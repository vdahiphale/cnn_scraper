We begin with relentless severe storms that continue to threaten millions across the U.S. this Memorial Day weekend. Especially hard-hit overnight, Texas and Oklahoma. Well, this is what's left of a gas station in Valley View, Texas north of Dallas. And it's just one of several reports of major damage in the area.Officials in Denton County, Texas say they are responding to reports of multiple victims and people trapped. It's unclear how many people are injured. There are also reports of overturned 18 wheelers damaged homes and downed power lines. Meanwhile, rescue and damage assessments are underway in Cook County just north of Denton after a possible tornado Saturday night. And in Oklahoma, police say the town of Claremore is shut down and to avoid the area. Well, there to reports of extensive damage to homes as well as downed trees and power lines. The State Emergency Operations Center has been activated. Right now around 240,000 homes and businesses are without power across multiple states in the region. And the threat is far from over. For more, I'm joined by CNN Meteorologist Allison Chinchar who has the latest. Allison?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, that's right. So we take a look at the video behind me. This was from one of the storms from late last night. This is from Windthorst, Texas that is in northern, Texas for some perspective there. But again, you can see the tornado there off in the distance. And this was one of more than a dozen tornado reports that came in yesterday over a hundred damaging wind reports and 70 hail reports, some of them as large as the size of baseballs.You can again see most of it is clustered right through here in the central portion of the U.S Especially the tornado reports, but we also had some areas of the southeastern U.S. and also portions of West Virginia and even Pennsylvania looking at some severe thunderstorms. We still have active severe thunderstorms ongoing as we speak. You've got a severe thunderstorm watch across portions of Texas and some tornado watches in effect a little bit farther to the north states like Missouri, portions of Kentucky, Illinois and even Arkansas. And it's all from this cluster of showers and thunderstorms right through here. We have active tornado warnings. We've had enough tornado emergency off and on for the last 20 or 30 minutes, for some of these storms and several severe thunderstorms as well. So the threat is not over this is expected to continue not only this morning, but even as we go through the afternoon and evening hours. Very similar to yesterday, but we're just starting to see a lot of that severe potential begin to shift a little bit eastward. So you're still looking at the same threats we saw yesterday, which includes a few tornadoes, golf ball size hail and wind gusts up around that 70 mile per hour range. The main focus is also going to include a bit more populated cities. You're talking Chicago, Cleveland, down through Atlanta, that includes Nashville, Memphis, even up around St. Louis. So a lot of cities here that could have the potential to have some outdoor activities may be postponed or even canceled today for the holiday weekend. Here's a look at the forecast, through the morning, the focus again is still going to be the same places that we're seeing it now. By the afternoon, we start to see more of that spread into St. Louis, Chicago and then down into portions of western Kentucky. That first line continues to make its way over towards the northeast by late this evening. But then you start to see this. This is the second wave that begins to develop later on this evening. That is the line that's going to slide across portions of Kentucky, Tennessee and eventually down into states like Georgia and even the Carolinas once we get to the overnight and the morning hours. So tomorrow morning, stay -- cities like Knoxville, Atlanta, and even Charlotte likely to have at least a little bit of a soggy commute. Some folks are off tomorrow for the holiday. But for those that aren't, they will have to contend with perhaps some very wet roads in the morning. Still the potential exists even tomorrow. It's slightly weaker, but still having the potential there for some damaging winds, some hail, and maybe some isolated tornadoes. That includes Washington D.C., Pittsburgh down through Raleigh, Charlotte, North Carolina, down through Columbia, Atlanta, Montgomery, and then back into portions of Mobile and even Baton Rouge. So this is going to be a multi-day event, Anna, where we're going to have to keep a close eye on this.",

Shortly afterwards, another woman and a man were attacked in a McDonald's in Plymouth. [05:05:11] None of the injuries were life-threatening. The early investigation suggests there is a likely connection between these incidents. U.S. President Joe Biden took aim at Donald Trump as he addressed the graduating class at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point on Saturday.

For example, the preservation of democracy, as well as U.S. leadership on the world stage. Now, the President talked about the multiple global challenges that the United States faces around the world, including, for example, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, saying that the U.S. remains steadfast in its support of Ukraine. And also talking about the strength of the NATO alliance, saying, quote, \"That it is the greatest defense alliance in the history of the world.\" And that is one of the messages that the President was trying to drive home in this address, that being the importance of those alliances for the United States. JOE BIDEN, (D) U.S. PRESIDENT: Our women and men in uniform are hard at work, strengthening our alliances, because no country has allies like ours, investing in deterrence. So, anyone who thinks they can threaten us thinks again. Defending our values, by standing up to tyrants, and safeguarding the peace by protecting freedom and openness. Thanks to the U.S. Armed Forces for doing only America can do, as the indispensable nation, the world's only superpower, and the leading democracy in the world.

Interestingly, though, these tend to be voters who in a typical election would vote Democrat and now are more likely to defect to Trump. But I think the real question is how Kennedy positions himself down the stretch. If he's going to focus on COVID vaccines and government conspiracies, et cetera, it's going to Trump by eating into his populist base, but if he focuses more on Democratic issues, climate change, minimum wage, labor rights, et cetera, I think it'll take support away from Biden. The other question is how hard Trump and Biden or their super PACs and surrogates actually start to attack Kennedy on the campaign trail and with advertisements.

And then you have the scenario where Russia has succeeded in Ukraine through a combination of threat and aggression. And Putin will be emboldened to essentially do the same thing against NATO. So you end up in that same place that Biden is so fearful of in terms of a wider war or even a nuclear war. The best way to deal with that threat is to give Ukraine the means to strike back hard using Western supplied weapons, and at the same time, increase the strength of deterrence messages going to Moscow to make sure they don't use nuclear weapons.",

And I think that Putin is quite happy to be patient and play for a protracted war.Ultimately, what he wants to do is wear down the Ukrainians. And he knows that he doesn't have a lot of time because ultimately weapons will start turning up from the U.S. and from Europe and will start to have an effect.

CNN has reached out to representatives for Minaj for comment.Well, Mexico has extradited a top cartel member to the United States in what U.S. President Joe Biden calls a good day for justice. El Nini, as he was known, was one of the most wanted people sought by the U.S. He faces charges of drug trafficking, possession of machine guns and witness retaliation. Salas was arrested in Mexico in November. He's now in U.S. custody. President Biden praised the move, saying El Nini played a prominent role in the notorious Sinaloa Cartel. The United States has charged him for his role in illicit fentanyl trafficking and for murdering, torturing and kidnapping numerous rivals, witnesses and others. Well, after the break, AI manipulated videos of flooding Chinese social media websites to peddle political propaganda and sell product. That and more when we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",
