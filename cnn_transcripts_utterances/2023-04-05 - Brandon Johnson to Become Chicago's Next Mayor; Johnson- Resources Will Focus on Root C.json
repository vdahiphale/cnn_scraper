In Wisconsin, the Democratic-backed judge won and won decisively, delivering Liberals their first majority on the state supreme court in 15 years. Abortion loomed large in that race, and as you can see, the outcome was not close.Now, the court could soon overturn the state's abortion ban. And in Chicago, Progressive Brandon Johnson is now the Mayor Elect, that after a narrow win over a more moderate opponent. There, violent crime and how to deal with it became the defining issue. Johnson promised to add, yes, 200 more detectives to the police force, but he said it was even more important to make investments in housing and youth jobs program. Let's start in Chicago with Mariah Woelfel of WBEZ. Mariah, grateful for your time on this morning after your city has a new mayor-elect, I want you to listen to him this Morning on CNN. He says, yes, we need more cops. I'll add 200 more detectives, but he made the case that it is much more important, hire more kids, get them off the streets, give them jobs, improve housing in neighborhoods that need help and more. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRANDON JOHNSON (D), CHICAGO MAYOR-ELECT: When you spin more per capita on policing here in Chicago than you do anywhere else in the world, and we're still not as safe, you know, people start to call that into question. And so this is about the allocation of our resources in a strategic smart way. That's what people voted for. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He was out-fundraised 2-to-1 by his opponent in Paul Vallas, who had much more name recognition than Johnson did. But Johnson had the backing of government unions who knocked on doors. They came with many, many foot soldiers and funding. And then it was an ideological battle between, as you said, a progressive way towards reducing crime and a more traditional approach in hiring police officers, which the opponent Paul Vallas talked a lot about.And Johnson said these results are proof that Chicago-ians, you know, want to reject a more traditional approach to reducing crime. Chicago of -- and of 298 big cities that report policing data to the FBI has the most police per capita of any other large city except for Washington, D.C. So Johnson's argument was it hasn't been working for decades. It's not going to work in the next four years if you elect Paul Vallas. I'm going to continue to make these incremental changes towards addressing the root causes of crime. Well, you know, as you said, trying to hire a couple, you know, 200 more detectives to try to solve crime, which Chicago struggles with as well.",

Let's bring the conversation back in the room with our great reporters. Wisconsin in a moment very quickly here.  You do have almost a split decision, if you will. Is it a split decision where, you know, Mayor Adams wins in New York saying more police, more of a traditional tough-on-crime approach? Karen Bass beats a Republican turned Democrat who ran essentially on the Adams platform, she says it's more nuanced. Johnson wins, says it's more nuanced.",

And they put a lot of money in for her and Republicans who I talked to in Wisconsin say, he didn't really even stand a chance because of the onslaught of money and largely focused on the issue of abortion, which clearly resonated in a very big way, because it is very impactful, because there's a law in the books that you put up that could be overturned.",

And I'm just fascinated by how sustaining of an issue abortion is going to be.

You have -- we're still waiting on that ruling in Texas and obviously, a very, very important issue for the White House, for abortion rights groups, for women across the country.
