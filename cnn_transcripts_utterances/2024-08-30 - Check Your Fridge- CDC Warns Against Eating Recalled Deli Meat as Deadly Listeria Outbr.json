The Ministry of Environment calling it a sustainability intervention. These animals will die anyway because of the effects of the drought there, the worst in 100 years. The government of Namibia was forced to declare a state of emergency in May as more than half of the population could face acute food insecurity. That is why the Ministry of Environment is contributing these animals as part of the drought relief program by the government. 723 wildlife from 83 elephants, 60 buffalos, 30 hippos, 300 zebras, 100 blue wildebeest, 50 impalas, and 100 elands have been earmarked for this. More than 150 animals have already been killed, providing more than 125,000 pounds of game meat to those that need it, especially in rural parts of Namibia. The drought here has been caused by the El Nino weather phenomenon, which has led to limited rainfall, but also the bigger picture here is because of the effects of climate change. The climate crisis is hitting Southern Africa especially hard right now. So that is the backdrop for this controversial move that the Namibian government says will also have reduced human wildlife conflict because of the drought. Limited water, limited grazing lands has led to some deadly human wildlife conflict and they`re hoping this helps alleviate some of that as well. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Happening on September 22nd this year, the autumnal equinox marks the first day of fall for those living above the equator. All right, you can have your pumpkin spice latte, you can have your football and all the other fun fall festivities, but we might have to hold off on welcoming the actual fall weather. The Climate Prediction Center just issued its forecast for the fall and it`s looking unusually warm across the U.S. This summer is expected to be the hottest on record for nearly 100 cities in the U.S., including Las Vegas, Phoenix and Washington, D.C. And while fall technically starts on September 22nd, the heat isn`t likely going anywhere. There may be small pockets of cool here and there, but especially in the southern Rockies, the South and on the East Coast, higher than average temperatures will persist through November. Question for you. How many stars do you think you can see when you look up at the nighttime sky? Now, a lot of that would depend on where you live. There tends to be a pretty big difference between urban areas and more rural areas that don`t have the same levels of man-made light pollution. Well, one city in Arizona, Flagstaff, is looking to change all of that and become a destination for astro-tourism, the practice of traveling to view objects and events that happen in space. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGIST (voice-over):  For thousands of years, humans have gazed upon the Milky Way with awe and wonder. But for nearly 80% of Americans, the timeless beauty of the night sky is hidden because of human-made light pollution. DR. DANIELLE ADAMS, CULTURAL ASTRONOMER FLAGSTAFF DARK SKIES COALITION:  This bright star here is Vega. DAM (on camera):  Wow.",
