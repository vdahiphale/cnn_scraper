I'm Jim Acosta in Washington. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. And my first guest this morning is Democratic Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, where Vice President Kamala Harris is set to campaign in just hours from now. Senator, good to have you on. We really appreciate it. Let's jump right in and talk about the polls that have been released showing the vice president tied are up just slightly over former President Trump. That reflects what's happening in Pennsylvania, where it's a tight race. What are you seeing on the ground there? And what do Democrats need to do to connect with those remaining undecideds? SEN. JOHN FETTERMAN (D-PA):  Well, I haven't seen one single thing in the polls that surprised me at all. I've been maintaining the same conversation since 2016. I said, it's going to be very close in Pennsylvania. And it's undeniable, Trump does have a very strong connection for voters here in Pennsylvania, but it's also undeniable that Harris has really energized the Democratic base as well in there too. And I'm so grateful and I'm excited that she's showing up in Erie later and we're going to be together in Erie. And back in 2020, Trump literally, literally said that and he's like, I don't want to go to Erie. I really, truly didn't want to go there. We definitely want to go there because Erie picks Pennsylvania and Pennsylvania will pick the president.",

I'm like, and Trump actually won Erie in 2016, and he won. And, of course, Joe Biden won that in 2020, and I'd also believe Harris will win Erie, win Pennsylvania, and be the next president.

I think the bigger problem is the enemy from within. Not even the people that have come in and destroying our country, by the way, totally destroying our country. The towns, the villages, they're being inundated. But I don't think they're the problem in terms of Election Day, I think the bigger problem are the People from within. We have some very bad people.

And we, as Democrats, we have to jam up those kinds of margin in roughly about 57 of those counties across Pennsylvania that aren't going to be blue on the map, but we can't allow like 80-20, 80-20, because for one county goes 80- 20, it's likely that there's 57 others that might have those similar kinds of margin.

It was good to have him here showing support for Florida and specifically the Tampa Bay area, very happy with the federal response. The city of Tampa is really risen to the challenge with the damage that we've incurred.We've had significant flooding with Helene. We had the coastal surge flooding, which was devastating, to large areas in our city because, of course, we are blessed with being surrounded by the Tampa Bay on many parts of our coast and it was an equal opportunity storm surge. It impacted wealthy areas and it impacted working folks' areas as well. It did not discriminate. And then when Milton came in, we had the fresh water flooding. I mean, I don't think any community could withstand rainfall of anywhere from 10 to 19 inches, depending on the community you're in.

We've been placing our sewage lines, reinforcing seawalls.But federal government has been a great partner not just with this storm but in the past as well. I was much appreciative of the president signing the major disaster declaration that included Hillsborough County, which is where Tampa, to get this infrastructure money going.  These two storm are going to cost us probably over a billion dollars, but also because right now, we're $700 million, three quarters of a billion. And I'm sure it's going to go way past that. But you're right, we have issues with our electrical grid. We have issues with the flooding and the infrastructure throughout with our pumps. And we've had issues, significant issues with supply of our gasoline. That was more of a state failure and not necessarily a federal because the staging that would've been promised clearly didn't happen because we had lines in excess. I waited in one of those lines of three hours to get fuel. We had first responders that couldn't get to hospitals and couldn't get to where they're going because they did not have access to fuel.

But now that false information surrounding FEMA has taken a disturbing turn. If you haven't heard about this, listen up. Eight operations in Rutherford County, North Carolina, were suspended on Saturday after National Guard troops saw armed militia members threatening FEMA workers. In an urgent email to federal agencies obtained by The Washington Post, these militia members, the troops, quote, had come across two trucks of armed militia saying they were out hunting FEMA. As a result, FEMA tells CNN they've made safety adjustments in counties where federal workers are receiving threats. While about 100 miles north of Ashe County, the sheriff there posted on Facebook on Sunday that some aid operations were paused out of abundance of caution due to threats occurring in some counties. And while aid has resumed in these areas, these sorts of incidents spurred by misinformation continue to hurt communities already in need. In the face of that disinformation communities ravaged by Helene are still trying to heal. Communities across Western North Carolina schools in particular remain closed largely with a timeline for reopening uncertain. In Buncombe County, home to Asheville, some 20,000 students have been impacted. Officials there are struggling to obtain necessities, like water, after the storm knocked out power, a part of the county's water system.
