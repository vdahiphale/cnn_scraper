It looks like the police are moving that encampment completely out.Let us get to Camila Bernal, who is there on the scene right now. We are seeing it is now light there. We've been watching this since 1:45 in the morning when police started pushing in.

At the very end, when you had a smaller group of protesters, what you were seeing was a lot more defiance, people pushing and shoving as they were getting arrested. Definitely a little bit more violence towards that last group of protesters. They were still trying to link arms. They were still shouting and saying things like, dissolve and divest, and screaming as they were being taken away by these police officers. In the distance you can see the buses where all of these members of the encampment, or protesters, were being taken after they were arrested or detained by these police officers. But you're seeing the amount of trash and the amount of tents and just a lot of the things that these protesters had for a week to be here inside of this encampment. It is just a mess. And you're seeing some of those officers taking down those tents at the moment as they were getting arrested. Every single one of those protesters was getting their helmets off, face coverings, masks, they were being taken off by these law enforcement officers and then taken to the buses nearby. Now, I want to show you the scene in front of me because the focus has now shifted to this area. There are protesters that were outside of the encampment that are still here waving these Palestinian flags, still shouting. And we did here these CHP officers saying that they were going to shift focus. So now you're seeing more of these officers standing right outside of the encampment, or the area that was the encampment, and are now facing these protesters. They have not moved in. And again, this sort of shifted just moments ago. But this is the scene right now. Protesters who were not part of the encampment, who are still wearing a lot of these helmets and face coverings, and then the line of CHP officers in riot gear. I also want to say, I saw some of these CHP officers covered in that white powder. We - we were speaking earlier and said that they likely had these fires distinguishers going off. That was part of the protesters. And we saw some of those fire extinguishers on the ground in the middle of all this trash. So, it's likely that that was used by the protesters. I saw some of the protesters at some point throwing water bottles and water at the officers. That was the moment when we saw what we believe were rubber bullets and police firing those off. Those were used during the most tense moments of the morning. But at the moment, things are a lot calmer despite the fact that you are still seeing a lot of protesters and the line of police officers here, Sara.",

It's incomprehensible to me that university, and particularly UCLA police, campus police, would ever have allowed this crowd to build that sort of a fortification. You know, respecting students' rights to protest and to exercise their First Amendment rights is absolutely essential, but that doesn't include bringing truckloads of lumber and shipping pallets and essentially building a maybe impregnable fortress on campus grounds.So, there has to be a level of engagement from the very beginning, making a clear kind of delineation between what sort of conduct is permissible and what sort of conduct is not. And then imposing consequences when the protesters go beyond - beyond that boundary. So that - if - if I was talking to university presidents today, that's the first thing I'd be advising them on.",

So, I think that's more relief. They were relieved he's saying they're not going to raise interest rates.
