But let me tell you, Max, people remember the devastation left by a Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, also what happened with Hurricane Ivan, and they fear the same thing may happen again. And we heard previously from the prime minister, Prime Minister Andrew Holness, and he is saying that the population in this country, population in Jamaica needs to take this hurricane very, very seriously.People here have also seen what happened in other islands here in the Caribbean and Barbados, in Grenada, and they are expecting that in the next few hours, things are going to change drastically. Right now, it is the calm before the storm, but this -- what you see behind me is going to change very, very fast. We have felt just winds started to pick up a little bit. We had rain about an hour ago, and you start to see the low-lying clouds that are very typical at the beginning of a hurricane. Earlier, we heard about -- from the prime minister, who says that people need to take precautions because in the next couple of days, this is expected to get much, much worse than what it is right now.

Now, part of President Biden's work today is trying to reassure some top party leaders, but also potentially hear out some of their concerns. As you noted, President Biden this evening will hold a meeting, some virtually attending, some in-person, with Democratic governors at a time when privately some Democratic governors have expressed concerns about the path forward for Biden in this re-election bid.The president is also expected to spend the day working the phones to Congressional leaders. We've learned that yesterday, he did speak with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, which was his first phone call with him since that debate. But at the same time, there is at least one Democratic lawmaker who is publicly calling for Biden to step aside in this race. That is Congressman Lloyd Doggett of Texas, and CNN has privately spoken with Democrats who are urging behind the scenes for the president to do the same, saying that he should do so out of -- for the good of the party and the country. Now, last night, President Biden really tried to reassure donors about his standing in the race. He spoke at a fundraiser in Virginia and tried to offer some explanation for his performance on that debate stage. He chalked it up to the grueling international travel that he had conducted earlier in the month when he had traveled to both Italy and France, and then noted that he almost fell asleep on the stage. That drew some laughter from the crowd, but it is unclear if that explanation would really ease any Democratic concerns about the debate and the state of the president's candidacy going forward. It is worth noting, now while President Biden did travel to Italy and France in the early part of June, he was back in the United States for roughly 11 days following those trips, including spending almost an entire week at Camp David preparing for that debate. Now, President Biden is also facing some calls from within his own party to become -- be more transparent when it relates to his health and mental acuity as well. The White House yesterday said that they don't think that the president's doctors are telling him he doesn't need to take a cognitive test and they say that they have been transparent relating to the president's health. But certainly, there are many questions going forward about Biden's position in this race. Yesterday, Vice President Kamala Harris tried to bat down some of the suggestions that she could potentially replace Biden on the Democratic -- at the top of the Democratic ticket. Take a listen to what she had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, (D) VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Joe Biden is our nominee.

It is not normal for a sitting prime minister to have one of his old internal Conservative rivals take up the stump and try to use some of their charm and charisma. Talking about Boris Johnson here, of course, the two of them have been pretty estranged politically for the past few years.

I actually remember that night going to the big Labour Party gathering and it was absolute euphoria. So although what we are hearing today from Keir Starmer, the Labour Leader, is very careful. It is a very controlled message. He is traveling to West Midlands in the U.K. He is going to Wales. He is going to Scotland. So he is getting all over the map.So, controlled message saying a few hundred votes in some constituencies could be all that is needed to give us that seat. He is not taking any votes for granted, whereas the Conservative Party are trying to put out the same message from a very defensive platform, saying Labour is going to bring you greater taxes. They are going to undermine the defense capabilities of the country, a lot of sort of scare tactics. But again, saying there is 130,000 votes in play there, both parties still urging anyone undecided to go out there for them, but I think that control of emotions that we are seeing from Labour at the moment will burst into euphoria overnight.",

They have had passes of major hurricanes in the last couple of years, but because the island is small, it is hard to get that direct hit when that eye comes on land.The last and only time that happened was Gilbert in 1988, that was the last major hurricane. So, it has been more than 40 years since they've had anything like this. You could see where that eye again gets very close, if it makes landfall, it would be on this southern half of the island. We are looking at storm surge up to nine feet, that's two to three meters, heavy rain as well, hurricane-force wind starting up as we go through midday, all in Jamaica. And the Cayman Islands are next going into tomorrow. And then as we head towards the end of the week, Mexico could see some of these impacts. Now, when we are talking about rain, this is a mountainous island. So you have all this tropical moisture kind of heating, right, as the land kind of comes up. When you force moisture up a mountain, that enhances the rainfall totals. So we could be looking at up to a foot of rain, that's 300 millimeters, and that could cause flash flooding and mudslides in Jamaica.

It is that wind energy upstairs in the atmosphere that could often kill hurricanes, hurricanes hate it. So we could find this intensity starting to waver as we go through the next day or so, we'll have to watch that closely. But ocean temperatures are record warm, so that could fuel it too. Max?",

Clearly, you can see a picture of Xi Jinping upon his arrival in Kazakhstan. It is an image that many people in Beijing saw when they woke up this morning. We also have video in addition where he was met by children and by music. These two nations enjoy a strong relationship.This is all happening as part of a broader medium, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a club of sorts spearheaded by China and Russia as the leaders try to establish themselves as an alternative to the West. The SCO has roots as a security bloc among many Eurasian nations to combat terrorism and promote border security but it is also emerging as a geopolitical force that comes into play as Belarus is expected to be admitted. Belarus, which helped Russia to launch its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, will become the latest authoritarian state to join the club after Iran became a full member last year. We will not see Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He is not attending, apparently uneasy about the direction of the SCO. As we've reported, it is pointing to some unease among members about the direction of where the SCO is headed. Nonetheless, the idea of an alternative worldview is something that's been at the forefront of this relationship between President Xi and Putin. It is among themes that we saw during their meeting here in China last May. Marc Stewart, CNN, Beijing.",

CNN has spoken to dozens of current and former Democratic officials who say Mr. Biden needs to pull out of the presidential race in the wake of his poor performance in last week's debate. And for the first time, an elected Democratic member of Congress is publicly calling for President Biden to step aside.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. LLOYD DOGGETT, (D-TX): I salute President Biden. I just feel that it is time for him to step aside if we were to be able to protect what he allowed us to gain in 2020, which was a victory for Democracy. But he could -- he delivered us from Trump then, he could be delivering us to Trump this year if we have more of what happened last Thursday. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You heard the Congressmen right there saying that yes, Joe Biden delivered us from Trump, but he worries that he could send the country back into a second Trump presidency. That really boils down the conversation we are hearing from so many Democratic members of Congress, officials privately.But this Congressman Lloyd Doggett, who served in the U.S. Congress for nearly 30 years, he has no time for speaking privately or quietly. He spoke respectfully, but said that it is time for President Biden to go. The question here, does President Biden see it the same way? I'm told that he takes this very seriously. He does not believe that this is just one of those moments where Democrats are bed-wetting as they say here, being unnecessarily worried. The question is, is he a drag on the Democratic ticket overall? And President Biden still has a decision to make. He is having those Democratic governors into the White House today and largely, most Democrats are trying to give him space. They're trying to build him up and say, you know, the agenda that you started will not continue sort of if you stay on. So patience is wearing a bit thin, but it is remarkable how respectful and patient they have been. I suspect if there's not some movement, that patience so wears out fairly shortly, Max.",
