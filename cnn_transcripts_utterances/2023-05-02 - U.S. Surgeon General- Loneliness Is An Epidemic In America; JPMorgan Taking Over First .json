That was the U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy releasing that advisory that he mentioned, addressing what he is calling an epidemic of loneliness and isolation that is hitting this entire country.His advisory lays out six pillars to address this problem. Strengthen social infrastructure. Establish pro-connection public policies. Address social connection through public health systems. Reform digital environments and deepen knowledge to address gaps in the data. And build a culture of connection. This is after he wrote a really powerful and personal op-ed a few days ago in The New York Times. So let's discuss this now with New York Times bestselling author and host of \"The Mel Robbins Podcast,\" and a dear friend who we are so proud of all you have built and done, Mel, since you were our buddy here at CNN, Mel Robbins. Thank you, thank you, thank you for being here. MEL ROBBINS, NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING AUTHOR, \"THE 5 SECOND RULE,\" HOST, \"THE MEL ROBBINS PODCAST\" (via Skype):  Oh, well thank you for asking me to come on and not only be with you but also talk about a really important topic that on its face it feels like a snooze fest or that it's going to be a really heavy topic. But this is something that despite the hour, Poppy, I want everyone to wake up, lean in, and pay attention to what we're about to say.",

As much as we talk about the fact that hybrid work is fantastic and it allows you to be able to be more connected with your family if you're living with your family -- but I think for a lot of us what it highlighted is just that I really need this sense of connection. And there's a second problem that happened during COVID, too, which iswe -- by being in lockdown, our nervous system flipped into a fight or flight mode and we actually for a while there were scared of other people. How many of you feel as though you've become more introverted? How much harder is it for you to push yourself out of your house? Your default has become to kind of be more shut in instead of being more connected to other people.",

Like, this is not me but maybe this is me now. And I had this conversation with three people who were feeling the same way.Is it -- is the solution of loneliness just surrounding us -- ourselves with more people or the kind -- no, right. It's about who we surround ourselves with. You're shaking your head.",

You don't belong.It's about the quality of the connection. You can feel lonely in your marriage. You can feel lonely at work. And so I think the really important thing is to think about number one, what are you actually doing to create connection with people? And one thing that everybody can do today is make it a habit to text somebody every single day. Just reach out. I was just thinking about you. I miss you. I'd love to see you. That is enough to get the ball rolling. The second thing that you can do is figure out what's something that you did before the pandemic that created meaning for you, whether it was volunteering or a hobby, and simply volunteering or taking a class. Up here, there's a ton of people that moved, Poppy, during the pandemic. I happen to be one of them. I realize I don't know anybody here. We started a walking group using a local Facebook page. And so this is something that I want everybody to take seriously. I think most of us are struggling with a sense of loneliness. We don't see our friends as much. We're not at work with everybody. And it's something I want you to start to change. You've got to take personal responsibility. The government can make recommendations but ultimately, this is something that you need to do. And this also means check in on your family members. Just because somebody's busy or surrounded by people, as you just said, Poppy, doesn't mean they actually feel connected to anybody.",

Senator Elizabeth Warren is not happy about that. She tweeted, \"The failure of First Republic Bank shows how deregulation has made the too-big-to-fail problem even worse. A poorly supervised bank was snapped up by an even bigger bank. Ultimately, taxpayers will be on the hook. Congress needs to make major reforms to fix a broken banking system. But listen to this.

I think half as many FDIC-guaranteed institutions today as a decade ago. And the big -- the big remaining ones are a lot bigger. And so that's spun up a little bit of controversy from progressives, in particular, but also maybe some discomfort maybe in the White House.

The Biden administration, which  claims to hate big banks,\" according to the Journal editorial board, \"signed off Monday on a deal to let Mr. Dimon's giant JPMorgan Chase get bigger and even more profitable.\" So, in a way, a big profitable bank was able to help stem the bleeding in the American financial system because it is so big but then gets bigger in the process.",
