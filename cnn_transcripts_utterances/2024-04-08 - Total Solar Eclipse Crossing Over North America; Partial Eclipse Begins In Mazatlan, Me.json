The last time Cleveland had a total of Eclipse 1806. The next time, 2444. So you got to wait 420 years. 3:13 p.m., that's where the sun will be just up in that beautiful blue sky. I see a few clouds coming, but we're hoping that they will stay away. We spoke to a NASA astrophysicist. This is also home to the Glenn Research Center, the only NASA facility that's on the path of totality. We spoke to a NASA astrophysicist who will tell us what we'll see when we see the total eclipse. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. JOSHUA PEPPER, NASA ASTROPHYSICIST: So when the moon fully goes in front of the sun and you can take off your eclipse glasses, you're going to see the edges of the outer layers of the sun called the corona. So these are streams of incredibly hot gas streaming outwards from the sun, and they're pushing those particles away from the sun, turning into the solar wind, which streams throughout the solar system.

They expect 30,000 people here alone. They have several events all around the city, the rock and roll hall of fame next door. They're going to DJ the eclipse with speakers all over town.

It's perfect, more or less the size that it needs to represent.But here's the deal. Now, the moon and the earth in space always cast a shadow, right? You could see it there on the ground. They're always casting that shadow. But we don't get the total solar eclipse that often because of the 5 degree tilt in the orbit of the moon around the earth, right? So it may be too high, casting the shadow above the earth, or it may be too low casting the shadow below the earth, but it's just when those perfect alignment occurs. And the moon goes right in front of the sun, blocking its rays completely. And we get, well, let's see, the total solar eclipse. And this time it's going to race across North America at 1,500 miles per hour, and it's going to bring this -- that great celestial dance. Now that is why it's so rare, but if we had that perfect orbit with the moon around the earth, eclipses would occur on a regular basis every couple of weeks or so. And we'd eat a cheeseburger and call it a regular Monday and move on with our lives. But because we get that alignment now, it is only every 375 years that this particular location will receive a solar eclipse. All right, guys, I appreciate your time. Take this and throw it at my cameraman right there. All right, you guys are perfect. Thanks for showing the world how solar eclipses work. Brianna, back to you.",

Like when you talk about, you know, what ancient people believed, they thought various, you know, different groups of people thought that it was a frog taking a bite out of the sun or a squirrel or a bear, right, dragons in China. I mean, that's kind of what you think of when you see a partial eclipse.But then the difference between a partial and a total is truly night and day as we've been saying. It is -- it sounds cheesy, but it is literally the difference between night and day. And so after you go through this phase of the partial solar eclipse, then we're going to get to these two moments right before totality that everybody watches out for him. Before we get closer to totality, you're going to see the sky start to turn almost an eerie gray, right? Like it takes about 15 to 20 minutes before totality. The sky turns an eerie sort of gray color and then about a minute before the moon totally covers the sun. What you're going to see is these two phenomena is hopefully that everybody knows about when you talk about total solar eclipses. Those Baily's beads and then the diamond ring, right? And it literally looks like, you know, there's a small band of light around the moon. And then one big bright stop the -- bright spot the diamond ring on top. So, this whole process only getting underway. But, guys, we are so lucky that we are here in the path of totality. We're going to get to be in total darkness for a glorious what?

Now, if you get over this Sierra Madre here, all of a sudden, we start to begin to see some clouds across parts of Texas and places that we don't. But there you see the first bite of the sun.Now you will not see that all the way up and down this stripe here behind me. But really not because Mazatlan is so far out there to the West. The eclipse starts in the West and moves on off toward the east. So where are the clouds now? Well, they are over Texas and they are getting thicker. But we talked about this yesterday, Boris, that when the clouds come in and then all of a sudden it gets colder because the sun goes away, those clouds can actually erode. They can go away because they don't have the lift anymore. Really good conditions here across the Ohio Valley. And then our Harry Enten is in Buffalo, I'm sorry, but I couldn't put you in a worse place because the clouds are just right over the Niagara frontier right now. And then our Derek Van Dam is up into Vermont. That looks really good at this point in time. But not everyone is going to experience the same eclipse. Because let's say San Antonio downtown, you're going to get 18 seconds of eclipse. You go just 10 miles to the west and that experience goes to about 2 minutes. It's the way you take a round disc and you push it over another round disc. If you're just getting the very edge, you're not going to get the full effect of the total eclipse. You're still going to get totality, but you're not going to get it for hours or minutes or whatever it might be is up to four minutes. I think Kerrville is going to see here. So it's the edge that we have to worry about. Don't be looking at it because if you're on the edge and you see diamond ring, you could be totality for 30 seconds and then diamond ring back and catch yourself with you really staring at the sun. But there's Dallas looking good for it worth as well. Two minutes for you. The clouds are here, but they can go away and I'm not even worried about like serious clouds. Those aren't going really the clouds that we're worried about. We're talking about the cumulus, the thick clouds that will build later on today with severe weather. But so far, through the middle part of the country, Indianapolis, Evansville. One of our producers is in Evansville right now that's why I kind of why I mentioned it because she picked a really good spot there. And then all of a sudden over parts of the Northeast, especially up into upstate New York, it gets cloudy again. And then Atlanta, Canada, you're doing really, really well with this. Guys? SANCHEZ: Yes, it's going to be majestic in some places. Others a little bit tougher for them to get a clear view of the eclipse.
