And yet he said, we are ready.And so I think that what the Kenyans as well as the Jamaicans and Bahamians and Benin, all the other countries that have volunteered to feel this force, what they bring is a level of expertise, especially in terms of technology, because what we've seen the last couple of days is the gangs have used drones in order to, you know, isolate their targets and to go after them. There was video that was shared online where we saw the gangs reporting the activities inside the courtyard of the national penitentiary, which was one of two prisons that was attacked.

CHARLESall trying to figure out. I mean, one, I thought it was very interesting that President Ruto Kenya did not mention a deployment date. What we know is that in order to get support from the parliament of Kenya on this deployment, he promised that they would not be incurring the cost. And so while the fact that this multinational security support mission, which has the support of the United States as well as the U.N., but it's not a U.N. peacekeeping mission, it has faced legal challenges in Kenya. He seems to believe that they've addressed these legal challenges with the support that he signed with the Haitian government. But there is an issue of funding. Republican lawmakers in the United States have blocked a request, initial $50 million that the Biden administration is asking as part of a $200 million pledge that they have made to finance this. So if the U.S. does not provide that funding, then once again, this force goes up in the air because the Kenyans have said, no money, we're not coming. And that leaves the question of what happens to Haiti. I mean, everybody is of the agreement to that time is of the essence right now. The gangs haven't just struck at the airport or the prisons, but they've also struck at the seaport. They're going after key government installations for the first time since we've been watching this crisis. We're noticing that the gangs are coordinated in their attacks. They're talking to one another rather than fighting one another. And that has put a price in fear. Because not only do you have thousands of prisoners who have escaped from the prisons, roaming the streets of the capital, but at the same time, now you have gangs who have specific targets in mind. And you have a police force that a year ago was barely 9,000. And we suspect that it is a lot less after the U.N. has said that it has been losing troops at an alarming rate.",

Near daily exchanges of fire, Israeli strikes pound parts of southern Lebanon villages, homes have been reduced to rubble, buildings burned to the ground. And tens of thousands of Israelis remain evacuated from the border out of reach of Hezbollah rockets. Escalating tensions over recent weeks between Israel and the Iran- backed Islamist group Hezbollah, one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in the Middle East, are sparking increasing fears of a wider regional conflict. U.S. administration and intelligence officials tell CNN they're concerned Israel may be planning a ground incursion into Lebanon in the late spring or early summer.

Hong Kong markets in the red this day, along with most Asian equities, currencies in retreat. As investors here question just how Beijing will manage to reach its target, China earlier today set this ambitious growth target of around 5 percent this year.And that was announced this morning as Premier Li Qiang delivered his very first work report. We also learned that defense spending will rise this year to about 7.2 percent from the year before. But China's top priority here is stability. And in order to get there, this is what we heard from China's Premier. Let's bring up the quote for you. He said, quote, \"we must push ahead with transforming the growth model, making substantial structural adjustments, improving quality and enhancing performance\", unquote. Now, transform is an important word to zero in on here. China's economic focus, it might be in the process of shifting from breakaway growth to quality and value. You know, China's economy has seen stunning growth in the last few decades, especially since reopening in the late 1970s. But that growth has really slowed down in recent years. And on top of that, there's a number of deep economic issues like the property crisis, like weak consumer spending, like high youth unemployment, like mounting government debt. The list goes on and on. The work report addressed these risks, not in too much detail, but there were a couple of key salient points I want to bring up for you. Let's bring up the bullet points here from the work report. China has this policy plan to prohibit vanity projects and wasteful local government spending, to tighten oversight on accounting at local government levels, to intensify efforts to attract foreign investment and to achieve greater self-reliance in science and technology, but not enough, apparently, to boost the markets, especially the markets in Hong Kong this day.

They were taken to hospital, where the woman told the doctor she had been raped. In a statement to CNN, the Brazilian embassy said they are working closely with the Spanish and Indian authorities on this case. CNN has reached out to the Spanish embassy for comment. According to government data, more than 31,500 rape cases were recorded in the year 2022, an average of 86 cases per day. Break that down further, and that's a rape almost every 17 minutes in the country. And experts warn that the number of cases recorded are just a small fraction of what may be the real number in a deeply patriarchal country. Despite amended rape laws and the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government saying it is committed to tackling sexual violence, India has struggled for years to tackle high rates of violence against women, with a number of high-profile rape cases involving foreign visitors drawing international attention to the issue.
