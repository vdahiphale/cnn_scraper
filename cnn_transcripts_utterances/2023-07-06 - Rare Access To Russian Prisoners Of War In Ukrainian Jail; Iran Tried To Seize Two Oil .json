The city's mayor says at least three people have been killed in a Russian missile strike on an apartment building. As dawn breaks over the city, rescue teams are working to find residents believe trapped beneath the rubble and debris from the badly damaged building. At least eight people are reported to have been injured in the missile strike. In eastern Ukraine, Moscow backed officials in occupied Donetsk say a Ukrainian missile strike set fire at an oil depot in the industrial city of Makiivka with 68 engine from Ukrainian shelling in the region on Tuesday, a sharp increase officials there say in recent days. And Ukraine military command says Russia continues to focus its firepower with dozens of combat engagements around the city of Lyman, Avdiivka and Marinka in the past day. Fighting also continues around Bakhmut, with Ukrainian forces feeling positive and optimistic they say about their progress after claiming to have retaken territory from Russian occupation. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Russia is preparing a possible attack on the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. He's accusing Russian forces or placing, \"Objects resembling explosives on roofs around the facility\". Ukrainian officials say they have procedures in place if anything happens. But the chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency has a word of caution, saying as of now there are no visible indications of mines or explosives at the facility. Mr. Zelenskyy tells CNN's Erin Burnett why he says certain in spite of the IAEA's claims. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Then came the ban on high school, university, ban on almost every other job out there in Afghanistan.Now, the Taliban have ordered the closure of or beauty salons. The Islamic draconian leaders seem to have just one policy as a government, a war on women. CNN's Katie Polglase has the latest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KATIE POLGLASE, CNN INVESTIGATIVE PRODUCER (voice over): Driving through the streets of Kabul among the brightly colored shops is one last symbol of women being visible in the public life. Squeezing them out of sight, Taliban authorities ordered beauty parlors to be shut within the month, sending shockwaves for women already gripped in a chokehold. A salon owner, who did not want to be identified for safety reasons, told CNN the Taliban's order means her poverty stricken family cannot afford the bare essentials. I don't understand why beauty salons should be banned, she says, my husband is jobless. And this beauty salon is the only means to feed my family. I have four kids, they need food and clothes. The Taliban seized back power in the summer of 2021 with thousands of terrified families flocking to Kabul airport, desperate to escape the group's barbaric rule. While the Taliban vowed reform, promising to be more progressive than their previous rule, women were quickly erased from public life, banning teenage girls from secondary and higher education and ordering non-profit organizations to stop their female employees from coming to work. The salon owner we spoke to says she doesn't know what more can be taken from them before there's nothing left at all. No women is showing off her face with makeup outside and were already wearing hijab in public, she says. This will further deprive women of their rights and freedoms. As the Taliban slowly chips away at their rights, hope is slowly dwindling for some women. But others still haven't been deterred from raising their voices, even if it means risking their lives.

We then have the El Nino weather pattern, which we know causes global temperatures generally to be high higher than average. But those are two natural factors. And the real unnatural factor here is the human caused climate change that decade over decade is driving our temperatures up. So, it's really that human caused climate change that is causing us to smash all of these temperature records. That said, we know that the last hottest year on record was an El Nino year.

We need to be preparing communities and individuals for increases in extreme heat like we're seeing, we need to prepare for greater wildfire risks, for amplified droughts, stronger hurricanes. And what we're seeing around the world is that we are already not able to cope with the climate that we have today. And so, we really need to ramp up so that we are prepared for what is coming down the pike. At the same time, we need countries around the world to be implementing their pledges to reduce heat trapping emissions from the burning of fossil fuels, countries have made those pledges for years, we know that most countries are falling short of those pledges. And we know that the pledges to begin with were insufficient to limit the extent of climate change in the future.

The king and queen wore Order of the Thistle robes, as did the Prince of Wales, who attended the ceremony with his wife. In Scotland, they're known as the duke and duchess of Rothesay. The robes mark a difference from when the ceremony was last performed for the late queen in 1953. She came under some criticism for wearing a less formal day dress. The moment so many were waiting for: this. The presentation of the honors of Scotland. Ancient symbols of monarchy that date back to when Scotland was an independent nation. In fact, these jewels are far older than the Crown Jewels used in the coronation. These ones were successfully hidden from Oliver Cromwell's armies during a turbulent and republican time in British history. More modern was the sword, newly crafted and named The Elizabeth in memory of the late queen. This ceremony wasn't just about a new king but a celebration of Scotland's union with England, albeit a union under pressure from nationalists.",
