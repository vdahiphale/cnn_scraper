A mass shooting in Baltimore killing at least two people with more than two dozen injured. It happened just after midnight in Baltimore's Brooklyn neighborhood. Crowds gathered for an annual celebration and instead the party turned deadly. People running for their lives as gunshots rang out. The Mayor of Baltimore telling CNN this morning that those responsible will be brought to justice. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR BRANDON SCOTT (D), BALTIMORE, MARYLAND: We're going to not rest until we find these individuals and hold them accountable, because we will not allow folks to just deteriorate people's communities, to attack people, to murder people and think that they're just going to continue to walk on our streets. But as I said earlier, it also highlights again the real need to deal with guns and illegal guns and access to them, not just in Baltimore City, but across this country. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's a holiday weekend. People are gathering. They're having a cookout. They're having a block party. And that's what the residents of this neighborhood were doing last night. It was supposed to be a family celebration that ended in tragedy. An 18-year-old woman is dead, a 20-year-old man was killed, and dozens more are in area hospitals. Now, I want to show you just a little bit of the scene here which is still quite active. We just had Mayor Scott a minute ago, he was still here canvassing the area. And you can see they've brought in this mobile command center. The Baltimore police has been on the scene all morning. ATF still here as well, still combing the ground, the grass looking for evidence. We have been told that this is still very much in the early stages of the investigation, but we heard from the mayor this morning talking about this community. Saying this community has had its issues in the past, but they've come a long way. And they're very proud of that. And that is actually the reason why they gathered and celebrate. And that was what he said was happening here last night. That is one of the reasons he is encouraging and pleading with people here to come forward and share any information they might have about the incident. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That's very, very horrific and likely the most violent, the largest and most deadly and violent mass shooting the city has seen certainly in recent years. So I was as horrified as everyone else.And then, of course, I heard the previous speaker, you know, I begin to ask myself, although I'm transitioning out, the acting commissioner is in the role, the very same questions about police presence and what was known, when it was known and how could police not have known.

So the most important thing that our detectives are looking for -- video, shell casings, physical evidence, it's for witness evidence and witnesses to come forward which I believe detectives are still doing that as we speak right now.

And with those relationships, we need to give confidence that the police department can actually find the people who did this, but it will take community support. It will take community help. Very well might take witness account of what happened, because if it happened to these folk, it can happen to anyone. And as you heard the mayor say, we don't want people coming to neighborhoods, tearing up neighborhoods. That's the last thing that any police department at any city wants, that any community wants.

I say this all the time. The decision to pull the trigger is not made when the trigger is pulled. The decision to pull the trigger is actually made when an individual puts their hand on a gun and walks out of their door, out of their home with that gun. They've already predisposed in their mind that, if they need it, they'll have it. And so we have to have consequences for the individuals who are carrying illegal guns and the willingness for them to use them. But we also have to stem the flow of guns into the city which are making it very easy for anybody and everybody to get them and then to ultimately use them.",

Because of that, you have a flash flood warning not only for the city of Chicago, but also for Peoria.

We already know that we have several roads closed, roads under water because of all of the rain. But it's not the only area dealing with rain showers. We also have some in the northeast, the mid-Atlantic as well as the southeast. And the biggest potential there is actually for strong to severe thunderstorms. We're talking damaging winds, large hail and even the potential for some isolated tornadoes. Nashville, Washington D.C., stretching down towards Atlanta and even Memphis all looking at the potential for those strong to severe thunderstorms. Those will continue through the afternoon and even into the evening as they continue to push off to the east. By tomorrow morning we're still looking at the potential for some strong to severe thunderstorms. Most of that will actually be along the East Coast, stretching back into the southeast as well. Another threat, as you mentioned, is yes, going to be the heat. Two separate areas we're talking about here, one in the southeast where we do have a heat advisory in effect. The secondary is out to the west where both the heat advisory and an excessive heat warning are in place. Out west, the main focus here is just the incredibly hot temperatures. You're talking 112 in Las Vegas today, up to 113 tomorrow, 115 today in Palm Springs, 115 as well tomorrow. But that heat is going to even spread farther north.

I think that the first reaction is going to be that everybody is going to probably try to take the court at its word.The court said that a university admissions office, private or public, may not use race as a basis for its decision. Nonetheless, the court said that universities could solicit essays from students about disadvantages or experiences they've had. And those essays could well make reference to race. Presumably what's applied in the court's opinion is that the university admissions office could then rely on those essays. So the door may not be completely shut for any reference to race whatsoever. After all, students are private actors whose conduct is not governed by the constitution. They may make reference to their own essays to their experiences as racial minorities among other things. But it remains to be seen whether or not there's going to be other litigation down the road that will challenge any reliance on essays that make reference to race. So we are not done with this big question the court tried to decide today. Initially the court made it clear race may not be formally used by admissions offices, but there's still a lot of litigation to come down the pike that will deal with whether or not race may enter into consideration in some other manner.",

Not the same numbers that we saw a little later into the night last night, but the security presence is still here, the concern about riots still there. Look at the number of fires, for example, good statistic to follow for the violence, 871 set last night, about 2,100 night before, 3,900 the night before. We said last night that last night was pivotal. I think this night is going to be important to see if that trend of violence goes down. But that's what we're looking at their. People are not taking any chances.",

He's due to be having a meeting right now with his interior minister, his prime minister, his justice minister, the prime minister and interior minister were out meeting the mayor that you were mentioning there before. His house was attacked with his wife and two young children were in the house, ages five and seven. One of them was injured, his wife's leg was badly broken.So, what we're hearing from government officials is that they're going to keep on the security pressure, they're going to act with firmness to prosecute anyone who perpetrate violence. They're going to act with firmness as well to continue to deal with the situation. And that means that big numbers of police will be here, it does appear as if the police, when they're out, and they can come out as we saw, and looking at that video a few minutes ago, they can come out in really big and strong numbers, have running cat-and-mouse chases right down the street when they get to start with the protesters, is having that big number of active police on the streets. That seems to be making a difference. But again, is it going to continue to trend down? The pivot last night was for the better. Does it continue in that direction? Boris?",

Thanks so much.Staying in Europe now, we want to pivot to Ukraine where military officials say that Russia launched an air attack on the capital overnight, using Iranian made drones. City officials say that Kyiv's air defenses destroyed all of them. But three homes were still damaged by falling debris during the strike. This is the first time in 12 days that the capital has been targeted. Let's take you now to eastern Ukraine with CNN senior international correspondent, Ben Wedeman, who is live for us.

But on the front, what we've seen is a continued struggle by Ukrainian forces to make incremental gains.Yesterday, President Zelenskyy said that Russia is losing the war during -- this during a press conference with Spanish prime minister. But stressed that every meter, every kilometer cost lives and cautioned that this counteroffensive is going to take time. Now, this part of eastern Ukraine, we have seen what looks like a lot of HIMARS being fired in the direction of Bakhmut and other areas that are fairly hot in the front lines. In fact, we heard just a few hours ago the deputy defense minister of Ukraine describing the entire front line in Ukraine, which stretches 600 miles, as hot. But it appears that at the moment the focus is in the eastern part of the country, around Bakhmut, north and south of it, where the Ukrainian forces are trying to encircle the city. So far, however, they have not made a breakthrough. And south of Zaporizhzhia, where their long term goal is to reach or at least get close to the Sea of Azov, which would essentially cut off Russian forces based in the west of there. They're hoping that would be a critical blow against the Russians. This counteroffensive, now into its third week has yet to produce the kind of dramatic results many, both here in Ukraine, and in the West were hoping for -- Boris.",

We, of course, see the work that they're doing in Europe, training Ukrainians on their own defense systems for their war against Russia. And these deployments are critically important work that they're doing.But they are taking a toll on the soldiers. Leaders say that they've seen an increase in the air defense soldiers going to behavioral health on post. So, meaning, seeking mental health support. They also have concerns about the unpredictable nature of these deployments and sort of the wear and tear that that has on army families. Leaders are aware of these challenges.

These soldiers are working with foreign nations in the region, you know, partnering with them on exercises. And given the sheer size of the region, that's a lot of time away from their families, away from home, and like I said, we see the work they do in Europe, working with Ukrainians. I spoke with one U.S. soldier who has led the U.S. Patriot training for the Ukrainians there who was emotional at times, recounting the work he does with his Ukrainian counterparts, knowing what's at stake for them as they go back to the front lines.
