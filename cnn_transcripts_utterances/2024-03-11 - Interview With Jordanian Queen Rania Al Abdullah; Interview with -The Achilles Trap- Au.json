Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. The Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins amid mounting tension in Jerusalem, across the Middle East, and amongst the Muslim population worldwide. The threat of an Israeli invasion into Rafah is sparking a riff now between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his closest ally, the U.S. president, Joe Biden. President Biden warns such an incursion would cross a red line. Prime Minister Netanyahu responds that his red line means preventing another October 7th. And he's again flatly rejected President Biden's call for a two-state solution. Israeli officials say an offensive into Rafah is not imminent, but neither has it been ruled out. More than a million internally displaced Palestinians are sheltering in Rafah. Food scarcity is bad there, but even worse in the north, which is why the U.S. and Europe are trying to ramp up sea convoys of aid while also resorting to air-dropping food and humanitarian assistance into Gaza. On Sunday, the U.S. and Jordan conducted another joint drop into Northern Gaza. Dangerous and desperate measures with no secure distribution and local crime families grabbing whatever they can. Jordan's Queen Rania has been outspoken in defense of Gaza civilians and urging the United States and other Israeli allies to use all their leverage to end what she calls Israel's deliberate effort to deprive those in need. And I spoke with her exclusively from the King Abdullah Air Base in Jordan just ahead of another airdrop. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

These airdrops are literally just drops in an ocean of unmet needs. And King Abdullah has said from the very beginning, they are neither sufficient nor they are substitute for, you know, humanitarian access at scale. So, countries should not use them as a way out, nor should they be viewed as an excuse for not doing what needs to be done. And that is implementing an immediate and sustained ceasefire, opening all access points into Gaza, particularly land routes, streamlining the inspection process and making sure that there is safe access within Gaza so that the aid can be distributed. Every moment counts. Children are starving as we speak. So, every moment and every meal counts. And so, I think now we're past the stage of trying to talk Israel into doing these things. We need to actually start using measures and political leverage to get them to do those things.",

We couldn't just sit idle and watch people starving. And so, King Abdullah started, you know, organizing these air drops. But I have to emphasize that the need is much greater than what we're being able to provide. As it stands today, there are trucks -- there's tons of food in trucks that are miles away from people who are starving. So, this is -- the hunger is not a natural disaster. This is a man-made -- an Israeli made disaster. It is a -- it is, you know, deprivation by design. No matter the volume of the aid going in, nothing is a substitute for a ceasefire. Delivering aid under bombardment does not stop the destruction, the death, and the heartbreak. We cannot save people from hunger only then to bomb them to death.

Then Netanyahu responds saying, my red line is no more Hamas, no more threats, and by the way, no state, no two- state solutions.

You know, Prime Minister Netanyahu, by his own admission, says that his policy was based on divide and conquer, covertly propping up Hamas in order to undermine the Palestinian Authority and then say there's no partner for peace. Last year, even before October 7th, we have set a record in terms of settler -- settlement expansion and construction. Just last week, the Israeli government approved plans to build 3,500 more illegal settlements on occupied West Bank land. And sure, some of its allies condemned those plans, but as in previous cases, there's condemnation, but then the plans are carried out. As long as Israel is allowed to get away with breaking international law, as long as its allies don't hold it accountable, it will just increase its sense of impunity. So, for years, Israel talks peace, but then condemns it to death by settlements, making a contiguous, independent Palestinian State less viable by the day. And for the longest time, we hear the International Community talking about a two-state solution while allowing Israel to create a one-state reality. And so, you know, I think the time for trying to persuade Israel to do the right thing has long passed. It is time for us -- we are not -- when you look at the horrendous reality that's in Gaza today, it is hard to believe that Israel is being unfairly singled out, that it's being held to a higher standard. Critics of Israel merely wanted to do the bare minimum, which is just abide by international law.",

And prior to October 7th, they have been living in 50 years of oppression, of occupation, of having their movement restricted, having every aspect of their lives dominated, being humiliated. If we want -- if I speak to the Israeli public, I would say, if you want your peace and your security, you have to address this big injustice that's on your doorstep. There is no shortcut. There is no security measure that is going to bring the more hopeful future and the stability that you want in your lives, other than finding a way to live with Palestinians. Israeli leaders must stop treating the existence of Palestinians as an inconvenient truth, as a demographic challenge, as the mode that leads to be a mode every now and then. Palestinians are here to stay. And so, we have to find a way to live with one another. And we need to be able to re- humanize, to be able to see the humanity of the other -- our humanity reflected in others' eyes. You know, an Israeli mother should understand that a Palestinian mother cares about her children just as much as she does. And there is just no way around that. I don't believe that peace is about politics. Peace is a bit about state of mind, it's about -- it's a culture, it is about values, and those are the values that really need to be addressed, and they are long overdue.",

They know everything, but then follow the logic, since they know I don't have it, the accusation that I do is just a game to set the stage for a war that has no relation to WMD.

And then, my last three years of playing in the NBA, I had seven surgeries. Right at the end of my last surgery, a doctor gave me a new drug called OxyContin. He said, take it. I took it, and in two days, I was in love. It was the greatest thing I've ever had in my life and probably have had. It made me feel smarter, funnier, better, better husband, better dad. More relaxed in my own skin. If people came up and wanted to chitchat, I was all for it. Like, come on. All my social anxiety went away.

And I've never really spoken on this, but when I came in, I left school and I didn't want to leave school.I didn't feel like I was ready to leave school yet, especially emotionally and socially. Basketball-wise, I was fine and, you know, I went right into the NBA and was fine, physically. But emotionally, I wasn't. And when I got into the NBA, guys like Magic Johnson and Isaiah Thomas and all those -- all the stars, black stars, they all put their arms around me, all of them. And I was -- I still am. I feel like a lot of guys' little brother. You know, Joe Dumars and Rolando Blackman and all these guys, they knew, they knew what I'd been through. None of us ever talked about it, but they were so damn nice to me. And if not for them, my teammates, Dell Curry, Muggsy Bogues. Dell taught me how to tie a tie. But everyone really put their arm around me and really helped raise me because I was the youngest player in the NBA by two or three years. And so, that part of it is so heartwarming and it almost brings me to tears thinking about it when I have to articulate it because they didn't have do that. I always a competitor of theirs.

I wanted to the write the one that Steve Nash will write someday or Grant Hill will right someday, just the all-American guy that did everything and could handle all that stuff. I couldn't handle it. And that makes me feel bad. And being praised for it is weird too. I feel like I'm failing up. But a friend of mine told me the other day, he said, shut up. What you're doing is not failing.
