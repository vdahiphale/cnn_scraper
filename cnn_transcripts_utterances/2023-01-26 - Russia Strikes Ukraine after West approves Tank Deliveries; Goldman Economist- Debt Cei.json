Lots to get to this hour but let's begin with the latest in Ukraine tanks promised from the west while missiles rain down from Moscow. One person has died and at least two more injured after Russia launched a new wave of strikes against Ukraine early on Thursday. The attack came after Germany and the U.S. announced that they would supply modern battle tanks to Ukraine a move that the Kremlin is calling \"a direct involvement in the conflict\".

We've been seeing this now for months on almost a weekly basis what the Russians have been doing once again in sending Shahed low level, low grade drones to absorb a lot of the air defenses and then follow that up with most sophisticated much more powerful cruise missiles. Now over the capitol city here in Kyiv local authorities are saying they shot down all 20 cruise missiles that were aimed at the Capital. One was shot down the debris from that killed a local resident in his 50s and fell fairly close to a significant energy generating facility which was clearly being targeted by the Russians. Now elsewhere in the country, the Ukrainians have preempted this strike because they had intelligence that it was likely to be coming by dialing down the amount of energy they were producing so that the results of any successful strike against them could be minimized. That seems to have been effective here in Kyiv, most of the emergency services, the supplies of power to hospitals and other critical infrastructure is backup same, reportedly out of Odesa. So they have once again weathered one of these storms. But this has taken none of the shine of their pleasure and delight, I should say Rahel, received here in in in this country over the reports that the festival Germans are going to be sending Leopard tanks along with their other allies. Some 80 or so Leopard tanks are expected in the next few months. 30 Abrams tanks probably going to take a bit longer 14 challenger tanks from the United Kingdom that may be here in a matter of weeks these are not strategic weapons, but they are strategically symbolic in because they show the enormous amount of unity now in the West at a time when the Russians might have been hoping for some fragmentation about what the strategy should be for Ukraine in the West. Now they are Full Square behind the Ukrainian strategy, which is to continue to prosecute this war until the Russians can be driven out. And there is hope here in the Ukrainian administration, that these tanks will be the precursor to more and more strategic weapons, particularly air defenses, particularly long range missile strike capability, but above all air defenses and potentially aircraft attack aircraft, which is something they've been asking for from before day one of this conflict, Rahel.",

And we knew that was going to be a negative the fact that mortgage rates have spiked has driven down home construction. It's also hurt commissions for real estate agents. So that's been a negative, but otherwise consumers are spending, businesses are spending, government is spending and all of that is contributing to what is stronger than expected GDP. I mean, this is essentially a report card for the U.S. economy. And in the first half of last year, the economy was kind of getting failing or near failing grades right there were back to back quarters of negative growth. It was kind of puzzling, set off a lot of concerns that maybe the economy was already in a recession. But ending the year clearly on a very strong note we had above 3 percent growth in the third quarter and now almost 3 percent growth in the fourth quarter. Throw that on top of some other really good economic news we are getting this morning, jobless claims unexpectedly fell in the latest week. They're actually lower than they were a year ago. Remember, this is a proxy for layoffs. So even though we keep hearing about major companies, including IBM and SAP and DOW all of them cutting jobs, if you look at it, look at the broader economy, we're seeing that unemployment remains very low in the jobs market remains pretty solid here, Rahel.",

One thing however, that's providing a bit more concern is this debt ceiling crisis, this is debt ceiling debate.

And the Goldman Sachs Economist, he told me, look, if they don't act in time, there's going to be really negative side effects in financial markets. People are going to start to be worried about the safety of U.S. government debt. And I asked him I was like, well; could this cause a recession if there's a default or even a near default? And he said, Yes, he thinks though, that's not going to happen. He thinks that eventually they're going to get a deal done. Now, bigger picture Rahel, Goldman Sachs is actually very optimistic on the economy. They're calling for a soft landing. And today's GDP report actually supports that argument.

Donie, we expected that this might happen is medicine, anything about how they came to this decision? DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, so Rahel, people might remember two years ago, right after the Capitol attack. That is when Facebook and of course other platforms too banned Trump. They said at the time, it was dangerous to have him on their platform, that he might incite further violence and that there was a direct risk of imminent harm. Facebook Meta now says that risk has receded and that it is now OK for Trump to go back on the platform. It is a bit wishy washy of you know, really they tried to I guess get the mood of the country on this kind of subjective issue.

So right now Trump is posting on his own social media platform, which is true social, there's reporting we have is that he does have an exclusivity agreement with that platform, or yes, post there first, and he can post a few hours later on other platforms. But it is broadly expected that he might be able to get his way out of that agreement. Look, he uses Twitter and Facebook very differently. Twitter is where he can stay in the news and the conversation. Facebook is where the Trump campaign and both 2016 and 2020 really effectively use the targeted advertising and the last election cycle in 2020. They spent hundreds of millions of dollars on Facebook, also because they can use it as a fundraising tool that investment they're getting campaign donations, through that? Look, this is obviously a very big political issue here in the U.S. many people saying that Trump should not be allowed back on that really the conditions in the country have not changed that much. And Trump is continuing to sprouts election lies that could they argue inside further violence? On the other side of this, there are people saying including, by the way, the ACLU and I think we have the ACLU statement, that it is a good decision that Facebook made yesterday. That a company like Facebook should not be allowed to silence or censor, a Former President and now a candidate for office in 2024. The ACLU saying this is the right call, like or not, President Trump is one of the country's leading political figures and the public has a strong interest in hearing his speech. So look, we'll see how long it's going to take if Trump goes back on the platform? How long it might take for him to break the rules or for them to ban him again or to take action against him?",

They've said they're going to grow 50 percent. That's how the stock is valued. OK, so just with respect to the results, we thought the results were very bad. I know that the stocks reacting positively, but let me run through it. So their auto gross margin fell 390 basis points, quarter over quarter. Keep in mind, in the fourth quarter, the price cut was just one point, roughly $5,000 across their suite of cars. In the first quarter, which is what's really important? Their price cut is about $5,000 across their suite of cars. So their gross margins fell 390 basis points with the price cut in Q4. Let's take a look at some other Q4 items. Their inventory in Q4 is up 120 percent year over year. That's a big problem with despite to write downs. And addition to that Elon Musk clarified yesterday that they're guided 1.8 million of sells this year is not supply constrained. What that means is there's just not demand for their cars. And given that he also confirmed that their price cuts equated to just one month of orders. That means you're probably going to have to cut prices to get it 2Q.

So assume they get another $1,000 of cost savings, and you get a price cut of $4,000. You take that $9,000, subtract 4000, you get $5,000 per car, that's profit, right? Net profit, you multiply that by their 1.8 million of guidance, and you get a number divided by their shares outstanding of about $2.69 per share in earnings. The street is currently at $4 and $2.69 per share based on where the price is today, is a 55 times multiple. That means that the street is saying they're going to grow 55 percent for the next 10 years, where they're guiding you to basically 11 percent growth this year. So it's not that I don't buy it, it's just that the valuation doesn't even match their numbers. So anybody who's buying the stock at these prices today, I think is going to be hurt pretty badly.",

Even Morgan Stanley, one of our competitors said the numbers probably going to come in at $3 this year and their note this morning. If that is indeed the case, this stock is going to come down a lot, look; I know it's up a lot today. I think it's due to a lot of misunderstandings, misreading, but these were not good numbers.

One is spirits is still very strong and desired by consumers, the cocktail culture is alive. It's well established in America, it's spreading elsewhere. And people are drinking better, the second trend. And as you pointed out the top end of our portfolio, which is about 28 percent of our business, our reserve business, grew double digit in every region of the world.

You know, Americans, one in three Americans are buying bottles of spirits over $50 a bottle. If you went back a year, it was one in four. So, you're seeing more people move to more premium brands. Because as is an affordable luxury, the average American household spends $1 a day on spirits at home, you only buy a few bottles of kettle one vodka or Don Julio a year. So, your willingness to buy better brands and to pay for better quality is high. And we see that trend continues. So, I'm very optimistic and confident about the future of our business in North America. And we have you know, our business since COVID in the U.S., our U.S. spirits business has grown 45 percent.

So, it requires being extremely sharp, very close to the consumer spotting trends early and responding. And you also in this day and age, you need to drive a lot of productivity and efficiency in the business to offset the impacts of inflation that are coming through. And so, I worry about making sure our teams right across the world have their pulse on the consumer, are agile in responding fast, because the fundamentals are strong. And we are fortunate to be in a category where consumers coming out of COVID want to socialize, want to celebrate, want to make those moments special, those moments actually count for more. And our brands play a tremendous role in them. So, we're fortunate, we're on the side of the ledger, when consumers come under spending pressure. This is where consumers actually do want to spend more; they may cut back in other areas. And that's helping the growth in the business.",

And more often than not, you will see sometimes at the bottom of articles that this was written with the help or entirely with the use of artificial intelligence.
