For the second time in as many months, the justices will weigh in on the reality facing some pregnant women in post-Roe America, can states deny an abortion to a woman having a medical emergency, such as organ failure or infection, case in point, Idaho's restrictive abortion law. Right now, one of the few exemptions in that state's abortion ban is when the life of the mother is imminently at stake. We expect the Supreme Court arguments from the government and a lawyer for the state of Idaho to begin shortly. We're going to show that to you live as it's happening. But I first want to go out to CNN's Gabe Cohen outside the Supreme Court. Gabe, obviously both sides are going to be out in force in front of the Supreme Court. What can you tell us? What can you share with us right now?",

They gathered here, many of them, over the past 30, 45 minutes right outside the Supreme Court.On the other side of all those barricades is going to be anti-abortion activists, who are going to have a program running at the same time as this one, right around 10L00 A.M. And, look, the program hasn't even gotten underway, and we have already seen some really tense clashes. At one point, a couple anti-abortion activists came over to the side, they were chanting, they were yelling, and they were surrounded by abortion rights activists, some of the organizers from these reproductive rights groups, trying to drown them out, trying to keep cameras from getting a look at them. There was a lot of tension there, a lot of shouting back and forth. Finally, those two activists did walk away. But it could be telling as to what today brings, Jim, those arguments not even underway yet, and we are already starting to see tense moments. And we do expect a program with speakers to get underway around 10:00 A.M. as well. So, we'll see what that looks like in the coming minutes.",

They say, look, if you need capacity to perform an abortion to stabilize a patient, that is sufficient under federal law. So, that's what's at stake here. Do they need to wait in the state of Idaho before someone is in a medical life-threatening emergency or can you perform an abortion to stabilize someone? That's really at the core here.

And these decisions are significant not only because they impact the women who may need these procedures or need this medication, also because it could have an enormous impact on the election. Historically, we've seen that abortion is an issue that has always galvanized certain bloc of Republican voters. But since the overturn of Roe v. Wade, it's actually something that has really begun to galvanize Democratic voters. These decisions not expected until late June, early July. That's going to be at the peak of the presidential campaign season.

And if you read some of the coverage of why this went into place, it's almost sort of mind-boggling because we've lived for almost 40 years with this in place.This was put in place after there were a lot of reports of what's known as patient dumping, essentially a lot of patients, many of whom who didn't have insurance who were moved before they were even known if they were stabilized from a private hospital to a public hospital for financial reasons, and this could include pregnant women. And if you're in an emergency situation and you haven't been screened and stabilized before the transfer, data showed that there were poor outcomes. Patients even may have died because of this. So, this was really an important statute. And I think what's really interesting in some of the arguments we may hear today, you hear from Idaho, is well, they didn't call out abortion specifically in EMTALA, and therefore it's a government overreach. And so we're going to hear like should everything be called out in EMTALA every kind of emergency medical situation. I think it will be interesting to sort of hear these arguments.",

      "speaker": "JOSHUA TURNER, CHIEF OF CONSTITUTIONAL LITIGATION AND POLICY",
      "sentences": "It put EMTALA on a centuries old foundation of state law. States have always been responsible for licensing doctors and setting the scope of their professional practice.Indeed, EMTALA works precisely because states regulate the practice of medicine. And nothing in EMTALA requires doctors to ignore the scope of their license and offer medical treatments that violate state law. Three statutory provisions make this clear. First, Section 1395, the Medicare Act's opening provision, forbids the federal government from controlling the practice of medicine. That's the role of state regulation. Second, Subdivision F in EMTALA codifies a statutory presumption against preemption of state medical regulations. And third, EMTALA's stabilization provision is limited to available treatments, which depends on the scope of the hospital staff's medical license. Illegal treatments are not available treatments. Add in this court's own presumption against preemption of state regulations, combine that with the need for clear and unambiguous spending clause conditions, and the administration's reading becomes wholly untenable. The administration's misreading also lacks any limiting principles. If E.R. doctors can perform whatever treatment they determine is appropriate, then doctors can ignore not only state abortion laws but also state regulations on opioid use and informed consent requirements. That turns the presumption against preemption on its head and leaves emergency rooms unregulated under state law. It's unsurprising that no court has endorsed such an expansive view of EMTALA, and until Dobbs, nor had HHS. Everyone understands that licensing laws limit medical practice. That's why a nurse isn't available to perform open heart surgery, no matter the need, no matter her knowledge. The answer doesn't change just because we're talking about abortion. The court should reject the administration's unlimited reading of EMTALA and reverse the district court's judgment. I welcome the court's questions. JUSTICE CLARENCE THOMAS, U.S. SUPREME COURT:  Normally when we have a preemption case, there's some relationship between the parties. Is the state being regulated by the federal government under EMTALA or is the state engaged in some sort of quasi contractual relationship?",

      "timeStamp": "10:10:05",
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "sentences": "Yes, Your Honor, in this case, the state, Idaho, for example, has no state hospitals that participate with the emergency rooms in EMTALA. And so in this case, there isn't even a quasi relationship. The parties being regulated by EMTALA here are hospitals and doctors. And I think your question is getting at the Armstrong issue.And we think that is a significant question. It wasn't part of the question presented. We think the Indiana amicus brief raises significant questions and deals with that argument well. But the question presented here is one of direct conflict between Idaho's law and EMTALA. And on that question, we don't think it's hard at all. And, Your Honors, going to that direct conflict, I think if you consider the express limitation within the statute of availability. JUSTICE KETANJI BROWN JACKSON, U.S. SUPREME COURT:  Well, before we do that, can I just, can I just step back and get your understanding of the statute. You made some representations as to how you see it working. And so let me tell you what I think, and then you can tell me whether you agree, disagree, or otherwise. So, I think that there are two things that are plain, pretty plain on the face of this statute. One is that EMTALA is about the provision of stabilizing care for people who are experiencing emergency medical conditions. That's one thing I think the statute is doing. And I also think that it is operating to displace the prerogatives of hospitals or states or whomever with respect to that fairly narrow slice of the healthcare universe. This idea of emergency medical services is like one very minor part or small part of, of the sort of overall provision of healthcare. So, what that means is that when a hospital wants to only provide stabilizing care in emergencies for people who can pay for it, for example, EMTALA says, no, I'm sorry, you have to stabilize anyone who's experiencing an emergency medical condition. [10:15:13] Or when a hospital wants to provide stabilizing treatments to people who are experiencing only certain kinds of emergency conditions, EMTALA says, no, here's the list of conditions and you have to provide stabilizing care for those people. Similarly, if a state says, look, it's our job to govern all of health care in our state. And we say that only certain kinds of health care can be given to people who are experiencing emergency medical conditions. We don't want whatever treatment. We want only certain kinds of treatment. EMTALA says, no, we are directing that, as a matter of federal law, when someone presents with an emergency condition, they have to be assessed and the hospital must do whatever is in its capacity to stabilize them. Is that your understanding of the statute?",

And as far as I understood your opening remarks, you say, well you this is left to the states. But if I'm just looking at the statute, the statute tells you what the content of the stabilization requirement is. It's to provide such medical treatment as may be necessary to assure within reasonable probability that no material deterioration of the condition is likely to occur if the person were transferred or didn't get care. So, it tells you very clearly, it's an object of standard. It's basically -- you know, it's a standard that clearly has reference to accepted medical practice, not just whatever one doctor happens to think, but it's here -- the treatment necessary to assure within reasonable medical probability that no material deterioration occurs.

The whole purpose of preemption is to say that if the state passes a law that violates federal law, the state law is no longer effective. So, there is no state licensing law that would permit you, permit the state to say, don't treat diabetics with insulin. Treat them only with pills, metformin. And a doctor looks at a juvenile diabetic and says, without insulin, they're going to get seriously ill. And the likelihood, and I don't know what that means under Idaho law, we'll get to that shortly, because I don't know, we believe this is a better treatment. Federal law would say, you can't do that. Medically accepted, objective medically accepted standards of care require the treatment of diabetics with insulin. The medically accepted obligation of doctors when they have women with certain conditions that may not result in death but more than likely will result in very serious medical conditions, including blindness for some, for others the loss of organs, for some, chronic blood strokes. Idaho is saying, unless the doctor can say in good faith that this person's death is likely as opposed to serious illness, they can't perform the abortion. So, I don't know your argument about state licensing law because this is what this law does. It tells states, your licensing laws can't take out objective medical conditions that could save a person from serious injury or death.",

Over there, that is an anti-abortion, a group of activists having their program. What we're hearing over there, a lot of talk about federal government overreach, talking about how abortion is never the answer, and basically saying states like Idaho should be able to control their own destiny when it comes to the issue of abortion.What's happening behind me here, these are abortion rights activists, a much larger crowd having their own program, and they, what we're constantly hearing is abortion is healthcare, and that states like Idaho are preventing pregnant people from getting the abortion care they need during medical emergencies, the stabilizing care talked about in this federal law, EMTALA, basically saying that the delays are potentially extremely dangerous for pregnant people. And, look, we have already seen, Jim, tense moments. Uh, between the protesters from both sides, we had seen a couple anti-abortion activists come over here. There was a bit of a clash, a lot of chanting and yelling back and forth between them and some of the abortion rights groups that are here. And so we're going to continue to watch these programs unfold. But the crowd in the meantime has been growing as the arguments are happening inside the Supreme Court, a lot of discussion about what it means for so many Americans happening right outside.",

Mary, thank you so much for being with us. What are your thoughts on the arguments that we've heard thus far? And if there is a ruling ultimately by the Supreme Court protects EMTALA across the country, ttate law that says if hospitals are receiving federal funding, you have to provide emergency medical care, and that includes abortions as well, might that reestablish some abortion protections nationwide? What are your thoughts?",

We've heard almost nothing from any of the conservative justices, right? So, I don't know if that's because they're agreeing with their liberal colleagues or if they're just holding their fire and waiting until Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar is going to take her turn.In terms of what would happen if the government is to win in this case, that too is complicated. We had reporting from the Associated Press just last week suggesting that even now when there was, prior to the court getting involved, a threat of fines and other penalties under EMTALA for hospitals, that a lot of hospitals were still turning away pregnant patients, even pregnant patients not seeking abortions, because they were afraid of state criminal penalties, in part because those fines were delayed, in part because it was sometimes difficult for the federal government to actually implement those penalties. So, it would certainly provide some kind of baseline for patients seeking emergency treatment, whether it would be enough because doctors are so afraid of criminal law, I think, is still kind of ambiguous.",
