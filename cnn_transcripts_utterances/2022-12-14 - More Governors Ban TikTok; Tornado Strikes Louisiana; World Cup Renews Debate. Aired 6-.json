The senator is citing fears that the app could be used to spy on Americans by foreign adversaries, like China. TikTok's spokeswoman responded writing, it's troubling that rather than encouraging the administration -- for the administration to conclude its national security review of TikTok, some members of Congress have decided to push for a politically motivated ban that will do nothing to advance the national security of the United States.So, this legislation comes as a wave of Republican governors in at least ten states have now banned TikTok on government owned devices. Joining us now to talk about this, CNN anchor and correspondent Audie Cornish, CNN media analyst and \"Axios\" media reporter Sara Fischer. Great to have you guys.

So, it's not a sort of unfounded fear and there have been reports about the Chinese government's attempts to get access when and where it wants.The even broader context of that is, that's kind of all apps. And there's been no real attempt, over the last 25 years, to try and regulate data privacy and security. In part because Silicon Valley and the innovation that our economy is based on is derived from that kind of lax regulation. So, the focus is on China right now, but there's also a broader conversation to be had about like, how do you control something that is also the engine for innovation under which a lot of the sort of creations of our modern apps are built on, which is us.

But he had a real pursuit there, saying it needed to be sold. The concerns about what they were sharing. And now it's something that's just widely accepted as it is a threat and the question is what to do about it.I mean you hear Janet Yellen, the Treasury secretary, talk about it.

That's how they were able to cement their dominance here.So, in 2020, Donald Trump was waving a flag saying this could be a concern. Of course, for political reasons, him and other Republicans want to seem hawkish on China. Now fast forward. TikTok has cemented its dominance here. If you look at any third party data analysis firm they will tell you it's the fastest growing app, it's the most widely consumed app by young people. That's why the conversation has changed.

Five goals, four assists in four games. Yesterday against Croatia in the semifinal we saw that penalty that you guys just showed. Emphatically drove that one home. But even more impressive was his assist, where he took one of the best defenders at the tournament, a Croatia center back, dribbled him the length of the entire half, rounded him in the box and set a teammate up for a tap in.
