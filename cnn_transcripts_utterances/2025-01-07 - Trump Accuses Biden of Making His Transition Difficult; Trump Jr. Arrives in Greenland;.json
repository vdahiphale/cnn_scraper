And to pile on the sports metaphors for you this morning, Donald Trump seems to be on offense and defense at the same time, and possibly throwing a hail Mary pass today for Greenland. We'll get to it all.First, the defense. The president-elect is facing a new legal fight. And we have new details on it this morning, trying to stop special counsel Jack Smith from publicly releasing his final report on his investigations into Donald Trump and the two federal cases that were dismissed. So, why is Donald Trump fighting this now? His lawyers read, we've learned, a draft of that report and are arguing in a new court filing that it contains baseless attacks, which they call an obvious effort to interfere with upcoming confirmation hearings. Now to the offense. Donald Trump is now attacking President Biden, accusing Biden of basically sabotaging his transition into the White House. This happened in an interview and then also on Truth Social he laid into him saying that Biden is doing everything possible to make the transition as difficult as possible. CNN's Jeff Zeleny is with us now. He's got much more on this. Let's start with this attack on Biden and the transition, because what we're hearing from Trump is not the same message we're hearing from those who are coming in to be on his staff.

Of course, we saw during the presidential campaign so many things from immigration to the economy to other matters that the Trump administration wants to do. The question is, how can they get that through a narrowly divided Congress? So, the first meetings will start tomorrow. We're told the president- elect is going to meet Senate Republican leaders likely on Capitol Hill or nearby to talk about the agenda and if they're going to try and do everything in one piece or perhaps break it up. It's looking now like a one piece that's extending his tax cuts, for example, the immigration bills as well.

His team is serious about somehow getting at least a greater role there. And you know that's true. He's sending his son there. He's talking about visiting himself.But also to Bolton's point about the way they're talking about it. They're talking about this as a national security issue. And it was notable, I saw this a few days ago, that Trump's former national security advisor, Robert O'Brien, he tweeted, \"if our great ally, Denmark, can't commit to defending the island, the U.S. will have to step in, as POTUS 47 said,\" referring to President-elect Donald Trump. They are calling this a security issue and therefore laying the groundwork to say this is central to U.S. national security and we're prepared to do whatever we need to do to get greater control there. So, what does that mean? Trump talks about buying it. It doesn't seem like a realistic option. But would they put pressure on a U.S. treaty ally to allow a greater U.S. presence there? Perhaps. But here's the other reality check, Sara, and that is that, as John Bolton said, Denmark has elected leaders, Greenland has elected leaders, and the prime ministers of both Greenland, which is a territory of Denmark, and Denmark itself, have both said, we're not interested in being bought by the United States, regardless of social media posts that Trump has been sharing of one or two people in Greenland with MAGA hats on.",

The city of Chapman, Kansas, saw more than 20 inches of snow, the storm's top snow total.And right now crews in several states, basically all of them, are now scrambling, working to clear roads and restore power before brutally cold temperatures set in. CNN's Derek Van Dam tracking all of this for us. You told us this storm was going to be bad. It was. And now you've got something else. They've got - everyone's got something else to contend with.

And it's actually going to set the stage for what could potentially be another significant snow and ice event. I'll highlight that in just one moment.But right now we've got, over the next week, roughly 75 percent of the American public under freezing temperatures. So, that is really saying something. And this morning, with wind chill values at negative one, you are really feeling it in Kansas City, especially with that fresh snowpack on the ground. In Boston, the actual temperature was roughly 18 degrees this morning, but the wind chill value was at one degree. So, you've got to dress like it's one degree Fahrenheit outside, because that's what it feels like on your exposed skin. And it's all thanks to this snowpack. There was a 1,000 mile plus wide swathe of six inches or more from this most recent snowfall. So, that's locking in the cold, not to mention the direction of the wind just funneling the cold air from the arctic. And, of course, with all the wind and energy behind this, and all the snow and ice that accumulated, we have knocked out power for nearly 200,000 customers across the mid-Atlantic and into the southern portions of the Midwest. So, the cold air, it's not going anywhere. Neither is the snow. So, like I said before, this is going to lay the groundwork, the cold air, for the potential for another snowstorm that is actually picking up steam come Thursday into Friday and potentially into the weekend. Look how it evolves. Dallas, Little Rock, Oklahoma City, you have the potential for some significant snow and icing depending on where that freezing line sets up. Atlanta, Birmingham, you also have the potential for some wintry weather. And then on the East Coast, where it goes from there, that's still to be determined for the weekend. Kate.",

As you noted, that JetBlue flight landed here at Fort Lauderdale Hollywood International Airport from New York City a little after 11:00 last night. Now, according to the airline, sometime after that, during a post- flight inspection of that aircraft, the two bodies were found in the wheel well of this aircraft. Now, the details surrounding just how the victims were able to access the aircraft out of New York City is still unclear at this hour. We're told that no one that was on this flight apparently knew of what happened. The identities of these two victims have not been released. And this discovery comes just two weeks after a body was found on a United Airlines flight from Chicago to Maui. Now, the details surrounding that incident is still being investigated. Again, John, this morning, the Broward medical examiner has taken these two bodies. They are in the process of trying to identify them. The FAA is also investigating the incident. And, of course, JetBlue is still trying to sort out the details, just how these two victims were able to access the wheel well of this aircraft. John.",
