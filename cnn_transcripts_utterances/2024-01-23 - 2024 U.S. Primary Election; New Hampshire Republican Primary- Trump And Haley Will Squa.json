Let me show you the process, and then we're going to talk about the numbers we just got from the poll moderator here. This is where everyone registers, right here, and you can also register to vote on the table far over there. We're kind of held in this little bay here. So, we're going to move about as we can.These -- this is where if you are an undeclared, you can then ask for Republican or Democratic ballot. And then you go into these privacy screens and you vote. As we all know, they do here in New Hampshire on this -- for the primary. After that, here's where the more of the action happens. That black box over there, that is where you will put your ballot in. That's where everything gets tabulated and the vote count comes. And then we've been seeing one of the longer lines here at this precinct. It's right here. This table here. This is where after voters have cast their ballot, they go back over here to become undeclared once again, which is important, as we've learned here in New Hampshire. The latest numbers that we've just gotten from the moderator is that so far today, and the polls have been open since 6:00 this morning, they close at 8:00 tonight. There have been 1,362 votes have been cast. For some context, in 2016, when this primary -- you know, when -- that's kind of the comparable primary that we've been talking about for Republicans. 3,100 about votes were cast. So, hard to say if they're heading towards any kind of a record as we've -- the Secretary of State has said he's looking -- he's predicting record turnout for Republicans across the state, but so far things have very clearly been moving very smoothly. We've been talking to voters that have been coming out after they have cast their ballot and what we've heard, they are generally speaking, if they are voting for Donald Trump and they voted for him in the past. They like what they saw for -- in the Trump administration, and they are voting for him again. They want to see it again. But also, we have heard quite a few, Anderson, people who say that they are voting for Nikki Haley because they are not -- she's not Donald Trump and they are looking for something new. Anderson.",

That is her voter, a Republican voter who wants someone other than Trump and is very disappointed in Trump. And I spoke to their campaign earlier today, they're seeing some really good turnout in Bedford, which is a very Tony New Hampshire town, and in the Seacoast, which is full of Republican suburban moms. And that -- again, that's her voter. I was speaking to a friend of mine that I hunt with in New Hampshire, he lives in New Hampshire, and I said, who's going to win? And he said, I think Nikki's got a shot because of soccer moms. And we haven't heard that term in a really long time. Remember that exploded in 1996 and, sort of, morphed into security moms, and now we've got mega moms, and all kinds of moms. He thinks the soccer moms in the Seacoast, those towns right above the mass border, are full of these soccer moms that are all going to come out for Nikki. Now, putting whether he's accurate or not aside, we'll learn tonight, but those are her voters. That, you know, Mary Anne Sullivan is her voter. You didn't like Trump, you're real disappointed, but you're not going to vote for a Democrat. That's the voter Nikki's happy to take the so-called scraps of, right?
