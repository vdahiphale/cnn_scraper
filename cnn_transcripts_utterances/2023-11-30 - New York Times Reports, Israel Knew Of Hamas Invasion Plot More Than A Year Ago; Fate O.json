      "sentences": "What did Israel know and when did they know it? An explosive report provides an answer to both of those questions. That's tonight on Newsnight.Good evening. I'm Abby Phillip in Washington. And breaking tonight, The New York Times reports that Israel had the Hamas attack plan -- plan of attack more than a year before October 7th, and they chose to simply file it away. Now, the consequences here were deadly. And now, there is a question about if at all, the war, the deadliest day in Israel's history, thousands and thousands of Palestinians caught in the crossfire of all those bombs, if it was all preventable. The Times claims that Israel intercepted a Hamas blueprint nicknamed Jericho Wall for a sprawling terror blitz. It, quote, called for a barrage of rockets at the outset of the attack, drones to knock out the security cameras and automated machine guns along the border, and gunmen to pour into Israel en masse in paragliders, on motorcycles, and on foot. Now, the document, according to The Times, circulated among Israeli military and intelligence leaders, leaders who then dismissed that plan as beyond Hamas' capabilities, not just once, but multiple times. The discovery of this document's existence also adds drama to a decision that is just hours away now. Does Israel try to push a faltering truce to an eighth day, or does Mr. Netanyahu try to bury these failures with more bombs? I'm now joined by CNN National Security Analyst Beth Sanner, former deputy director of National Intelligence. Beth, this has already been pretty clear to be a devastating intelligence failure for Israel, but The Times is reporting that these attacks were planned for years, that they knew about the plans, that they had even previous iterations of these written plans. Could this all have been avoided?",

What's your reaction to hearing that this plan was in the hands of Israeli intelligence officials? SHANY GRANOT-LUBATON, RELATIVES, FRIENDS KIDNAPPED BY HAMAS:  Well, first of all, it's very important for me to say that I trust the IDF. I trust its commanders. They're doing the most important and hard work there is right now. And I don't blame the IDF, neither the commanders. But we are very much heartbroken by what happened. And in many ways, I think it's very important to say that the only one to blame is the terror organization, Hamas, who did these atrocities and massacre and kidnapped our loved ones on October 7th.

And they were too busy on that instead of keeping our borders and keeping the civilians safe. And we are extremely sad and painful and heartbroken by this. And they will need to give us answers. And I hope Prime Minister Netanyahu will take responsibility for his own failure. But, once again, the IDF soldiers are not the ones to blame. And they have been doing the most amazing work right now. They are risking their lives. They are committed to fulfill their job and their mission to keep us safe and to eliminate Hamas because that is the most important job right now.

I don't want to call them desperate measures, but the reality is clear. He misrepresented himself. There was an abundance of lies that he told to his constituency. For crying out loud, I think at one point in time, he had lied about his mother being a part of 9/11. He had lied about that along with various other things that they said he lied about. And so when you consider that you got elected by completely hosing a constituency, the third district in New York, then something definitely needs to be done. And it's incumbent upon his contemporaries within the House to do so. So, I certainly applaud what they're doing in this particular situation. I'm not getting into their motives and their agendas because we always know there's something behind it.

We have seen not just the ex-president, we've seen an abundance of politicians on Capitol Hill acting as belligerent as you can be, immature, uncivilized, unprofessional and in the working world, they would have lost their jobs. But you know what? On Capitol Hill, if you coax your constituency into supporting you no matter how belligerent or immature or out-of-pocket you are, then you remain in office and you have a vote and that makes you a very significant individual, whether it's 435 in the House or 1 of 100 in the Senate. That's the way that it goes. And so, you know, for me, I look at somebody like you and others, and I got to tell you something, me talking politics from time to time and stuff like that, I actually find myself feeling sorry for you all. How you all could be subjected to this stuff on day-to-day basis listening to these folks act like a bunch of damn hooligans, for crying out loud, okay? And I know there is no way that that would be tolerated from young athletes who have no impact on anybody. You could turn off the T.V. You don't have to patronize the product of the brand and go to games and support them and all of this other stuff, and the litany is criticism and the vitriol that is aimed in their direction for the slightest thing. But these folks on Capitol Hill seem to get away with everything. That's the time that we're living in. If there's a change that needs to be taking place, it needs to be a return to a significant level of accountability that politicians once had to face that they no longer have to face. It needs to be reversed, instead of holding kids more accountable and having no patience with them or young men and women accountable with no patience.
