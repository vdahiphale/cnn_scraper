This as Michael Cohen makes a major admission. Did he recover? And he's one of the only American doctors left in Gaza. Hear why the doctor who is credited with saving Senator Tammy Duckworth's life in Iraq says this conflict is worse than anything he has ever seen. Plus, breaking news, Bannon just responding to the DOJ's request that he starts his prison sentence. Is Trump's onetime right-hand man about to go to jail? Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, are you staring me down right now? An explosive clash between the judge in Trump's hush money trial and one of the only defense witnesses. The judge even at one moment yelling, \"Clear the courtroom\". Tensions had been building as Robert Costello, a lawyer who once advised Michael Cohen, started making remarks like, \"jeez\" and \"ridiculous\" when an objection was raised. At one point, expressing his disdain and exasperation by making a blowing raspberries sound after a series of sustained objections, and it got so out of hand that the judge reprimanded Costello. Judge Merchan saying, quote, Mr. Costello, I'd like to discuss proper decorum in my courtroom. As a witness on the stand, if you don't like my ruling, you don't say, \"Jeez\". And then you don't say strike it because I'm the only one who can strike testimony in the court. If you don't like my ruling, you don't give me side or roll your eyes. Well, Costello said he understood. And at that point, people in the room say Costello was staring at Merchan, causing the judge to erupt. Are you staring me down? Get out of the courtroom. And the room quickly cleared so that Merchan could dress down Costello. Now, Trump, after leaving later, spoke about it after the court. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: So what happened to a highly respected lawyer Bob Costello, wow, I've never seen anything like that. I don't understand it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The defense is expected to wrap up tomorrow, but not before scoring what might have been a major win today. Michael Cohen admitting while on the stand that he stole at least $30,000 from the Trump Org, money that we supposed to go to a tech company called Red Finch.So let me just share the exchange with you because Trump's attorney Todd Blanche asks Cohen, you are shorted $100,000 on your bonus that year. Cohen responds, that's correct. And then Blanche says, so the $50,000 that you got to pay Red Finch, you only paid the Red Finch owner $20,000, right? Cohen: Yes, sir. Blanche: So you stole from the Trump Organization? Cohen: Yes, sir. And as the trial nears its end, Trump making, most of that moment and today making the most of every moment he still has left in that courtroom, he was surrounded by a group of people who have been charged or convicted of crimes, including Chuck Zito, a former leader the House Angels Motorcycle Gang, who did time for drug charges, Trump legal advisor Boris Epshteyn, who's been indicted in Arizona for trying to overturn the election, and been omnipresent in that courtroom, and former NYPD Commissioner Bernard Kerik who spent time in prison for tax-related charges.

Because that's what was owed and I didn't feel Mr. Trump deserve the benefit of the difference, right. So it was sort of a motive, but it was -- it was presented differently today.

So that's the same kind of character that's stealing $10,000 in this exchange.At the same time, I do think the defense can make something, I've been in the surely will in their closing submission, they will say, look at this person. He is not a loyal person who's only getting authority from Trump. He's stealing from Trump. He's doing things behind his back. He's rogue, and Trump doesn't even know about it at the time.

And so I think the prosecutors will lay out in pretty organized fashion all of the reason and the basis that Donald Trump was aware of the reimbursement orchestrator, the reimbursement was in on everything involving that and you don't only have to credit Cohen for that, disregard him. But look at all the other things which would suggest last point, Erin, and that is the jury will be instructed that they can make reasonable inferences, right? That is using your common sense good judgment. May be Cohen is the one that directly ties Trump. Lets talk about ladies and gentlemen, all the things that indirectly tie him, right?
