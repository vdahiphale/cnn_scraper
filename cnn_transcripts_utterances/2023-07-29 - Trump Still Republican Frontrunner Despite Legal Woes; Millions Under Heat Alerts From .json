So those are the types of things that we heard President Biden talk about yesterday in Maine really revved up language. Now, one important factor about Maine, this is why we could see President Biden going there more and more as it head to 2024 is that is one state out of two in the U.S. that don't give all elector, excuse me, electoral vote to the popular vote winner, so reason why we could see President Biden going there pretty frequently. Now, on top of all those things that I just talked about, we heard President Biden talk about, in addition to a recently signed Executive Order prioritizing manufacturer. We also heard him take a swipe at Republicans who are really starting to gain traction with talking more about the impeachment inquiry against President Biden, a potential impeachment inquiry against President Biden on Capitol Hill.

But I think this moment, that in time that the White House existed was really described perfectly by Maryland Representative Steny Hoyer, who said yesterday at the White House that this is not time for a victory lap.

Good morning, Lynn, great to see you. Lynn, let's start with the high profile gathering in Des Moines because Trump, which was noticeable, he didn't address the expanded charges in the Federal Documents case or, you know, aggressively attack it, which many expected. Rather, he held back. Clearly someone had a serious conversation with him. He stuck to the script, was disciplined in doing so which is obviously uncharacteristic of him. Do you see that as a signal that Trump might be getting nervous about the heaviness of this criminal case? And of course, the other is that potentially pending? LYNN SWEET, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, CHICAGO SUN-TIMES: No. Here's why. These contenders were under a 10-minute limit. So for Trump, that's hardly time to say hello. This is a singular event that I think should not be a signal for anything in the other days that unfold in Iowa. I know there's talk that the rivals didn't attack Trump. Well, why would you when you know he was there. You were just asking for it. When that day comes, it may come, it wasn't going to be last night in Des Moines. For Trump to not address the charges, I think has no significant distinction, because he has plenty of opportunities to do so almost at will on a variety of communication platforms.",

You could still, if you want to talk about Hunter Biden day and night. But the idea that there is -- there's two ways to go here. And we'll see if this develops, I think it's still a little early.And again, last night was not the place when the bears in the room to go attack the bear. So was the wall ever built? Did Mexico pay for it? What about debt in the U.S. that went up under Trump, et cetera, et cetera. There are just things that never happened that aren't an attack on Trump, it's just a same what it is, with the idea that it's time to move on to somebody who can talk to everyone about everything, and not make this about himself. This is very hard. We'll see if there's any unity in this messaging if other Republicans who are in any kind of leadership or influence, mental roll come forward, I think it's awfully important to the process. Because I think that the main bottom line thing to remember here, do you want to get Trump out of contention? Or do you want to put yourself in it? These are kind of colliding goals as these different candidates figure out how to position themselves, get in some Trump people and that get Trump mad at you, and attack you at a time if it's seen as counterproductive to your process. One quick other thing, you may not see this group together again, with Trump anytime soon, we'll see if they all show up at the August 24TH debate in Milwaukee.",

But of course, Biden is also, you know, 80. You got Trump in his upper 70s. Yes, we're not expecting Congress to enact any kind of age limit. But what's the bigger conversation here? Should we be talking about politicians being required to disclose any major health issues before running? Should we be talking about the need for generational change when it comes to that level?

And so, when you look at the legal standard which are, are you irreparably damaged, right?Is there any rehabilitation which can really have you be a productive member of society? It's a very difficult question. And that's why Jean in her piece spoke to the defense now, pointing to experts showing perhaps he does have that redeeming quality. As it stands now -- and you know, again, it's very emotional, of course, and the judge has to evaluate that, has to evaluate the nature of his conduct, the nature of his family life, the nature of his environment and balance that against whether what he did really warrants at some point in his life, him being able to be a contributor to society. And so, I think at this point, the prosecution certainly has raised the case that he needs to remain in jail for the remainder of his life, and that's going to be the question the judge will ultimately have to decide.",

Should he be? The larger question, of course, Victor, and why we're having this is because the majority of the states in the country, about 27, do not permit life without parole for our children.That is minors, people under 18. You may ask why? And the answer to that is that there's a lot of research owing to the fact that minors, their brains work differently. They don't function as adults would. Of course, that is a proper and appropriate sentence for any adult, but when it gets to minors, that's the case. There's also a history of Supreme Court decisions saying, you can't sentence minors to death, in the event that you know, you have life without parole in and of itself, it's not a legal and constitutional sentence, unless you have really some kind of standards to match it or against in some kind of hearing, that's the basis for the hearings itself, because he's a minor and because they're considering that life without parole sentence. The issue was whether the facts, the circumstances and everything else we know would make him really eligible for release, and that's something the judge will have to determine and decide. But right now, the evidence, Victor, is compelling, it's emotional, it's tragic, and just very difficult to listen to and try really to make sense of. It's just horrible.",

What does that mean? It means through the fact that she filed a false report as it relates to this.She lied to police as it relates to this. And so, in terms of defenses, right? The essence is that she's guilty. What your question is, is it matters because of mitigation, that is how it's going to be assessed and what her punishment will be. Very quickly, there's deterrence, there's rehabilitation, and then there's punishment. Her attorneys are going to argue that she's a member of society, could be rehabilitated, she could do better, she shouldn't be judged by this. We have to evaluate all of the essence of why she did this, and they're going to argue for any reduced punishment or reduced sentence, and that's why it matters, Victor.",
