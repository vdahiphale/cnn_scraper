We begin this hour with a murder investigation in Dallas, Texas where police say that a woman was shot and killed by her boyfriend over an abortion. 26-year-old Gabriella Gonzalez who lived in Texas was shot in the head the day after she returned from Colorado where she went for an abortion.Let's get straight to CNN's Isabel Rosales who's been following this story for us.

And also, they're speaking with witnesses including the victim's own sister who heard the shooting, unfolding. This all happened on Wednesday, Dallas police got a 911 call. They rushed to a parking lot. And they're on the ground, they found 26-year-old Gabriella Gonzalez shot and killed.Now court documents indicate that through surveillance video they saw the suspect Harold Thompson walking with Gonzalez. They had been dating all of this right before the fatal shooting. Thompson in the video, the court documents detail was seen attempting to put Gonzalez in a chokehold. She then shrugs it off, and that is when Thompson reaches for a firearm and shoots Gonzales in the head. And as she falls to the ground, he then continues to shoot at her. Now according to the arrest warrant, an affidavit in there, it says \"further investigation revealed that Gonzalez went to Colorado to get an abortion and returned the night before. It is believed that the suspect was the father of the child. The suspect did not want the complainant to get an abortion. Now court documents also indicate here past history of violence against Gonzalez. She told police that Thompson had beaten her up several times before and he had an active family violence strangulation warrant during the time of the shooting. That was for a March incident that occurred while Gonzalez according to the court documents was pregnant with his child. So far, Gonzalez has refused to put out a statement or speak with police. He has been charged with murder and assault to a family member. And according again to those court documents, he's been denied bond and will be appointed a public defender. Alex?",

Isabel Rosales, thank you very much for that report.Now to the U.S. southern border where officials are saying that they're seeing fewer migrants crossing than expected despite Title 42 expiring at midnight on Thursday. Authorities say that the long lines of people who once waited to enter the U.S. have dissipated that many of the border crossings, many officials had expected a surge after the COVID era policy expired. But there are also new warnings about a potential for that surge to worsen in the coming weeks with one Border Patrol official projecting as many as 14,000 migrants who could try to enter the U.S. per day.

Thank you very much.Now here with me now with more perspective on all this is Raul Reyes. He is an immigration attorney who also writes for CNN Opinion. Raul, thank you so much for joining us. I want to ask you first about the change in policy. Title 42 has expired. Title eight, as it's known, has now taken effect and that does impose harsher penalties for migrants who tried to cross into the U.S. illegally. But the process for migrants to claim asylum, to seek asylum can be quite lengthy and complicated. Do you think that the system we have now is sustainable?",

      "sentences": "Well, basically the immigration system that we have overall, it's really barely a system at all. Our asylum process as we know it, it was truly designed for a very different era. And now what the Biden administration is trying to do, they're trying to balance a mixture, they're creating some new legal pathways to entry, increasing the number of refugees admitted, but at the same time, they are causing this -- basically a transit ban for asylum seekers.And that's going to be very problematic on the ground because this asylum ban will affect potentially hundreds of thousands of people who do have a lawful right to seek humanitarian relief at the border. And balancing that with our own inadequate so far as we've seen response at the border. And I mean, to put this in perspective, we are seeing early on, as you mentioned, right? Perhaps fewer numbers of migrants at the border. But for the Biden administration at this point, honestly, that whether it's fair or not, the fact that there may be fewer numbers right now, that's less important than these images. These are very powerful images we've been seeing all week. And that's a tremendous political problem for the Biden administration. President Biden's approach to immigration, according to Gallup, presently is only approved by 33 percent of the American public. And that's actually lower than President Trump was known for his extreme policies, that number is actually lower than Trump. So, big problem for the Biden administration going forward.",

REYES: No, no. In fact, I'm confident saying that because I know that Department of Homeland Security has repeatedly asked Congress for additional funding for more searching of resources to the border and Congress has not allowed it. And to put in perspective, the backlogs that we are talking about people, as we -- as we look ahead, right now, the average asylum case, it takes 4-1/2 years to resolve. And that's just start, you know, for many of these migrants, their cases that they have not even begun. So, we're looking at tremendous backlogs, not only along the border itself in government facilities, but in our court system, in our asylum system. And as much as the administration has been sending troops and resources to the border, their policies are still very problematic because they don't address the root causes that the -- say the push factors that drive people to migrate from Latin America and Central America to the U.S.",

We know President Zelenskyy said the other day that the conditions weren't quite ready for the full-scale offensive to be launched.That said, there have been local tactical gains by the Ukrainian armed forces in that long-running and very, very brutal battle for Bakhmut with the capture of a couple of kilometers both to the north and the south on the flanks there. With the Wagner mercenary group taking heavy casualties we understand from Ukraine officials. And Nic Robertson has been reporting on that. But I think, much more widely, the delivery of Storm Shadow missiles -- these are cruise missiles from the United Kingdom -- offer almost a strategic upgrade in the capabilities of the Ukrainians. They're the first longer-range missiles capable of reaching any target they choose within Ukrainian territory occupied by the Russians. That's very important in terms of breaking down the logistical chains. That may well be what they're trying to do in places like Luhansk and as we've seen elsewhere in the Crimean Peninsula, too. There's no evidence that cruise missiles were used in the air strikes against Luhansk, although that's something the Russians will claim, particularly if there were any kind of civilian casualties. But the Ukrainians make their own missiles and cruise missiles and other missiles capable of hitting there. What will be the real sign that an offensive is even more imminent is if we see a significant increase in these campaigns against the logistics chain of the Russians.

The U.S. Marshalls followed that man to an empty parking lot and that's where they confronted him and ultimately arrested him. They say that Grant was visibly surprised when they approached him, but he did surrender without incident to the U.S. Marshals. Meanwhile, there was also a second arrest earlier this week in this case, a 21-year-old woman, Xianni Stallings, she's accused of actually helping these two men break out of prison back on Sunday. But at this point, we still don't have a lot of details as to how she potentially helped these men escape. This one, she's facing four felonies, including the felony of escape. But her defense attorney was not giving any comment earlier this week to CNN when we asked. Meanwhile, the last suspect, Ameen Hurst, that's the 18-year-old, he's one of the gentlemen who is accused of escaping that prison, also, on Sunday. He's still on the loose. And he was in prison initially suspected of four homicides. The U.S. Marshal said he is still considered to be armed and dangerous. But I should say, the Marshal said that, earlier this week, they were splitting up their time, devoting energy to finding two escaped inmates. Now they said, while it's been a long week, they can focus all of their energy on bringing back this one potentially escaped inmate. Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It's available for public comment from now through June 5th. But based on current incidents rates, it's estimated that 12.9 percent of women born in the United States today will develop breast cancer at some time during their lives. And it's important to catch these cancers early. That gives a better chance of survival. Now meanwhile, this update does not change recommendations for women at high risk of getting breast cancer. Those women should still keep in contact with their doctors for what's best for them. But for all of us, for all women, it's important to discuss with our doctors our family history of cancer, whether you have dense breasts. Ask for a breast exam at your next appointment and talk to your doctors about when to start screening for you based on your own risk factors and how often. Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
