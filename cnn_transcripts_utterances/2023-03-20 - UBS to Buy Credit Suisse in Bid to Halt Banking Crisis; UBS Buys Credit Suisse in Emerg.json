      "sentences": "A warm welcome to \"First Move\", fantastic to have you with us and a very happy first day of spring to you all. And we'recertainly springing into the very latest on Chinese President Xi Jinping's first visit to Moscow since Russia invaded Ukraine. What may come from his talks with President Putin just ahead? But first the action on global markets after another historic weekend of deals in decision making aimed at shoring up competence in the financial system. The key development, a de facto shotgun wedding, let's call it that between Swiss banking giants UBS and its beleaguered competitor Credit Suisse. The cost some $3.25 billion equivalent in stock, UBS will also take a hit for a further $5 billion worth of losses if required. The Swiss National Bank will also provide some $100 billion worth of liquidity assistance again, if required now, the initial response from stock investors across European Banks including. Let's be clear, UBS shareholders too is concerned, I'd call it that although admittedly, shares are way off their worst levels earlier on in the session. UBS down around 3 percent, as we speak, and other European majors down around 1.5 percent that stock for debt holders, I think it shock. Now the reason for the nervousness there is tied to how this deal treats debt holders versus shareholders. Now, just to be clear, normally, shareholders are the first in line to take a hit when a bank gets into trouble. However, in this deal, some value for shareholders is being preserved, while $17 billion worth of debt is effectively being wiped out. Now, you're going to hear a lot of talk about something called 81 debts. That's a debt here that was established after the financial crisis to be a buffer in case a bank got into distress in the future. The problem now is that this sends a warning shot across the bow of other investors in this kind of debt, that perhaps it's riskier than they first thought. So you have to watch the debt markets now, rather than perhaps the stock markets. Now, in another move reminiscent of the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve and other global Central Banks announced measures to boost the availability of dollars. The message, you can keep lending to customers and businesses, were not going to let you run out of cash, and there's no need to hoard money, that's the message. Now after all, this U.S. futures moving higher after earlier weakness, green arrows, as you can see that for Europe too, though, there's still nervousness in U.S. regional banks with shares of First Republic set to resume their slide. In early trading today, after yet another downgrade, you know what I think of the rating agencies. So I won't elaborate further now, more on all of that in just a moment. But first, another weekend, another emergency rescue. Anna Stewart joins us now. Anna, we sought to call this but even I was surprised at the speed upon which this happened. Just talk us through the contours of the deal.",

Something that did catch my eye when I was poring over the details beyond the initial hit, which was the debt holders, as you've mentioned, was this idea that they were paying around a 60 percent discount compared to the value of Credit Suisse on Friday, but to your point, you top up that $3 billion, with the $5 billion potential hit that UBS takes. And that brings you back to the $8 billion that Credit Suisse was worth on Friday. The cost savings, though, Anna, talked to me about the potential cost savings for UBS, relative to that $8 billion sum that we're talking about, which is why I mentioned that?",

But $8 billion of saving a year by 2027 and this will mean of course, huge job cuts. And my heart goes out to people that work for Credit Suisse, who are probably worried about that position today. There will be a lot of synergies; they didn't have an answer to all of the many questions. For instance, what happens to the whole plan to spin up Credit Suisse's investment bank to Credit Suisse First Boston? I think that looks like it's on the rocks - are looking to reduce and slim down any investment bank operations and bring it into line with their culture of risk management. There was a lot of excitement. It was a very short presentation in terms of slides, just the one slide, very succinct, but a lot of excitement for UBS about wealth management and what Credit Suisse will bring to its portfolio. Combined, they will have $5 trillion worth of invested assets, UBS was looking to expand in - and Asia and this will certainly help it to do that. But a lot of cost savings along the way. And one big question that I don't think we have the answer too really but the domestic banking operations which of course quite profitable, in terms of Credit Suisse, what that will bring to UBS and to competition, I think domestically, Julia.",

And the fact of course, we should mention shareholders didn't get a choice. They were told what was going to happen here. They weren't allowed to vote. Anna, great job, thank you so much, and well done for being on that call! Anna Stewart there! And let's bring in Richard quest now, Richard much to discuss. We can talk about Credit Suisse and the decisions in Switzerland. We can also talk about, again, a repeat of what we saw in 2008. Where were all the Central Banks come in and provide liquidity even before perhaps they worry, I think the situation here is always you don't know, what you don't know until you find out. RICHARD QUEST, CNN EDITOR-AT-LARGE: And that is exactly the problem at the moment. There was always the fear, you know, this Julia well, that the rising interest rates would expose weaknesses in the plumbing system. But nobody really knew where or how far good example, of course, was Liz Truss's mini budget that wasn't, which exposed huge weakness in portfolio insurance and the pensions industry overnight in one fell swoop. While these rising interest rates have now exposed weaknesses in those banks that were long bond heavy, and weren't risk managed properly. Interestingly, the New York Times, of course, over the weekend had the story about how SVB was warned several times by the Fed about its risk management position. And so Julia, what I think you're seeing today is a sort of a torch, a flashlight as the Americans would say, being shone into all corners of the financial system and plumbing, working out where the leaks, where's the problems, what's next?",

So the Central Banks moving in, and then the coordinated swap activity, which basically says, as many dollars, euros, yen, as you like, stuff your gills with them. We can always get more, that shows they've learned the lesson, not just of Lehman, but of course, the Bank of England with Liz Truss.

Former Legal Adviser to Trump's Attorney Michael Cohen is set to appear before the New York grand jury today. Kara Scannell is following the case for us in New York.

And BobCostello, who was once an attorney for Michael Cohen, back when Michael Cohen and Trump were on the same side he is expected to appear before the grand jury this afternoon. That source told me that Costello had reached out to both the Manhattan District Attorney's Office and lawyers for Former President Trump saying that he had information that would contradict Michael Cohen's testimony. Now, Cohen appeared twice before the grand jury last week. As you recall, he pleaded guilty several years ago to federal charges. And at the time, he said that he made these payments in coordination with an app the direction up, Former President Trump. Now Costello has turned over hundreds of documents, including emails back from that time period when he was working with Cohen because Cohen had waived attorney client privilege. And we're told that Trump's lawyer sent a letter to the DA's office asking for them to put Costello on the stand because they said Costello would say that Cohen told him at the time that he was aware of no illegal activity by Donald Trump. So that's some testimony that Trump's team wants to get before the grand jury today. Now, Michael Cohen was on MSNBC over the weekend and said that he would be appearing today in court to the DA's office asked him to be on standby. He wasn't sure if that was to be a rebuttal witness before the grand jury or just to answer additional questions by the prosecutors. You know, there's a lot of expectation and some tension about you know, when an indictment could possibly come down when a decision will be made on whether to pursue and we're starting to see some of the security around the courthouse change. This morning, our team observed NYPD officers installing security cameras on the top of the lights in this vicinity, all part of the enhanced security protection and concerted concerns that everyone has with a potential indictment of a Former President and his public appearance in the courthouse just next to me, Julia.",

To shore up the global banking sector Switzerland's biggest bank UBS agreed to buy its ailing rival Credit Suisse. And an emergency deal works on $3.2 billion. Credit Suisse shareholders will be largely wiped out although shares will retain a fraction of their value. The same cannot be said for owners of $17 billion worth of additional tier one bonds. As we've discussed, investors in this riskier class of bank debt will lose everything. Joining us now is Vincent Kaufmann. He is the CEO of Ethos Foundation, a holder of more than 3 percent of Credit Suisse stock. Ethos is composed of 246 Swiss pensions and public utility foundations. Great to have you on the show, sir!

So we have repeatedly asked for different measure, different strategic orientation. So it's a sentiment of yes, big disappointment because we're convinced something better should have happened. But now we have to look at this, I would say more positively and say that the Swiss government had some information and had to act this way to certainly avoid a second Lehman - case and the comparable financial crisis as in 2008.

For instance, we have always pushed for strong and real shareholder equity. We still believe a lot of banks are also the legislation push for higher capital. But I think how financial products are more and more toxic, short term and volatile. We believe we should have much higher core capital. And those buffer instruments were always a little bit for us, not the best solution. But here, you're right, it's certainly that was possible within the perspective of this instrument.

The too big to fail legislation was clearly say that we should reinvent the Swiss business, you know, we are small countries, and we cease to big banks, we really had to have safety mechanisms. So one of the safety mechanisms was to have those streets division independent and being listed on the market quite quickly it was too late last week; clearly, the Swiss division alone would not have been able to survive. That's why we were asking that before. Now, what we would expect from the Swiss Authority, because they pushed on UBS to make this deal. But I think they could also have in terms of anti- competitive low, because here, on a normal case, the anti-competition law would have never accepted such a deal. Here, the protection of creditor overpassed, the anti-trust legislation, but I think the anti-trust legislation could still make the kind of a condition to say, look, you keep it UBS can keep the Swiss division of creditors quite --. So you guys could work really on us with our International Wealth Management work on the investment bank makes the things they have they have a lot of money from the confederation not make the restructuring 9 billion, just a loan to further restructuration. So they can work on this and keep the Swiss business quite both independent and then potentially in two years, give a dividend - to UBS shareholders as a spin off and an IPO of the Swiss division. This is something we'll ask to the resource already, because of course, UBS bought might be reluctant because, of course, they don't want to create a next competitor again as a competitor.

And on the back of Putin having traveled to occupy Ukraine, literally hours ago, Xi Jinping would have been briefed in advance of that.

And I'll say one interesting thing is that the Russians over the last week have been talking to Europeans at a senior level, and saying that if a negotiations process that the Chinese are willing to broker isn't accepted by NATO isn't accepted by Zelenskyy. But the Chinese have said that they're willing to start providing weapons directly to the Russians. Now, I think that that is overstated. I think that's Russian bluster.

And I think that the Europeans, others that engage with the Americans on the global stage, aren't yet really prepared for that what it would mean, certainly if you think about Russia, Ukraine, Trump would have a very radically different position than the Biden Administration or the Republican leadership has had over the course of the past year. Trump would be calling it if the Chinese are promoting a peace plan, Trump would probably be supporting that peace plan. He's much more aligned with the Chinese position here than the Europeans or the American government's presently are. This puts a spanner in the ability of the United States to lead a consolidated NATO or G7, or West. And I think that's perhaps the most significant thing that a Trump nomination, if it comes would be and yes, the country we'll be talking more about Trump as we get further into this Republican nomination process. And as we see whether he is or is not detained tomorrow, his ability to drive headlines continues to surprise compared to his level of capable capabilities as President.",

This was very, you know, sort of, I would say, symbolically charged, very strongly friendly, and powerful language from Putin saying that this feels to me very much like the language that was used a year ago February 4, by Putin in Beijing, talking about these two leaders as friends without global limits. We've heard nothing like this from Putin during the war, since. There's no question that is what he is sharing with the Russian stage and with the global stage today.",

It's a soft smile, but he's smiling throughout this, just the interaction between these two leaders very different even on the surface here.

And the announcement we saw two weeks ago, are bookends of a shift in alignment, a China that believes that the United States is increasingly implacably hostile towards it, and therefore it wants to ensure that the Russians do not lose this war in Ukraine. And that, of course, means that they need to not just stop NATO, from continuing to escalate as they see it, the war on the ground, but they also need to bolster and shore up Putin's position on the international stage more broadly. And Xi Jinping is doing his damnedest to put that into place right now in Moscow.",

This has gone on now for so many weeks of not just popular discontent, Julia but of course thosefractious arguments within the French Parliament that have led us to this point with this no confidence vote coming tonight. Now the parliamentary arithmetic means that it is 287 votes that would be needed for it to pass forcing it is a bad bone, the Prime Minister's government to fall as things stand tonight that looks unlikely to happen although not impossible, Julia, it is more what happens beyond parliament. That we're keeping an eye on this afternoon because as we've seen these last few days, ever since the government announced on Thursday that it would be forcing through this particularly unpopular and controversial attempted pension reform without a vote on Thursday using a parliamentary device that allows it to be pushed through. We've seen those spontaneous and unplanned and not permitted illegal protests taking place spontaneously in Paris and in other French cities. We expect those to continue later today even though any kind of public gatherings have now been banned around the - right here from where I'm speaking to you. Still, the protesters are determined to make their voices heard well beyond the parliamentary walls. And of course, this picks up off something that we've been seeing these last few weeks and coverings to air on CNN, Julia, which are the trade unions that are now preparing their ninth day of mass protests on strike. On Thursday, they'd begun at the start of the year ever since Emmanuel Macron announced that he was determined to get this retirement age pushed through raise from 62 to 64. They've held these protests, these strike actions there will be more on Thursday when much of France will be paralyzed again. Still, and despite that a large proportion of the French public determined to remain against this particular move against the government's proposal and behind what the trade unions and the protesters have been doing these last few weeks. So a remarkable sort of arm wrestle between the governments and really the wider public and the parliament as well, Julia.",
