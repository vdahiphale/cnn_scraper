But when a storm gets very close, the Hurricane Center does it every single hour. So, here's what we see. Here's what the Hurricane Hunter just found. So, were now -- we're ramped up to 130. That is the bottom end of a Category 4 but it is a major hurricane and it has arms all the way into Central Florida, going to go all the way with a hurricane warning to Macon, Georgia. It would take three hours to drive there from Apalachicola to Macon. And that's how long this is going to have hurricane force winds. Where is it the worst right now? Likely from New Port Richey and around Clearwater all the way up to Hudson in Florida. Anytime you get one of these bands and, Anderson, you know it well, in-between the bands the wind kind of dies off when you get one of these heavier bands, the outer bands, then the winds pick up. So, I'm thinking probably on land were probably seeing 70 to 75 miles per hour as the max wind right now but the storm isn't close to shore yet and it won't get close to shore for another, let's say, three or four hours. The closer it gets, the more winds will go up and likely we'll have winds around Perry, Florida around 115 miles per hour for a gust, without a doubt. We are going to see a lot of rainfall. It's already been raining, flash flood warnings are already in effect. Here is the hurricane warning. There's Atlanta and Macon and you can look at a map, how far it is from way down here it's going to be land-falling and that's how long it's going to take to cycle down. We always say, hey, it's going to hit land, it's going to die. This thing is moving so quickly when it hits land, it isn't going to die. It's just going to keep right on going. And that's what's causing a lot of this surge as well. And Derek will get surge in Apalachicola, Saint Marks, absolutely, Cedar Key without a doubt, and all the way along this little hook area through here that's 15 to 20 feet. That's what they're talking about, the un-survivability that's why. If you're six feet tall and you got a wave or water over you another 14 feet above you you're not going to survive that.

You can see where this part of the pier here just broke off at two and it's pushed up against this long seawall here. Up and drive -- up and down this portion of St. Pete really shows that much of this neighborhood is in the dark. There is a good amount of debris and we're still seeing all of this storm water. The storm surge pushed into off of the gulf as well as from Tampa Bay. You know, kind of going into today, we knew that where we were in Gulfport was going to flood because we've covered two other hurricanes, and that's where we had pre-positioned. But going into the afternoon today, we really knew it was going to be a particularly more dire situation because all of that water just started to rush. And when you looked at the radar, the storm at that time was still to the southwest of us. Of course, now it's continued on that track north, but even with the storm staying off about 100 miles to the west of Pinellas County, where we are right now, you could still feel all of that, the wind. You could still feel all of that rain that fell over the past couple of hours. And more importantly, you started to see that storm surge. And this right now really is not the worst of it, because even though the storm has slowly continued its way north, a high tide is not going to be here until about 12:00 or 1:00 in the morning. So you're still going to have all of that water being pushed in, even though the storm is far north of where we are right now. But, Anderson, that's kind of the situation here in St. Pete. We were about 20 minutes to the south and the west of here where things just were too dangerous for us to be. So we kind of drove around.

Thousands and thousands of trees to come down the beautiful live oaks here, and that will just cause major problems. Hundreds of road closures expected. Hurricane Michael a few years ago, which wasn't a direct hit on Tallahassee at all caused power outage for 90 percent of the population here for a week. So a direct hit on Tallahassee.
