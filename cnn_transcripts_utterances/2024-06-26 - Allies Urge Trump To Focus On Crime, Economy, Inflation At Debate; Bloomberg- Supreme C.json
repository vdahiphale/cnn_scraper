Another day of debate prep for the president at Camp David, where he's huddling with his advisors, and also doing those mock debates with his advisors preparing for multiple scenarios. Now, we're learning a little bit about what the President won't do during the debate, and that is make any policy or personnel announcements. But the campaign sees this as an opportunity to draw a stark contrast with former President Donald Trump on three defining issues being the economy, abortion and democracy.But I'm now being told by sources that the President is very much preparing to go on the offensive on immigration. That has been a key issue for former President Donald Trump. He has slammed Biden time and time again. And the President is preparing to point to his recent executive actions. Officials have taken a victory lap today saying that it has led to a drop in border crossings, and also preparing to call out what they say is for President Donald Trump's extremist agenda on this very issue. Now, the President is also expected to talk about foreign policy. This has been a key area of focus for the President amid instability across the globe, and one where they think it's very clear the difference between President Biden and former President Donald Trump, particularly in underlining one of the key arguments from the Biden campaign, which is that Trump is dangerous. that he can't hold a second term, that he would particularly pose a danger to democracy and to global stability, if he were to take -- if he were to win in November. So all of these issues are going to be bundled together in this debate stage, the President preparing for all of this. But what they hope to make clear here is, again, that contrast between the two candidates on all of these issues preparing for those attacks from former President Donald Trump especially on issues like immigration, while also making point -- making clear the point to Americans who may be tuning in for the first time that they think that Trump poses a real risk and danger to democracy.",

They're really relishing that contrast with Joe Biden, who as Priscilla just laid out has been at Camp David for week, leading up to the debate. Donald Trump is of course preparing.[13:05:04] And over the last few days, he's been in Mar-a-Lago. He's been continuing to have what his team has dubbing, quote unquote, policy discussions, more informal opportunities for Donald Trump to pick the brains of his advisors, VP contenders, his former administration officials, and really walk through a series of key areas that they want him to focus on. Now, I'm told by Donald Trump's team, that they are really pushing him to talk more about kitchen table issues, than go on a rant about his grievances, something we've seen Donald Trump do time and time again, on the campaign trail. And really, there's three areas that they think he is strongest on, and also topics that he polls, you know, better on than Joe Biden, and that includes immigration, the economy, and crime. And it's interesting, because those are some of the similar topics that Priscilla just laid out that the Biden team wants to focus on. But when I talk to Trump's team, they really think that those are the issues Joe Biden is the most vulnerable on when you look ahead to November. And so those are the key areas that they want to be pushing Donald Trump too. Now, part of that conversation behind the scenes is also to rein in some of that aggressive rhetoric. Remember, back in 2020, during the first debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, Trump was very aggressive. He repeatedly cut Joe Biden off. He wouldn't really let him get a lot of words in at one point. And we did see Donald Trump fall in the polls shortly after that. It's actually something Trump addressed candidly, in an interview this week, saying, you know, some people say I lost that first debate, but that I won the second. So this is something I know that his team has been talking with him about behind the scenes. And then the other thing I just want to point your attention to, is the expectation game, the way that they are trying to raise the bar. We've heard a lot of Donald Trump's surrogates over the past several days try to argue that sure, even though over the past several months, they've been essentially calling Joe Biden senile. Now, they're trying to argue that he's going to be jacked up and basically claiming that he's going to be taking something. Take a listen to what how speaker Mike Johnson said yesterday on CNN. I'm sorry, I think we don't have that sound bite. But anyway, Johnson had told Kaitlan Collins that he thinks that Trump will be or excuse me, Joe Biden will be taking some sort of energy drinks kind of along the same rhetoric that we've heard in the language we've heard from Donald Trump himself over the past several days.

We also have with us former Trump administration official, Matt Mowers. Maria, let's start with you because there's something that struck me about Priscilla's reporting as it relates to what Alayna was talking about. The Trump campaign sniffs an opportunity when it comes to the issue of immigration. They believe it's a weakness for President Biden, Priscilla was just saying Biden is going to come out aggressive on immigration. How?",

And I think that the Biden campaign has a terrific opportunity to not just flip the script, but to lay out for the American people that it is President Biden, his administration and Democrats, the ones who are responsible on this issue, the only ones who have actually offered a solution. Because when it came time for Republicans and Trump to be able to solve a big part of this, which was their border security bill, their own very conservative border security bill, Donald Trump told his people in the Senate, don't do this, don't pass this, don't give Biden a win, because I need this issue for the election in order to use it as a cudgel. That is very clear to the American people, the priorities for Donald Trump right now.He cares about himself. He cares about using this issue to weaponize it. He doesn't care about solving this. He doesn't care about giving the American people what they deserve, which is a government that actually works. That's what President Biden stepped in with his executive action on border security. And we have seen with the numbers, they are drastically down 40 percent less border crossings. And now with the recent executive action on expanding legal pathways, that common sense, balanced approach is what most Americans we have seen polls show this, most Americans, Latinos, swing voters, that's what they want. They understand that that is something that is focused on a solution. And so yes, I hope Biden comes out strong on this, because that is where the American people will really see that stark contrast between who's fighting for them, who's fighting for solutions, and who is in it for himself.",

And the reason they're not is because they've seen what he's been doing, the actions he's been taking since the day he became President.[13:10:08] I mean look, I worked in the State Department under President Trump. I was there when the Remain in Mexico policy was negotiated. And yet on day one, the executive order, executive action, President Biden rescinded the Remain in Mexico policy, it took additional actions throughout his presidency which is actually incentivize folks to come here illegally. And the action he took last week and Maria calls expanded pathways to citizenship, a lot of folks will call that amnesty. He is now actually on the side of trying to talk and defend illegal immigration. At the same time, when you had President Trump just in the last two weeks talk about expanding legal migration when he's talking about providing visas to those who actually come to the United States to get educated. Those who have college degrees, giving them an automatic green card to stay here in the United States so they can then go into work, that's really set up a real big policy debate for tomorrow night.

And that, frankly, our workforce is expanded, which is what our corporations and CEOs want. KEILAR: Let's put a pin in the immigration conversation, because we could dig in on that and be here for hours. And I'm sure we'll see some of those arguments at the debate. But I want to ask you, Matt, about temperament because Alayna was just talking about the expectations game, the Republican side sort of setting expectations for President Biden, they had been calling him senile, or all sorts of allusions to his mental fitness and his age.

It wasn't the best moment for him. So we'll see how that parlays into debate setting.But look, I think the truth is based on temperament, Donald Trump just needs to try keep it in between the buoys tomorrow night. And you know, when you go into debate, and I've run for office before at lower level, but, you know, you're on live television, it's a lot of the same human emotions. The goal is you've got some candidates go out there and try to write down every policy prescription that notepad they're given. The smart ones go out and say, what are my guiding points? If you're Donald Trump, you should keep just a couple guiding points. I'm strong, he's weak. He failed, I won't. And honestly, I throw in one last thing, if I'm Donald Trump, right down Hunter Biden. I think he actually has a unique opportunity. It's something he's already put out there on Truth Social to say, you know, what, Hunter Biden would have been prosecuted for him for his last name the same way I would have been prosecuted if I weren't running for president. We need to unify this country. I'm going to go out and try to unify the country by pardoning Hunter Biden. If he goes out and does those three things, keeps about weakness versus strength. He keeps about the track record under the Trump administration under the Biden administration, and it shows that he has a little ability to unify America.

But that came up against a more permissive federal law that would allow abortions to be or to require abortions to be performed to protect the health or a catastrophic consequence for the mother.

The court's opinion and Moyle v. United States and Idaho v. United States will be issued in due course.

Now, we will find out soon enough, we expect that these major opinions will be released in the coming days. But as you and Joan, were just talking about, a lot of folks that have been wondering and waiting for the Trump immunity decision. But this abortion related decision is one that could potentially have really the biggest impact on the outcome of the 2024 races in November, because it has been an issue that historically has galvanized a lot of conservatives, but after Roe v. Wade was overturned, it is something that Democrats have actually used to turn out their votes. So the actual opinion in this case really matters. So it will be interesting to see over the next few days if the Supreme Court releases this and if it is indeed the final opinion or if what Bloomberg says that it saw was merely a draft.
