We begin with the major win tonight for Democrats.CNN projects Senator Raphael Warnock will win reelection in that very close runoff election against Herschel Walker. The race closes out a difficult midterm cycle for Republicans who did win a slim majority in the House. But after tonight, they've lost ground in the Senate. Warnock's victory gives Democrats a 51 to 49 edge. It is a critical seat because it gives them a majority in all the Senate committees and it limits the influence of any single moderate Democrat. They have at times held up President Biden's agenda. Senator Warnock spoke with supporters at his campaign headquarters in Atlanta a short time ago, he said he was honored to repeat the four most important words that he says were ever uttered in a democracy that people have spoken. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RAPHAEL WARNOCK (D-GA): I want to say thank you to my mother who is here tonight. We'll see her in a little while. But she grew up in the 1950s in Waycross, Georgia picking somebody else's cotton and somebody else's tobacco. But tonight, she helped pick her youngest son to be a United States Senator.

And yes, Donald Trump played a role here. But so too did the coalition that Warnock was able to put together here. And when you ask, where does Georgia sit in 2024 presidential politics? It sits right at the center of it.

This is, of course, a state where Donald Trump aggressively not only question the results, but tried to pressure elections officials into changing results.And then, Herschel Walker stood up and said believe in the Constitution. This at a time when former President Trump now a contender for the presidency in 2024 is saying that he wants to throw it out because of the massive fraud that was committed. I think it's fascinating whether, you know, Walker said that off the cuff or whether that was written into his speech, probably more likely, we're trying to report that out right now.

Donald Trump's influence on races across the country, he's been a huge weight, but it has been an anchor down on all of these candidates. And this was a huge wake up call to Republicans. I'm hearing from Republicans all night long, this is it. This is the final straw, it's time to move on. We need to turn the page. And these are people from Iowa to Georgia, and right here in Washington D.C. saying that we're tired of losing.

Trump was not charged in a legal scheme, but prosecutors told the jury that he explicitly sanctioned some of the tax fraud. The guilty verdict tarnishes the real-estate company he built from the ground up, and comes as Trump is embarking on a second run for the Republican nomination for president in 2024. Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg said the verdict proved that, in Manhattan, there is one standard of justice. Over the seven-week trial, the jury heard testimony from Trump's one- time right-hand man, the company's former chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg. Weisselberg, who was on paid leave, pleaded guilty to the tax fraud scheme, and in exchange for a lighter prison sentence, he agreed to testify at the trial. Weisselberg testified that he and others received off-the-books compensation in the form of perks, apartments, luxury car leases and, for him, private school tuition for his grandchildren. Prosecutors told the jury the scheme was a win-win for everyone, both the executives and the company, that all paid less in taxes. The Trump Organization could face a maximum of $1.6 million in fines when it's sentenced next month. Lawyers for the Trump company said that they will appeal.",

Of course, he just wants to be -- have a coronation in his nomination process. But that doesn't look it's going to be the case. What I believe Scott will tell you, that if there's 15 or 20 people onstage, Donald Trump is more likely, because he still controls anywhere from a quarter to a third of the Republican base. He's more likely to come out of that victorious. Because what the Republican Party hasn't done, and nobody has talked about this or mentioned this, is they haven't structurally changed their Republican nominating process. As long as states are winner-take-all states and someone can only get a quarter of the vote, all of these little things -- the January 6th indictments that may or may not come; the prosecution of the Trump businesses; his losses in Georgia -- all that means is that you're going to have all these one-percenters. And one-percenters, I mean Mike Rogers; I mean Mike Pence; I mean Mike Pompeo. I mean, all of these individuals who can't get more than 1 percent of the electorate, because they don't have a base, are going to all run.

She joins me from Atlanta. Tia, you have covered the ins and outs of this race for a very, very long time now. We knew this was going to be, really, the center of the battle for the Senate. Honestly, the fact that it was for the 51st seat and not the 50th, was in some ways, pretty remarkable here. But I will say, because all the sources that I've talked to, none of them were surprised by the fact that Warnock was able to pull this out. I'm interested to know what you are hearing from your sources and what they're telling you tonight about what this all means?",

      "sentences": "Yes, we knew that Warnock's team came into election day very confident. They felt they built up a big lead during early voting.And then, once the polls closed and results started trickling in, t became clear pretty quickly that there just weren't enough votes out there for Herschel Walker to win this race. The bigger counties -- DeKalb, Fulton, Cobb and Gwinnett -- as -- you know, because for a while, it was kind of 50/50. And Herschel Walker at times would be slightly ahead. But when we looked at the counties that still had the most counting to do, these are counties that were going for Warnock 80 percent, 75 percent. And so it just became clear that the math was not in Herschel Walker's favor. I think that the people who support Raphael Warnock, that's what they thought was going to happen. But, at the same time, they were cautiously optimistic. They said they didn't want to count their chickens before all the eggs had hatched, because anything could happen, if election day had been strong for Herschel Walker.",

      "sentences": "Sure. So Tia, let me ask you. You mentioned voting. And that, of course, in so many ways has become a central theme in our politics.Generally, whether it's the questioning of elections, election fraud, to questions about voter suppression, to in Georgia, in particular, that early voting was so important here. And one of the things that I've heard from Republicans is that they're very frustrated with the fact that their voters don't seem to trust early voting as part of the process and that it really, really hurt them. What does your reporting tell you about the impact on the results here from the willingness, or lack thereof, of Republicans to vote early?",

      "sentences": "Yes. I mean, I think that's truly something that the Republican Party is grappling with. But that's a problem that Republicans brought onto themselves. And you know, not all Republicans.But we know that, particularly in 2020, there became this shift to once prioritizing election day voting. There was all these criticism from Republicans, particularly allies of President Donald Trump, that began to criticize voting by mail; criticizing the use of drop boxes; criticizing different ways during the pandemic that a lot of municipalities made voting easier for everyone. And so, Republicans, in criticizing that, kind of turned off a lot of their voters to make it seem like some of those methods weren't solid, or weren't reliable. But what we're seeing now is that Republicans, now, aren't reaping the benefits the way Democrats are, again, about ways to vote that are very popular for people. I think, also, in Georgia, when Republicans said that that Saturday after Thanksgiving, it would not be available for early voting. And we know Warnock's campaign, the Democratic Party, sued and they won. Not only did that provide another day of early voting in counties that decided to opt in, but it become another rallying cry for Democrats. You know, Democrats were able to say, this is an example of Republicans making it harder to vote, suppressing the vote. This became something that we heard from Warnock on the campaign stage in the closing weeks of the runoff. And it was a powerful message. I think it paid off. In a lot of counties, Warnock performed better than he did in November.",
