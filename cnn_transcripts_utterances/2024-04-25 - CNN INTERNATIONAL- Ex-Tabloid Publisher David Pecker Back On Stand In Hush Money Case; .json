      "sentences": "It is 8I'm Jim Sciutto. Thanks so much for joining me. And let's get right to the news. We are following two major legal stories involving the former President Donald Trump. Today, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case over whether the former president may claim immunity from prosecution in his federal election subversion case. Trump has been charged with attempting to subvert the results of the 2020 presidential election. The decision by the nation's highest court could help determine whether he will face trial in the case before November's presidential election. We're going to walk you through the legal and political implications of this case in a moment. We do begin though in New York where Donald Trump is once again in a Manhattan courtroom for day three of testimony in his criminal hush money trial. At this hour, former tabloid publisher David Pecker is back on the stand. Trump, you may remember, is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in what prosecutors say was an attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election by covering up a looming sex scandal involving the president. CNN's Jessica Schneider is following the Manhattan trial. She joins me now. Jessica, David Pecker on the stand now, notably saying that he was discussing the Karen McDougal case, of course, another alleged affair with the former president, with White House staff at the time. Tell us the significance of that.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. And at one point, he was even invited to the White House summer of 2017, just a few months after Donald Trump took office, he went to the White House, brought some staffers with him and enjoyed, you know, being at the president's -- in the president's company. So, I mean, this just goes to the very close relationship that they had and the fact that David Pecker really seemed to want to do anything he could to help Donald Trump out.Now, David Pecker, you know, this is third day of testimony. He's testified already total for more than five hours. What's been crucial about this afternoon's testimony is he has finally launched into the Stormy Daniels saga, that is at the heart of this case. We've already heard from him on those payouts to Karen McDougal and the Trump Tower doorman. Those, however, are not part of this case, but they just went to the pattern of the payoffs. But Pecker did testify that when word got to him that Stormy Daniels wanted to go public with her story, David Pecker saying, you know, he drew the line. He said, I am not a bank and he refused to be the one to pay her off after making those two previous payoffs. So what he did in the Stormy Daniels case is he said he told us editor in chief Dylan Howard to get in touch with Michael Cohen, alert them about this possible story, and Pecker really stressed, he did not want AMI involved in this story in particularly because it involved a porn star. So that's the testimony we're hearing right now from David Pecker. He's also given some crucial testimony about Trump's concerns related to these payoffs, Pecker did say that Trump really was primarily concerned about how all of these allegations could affect his campaign if they were made public as a opposed to, you know, in 2016, 2017, worrying about shielding his family and that could be crucial playing into the prosecutions case that Trump, in fact, was violating campaign finance roles by paying off people by proxy to protect his election chances. So, Jim, there's all this testimony is still happening and, of course, still waiting lets see what happens with that gag order ruling. Judge Merchan, this afternoon said he'll now consider for more instances that prosecutors say Trump violated the gag order with. So now were up to about 14 instances. We've been waiting on this gag order ruling for a few days, so it's possible. Judge Merchan could maybe issue something today when core concludes around 4:30.",

This deals with the prosecution of a former president and current candidate for president, also broad questions about immunity for all presidents going forward. I want to play an exchange here between justice, Amy Coney Barrett and lawyer for the president and the court about what is a crucial question now it seems.

The problem is that most of the things that he did as a president really aren't the substance of any of the charges. They are evidenced showing motive, intent, and knowledge, what we call for 404B evidence to establish that he wasn't making a mistake. He knew exactly what he was doing. And these things were supposed to aid his private actions. So he hasn't been charged with doing anything as a public official. All of the accident they're talking about in the indictment deal with something in his private matters relating to him being elected or not elected during the 2020 election. So I'm not sure exactly what they're going to do. My concern is that they send it back down to Judge Chutkan who is the trial lawyer and says you have to hold a hearing and make a determination on all of this. And if she makes a determination, that becomes appealable, and now, all of a sudden, we're two years down the pike and we still haven't brought this case to trial.",

But -- but the nature of the questions. And as much as Michael Dreeben who Samuel Alito was addressing, that comment, you just heard from Justice Alito as much as he tried to turn the conversation toward what happened in the immediate days after the November 2020 election, leading up to the attack on the Capitol on January 6, 2021, Justice Alito and some of the other ones just weren't having that. What they -- what they were focused on is sort of retribution by one president to another, potentially overzealous prosecutors who would target a president.And I would say just bottom-line, Jim, takeaways, they're not going to rule that there is absolute immunity in every, every situation, but that won't matter for Donald Trump.

In other words, creating a kind of barrier around the president that as far as I can tell, and I don't cover it as closely as you, but, but smarter people than myself have noted, the constitution doesn't grant presidents this kind of immunity for these kinds of acts that were discussed today.",

And that's -- I think that I went into it thinking that they would at least buy that argument.And in the end, Jim, they'll probably at least give that -- give that some, some weight but the key thing here, as they were looking at the present -- the constitutional framework is they were buying a lot of what John Sauer, the lawyer representing Donald Trump was saying about protecting the precedent. Now, separation of powers first, the concept in the Constitution can cut both ways. Obviously, as I said, traditionally, it has not precluded one branch holding a former president criminally liable for wrongdoing in office. But -- but they -- the justices, as evidenced by the clip you just ran of Justice Alito, were just really concerned about overreach and about presidents been subjected to just real unfairness after leaving office, and then it kind of back-and-forth going forward, one president then attacking another president.

Then once the trial court makes that determination, there's probably going to be another fight about whether the special counsel and federal government are able to introduce evidence of official acts that might themselves be entitled to immunity and couldn't be the basis of criminal liability, but could potentially be evidenced relevant to establishing Donald Trumps motive or his intent behind this scheme.And so, that's going to be a separate site and adding all of those questions and that additional process is going to take some time and its going to add delay and thereby decrease the odds of any pre- election trial on the election interference charges.",

What do you think of that defense as it relates to the larger argument?",

He wasn't involved in any of that, but he does know that that story that Mr. Trump wanted to hide it. He does know as it relates to Ms. McDougal, that in fact, he put out money to kind of kill the story and he knew from his conversations directly with the president and former president that, in fact, he needed to bury it because it would hurt the election and it would hurt him personally, but it would hurt the election and it would hurt what would happen is it related to his presidency. So he understood that and that's exactly why he did what he did, to help the former president become president. And so far, they haven't addressed any of those conversations.",

And what they're starting off with is just kind of talking about the pattern and practice of David Pecker's publishing business, in particular as it relates to \"National Enquirer\".And my sense of it as we're seeing these notes coming out of the courtroom is that there really trying to portray David Pecker and his business as kind of a sleazy operation. I mean, they're saying that, you know, you regularly killed stories. You publish stories about Donald Trump because they were popular and it was good for business and you really -- especially during \"The Apprentice\" years when Donald Trump really was a celebrity before he turned politician, this was a good thing you did for business. So we're hearing them lay the groundwork. And, of course, they want a question -- they want jurors to question the credibility of this witness. We've seen prosecutors over about five plus hours of direct testimony, try to make Pecker a credible witness, have him talk about this scheme to catch and kill, how they were doing it all for the benefit of Trumps campaign. Now, defense attorneys are coming in to really try to attack the credibility of David Pecker and casts some question as to what his motives were and talk about the fact that this was a business and he was a business guy and he was doing it for business and maybe not for necessarily all for the goodwill of Donald Trump. So, really just launching into the beginning of cross examination now, Jim. We're expecting court to go until about 4:30. But, yeah, probably some tough questions that will come up from defense attorneys as they try to really lay question in the jurors minds about who David is and really what he was trying to accomplish.",

We have four more instances of him violating it.The judge said, okay, I'm going to take those four more for instance, instances into consideration. Notably, Jim, the judge said that about an hour and a half ago that he'd take those for more instances that prosecutors have pointed to into consideration. So we could get a ruling from the judge before the end of business day or, you know, he's still might consider those and come back tomorrow. So its been a question as to whether -- whether and when, or we know he will, but when the judge will actually issue this ruling concerning the gag order, it's likely he'll fine Donald Trump's something, you know, as sort of this initial, you better watch out and stopped speaking out like you have been.",

There's going to have to be some protections for their actions, but I think it needs to be a case-by- case basis.

Well, we will all see what the court decides, but it certainly felt like and I think there were a number of legal analysts who were saying to them it felt like the conversation was such that it was likely that there wouldn't be a ruling in the January 6 case prior to the election in November, which, of course, has been Donald Trump's legal and political strategy around this case from the outset.

But I do give them some credit. They're taking small opportunities. Of course, he went to a construction site this morning to talk to union workers.

I think he has been direct, again, about condemning both antisemitism and Islamophobia. And he's also talked about the right of young people and people across the country to protest peacefully. So I do think this will be an element. And again, any issue that is roiling the Democratic base is one that the Biden campaign should, should focus on and be aware of.
