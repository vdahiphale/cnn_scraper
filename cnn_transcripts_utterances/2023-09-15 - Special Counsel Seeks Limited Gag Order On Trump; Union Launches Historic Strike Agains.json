The special counsel's team claiming the former president's public statements have already led to witness harassment.Also tonight, a ground breaking strike against major U.S. automakers is now under way. For the first time in history all three companies are facing a union walkout. The strike is targeted for now but could expand dramatically in the coming days if workers demands aren't met. And CNN is now on the ground in Libya where thousands are dead and thousands more are mission after a catastrophic flooding. This hour, we'll bring you a live update from the disaster zone. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. Let's get to the breaking news and straight to new development in the special counsel case against Donald Trump, a new court filing revealing apparent witness harassment directly resulting from the president's public statements. CNN's Justice Correspondent Jessica Schneider is digging into this new document for all of us. Jessica, federal prosecutors are say, they need to judge to put a limit on what Trump can say about this case. What's the latest?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Wolf. The special counsel's team here in this long motion, they are laying out all of these reasons why they want the judge to now step in immediately and order Donald Trump from -- stop him from making statements online and in person, any statements that could end up intimidating witnesses, court officials as well or even the jury pool.Now, earlier today the special counsel actually revealed that numerous witnesses have in fact faced threats and intimidation because of statements from Donald Trump. So, now, they are asking in this motion, they are asking the judge to do something official about Trump's words. So, they are laying it out this way. They are saying the defendant's repeated inflammatory public statements regarding the District of Columbia, the court, prosecutors and potential witnesses are substantially likely to materially prejudice the jury pool, create fear among potential jurors and result in threats or harassment to individuals he singles out. Put simply, those involved in the criminal justice process who read and hear the defendant's disparaging and inflammatory messages from court personnel to prosecutors to witnesses to potential jurors may reasonably fear that they could be the next targets of the defendant's attacks. And because of that the special counsel now wants the judge to issue an order officially restricting Trump from making certain comments and the special counsel, they laid out a number of social media posts and comments from Trump over recent weeks that have not only targeted the special counsel, Jack Smith, but also former Vice President Mike Pence, even a prosecutor on the special counsel's team. What's interesting here is that Judge Chutkan, she already ordered Trump to stop from making disparaging comments. She did that at the arraignment. But, obviously, Trump has not listened. He's continued to post. So, now, the special counsel wants the judge here to issue an official order in writing prohibiting Trump from naming witnesses, making statements about them, really making any statements about anyone that are disparaging or intimidating. So, Wolf. This is really a significant move and request from the special counsel's team here, and even though the judge has warned Trump once at his arraignment, this is the team, the special counsel's team asking the judge to make this order official, iron clad, and, really, if she were to do this and issue this order and Trump violated it, there could be serious legal repercussions.

In the motion, they referred to the kind of the overarching allegations that the president willfully and knowingly lied about the election for the purpose of altering the result.And they are saying that's exactly he's doing here. He is willfully, knowingly lying about the judge, about witnesses, about the process and the court system in an effort to kind of put his thumb on the scale, to prejudice the jury pool, to intimidate witnesses. And I agree with Jennifer that this is an important next step. It is by no means a gag order. This is not -- that's not what's under consideration here, but this is elevating the warning citing a specific local court rule and presenting it to him, if she passes it, if she does it and I think she will, he's going to be officially on notice. And then the next instances, which I'm sure will come, will result in some real consequences.",

I think, as Jennifer was saying, this is laying a foundation for the judge to rely upon, and, therefore, laying a foundation for potential charges to be brought if he violates it.I think the difficulty here is actually something raised by Andrew, which is it does very much mirror the charges themselves. And, therefore, when you get into the nitty-gritty of how do you interpret what's harassment or intimidation, Trump's defense counsel will have a strong argument that he's just proclaiming his innocence about the charges because they are so closely related to each other. So, it will put the judge in a difficult conundrum, but the prosecutors are laying the foundation for this correct approach. And, ultimately, for the defense council for Trump, they have to be asking themselves too, are they listening too much playing to their client at the risk of actually exposing their client to further charges.",

I think another potential consequence if he violates -- if this becomes an order and he violates it would be imposing a gag order on his ability to talk about the case at all.Now, it's very controversial, and I should note that the defense, Trump's defense has really made his first amendment rights, kind of front and center in their defense to this underlying case. They claim that the entire prosecution is unfairly targeting him for his exercise of his First Amendment rights. So, any steps that they take in that direction, a gag order or consequences as a result of his speech are going to provoke even more kind of outrage claims from Trump and his supporters that this is all part of First Amendment persecution.

So, you know, I think they were kind of pretty pointed in using that example. But that's exactly what they have to say, that this defendant has again and again said things that are intimidating to witnesses, disparaging to people in the process. He's trying to taint the jury pool and the integrity of the proceedings as well as the safety of people involved has to mean that he has to stop it. And this is the first step in making that happened. I agree with Alice, you know, he may not do it, but the judge then will have tools at her disposal if she chooses to employ them.

This is a Stellantis plant where, usually, they would be making more than 1,000 Jeeps every day. But not right now. That process is frozen. And this is just one of three factories that are part of this tactical strike. There's this, there is a Ford plant in Michigan as well as a General Motors plant in Missouri. But what we are likely to see in the coming days, what's really already happening, is additional factories that have to stop their own operation or even lay off workers because they don't have the materials they need or they have nowhere to send their parts. But, look, the union stands by what they are doing, and we heard from the union president, Shawn Fain, who said that it's possible they will add additional factories to the strike.

I think about my own hometown of Flint, the UAW sat down in the factories in 1936, and in 1937 they got that firs UAW contract. Those were tough times, and it took a while, it took 44 days. But what happened after that was tremendous growth in the middle class. And that's what the UAW is fighting for. That's what the men and women of the UAW are out there carrying picket signs for.

Well, as you seeing the information that we've released until now in terms our understanding of the initial negotiations for some of the arms that have already been provided as well as the White House release a few weeks ago about the upcoming summit, there's efforts under way to follow these actions.I can't give any more details that, but certainly, too, for both of these countries to maximize the political and diplomatic benefits of this interaction there's going to have to be more of a public dimension to this going forward. Otherwise this just ends up as a one- off highly symbolic with some dark room missile deals, weapons deals that could have taken place in the background anyway, so it's almost a secondary importance at this point to kind of the strategic message that these two sides are trying to send.",

It's now at 97 because the anthropologists have been able to do a more thorough analysis. So 97 people have passed away, and we have report of 31 who are still unaccounted for.

That will help us heal. I have 7,415 people in hotels right now, which over the next two weeks will be transferring themselves and transitioning to long-term rentals. That's a big lift. We were able in two weeks to get everybody out of shelters and into hotels. And in another two weeks most of those people will be in long-term rentals. But, look, we have now 15,000 people who are unemployed on Maui alone as a result of the fires.

Jomana, what are you seeing where you are? JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (via telephone):  Well, Wolf, we spent the day here in Derna out on the streets. And I can tell you that our team has covered wars and natural disasters, has never seen anything like this before. I mean, we know what caused the catastrophic flooding here where two dams burst and sent violent currents through the city. And seeing what it has done is truly shocking and just heartbreaking. It was so powerful and devastating that pretty much destroyed everything in its path. And we're talking about entire neighborhoods that have been erased -- buildings, infrastructure, cars, homes that were swept into the Mediterranean Sea. And then you have thousands of people, more than 5,000 estimated dead right now, 10,000 unaccounted for. You've got entire families that were killed. And nearly a week since this happened and we still have bodies that are washing up back on the shore. And, you know, while we're walking around today, we met survivors, people who really feel traumatized by what they survived, and what they witnessed. People were grabbing their children in the middle of the night when this happened at 2:13 in the morning and just running from floor to floor to try and escape a wave that was more than 20 feet high. The water kept rising from one floor to the next. One man that we spoke to said that they ended up on top of tanks on the roof. It is just unimaginable. And when we speak with Libyans here, everyone here is in a state of shock. They dealt with loss and death, but this is different. Nothing could've prepared them for a catastrophic event like this one.",
