In just a few minutes, the House Rules Committee is expected to convene they will discuss this bill and we expect that there could be some problems among conservatives on that committee, both Chip Roy as well as Ralph Norman have suggested that they could vote against it. However, there's another conservative who could be a key and important vote, that's Thomas Massie. He said earlier today that he was not going to publicly say how he was voting, but in previous comments from just a few months ago, he did note that if the majority of his conference was supportive of something, he wouldn't necessarily stop it in the House Rules Committee. So when I asked Kevin McCarthy just a few minutes ago, if he was confident he was going to have the Republican votes he needed in that committee, he told me yes as specifically how Thomas Massie was going to vote. He said, \"Ask Thomas.\" I also asked McCarthy, more about if he feels like his speakership is going to be threatened if he puts this bill on the House floor tomorrow. He told me: \"You guys asked me all the time. I'm still standing.\" Boris.",
