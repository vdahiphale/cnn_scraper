Israel is also set to release more Palestinian prisoners.The Israel-Hamas truce is now in its fifth day and should last until at least Thursday. But this morning, we're hearing reports, of course, of fighting on both sides. Now, so far, 51 Israeli citizens and 18 foreign nationals have been released by Hamas since the pause began on Friday. We're told the families of the hostages set to be free today have already been notified. The youngest known hostages, sadly, not on today's release list. It is believed ten-year-old Kfir Bebas and his family are not being held by Hamas, complicating the efforts to get that family out to safety.",

It takes a little bit of time before they're in Egypt and then back here finally on Israeli soil again, taken to hospitals, reunited with their families. We have not seen any of that activity yet on day five of this hostage release, though we are still expecting it to go forward. Sara, you pointed out earlier those clashes that have been happening in Gaza between Israel and Hamas. So far, we don't have any indications that that has derailed this deal, even though they are accusing each other, violating the terms of the agreement, which is no fighting happening in Gaza at this time. So, we are watching that closely. But also this trip by the CIA director to Doha right now, he is meeting with Qatari officials, Egyptian officials, having these ongoing discussions. And what the U.S. very clearly wants to see here is an expanded deal, not just these two days that we're seeing for more women and children to get out, but they are also hoping to negotiate for men to get out, for IDF soldiers to get out, both men and women. And when you talk to officials here in Israel, they'll openly acknowledge that that is a much higher price that they believe they would have to pay than what they have done so far for the women and children, which is 30 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for every one Israeli hostage who makes it back here at home. That is another part of the deal. It is continuing as a part of this two-day extension. And so I think right now everyone is waiting to see if those efforts by the CIA director will be successful, but also waiting to see who is going to be on this list of hostages released today, because we do know the youngest, a ten-month-old baby who was taken with his entire family into Gaza is not expected to be on that list. He's not even believed to being held by Hamas, but instead is being held by another terrorist group. We're tracking all of this with Oren Liebermann, who is also here in Tel Aviv. And, Oren, we're also learning news from the IDF about another hostage who has been found killed. Do we know if this person was killed while they were in Gaza? Were they killed before they were taken there? Do we have any details on that front?",

And that's a name or at least a last name we've heard before that's because his sister, Doron Katz, and her children, were some of the first to come out on the first day of the agreement as Hamas released the first group of Israeli women and children. They have now learned the horrible news that Ravid Katz died in Gaza, the IDF confirming that just a short while ago.That is the third Israeli we now know of, according to the Israeli military, to have died in Gaza. The first was 19-year-old Corporal Noa Marciano found not far from the Shifa Hospital, some 50 meters, according to the Israeli military. The second is 65-year-old Yehudit Weiss, a grandmother, also found in the vicinity of the Shifa Hospital uh, according to the Israeli military. So, the effort continues. It has been a key question what is the condition of the hostages held by Hamas. And as we've just learned more definitively held by other groups, but that's a question that nobody has been able to answer conclusively, not the Israelis, not the U.S., and, critically, not the Qataris. So, this is something will be watching very closely. Israel says they tried to operate in such a way as to not in danger the hostages held in Gaza but that is, of course, an incredibly difficult objective to carry out because Israel has never had a very good indication of where they are. So, this is unfortunately a horrible aspect of all this that we will keep an eye on.",

They want it to include these IDF men and women soldiers as well.But I think there's a real sense of almost desperation among the hostage families who are not only desperate to get their loved ones' homes but are looking at this potential window here. They know that this truce has been extended by two days, but they also know that Israeli officials are making pretty clear if this truce goes south, or if it ends abruptly, or if it ends even after the two days, it's very clear that Israel is going to immediately begin its military campaign in Gaza, which could be even more expanded than what we have been watching for the last several weeks.",

And starting today, when it comes to Gaza and what we're seeing there, as it's been very quiet with no fighting, the first of three U.S. military flights that is carrying critical humanitarian aid for Gaza is going to land in Egypt, where it will stop there before being taken into Gaza. We're told that on these flights, medical supplies, food, winter weather gear, because senior administration officials will say, obviously, the winter is coming. It is going to be incredibly rainy there in Gaza. And once that aid has arrived in Gaza, we are told the United Nations will be in charge of distributing it. This delivery, we are told, is separate from this ongoing truce that has just been extended for two days. The U.S. says it will continue, even if that truce is disrupted, as Oren was noting there, it's incredibly fragile. The question, of course, is if they can still successfully get it in as easily when there is fighting that is resumed. CNN's Arlette Saenz is tracking all of this from the White House. Arlette, what are we learning about, just how confident U.S. officials are that, one, this aid is even coming close to being enough to what people need on the ground, and, two, how they could ensure that it would keep going into Gaza if Israel does begin its military campaign again?",

And they are trying in part to ease some of that by sending in this new round of humanitarian aid in.As you mentioned, the first of three military planes carrying this added aid will be heading into Egypt today. At that point, it will be distributed by the U.N. and really use to replenish some of the supplies and stock that have started to winnow down as this fight continues. Now, this latest shipment is expected to include medical supplies, food, winter gear. As you noted, this is a cold and rainy season in Gaza. So, they want to ensure that they're able to get that type of material to the civilians there. But it does come as there has been an increase in aid going into Gaza since this truce between Hamas and Israel had started. There are roughly 800 trucks of humanitarian aid that have gone into Gaza. President Biden himself has pointed to one of the successful portions of this truce being the fact that they're not only able to get hostages out but also get that humanitarian aid. So, the administration trying to take one more step at this time to help those civilians in Gaza with this aid.",

Thank you so much, Kaitlan, and thank you also to Arlette.CIA Director Bill Burns, as you heard, is back in Qatar, pushing for a broader hostage deal, this one to include men and soldiers, according to multiple sources to CNN. Burns continues to play a key role in the negotiations. Today, he will meet with his Qatari, Israeli and Egyptian counterparts. I am joined now by former CIA Operative Bob Baer. Thank you so much for being with us. It's been a minute since I've gotten to talk to you. I'm happy to see your face. First off, can you give us some sense? How significant is it that the director of the CIA is once again back in Qatar, talking through negotiations with the Qataris, the Egyptians, the Israelis, and through them, Hamas? Can you give us a sense of just the importance of him being there?",

He's also very discreet, and CIA communications are very secure. So, any sensitive discussions the president knows will be held very tightly. So, that's why Burns is there.But what Burns really would love to do, and I'm speculating here, is a permanent ceasefire. Because right now, the Israelis are intent on resuming the war, going south, and there is no such thing as precision strikes in Gaza. It's just not possible. It's too built up. Israeli intelligence isn't good enough. So, we're really at a threshold here. Will this war expand? Will expand through the Middle East?

So, getting rid of it, I don't even know how you would do that, how you would define getting rid of it. But I can tell you right now is the Israelis politically, and for their survival, in a way, need to get rid of Sinwar, the political head, and Mohammed Deif, the military leader. And who knows where they are? They're probably underground. They're moving all the time, every 24 hours. So, the Israelis -- we're talking about, again, going back, they have to resume this war.",

The reason why is just the incredible amount of money that Americans for Prosperity has at its disposal and has shown that it will use.This is the very first time they've ever gotten involved in a presidential primary, in the GOP presidential primary, and they said they had to. They knew and had said that they would likely bypass former President Trump, because in their explanation of this endorsement of Nikki Haley today, one of their executives saying that they believed that the GOP continues to nominate what they called bad candidates and that Americans are rejecting them. That's why they are throwing their support behind the former South Carolina governor, Nikki Haley, who they believe could win in a general election. So, what does their support mean? This is why this is such a big deal. It means probably millions and millions and millions of dollars in ads both in the early states and also the Super Tuesday states. It means access to their data to get to voters. It means their vast network of conservative activists all acting on her behalf. So, this is a huge boost to Nikki Haley as she really looks to fend off Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor, as the Trump alternative in this race. And just a scene set for everybody. Remember, the former president continues to really lead this field in all of the polling, both nationally and in the early states. And so what we have seen is who will be that Trump alternative. That's what so many of these other people in the field have tried to become. Ron DeSantis has really pitched himself as the person who can beat Donald Trump and win in a general election. Nikki Haley has done the same thing. And so in all of this polling and also on the ground, we're hearing from voters who are trying to sort through who is the best alternative and who can win. That's the thing that they really keep looking to. And so this endorsement could potentially reshape a lot of dynamics within this race as we get ever closer to January 15th. Of course, Kate, that's the Iowa caucuses. It kicks off the primary season voting.",
