And each kind of has their little tagline that they've said. I think Haley says that chaos follows him. DeSantis has said that, you know, he's going to be a better implementer of Trump's agenda. That said, the two of them haven't going after each other because I think they know that, two can go in.Only one can be second place in Iowa because former president just has such a lead there.

And you can really see this in how he talks about abortion, which is of course kind of the classic issue for the conservative Christian voters that typically, you know, pick candidates in Iowa. I want to show you a little bit of what DeSantis had to say, criticizing both Trump and Nikki Haley on abortion last night in a Fox News Town Hall. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RON DESANTIS, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He attacked pro-life legislation like the heartbeat bill here in Iowa and said it was a terrible, terrible thing. Now, that was not what he said when he was president. She has chastised pro-lifers saying, you know, you shouldn't be talking about putting women in prison. Nobody's talking about that. I've not met a single pro-lifer that has ever talked about that. That is a trope that the left in the media will use, and yet she's indulged that. She's indulged some of these other tropes.

I mean, that is what he's trying to do, what he can to make that happen.And you're right, Haley and the former president to an extent are looking at the map. They're looking at how abortion has played both in the midterms and in these ballot initiatives where it was literally on the ballot. The abortion rights groups really have a perfect record on those ballot initiatives. And that when people actually go and vote on this issue. They tend to side with abortion rights just more broadly. So that's -- they're making a political calculation. And so as Ron DeSantis here, by just going all in and trying to come out of Iowa with that second-place trophy.

The Huskers beating a top ranked team for the first time since 1982.And as you can see, the students having a blast there rushing the court as were the students in AMES, The Cyclones, Milan Momcilovic, an incredible fadeaway jumper here in the final minute. Iowa State taken down second ranked Houston, handing the Cougars their first loss of the season. All right, in the NBA, the Miami Heat, inking Erik Spoelstra to the richest coaching deal in American sports history. Spoelstra's extension, according to ESPN, is for eight years and worth more than $120 million. Spoelstra has been the Heat's coach since 2008, leading the team to two NBA titles and six Eastern Conference crowns. All right. Now, on the court, the Lakers were hosting the Raptors last night. Under 30 seconds to go, RJ Barrett here called for a charge that wiped away a game time three for Toronto. The Lakers shot 23 free throws in the fourth quarter and held on to win this one, 132 to 131 after the game. Raptors head coach Darko Rajakovic was furious with the Raps. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Scottie Barnes is going to be all-star. He's going to be the face of this league. And what's happening over here during whole season, I've been calling the back.
