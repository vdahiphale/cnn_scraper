U.S. special counsel Jack Smith is pushing back against Donald Trump's claims of presidential immunity amid his 2020 election interference case. Smith's claims are in a new court filing on Saturday. It says that Trump's sweeping assertion, quote, threatens to license presidents to commit crimes to remain in office. Smith also made an unusual request for the appeals court to implement its ruling quickly. That could fast track the case ahead of the 2024 election. CNN's Zachary Cohen has more from Washington.

And really using it to remind Americans of the continued war on the ground there, saying that Russian President Vladimir Putin's intentions have not changed in the two years since this war broke out.And he's also using this as a moment to call on Congress to pass new assistance for Ukraine and really telling lawmakers that the defensive systems that have been passed already, the Patriot missile batteries, other defensive systems, have saved lives on the ground there, including just this week, but if those systems aren't provided in the future, the Ukrainians will essential be left defenseless. In a statement, the president saying: Unless Congress takes urgent action in the New Year, we will not be able to continue sending the weapons and vital air defense systems Ukraine needs. We cannot let our allies and partners down. History will judge harshly those who fail to answer freedom's call. But remember, this new funding for Ukraine is tied up in this debate back in Washington between Democrats and Republicans over immigration, over tightening the rules at the border. And it remains to be seen whether this new air assault will do anything to change the minds of skeptical Republicans, who at the end of the day really just don't support new funding for Ukraine. They don't believe that it is in America's best interests. Just this last week, the White House said that it had approved the final amount of money that was left in the existing authorization, $250 million in assistance to Ukraine, but essentially saying that that was the bottom of the barrel, that no new funding would be going forward, unless it was passed by Congress. So President Biden really hoping to use this moment to convince these lawmakers that that assistance is necessary going forward. And as he returns to Washington next week, that will certainly be at the top of his agenda, as the war in Ukraine continues to rage on. Kevin Liptak, CNN, traveling with the president in St. Croix.

So, that leaves you with some pretty quiet conditions as you're headed out for your new year's in the evening. Not too much rain and snow, pretty much really nationwide. Temperatures kind of seasonal, a little bit on the chilly side going for a temperature at 32 degrees in Minneapolis and 30s down to St. Louis.

Maybe a flake or two could fly, but for the most part, looking at dry conditions, with a little bit of a breeze, you'll find those wind chills in the middle 30s. You'll definitely want to bundle up. But upper 30s is kind of seasonal, kind of right where those temperatures usually are for this time of year. When you look at the records, the warmest records for that midnight ball drop in New York City, all of those records, are in the middle 50s. We actually hit one, the third warmest on record coming into this year, 2023, with that temperature of 54 degrees. 2022 was also top five for record warm. Back in 2018, we were rivaling one of the coldest ball drops on record. We just missed it, second spot, 9 degrees. That was set back in 2018.

And his alternative wellness brand, he has a net worth of $100 million. So that's just one example.And someone in the -- in Australia has been peddling the same misinformation and using it to sell his books and all sorts of things. And in South Africa, we've had wellness doctors who usually do weight loss and aesthetics, and have nothing to do with public health or vaccines or infectious diseases, and they've pivoted to influencing over vaccines and COVID to sell their own products, their own detox protocols.

Authorities saying, yes, they may be beautiful, but they are also extremely dangerous. You're seeing closures when it comes to the piers, all up and down the California coast, not just here in Manhattan Beach. According to the National Weather Service, we expected waves between 15 and 20 feet in the central coast of California. And then here in Manhattan Beach, where I am, in Los Angeles County in Santa Barbara County and Ventura County, waves of 10 to 15 feet. Ventura County was the hardest hit. That's where we saw those dramatic videos of these monster waves and people running from the ocean. Unfortunately, in Ventura County, at least eight people were taken to the hospital because of this. That's where we saw some of the road closures and some of the evacuations. Authorities saying that there is still the risk of flooding, especially in those areas that normally flood, in the lower areas. So, again, people being told to be extremely careful, to never turn their back to the ocean. I know I'm doing that now, but I do have a team just ready to tell me, in case we need to make a run for it. Hopefully, that is not the case. But, again, authorities telling people to continue to be very careful and a lot of the closures you're going to see them through Sunday. Camila Bernal, CNN, Los Angeles. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The loss means that the Lions are officially out of the running for the number one seed in the NFC and the first-round buy. For the Cowboys, the win means they still have a shot at winning their division and getting a home playoff game. The stakes are very, very high here. Here's how expected. I'm going to walk you through this. Detroit was down by seven with under 30 seconds to go when Jared Goff finds Amon- Ra St. Brown who dives into the end zone for the touchdown. Now, rather than kick it and tie it up, the Lions decided to go for two and the win, and they pull out a trick play that's Goff to offensive lineman Taylor Decker, who comes down with it, but hold on, but there's a flag on Decker for ineligible man down field. So, the rule is that an offensive lineman must go to the referee before the play if they want to report as an eligible receiver. The ref said that Decker did not and instead it was number 70, Dan Skipper, even though on the replay it looks like it was Decker going up to Allen. They replayed the down, Detroit goes for it again, no good, but now Dallas is called for a penalty. So we do it again. Detroit going for 2, and Goff just missing a wide open James Mitchell. Cowboys win 20-19. Campbell still really upset after the game. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
