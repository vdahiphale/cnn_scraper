And this is important inside Russia. It's important for those Russians who are inside other countries today because Putin's propaganda is trying to convince including Western public opinion that all Russians are in favor of war.",

This 80 is -- the reason is clear. Putin has taken an unprecedentedly irresponsible, immoral decision to invade Ukraine. Now he has to show that this decision is supported by the majority that is larger than ever, which is a way to redistribute, to share the responsibility for this decision with the whole of the country.",

And in all other groups, there are much less, like 60, 50, and then the group younger than 30, it's less than 20 percent. But this support, at least to interpret this result of 85 percent as a support for the war of 85 percent of population, it's technically impossible even taking into account the official numbers, the officials of theology. Now go to the voting abroad, this unprecedented numbers of people who voted abroad that first show us how many Russians have moved outside of Russia since the beginning of the war. And then what the result would be without the reach of this political, technological, administrative mobilization and resource that exists inside Russia and without the reach of Russian propaganda, at least the restricted reach of Russian propaganda.

The state becomes more and more the single employer in many regions, in many areas of the economy. So it has this resource to pressure people to go and vote and even to show how they have voted.Because we see how the bosses of the companies, of the enterprises were asking people to show them how they did vote electronically or to make a photo of their ballot and to send to them, which is absolutely illegal even by Russian law, but it happened in unprecedented numbers of cases right now. That's one reason. And another reason that the whole system, the governors, the mayors, the heads of the state-run companies were keen -- were certain involved in a sort of competition to show the large support because they knew that the Kremlin and the leader want to show that this, as I said, unprecedented, risky, immoral and destructive decision to go to the war with Ukraine is supported to comfort the consciousness of the leader.",

And like just about every other humanitarian veteran that's worked in Gaza recently or visited Gaza recently, I would say there are aspects of this crisis that are amongst the worst I've ever seen. So the levels of displacement -- I was only in Rafah, where, as you know, there's been a million people now displaced.I've never seen overcrowding like that, never seen so many people squeezed into such a small area with appalling sanitation, very limited access to food. You know, and the shelter itself is of very poor quality, and there's been a lot of rains and flooding of those settlements. So that is a crisis in and of itself, the level of displacement, the lack of sanitation, the associated disease outbreaks now of hepatitis and diarrhea. Of course, limited access to aid. And we've already talked about the food deficit. Now, I was looking at some of the data this morning. Now, we usually don't like to talk about the number of trucks going into Gaza as an appropriate metric, but it's one of the best that we have. And we say that we need around 500 trucks going into Gaza per day. Since the start of the crisis, we're at an average of 113. So that gives you a sense of the massive deficit of assistance going in as these needs continue to soar.",

But again, there's no areas prepared to receive them. Where is the shelter coming from? I mean, most of the shelter there is makeshift. It's made from plastic sheeting and, you know, bits of wood and timber that people have been able to bring together.People aren't in big, tented camps. Let's be clear. This is not like, you know, a managed refugee crisis. So where do they go? What's the source of shelter? How does the aid then get to them? The other big concern, of course, for us on healthcare, you know, we've seen this massive degradation of the health system. Of the 36 hospitals, only 13 of them are functioning and they're only partially functioning. So when we were in Rafah, I visited two hospitals, El-Najar Hospital, which is normally a 65-bed facility. It has 300 patients right now. And another field hospital, very well run by International Medical Corps, the U.S. NGO, which now has 150 beds. If that military offensive occurs, both of those hospitals are going to have to relocate. Now, where do they move? This is the first one, El-Najar, it's a fixed facility. They're looking at options for perhaps moving into some other makeshift facility further west or north. International Medical Corps will have to pack up its hospital and move entirely. That'll take days. So this, you know, further limiting access to medical care during the time of a military offensive when we would expect high levels of trauma and injury as well. So it's a beyond catastrophic situation.",
