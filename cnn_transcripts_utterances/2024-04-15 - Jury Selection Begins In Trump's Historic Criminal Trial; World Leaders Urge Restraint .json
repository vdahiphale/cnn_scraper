I'm Jim Sciutto in New York, outside Manhattan courthouse where right now former U.S. President Donald Trump, current GOP nominee for president in 2024, is sitting in a courtroom as the first jurors are brought in for questioning, some 100 this afternoon, perhaps several hundred over the next several days as defense attorneys and prosecutors asked them questions to ultimately arrive at the pool of 18, 12 jurors, six alternates, who will sit in judgment of Trump on multiple counts.This is the first time a U.S. president has sat in a criminal trial. Our Katelyn Polantz has been covering the events this morning from Washington. And before that pool of 96 potential jurors walked into the courtroom. There are a number of questions before the judge, a final chance to delay the trial, questions about the exact questions that will be asked of jurors during the next several days. Katelyn, tell us what the most significant decisions were this morning as jury selection gets underway. KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER:  Well, most of what the judge was doing this morning, Jim, was sorting out exactly how and what can be said before these jurors whenever there are witnesses on the stand and evidence presented. So, the judge was working out specific details what could be discussed about alleged affairs that Donald Trump had outside of Stormy Daniels? And that payment made to her that forms the core of this business falsification of records case. There are alleged affairs that will be able to be discussed, alleged sexual assaults, though, that came out after the Access Hollywood tape in 2016 when Trump is running for president. That's not going to be able to be discussed. And that \"Access Hollywood\" tape itself, that's not going to be played to the jury in this trial. But there's a general idea that the prosecutors want to be able to put forth and bring out in their witness testimony when they put people like campaign staffer Hope Hicks on the stand, when Karen McDougal, someone else who alleged an affair with Donald Trump and was silenced from telling her story -- when those people are testifying, what prosecutors want to be able to do is show why Donald Trump may have wanted to silence them stories that could have been damaging to him and ultimately, Stormy Daniels whenever he was facing voters in 2016 teens. So a lot of that is what was being worked out this morning. Now though, we are into the meat of this, the judge has sworn in these 96 potential jurors. The first batch of that jury pool, about 25 minutes ago and has told them that they alone are the judges fact in this case, they are the people who will decide whether the former president of the United States is guilty or not guilty of the charges that he faces in this business records case, and they're going to start by asking those jurors questions to get more of a sense of who they are to make sure they can be fair and impartial.",

But there's another piece of this that prosecutors want to have shown to the jury, and that was what the \"National Enquirer\" was being used to do.There is a man, David Pecker, who's the former chairman of American Media Incorporated, the publisher of the \"National Enquirer\", he is someone who has been given immunity in this case. He had an agreement with prosecutors. He's very likely to testify and he would be able to speak about what's called a catch and kill scheme, when they were paying other people, other women, to silence their stories so that the National Enquirer would get rights to those stories and then bury them, not put them out there. At the same time, the judge is allowing and decided just this morning to do this. He is going to allow the \"National Enquirer\" stories on Trump's opponents that reprinted that to be a part of the trial. So you're going to get the whole portrait of what it looked like around 2016. What are the allegations and what was this publication, the \"National Enquirer\" that was friendly to Donald Trump, what were they doing at this time, either to put things out there, to help Donald Trump in the election or to keep people quiet like Stormy Daniels?",

Of course, the extremely unusual circumstances of this case is that the person sitting in the dock, the defendant is a former U.S. president and a current candidate for president in 2024. That, of course Donald Trump. This all taking place behind me in a courtroom and the courthouse here in Lower Manhattan. Katelyn Polantz, thanks so much. We do want to turn now to the delicate deliberations in the Middle East following this unprecedented attack by Iran on Israel over the weekend. Many hundreds of missiles and drones fired at Israel. Ninety- nine percent of them according to U.S. and Israeli officials, shot down by not just Israeli anti-missile defenses, but also the participation of allies, including the U.S., the UK, France, and Arab allies as well. Our Jeremy Diamond joins us now from Israel, where Israeli leaders are now considering in a potential response, potential retaliation for this attack. Do we know, Jeremy, where those deliberation stand?",

      "sentences": "Well, interestingly, Jim, Israeli officials are staying mum on whether or not a decision has been made out of this nearly three-hour long war cabinet meeting today. Yesterday, they told us very clearly that a decision had not been made, and I'm told that during this war cabinet meeting today, Israeli officials, the members of that war cabinet, reviewed military options for a potential retaliatory strike against Iran over this attack that Iran carried out over the weekend with more than 300 drones and missiles targeting Israeli soil for the first time in history.Now, these deliberations there has really been heated debate amongst the war cabinet about the timing and the scope of such an attack on the timing front. I'm told that Benny Gantz, a key member of the war cabinet, has been pushing for a much swifter response, whereas the Israeli prime minister at least up until today, has been putting the brakes effectively on actually making a decision about authorizing a retaliatory strike. Now, the question is, what exactly will this is rarely response look like? There is a sense that there is an attempt to thread the needle here, delivering a response that makes clear that Iranian attacks on it Israeli soil will not be met, will not go un-responded to, but at the same time trying to perhaps avoid an all-out war between Iran and Israel. That is certainly what the United States is pushing Israel to do, to deliver a more measured response, if any response at all. And certainly respond that takes into consideration the fact that 99 percent of the drones and missiles that were fired towards Israel did not reach their targets. So this is certainly an inflection point, Jim, and we will see over the coming hours and days what unfolds and how it will of course impact the region.",

Our Kevin Liptak joins us now from the White House. Kevin, the messaging from the White House to Israel has been quite clear that they want Israel not to over respond not to further escalate because the U.S. quite invested it seems and preventing a broader war here.

And in their phone call late Saturday night, the real emphasis that President Biden was trying to make was that Israel should consider this a very successful attempt at intercepting the Ukrainian barrage.They point out that nothing of value was struck that over 99 percent of them were intercepted, with the suggestion that a powerful Israeli retaliation might just not be necessary. The big question that's hanging over the White House today is whether Netanyahu will receive that message. There are plenty of American officials who really don't view the Israeli decision-making when it comes to the military as necessarily fully fleshed out, fully thought out, and certainly there are officials who believed that Netanyahu could be trying to pull the U.S. closer into direct conflict with Iran. So these are unanswered questions, but you have heard this attempt at the White House today to try and push back on these suggestions that Iran was attempting something smaller than a broad scale attack against Israel. They do say that they view this as an attempt at a lethal attack. We heard from Admiral John Kirby, the National Security Council spokesman, trying to push back on this idea that Iran warned the United States about what it was planning to do.

American officials have been intent that that is a very important thing to maintain.

So the options that they have, you know, range from very massive cyber attacks. I mean, they have shut down the entire Iranian fuel distribution system.

They've been asked questions. The note -- most notable of those questions is, can you be an impartial juror in this case?

And so, I think that as voters, especially independents continue to view this guy, Donald Trump, day after day after day in a courtroom, they're going to say to themselves, do we really want a criminal defendant in chief to be the one that's going to represent us on the global stage for four years as our president? And I think the answer is going to be no. And what this trial is going to show us this isn't just about business records of the desperation of Trumps allies trying to convince us a such, I think that they're very worried about it because it's actually about election interference, and the dispute and lies that Trump tried to tell -- frankly did tell the voters in 2016 that frankly was a great reason why he got elected because they could not have all of the information at their fingertips in terms of what he tried to pull -- pulling the wool over their heads, so I think that's what's going to come to light.",

So, those are the two reasons that Gallant lay down to Austin in this call. And today, I think we hear this was the private the message. Today, the IDF chief of staff in public in front of the cameras in an air force base of an F35 squadron, just said directly that Israel is going to respond and he just said, we will pick the time and place of our choosing.",

And the Iranians did not respond and retaliate directly against Israel. So that's definitely an option.The question is, if the Israeli government thinks it needs to go for an overt response with, you know, fighter jets flying to Iran and bombing targets there. It would also be an unprecedented Israeli action. I think the jury is still out. All those options in front of the Israeli cabinet. It is unclear to me whether there is a final decision or not. An interesting thing today, White House spokesman John Kirby sort of a distance the U.S. from this whole thing, saying that the U.S isn't involved in Israel's decision-making. And he said these rallies can take whatever decision they wanted, it's their own business. I found that to be surprising and maybe do something happening behind the scenes.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  It wasn't until almost 12 years after the affair allegedly occurred that the world first learned of the allegations of hush money payments to Stormy Daniels. In January 2018, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that in the weeks before the 2016 election, Donald Trump had arranged a $130,000 payment to the adult film star to keep her from publicly discussing their alleged 2006 encounter. Later, former Trump attorney Michael Cohen testified that Trump directed him to make payments to Daniels, quote, for the principal purpose of influencing the election. And that Trump later reimbursed him. Cohen served jail time for campaign finance violations related to the hush money payments and gave jarring testimony to Congress.
