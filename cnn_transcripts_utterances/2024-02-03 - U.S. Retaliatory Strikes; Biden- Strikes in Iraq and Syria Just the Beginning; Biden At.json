In a statement, President Biden says, \"Our response began today. It will continue at times and places of our choosing. The United States does not seek conflict in the Middle East or anywhere else in the world.\" Meanwhile, the leader of one Iranian group is vowing to continue attacks on U.S. targets. There have been 165 attacks on U.S. troops in the Middle East since October. Now, those attacks have injured more than 120 U.S. service members. Syria now says the U.S. strikes have caused \"significant damage and killed civilians and military personnel.\" The retaliatory strikes took place just after the dignified transfer of the three American soldiers killed in that drone attack in Jordan. The remains of Sergeants William Rivers, Kennedy Sanders, and Breonna Moffett were carefully carried off a military plane in Delaware. President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden met with their families. Now, presidents don't always attend the solemn ritual, but this is Biden's second as commander in chief. All right.

They say 25 others were injured, that there was damage to residential properties in the areas where these strikes took place as well. They say that the areas that were struck in Western Iraq were sites where \"our forces were present.\" And it's very important to point out here, Kim, when they say our forces, the Iranian-backed militias in the country known as the Popular Mobilization Units. They nominally fall under the control of the Iraqi government. They have operated alongside Iraqi forces for years. So, when they say, our forces, one would presume they are also referring to the militias. And our colleague, Mohammed Tawfeeq, spoke to mayor's local officials in Western Iraq, in these towns where the strikes took place, and they say that the sites that were hit, those were Shia militia sites, that these were the Popular Mobilization Units there. The Iraqi government as well, describing this again as an aggression, and they deny, what we've heard from U.S. officials, that there was any sort of coordination, they say, with the Iraqi government, that they were given advance notice that this was going to happen. And they say that this aggression will push Iraq and the whole region to the brink of the abyss. And really important here, Kim, they are saying that the U.S.-led coalition, more than 2,000 troops who are in the country has diverged from its mission and the authorization it has to operate in Iraq and that it has become a source of instability for Iraq and for the region. We do know that there are plans. We have heard this in the past week that Iraq and the U.S. want to discuss the plans for the future presence of U.S. forces in the country. Iraq, once again saying that it does not want to be a battlefield with various regional, international powers for these conflicts and their battles to play out on its territory. Kim.",

And the goal, I think, of these strikes is more to degrade the Iraqi militias and also the Syrian militias and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force. So, the question, I think, that everyone is asking is, will it deter future strikes by Iranian proxies? And there is some concern that the long delay in getting these strikes going and also more significantly the telegraphing of intent to Iran will actually undermine that deterrence aspect.

That is because a federal judge on Friday said it couldn't begin on March 4th. The reason? It's because the law hasn't been worked out yet. There are questions about presidential immunity, whether Trump even can face trial that are before an appeals court. That appeals court hasn't ruled in weeks.And so, as the wait for the opinion continues, day after day after day, that means that Trump's team is not preparing for trial and that the trial is not going to be able to go forward as scheduled. This is the trial in Washington D.C., a federal case against Trump, but he is still set to go to trial in March. In the end of March, in fact, is when the Manhattan District Attorney, Alvin Bragg, is set to put on his case against Trump now as a defendant related to a hush money scheme and the falsification of business records. So, right now, that is supposed to be the first criminal trial against Trump on the calendar. There is a lot of moving parts here. Trial dates do move. And this case with Judge Tanya Chutkan, there is much anticipation of when the appeals court will determine what the law is here, when it will go back to Judge Chutkan, and when that 2020 election case could be put back on the calendar. And especially, whether it will happen before the presidential election of 2024, something the Justice Department very much wants to happen, no matter when the Manhattan D.A.'s case and other cases against Trump go forward. So, we will wait and see that. Trump, of course, doesn't want this trial to happen before the presidential election in November. It would shine quite a light on the end of his presidency, how he managed his White House. There would be formal officials called to testify against him, very possibly his own former vice president, Mike Pence, and it would put a spotlight on how Donald Trump viewed elections in a critical moment where he is still running for the American presidency.

The tension's already clearly very high. The northern border of Israel with Hezbollah has exchange of fire every day. The IDF is engaged with Hamas inside of Gaza. The question is, could these strikes then trigger a misinterpretation of another move? Could it trigger one of the -- one of Iran's proxies in Iraq and Syria to strike back aggressively and therefore escalate the situation?Well, the first we've heard is from the Iraqi government. A spokesman for the army there is saying that it's a violation of their sovereignty. Now, we've heard them say this before. So, that in itself, not necessary an escalation. The biggest and strongest of the Iran-backed militias inside of Iraq, Khatib Hezbollah, just before the strikes, minutes before the strikes on their Telegram channel, they said they were waiting for orders about what to do next, an indication that they're waiting for Tehran, their main sponsor, to tell them how to respond to the events of the night. It's not clear yet how much damage has been done, how many of the IRGC members and how much of their weapons have been, have been damaged and destroyed overnight. But I think perhaps looking to what the president of Iran has said, he said, we're not looking to get into a direct fight with the United States, but he's clearly hinting very strongly that there will be a response. He said, we will deal with bullies authoritatively. I think in the language of this region, that means the United States strikes, so though there'll be more, they certainly won't be the last word from Iran's proxies in the region.

Great to have you back here with us. So, I just want to get your reaction to the scope of these strikes and the Biden administration walking that fine line between punishment and escalation. BRIAN FINUCANE, SENIOR ADVISER FOR THE U.S. PROGRAM, INTERNATIONAL CRISIS GROUP: Well, I think it's important to take a few steps back and understand the broader context in which these latest, and, yes, wider us strikes are occurring. So, the latest round of us hostilities with these Iran-backed groups and Iraq and Syria began in mid-October as a result of the Gaza conflict. There had been a month long lol (ph) and attacks on both countries on U.S. forces, leading up to October, and those attacks resumed October 17th as a result of the Gaza conflict. And they've been much more frequent and intense as a result of the Gaza conflict. We've been now up to about 165, 170. And many outside analysts, including a crisis group predicted that eventually there would be, unfortunately, a fatal attack on U.S. forces, and we saw that last weekend in Gaza with the three U.S. soldiers killed -- are -- in Jordan, with the three U.S. soldiers killed. And yes, the U.S. is walking a fine line. There is a political imperative for the Biden administration to respond to these fatal attacks on U.S. troops. But they -- as they telegraphed and indicated very clearly, they don't want escalation and they don't want a direct conflict with Tehran. And Iran has indicated the same, that they do not want to direct a conflict with the United States. So, you have both parties -- and again, they don't want to want a broader conflict, but the U.S., you know, has a need to respond to these continuing attacks in U.S. troops. I do not expect, however, these strikes -- you know, they're not done. I did not expect these strikes are going to end the attacks on U.S. forces. At least based on the track record thus far.",

They have their own decision-making, and it's not simply a matter of them following marching orders from Iran. I think it's quite likely that these groups were surprised that they -- that they're -- the attack in Jordan, succeed in killing U.S. personnel. I think that they have expected it would have been another one of these harassing attacks on U.S. troops that was intercepted and shot down. But unfortunately, you know, these are deadly serious activities. Later, one of these attacks was likely to kill personnel.

Even L.A. picked up 2.49 inches in one day. The total for the entire month of February should be around three inches. So almost an entire months' worth of rain in just 24 hours.The next atmospheric river is on the way for Southern California. It will make significant rains from the Bay Area down through Monterey and all the way down even towards Santa Barbara and eventually into L.A. It's going to take a while to get there. But something else that's going to happen are significantly gusty winds here. Along the Central Coast, we're going to see wind gusts 50 to 70 miles per hour. That will bring down trees. That will bring down power lines. All of those things that happen, and especially in places that already have saturated ground from the rain that we picked up three days ago. So, here it is. The storm does come into San Francisco. First, snow in the Sierra and then all the way down even toward Santa -- about Santa Barbara by the time we work our way into Sunday morning. It gets into L.A. later in the day and into the night, and then it pushes to the east. How long this heavy band of rain stays over Southern California before it moves inland is going to be the big question mark. How much of this forecasted rainfall actually comes down before it moves away? If this storm or if this frontal little system here begins to stall and it rains for hours and hours and hours, there will be a significant flood event for SoCal, all the way up even towards San Francisco. Certainly, along the coast where from Monterey all the way down, even toward Pismo Beach, could pick up -- in the mountains, could pick up a dozen inches of rainfall. Not along the coast as much. But when you start to push that air up into the mountains, all of that water has to run back downhill. And we know what happens to the highway when that happens. So, yes, we have only 53 percent of the snowpack in the Sierra. So, we'll take the snow, but it's that heavy, heavy rainfall that is going to run off possibly with mudslides, all the things that could happen just depends on where this storm, if it does, stalls over California.",
