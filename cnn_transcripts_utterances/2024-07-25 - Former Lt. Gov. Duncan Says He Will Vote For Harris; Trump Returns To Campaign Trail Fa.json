That is not necessarily the same thing as these DEI attacks that we're now seeing from Republicans. I mean, as you mentioned, we had at least three members of Congress yesterday saying that they believe that she was a DEI hire or directly going after her because of her race. That's not what Trump is doing in this situation. He's actually kind of doing what he did against what we saw -- for instance, his GOP rivals. Against Ron DeSantis, for instance. Workshopping right now. Working with the crowd to see, OK, well do you like Lyin' Kamala Harris? Do you like that I'm calling her incompetent? Do you just like that I'm, like, yelling that she's mean, that she's nasty, like he said against Hillary Clinton? He's figuring out what is his line of attack at the moment and what are the ways that he wants to be resonating with his base on this. Is that going to resonate with swing voters?
