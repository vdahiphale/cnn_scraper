Officials say air defenses intercepted one drone headed in the general direction of Moscow, while another one hit a city in the Kursk region Friday morning, damaging a building.The operations at three Moscow airports were temporarily restricted after the attacks, but flights are now back to normal. Across the border, Ukraine says its troops are edging towards what could be the toughest line of Russian defenses in the south. It's happening near the village of Robotyne, which Ukrainians recently captured. But now they're up against a maze of heavily fortified trenches and obstacles that Russia has been building for months. A Ukrainian brigade in that area acknowledges there is a tough fight ahead. Meanwhile, President Zelenskyy says Ukraine has successfully used a new weapon that hit a target from 700 kilometers away. He did not give any details about the weapon or the target. CNN has not yet independently verified his claim. Katie Polglase has been monitoring these developments for us and she's here in London with me, with more. Katie, drone attacks are increasingly a dominant element of Ukrainian military strategy. What happened last night and what impact did it have?",

They are more common than not and that really speaks to the Ukrainian strategy here. Now it's worth noting, we're not seeing serious damage yet from really any of these attacks. But this has been a week of drone assaults on Russian territory, really quite far away from the front lines with Ukraine. And that is the tactic here, to bring the war home to Russia, to make the war be felt by the Russian people.And it's worth noting here that while this is going on, we're seeing figures from the Ukrainian government that the drone manufacturing capacity, the number of drones they are building at home in Ukraine, is dramatically shooting up. They have been just in the last month, 200 drone manufacturers jumped to 300 drone manufacturers. Before the start of the war, there was just 30. So that really shows you the intention here, that drones and the use of them in this war is something that Ukraine is heavily prioritizing. And you mentioned there the 700-kilometer weapon. It's a rather mysterious reference from President Zelenskyy there. And he said that Ukrainians had successfully launched a weapon that landed at a target 700 kilometers away. That is roughly 435 miles. Now, we don't know where that is and we don't know whether we can independently verify it at this point, but it's worth noting that amidst the vast array of drone attacks that happened this week, one of them happened in Skov, which is just north of Moscow, really quite far away from the front lines and about 700 kilometers away. Could it be that? We don't know, but it's an interesting reference in a week of many, many attacks. Bianca.",

The military junta that took over Gabon on Wednesday says the general who led the coup will be sworn in as transitional president on Monday.Deposed president Ali Bongo appealed for help from other nations on Wednesday while being held under house arrest. The coup happened shortly after Bongo was declared the winner of Saturday's disputed election and that last part is key. Gabon is the latest of mostly former French colonies seized by a military coup. Let's get some perspective now from CNN's Jim Bittermann who's joining us from France. Jim, France has clearly taken the stance of demonstrably and rhetorically rejecting these coup d'etat that are happening across countries that they have historic ties to. However there's also been criticism of France that they haven't used that historic influence to try and democratic principles are respected in the countries where these coups have occurred. JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, it certainly seems that way. This is the seventh coup that we've seen, military coup in the last three years in West Africa and the region. And as a matter of fact, President Macron must be, I would think, appalled at what he sees going on. And it was only 48 hours before this coup that he was talking about the coup in Niger which took place barely a month ago, a month ahead of this coup in Gabon. And in the case of Niger, in fact, he said that he was most worrisome for the French diplomats that he was speaking before. These are diplomats that assemble in Paris once every year. And then 48 hours later, we have this coup in Gabon, another former French colony. So it really is sort of a hand-wringing moment for the French, but for the whole world as Antonio Guterres, the Secretary General of the United Nations said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That's at least the analysis of the head of ECOWAS, the Nigerian president, who said that He thought, in fact, that this was an epidemic of falling dominoes across Africa.So it's really something that has people here on edge. And also, you wonder exactly where the policy is going to go from here, because while the French have got 1,500 troops in Niger, troops that could be called into play to reinstall some of these governments, some of the governments, they may not want to, for example, Ali Bongo's government. He represents a family that has been in power there for 55 years, marked with a lot of corruption and untoward stories about their rule. So it's not one that they would want to defend. Their election, as you mentioned, was questionable in Gabon, not so questionable in Niger, but still the actual use of force to reinstall a president is not something that France really wants to get into these days.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SARA MURRAY, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Donald Trump officially entering his plea of not guilty in the sprawling racketeering case he faces in Fulton County, Georgia, where he and 18 other co-defendants were charged for their efforts to allegedly try to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in Georgia. Donald Trump is now one of five, again, of the 19 co-defendants in that case who have entered not guilty pleas and waived their right to an arraignment. That means we're not going to see Donald Trump showing up next week in the Fulton County courthouse. We won't see him on camera there as many had expected.

His attorney has moved to sever his case from other co-defendants, saying, well, there are some who want to move ahead speedily with this trial and move ahead to trial in October of 2023. Donald Trump is not one of them. His attorney says there's no way he's going to be ready for trial by then. It's also possible we could see Donald Trump's team try to move this into federal court. They have not made that attempt yet, but others involved in this case have.

Thanks so much for joining us.First of all, if you could paint a picture of the relative capabilities of Russia and Ukraine when it comes to drones, because there's increasing signs of self-sufficiency from both. I'm reminded that at the beginning of the war, Ukraine was relying so much on commercial and sort of hobbyist drones for use on the battlefield. STEPHEN WRIGHT, SR. RESEARCH FELLOW, UNIVERSITY OF THE WEST OF ENGLAND BRISTOL: Both sides have definitely expanded their capability. The interesting aspect of all this is one thing that drones always rely on, and that's electronics. And that's something that the Russians are conspicuously short on. They had an attempt years ago to found their own electronics industry and it didn't really work and so they've been heavily relying on Western electronics effects and been smuggled into Russia. The Ukrainians obviously have got the support of the whole Western world.

Secretary General Antonio Guterres said on Thursday that he sent a letter with concrete proposals to Russia's foreign minister. But Guterres warned that any renewal of the deal must be stable and not, quote, \"move from crisis to crisis, suspension to suspension.\" Russia's foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said Moscow wants to see some guarantees. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SERGEY LAVROV, RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER (through translator): As you know, President Putin has repeatedly officially stated clearly that all measures are taken not on the negotiations of the Russian part of the Black Sea package, but measures are taken to solve all problems that have remained unfulfilled. Despite the promises of the UN Secretary General, who efforts we appreciate. But as soon as the talks turn into more concrete decisions on the same day, we are ready to resume the Ukrainian part of the grain package. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "No, not at all. In fact, the pressure just seems to be increasing. We're also waiting today for a possible decision from the sports tribunal on whether or not Rubiales will be investigated and suspended.And keep in mind that the number of complaints against Rubiales has gone from the single complaint that was filed on the night of the World Cup to 16, everything from allegations of sexual aggression to abuse of power. So it really does seem to be increasing the pressure on him. And we spoke to the man who filed that very first complaint. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SHUBERT (voice-over): At the moment of Spain's triumph, an unwanted kiss now threatens to bring down Luis Rubiales, the powerful president of the Spanish Football Federation. Rubiales apologized, but it was not enough, and he became the target of national anger, a wave against sexism and sport triggered in part by Miguel Angel Galan at his unassuming office in Madrid, officially the head of the National Training Center for Football Coaches, unofficially the longtime nemesis of Rubiales and the Football Federation. He says he has filed more than 50 complaints against the Federation, one of which landed the previous president in prison. Now, he hopes to take down another with this kiss. It was a sexist and intolerable act, a chauvinistic act, he said to CNN, by a president who is already plagued by corruption scandals and sexism. Steeped in tradition, Spain's Royal Football Federation has long ruled over the nation's lucrative football fortunes. When this furor broke, Spain's prosecutor was already investigating Rubiales for trafficking in influence and bribery. Allegations, Rubiales, has consistently denied. CNN has reached out to both the federation and Rubiales. Neither have responded. And now women footballers have entered the professional ranks. They are demanding equal pay, rights and structural change, says the president of Spain's women's league, La Liga F, Beatriz Alvarez, who's had her own disagreements with Rubiales. In that federation meeting, that totally delirious speech he made, she says, look at how they applauded him. It is unacceptable. It shows that more than the president has to change, the entire model has to change. As the scandal grows at the Rubiales hometown church, his mother went on hunger strike to support her embattled son. Briefly hospitalized, she continues to defend his innocence, even as others close to him are speaking out. His own uncle, Juan Rubiales, told Spanish news \"El Mundo\" that the kiss was just the tip of the iceberg. I was not surprised by that at all, he said. He is an extremely arrogant man who has not acted as a president should. Instead of being a political leader, he wanted to be a warrior who sees ghosts and enemies everywhere, he said. In the end, his own worst enemy was himself. Spain's historic win at the Women's World Cup, it seems, is forging a path for change in more ways than one. (END VIDEOTAPE) SHUBERT (on-camera): It all means a crisis for the Federation. Keep in mind that Rubiales' uncle, Juan Rubiales, was actually his chief of staff at the Federation and claims to have witnessed a number of allegations of corruption and abuse of power. So all of this is beginning to resurface now. But the Federation is trying to push ahead, business as usual, waiting for this press conference from Luis de la Fuentes, who I should point out is not just the coach of the men's team, but was one of the men who applauded Rubiales when he defiantly refused to resign. Critics of Rubiales are saying it shouldn't just be Rubiales who resigns, but those who applauded him as well, such as de la Fuente. So he could be facing some of those questions at the press conference later today, Bianca.",

      "sentences": "Chinese tech firms Baidu and SenseTime have just launched their answers to the ChatGPT craze, rolling out their A.I. bots today to the general public. The move marks a new milestone in the global A.I. race, which is heating up.Baidu, for one, is now letting all users get their hands on its platform, which is dubbed ERNIE bot. The tool allows users to conduct AI-powered searches or carry out an array of tasks, from creating videos, to making newsletters, to providing summaries of complex documents. Now the news sent Baidu's shares up immediately, surging more than 3 percent in New York on Wednesday and nearly 5 percent higher in Hong Kong on Thursday. Baidu is among the first companies in China to get regulatory approval for this rollout, and it's the first to launch this type of service publicly, a source tells me. Until now, ERNIE bot had been offered only to corporate clients or select members of the public who'd requested access through a wait list. Meanwhile, SenseTime, which is an A.I. startup based here in Hong Kong, also announced the public launch of its own platform today. The company's stock surged 4 percent in Hong Kong after the news. Now Baidu has been a front-runner in China in the race to capitalize on the excitement around generative A.I., the tech behind systems like ChatGPT or its successor, GPT-4. Baidu announced its own iteration back in February, giving it an early advantage in China, according to analysts. Since then, though, competitors like Alibaba have also announced plans to launch their GPT-style tools, adding to the list of Chinese businesses jumping on this bandwagon. Now, Alibaba told CNN today it had filed for regulatory approval for its own bot, which was introduced in April. To stand out, companies are now showing off how their tech can be used for different scenarios. Baidu says its service is different because of its ability to generate various types of responses like text, images, audio and video. SenseTime has touted a range of features which it says lets users write code more efficiently or receive personalized medical advice. Michelle Toh, CNN, Hong Kong. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
