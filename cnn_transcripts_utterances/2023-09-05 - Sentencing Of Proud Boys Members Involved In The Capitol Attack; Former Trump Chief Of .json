He's one of four of them who have been convicted of seditious conspiracy. And Enrique Tarrio wasn't actually at the Capitol on that day. He'd been arrested just before January 6th and before the crowd gathered that day, in part because he had weapons on him and he was involved in a previous altercation, stealing a sign at a church right here in the District of Columbia. So, for that reason, he wasn't here.But prosecutors say he was in touch with members of the group who were here on the ground and who formed really the point of the spear to get the crowd, the mob, into the Capitol that day, breaking windows and so on. Right now, the judge is gavelling the hearing to a start. And so, we're waiting to see what he decides here. As you pointed out, the members of the Proud Boys, there's four of them who have already been sentenced in the last few days. Ethan Nordean got 18 years. Joseph Biggs got 17 years. Zachary Rehl, 15 years. And a lower-level member of the group, Dominic Pezzolla, got 10 years. We're expecting Tarrio, because of his leadership role, to get a lot more than that. Now, prosecutors are making the point, Jim, that what the Proud Boys did that day was not just cause violence or lead some of the violence. They also stole from Americans the peaceful transfer of power, something the judge has already emphasized in a number of the sentencing. So, the hearing is about to get underway in court, and we'll see what he decides, Jim.",

He's not detracting from any of that, but he doesn't believe it rises to the level of terrorism, and so that's one of the reasons why you've seen sentences come in well below what prosecutors have been asking for, Jim.",

For Mark Meadows, that's an open question of whether this is a case that's going to proceed in state court or in federal court.

He wants that gone completely or a vote on the Senate floor to essentially codify it, and assuming that they had a vote on the floor, that would fail, which is why the Democrats don't wanna agree and go down that route.So, this standoff has led to Tuberville doing what the right of any individual senator does, has, which is to place a hold on a nomination. Now, there are ways around a senator's hold. The Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer could schedule a vote on each of these individual nominations, but that takes time. That eats up floor time, and Schumer has made clear he has no desire to give in to Tuberville's demands, instead believing that the pressure campaign will only mount and that Tuberville ultimately will relent, and if once the senator drops his objection, these nominees could be confirmed rather quickly, but some key ones are held up as well, including potentially the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, someone who needs to be confirmed by the end of September. Otherwise, that could be vacancy in that extremely critical post, but Tuberville says that he is of the belief that this is not putting the national security at risk. He says he has had conversations with other people in the military who have not raised this concern, and he believes if Chuck Schumer wants to confirm these individual nominees, they can move one by one, so the staring contest is only bound to intensify. The only thing at the moment, Brianna, some believe could change the calculus if pressure among Republicans really intensifies. We've heard some Republicans raise concerns, including Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, but very few of them have leaned on Tuberville, and Brianna, when I've asked Tuberville in the past, that would be enough to change his mind if Republicans began to ration up their pressure campaign, he said no.",
