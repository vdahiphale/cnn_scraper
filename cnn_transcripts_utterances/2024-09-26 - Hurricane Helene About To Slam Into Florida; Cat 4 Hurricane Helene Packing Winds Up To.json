It's now an extremely dangerous Category 4 storm, and winds are now up to a 140 miles per hour. If it stays this strong, it will be the strongest storm to ever make landfall, in Florida's Big Bend region. That's the area that we're keeping a close eye on, this hour. More than half a million people there have already lost power. And forecasters are predicting, tonight, that the storm surge, in some areas, could be, quote, unsurvivable, reaching as high as 20 feet. Surges and high winds were already the reason for the closures of several major bridges in the Tampa area that we saw, tonight. Officials there are telling residents to shelter in place, that it is going to get worse, and don't go outside. Emergency Managers in one Florida county are being so blunt with their warnings, for those who are in low-lying areas and did not evacuate. They are telling them to write your name and date of birth on your arms or legs, so if needed, you can be identified and your family can be notified. That is how dire the situation is, as we come on the air, tonight. We're monitoring it all very closely. We have reporters covering every angle of this. CNN's Derek Van Dam is joining us live from Apalachicola. Derek, just tell us, obviously you've been there all day, tracking this as the winds are picking up. Tell us what you're seeing right now on the ground.",

      "sentences": "Kaitlan, this is the most intense rain bands and wind that we've experienced so far, with the approach of Hurricane Helene. And we know that it's only going to go downhill from here, as we remain on the western side of this.I want to look directly into the camera. Franklin County, where I'm located, is under a mandatory evacuation. So are so many other counties that line the Big Bend of Florida. If you chose not to evacuate, now is not the time to get out and try to move out of harm's way. You have missed that opportunity. The storm is too close. The conditions are too dangerous. And it is going to go downhill with a vengeance and at pace. And the reason I say that is because we can see, let's say, buoys in the Gulf of Mexico, about 100 miles offshore from where we're located, with winds that have already topped a 107 miles per hour. There have been waves measured at 26 feet, on the western side of this storm. And that means that surge is getting pushed up with the strong winds that have moved over the shallow water, the shelf of the Gulf of Mexico, that's sitting just over my right-hand shoulder. A 140 mile per hour winds. That is a Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson. That is the potential to bring catastrophic damage. Think about what that can do. That will peel back the roof off of a house. That will topple some sturdy structures. That will also take down power poles and snap trees like they were twigs. So, this is something that people need to be prepared for, as the storm makes its final approach. Every once in a while, we get some of those stronger bands that come through. And John Berman and I have been talking about this on air for the past couple of hours. It almost feels like a power washer is being taken directly to your body, it just stings every time it hits your opened, exposed skin. But this is the reason, Kaitlan, why people were asked to evacuate this area, because they knew that this most intense part of the storm was going to approach, in the darkness of night, and it is going to be an incredibly devastating next 12 hours here, across the Big Bend, as this major hurricane makes landfall.",

In fact, with this hurricane, to the north of where we are right now, at this hour, you can still see all of this water being pushed in, from the Gulf as well as the Tampa Bay. All of this is associated with that hurricane. We're talking about at least four feet of storm surge, earlier today. And we're told, our meteorologists tell us that we could be getting anywhere between three to four more feet of storm surge. Again, all of this is taking place with the storm effectively having passed Pinellas County, and not hit the area directly. Now, here in St. Pete, much of the neighborhood that we've been driving around is without power. And we're at a marina, where the damage is quite evident here. You can see a portion of the dock, a portion of the sea wall here, was cut in half, it was broken apart, in this afternoon's strong winds and the storm surge and all of that water that just continues to rush in. It's been pushed up against this, what's left of that seawall here. It's really dark out, so you really can't see far from where we are. But all of that side is underwater. It's filled with debris. We've got buoys from some of these boats that have all pushed up along shore here. We're being told that a lot of this water, really, is not going to recede until about 5 or 6 o'clock, tomorrow morning. And if the folks that live, in Pinellas County, think that they're really done with this storm surge? Here's a fun fact. High tide is not going to kick in until about midnight, or 01:00 in the morning, which means that the water levels that we're seeing not just here, but over in Gulfport, which is about 15 to 20 minutes to the south and the west, that water is only going to get higher. Because you've got high tide coming in, around midnight, 01:00 in the morning, and then it's not really going to go back down until about 05:00 in the morning or 06:00 in the morning. So, for folks that decided to stay put, in this evacuation zone? Well, chances are you're not going anywhere. You're probably in the dark. And once you wake up, tomorrow morning, then you're really going to get a sense of such of the -- a part of the cleanup effort. And then, we've still got to see just when these bridges might reopen. Because again, right now, if you live in Pinellas County, you cannot get out to Hillsborough County, which is home to Tampa, and you can't get down to Bradenton. Kaitlan.",

As you follow the path, you may have significant impacts, serious flooding, tornadoes, strong gusting winds, far away from the center of this storm. So, that's something people should pay very close attention to. In some places, unfortunately, it may be too late, for people to evacuate. In some areas you may still have time.

We are waiting for it to make landfall. Joining me now is Jules Carl, who is with her family in Florida. She rode out Hurricane Idalia, last year, while she was pregnant. And she is now riding it out, tonight, with her 1-year-old baby. Obviously, we are watching all of this very closely, as officials there have been very worried about people who stayed on the ground. We're actually working to make sure we have Jules' connection. So, stand by as we'll speak with her in a moment. As we're tracking all of this. You can see this storm moving very closely into the Big Bend area. That is exactly where Steinhatchee is. It is in Taylor County, right there. That's an area that we're watching very closely, tonight. As we wait to get Jules on the line with us. I do want to go to CNN's Derek Van Dam, because there is now an extreme wind warning that is in place, for exactly along where these areas are in Steinhatchee. That is in the Big Bend area.

So, Kaitlan, these extreme wind warnings are reserved by the National Weather Service, to only issue them at the most important moments, the most extreme moments for the approach of a storm of this magnitude. They really reserve them, because the verbiage talks about how you need to treat this like an extreme wind, as if a tornado was approaching your area.So, what do you do when the tornado comes knocking on your door? You go to the interior of your home, away from windows. You protect yourself by putting blankets, perhaps even bedding over top of you. You need to take action to protect your life and the life of your others in your home with you. Now, the safest place that they're talking about, during this extreme wind warning is in a reinforced interior. That's maybe perhaps under a table, if that's not a possibility. So, this extreme wind warning, again, it's reserved for these most extreme moments. And that is what we anticipate to do take place, just east of Apalachicola, where I'm located, along the Big Bend. We're feeling the brunt of tropical storm force winds that are teetering on hurricane force. But it's a miracle that we still have power. That is not the same for hundreds and thousands of people, here across the State of Florida, that will be plunged into darkness, as the most intense part of Hurricane Helene makes its way on shore, here in the coming hours. We're really focusing in on that Taylor County area, very low-lying, susceptible area to storm surge. But the catastrophic wind threat, the potential to peel back roofs off of buildings, to topple structures, and even topple power poles and trees is real, Kaitlan. And this storm, it's coming.

I mean, if you look at the diameter of the hurricane winds that are associated with Helene, it's over a 100 miles. So, in essence, you could think of that as a low-end EF-0, or even an EF-1 hurricane -- tornado approaching, but over a 100-miles swath, right? So that's significant. Whereas a tornado would only be a couple of hundred yards across, creating that consolidated damage path. But a hurricane of this magnitude, this size, and this intensity, will create what a tornado with similar winds would create, but over a much larger area. My favorite hat, it's ridden out so many hurricanes. I'll get that later. All right, guys, so now -- now, as I speak, and my hat flies off the top of my head, we're starting to hear these familiar signs (ph) sounds. And just you can see some of the debris starting to flow behind me. I mean, this is -- this is what's going to increase, in severity here, in the coming hours. And now, we need to be very mindful of what's upwind from us. And I'm seeing this building behind me, with metal roofs, and wooden pallets on the ground. These are things that can become projectiles, in the strongest of winds. We're very cognizant of that. We have the ability to get in and shelter in place, if we need to. But this is the reason why officials here, in Franklin County, enforce this mandatory evacuation, of the entire county.
