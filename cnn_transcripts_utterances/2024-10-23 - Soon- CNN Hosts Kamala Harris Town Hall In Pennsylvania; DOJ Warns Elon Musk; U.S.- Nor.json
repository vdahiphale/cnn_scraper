Trump hitting back hard this hour. Plus, new reporting tonight from our KFILE. Trump's own campaign manager retweeting and liking posts blaming Trump for January 6th, one post even called for invoking the 25th Amendment against Trump. KFILE's report. And breaking news, the Justice Department putting Elon Musk on notice for his battleground sweepstakes scheme. Is Musk breaking the law? And by the way, who exactly has won the million dollars a day from him so far? We'll tell you. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, on message with just 13 days until Election Day, and moments away from our exclusive presidential town hall with Kamala Harris tonight, the vice president going all in on the allegations in \"The Atlantic\" magazine against Trump, claiming Trump told General Kelly, quote, I need the kind of generals that Hitler had. Here's Harris today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It is deeply troubling and incredibly dangerous that Donald Trump would invoke Adolf Hitler, the man who is responsible for the deaths of 6 million Jews and hundreds of thousands of Americans. Donald Trump is increasingly unhinged and unstable, and in a second term, people like John Kelly would not be there to be the guardrails against his propensities. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He is about to speak in Georgia at this hour.

She should be talking about this. It's a threat and not let people forget the type of language and type of leader that Donald Trump would be. But she also should talk about issues like reproductive rights that so many Americans care about and the economy, and how she can -- she is going to plan to provide relief to them.

I just don't think that this is that big of a deal for Donald Trump to attack back using that kind of language. We've all heard him do this before.Part of what the vice president's got to do tonight is to then go back and say, see this is exactly what I'm talking about, right? We are talk -- we have a country that has a variety of needs, we've got a variety of things we need to address. We got to deal with our education system. We got to deal with our housing costs. We got to deal with a variety of things. And then this guy is just calling people names like he's in the schoolyard. But I think there's a bigger question at the table. The bigger question right now is a few months ago in the summer, we saw Joe Biden out in the debate stage, and he did something that Democrats were very uncomfortable with, a lot of Republicans were uncomfortable with it. They said maybe Joe Biden isn't really up to running for another four years and Democrats had to step up and say, you know what? Maybe this could be something that's right. We saw a lot of Democrats say that they risk themselves, they risk their reputations, they risked their relationships. At a moment seems like Republicans are going to have to do this, too. We keep finding out these things about this president where our worst fears are confirmed that he actually does have autocratic and dictatorial tendencies. He does want to sic the press and the mil -- the military on the -- on his enemies. He'll do that even to Republicans. At what point do the Republican Party -- do the Republicans say, you know what? For the sake of country, country over party, even though it's uncomfortable, even though it's something I may not -- it makes me feel -- it turns me up because I agree with the policy, this guy shouldn't be in office.",

I mean, if -- if he were really Hitler, if he were really a threat to democracy, not a single Democrat in this country would be running ads touting their work with Donald Trump. Now I'm callous on this Hitler business because I live through the Bush years and I used to peer out my window onto Pennsylvania Avenue and I saw everybody marching around in their brown uniforms, signs up, Bush is Hitler, Bush is Hitler, and then they did it to John McCain, they did it to Mitt Romney, they've done it to Donald Trump, they even did it to Paul Ryan I recall at one point. So I've heard it all before, and I think the reason Democrats are freaking out about it right now is because what they have learned is that it's not Republicans who are the Hitlers or the Nazis, it's actually emanating from within their own party.

So KFILE's Andrew Kaczynski joins me now. All right. Chris LaCivita obviously running the Trump campaign now. What did you find? ANDREW KACZYNSKI, CNN KFILE SENIOR EDITOR: Well, look, and, Erin, what has Donald Trump been doing the last couple of weeks? He's been recasting January 6th. He called it a day of love. He spread a conspiracy theory that it was a government staged inside job. Well, one person we found who seemingly disagreed with him was his own campaign manager, all right? And this guy liked and he shared post condemning Trump on January 6, and I want to walk people through some of them. You referenced that one in the intro, the 25th Amendment. Now, this was a tweet that he actually liked, from a former Republican member of Congress, Barbara Comstock, saying that, quote, Twitter locked at real Donald Trump for 12 hours now. The cabinet needs to lock him down for 14 days, #25thamendment now. The 25th Amendment basically says that the cabinet can basically keep the president -- take the powers away from the president if he's essentially incapacitated. They were calling for him to do this after January 6. So that's one thing his campaign manager liked. He also shared a lot of posts on his feed, some of which we found that he removed. One of them was a statement from former President George W. Bush that laid the blame at the feet of Donald Trump, just a couple of quotes from there that said: I am appalled by the reckless behavior of some political leaders since the election and added that the rioting at the Capitol was, quote, undertaken by people whose passions have been inflamed by falsehoods and false hopes -- again seemingly pointing the finger at Trump. And then another post shared by LaCivita was -- this text message that said, quote, this is a disgusting tragedy, someone literally lost their life because of a lie that Trump told, and that again essentially points the finger at Donald Trump. And then one more post talked about the people rioting at the Capitol and said, quote, these are not protesters these -- they are thugs.",
