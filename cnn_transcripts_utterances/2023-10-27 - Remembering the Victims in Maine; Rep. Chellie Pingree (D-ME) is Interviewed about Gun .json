But as the editorial board for the \"Portland Press Herald\" writes, that illusion is now shattered. Quote, \"gone is the idea that Maine is unusually safe or otherwise somehow immune from the rampant American disease that is gun violence and mass shooting. And even in our grief, we have to ask again, why we are not doing more to keep public places safe from senseless massacre.\" With us now this morning, Democratic Congresswoman Chellie Pingree. She represents Maine's First District, which is just south of where the shootings happened. Thank you for being with us this morning. The tragedy is unbearable I know for all of you. As you think about Maine and the state you love and the people you represent, how do you move forward from this? What do you think needs change? REP. CHELLIE PINGREE (D-ME): Well, thank you so much for telling this story and for talking about the wonderful people and the family members who have been lost. This is a terrible tragedy for our state. And, frankly, our state is still in fear and lockdown. Communities throughout the state are still worried about the shooter that's on the loose. As you heard, Lewiston is locked down. In my district yesterday, Portland Public Schools, schools on the mid-coast. You couldn't buy a cup of coffee on the commercial street in Portland because everybody was locked down. And today will be another day of fear and concern. And, as you said, you know, we've thought of ourselves as immune, the safest state in the nation. It's almost hunting season in November and so many people own guns and use them safely. We always thought, oh, this just can't (ph) happen in our state. And - and here we are. It's a - it's bringing us face to face with reality.",

He served in the military. He knows the difference between a military assault weapon designed to kill and something you take out to go hunting and get yourself a deer.
