RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL): Ideally, you have to listen to military commanders who have the best information.

The fact that it's not really collecting intelligence, because (inaudible) and then one thing that I would just bring up as a member of the Intelligence Committee as well is, a lot of times we actually want to preserve the tech that is actually doing reconnaissance so that we can learn more about their capabilities.
