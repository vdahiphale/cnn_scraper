      "sentences": "Oh, their patience of course boys. You know, so far so smooth here at DCA, the Terminal 2 North Checkpoint. Rush is building a little bit of the current wait times right now, between 8 and 11 minutes according to the live tracker here for standard screening. About five minutes to get through pre-check.TSA says it's anticipating about 2.8 million people at airports nationwide today. An even bigger number tomorrow, about 2.9 million people. TSA getting pretty good at making these predictions because the top 10 days in TSA history for air travel numbers have been in 2024. The really interesting thing here is according to TSA administrator David Pekoske, he tells me that some airports might be so slammed that they may not be able to keep the standard wait time promise for standard screening. That's about 30 minutes or less for pre-check. That's about 10 minutes or less. Of course a lot of people are driving. It's really more of a driving holiday. AAA says 80 million people in total will travel 50 miles or more. 70 million of them will drive. And I want you to listen now to AAA's Aixa Diaz. She says the really interesting thing now is AAA is considering this a seven-day rush. It used to be a five-day rush because a lot more people now can work from home or in some cases on the road. I wanted to tell you about the best and worst times to travel as well. The best time according to AAA is to wait until after 7 p.m. tonight. The worst time tomorrow between 1 and 7 p.m. They say really the best time tomorrow maybe hit the road before 10 a.m. So you might want to get started a little bit early. The big thing that happens on days when it's an early rush like this is when that holiday traffic meets the normal congestion of commuting will be especially bad today and also especially bad on Monday, AAA says, when so many people are coming home all at once.",

It was difficult to hear what the president said there, but I think he said that there were significant differences. The president there saying that this agreement between Israel and Hezbollah and Lebanon to enact this ceasefire deal along with France, another significant player, is a critical step in advancing a vision of peace for the region.The president repeating multiple times that peace is possible. He talked about lasting security for Israel not being achieved solely on the battlefield. He talked about diplomacy being a significant factor here. He said that this ceasefire would take effect at 4 a.m. and it is, in his mind, designed to be permanent. But he added that if Hezbollah or any other actor breaks the terms of this deal, that Israel has a right to self-defense. He also called it a new start for the people of Lebanon.",

We're going to see, of course, what happens now that Israel is turning its attention away from Lebanon and back towards Gaza.Let's go now to CNN international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson, who's live for us in Jerusalem.

People are going to spend about $900 on holiday gifts this season.The but is that sales growth is expected to be moderate or normal, the lowest level that we've seen in five years. Sales growth this year, about 3.3 percent. Compare that to about the average we've seen over the past couple years, 4.3 percent. And that is because shoppers are being more discretionary with their spending. This year, Americans have 30 percent more debt than they did last Christmas. And so you have retailers fighting over every dollar that people are going to spend. Target, for example, had really slow sales in the third quarter. So they are ramping up sales and promotions in the fourth quarter around the holiday season to bring people in. Foot Locker, on the other hand, guys, they learned their lesson last year. They got stuck with too much inventory, so they are not offering as many sales and promotions. The one thing that all retailers know this year, the holiday shopping season is a week shorter. So less time for people to do their shopping. But that could mean some good news if you're a last minute shopper. If stores have inventory, they're going to move that inventory really quick. You could see some good deals if you're a last minute shopper, guys.",
