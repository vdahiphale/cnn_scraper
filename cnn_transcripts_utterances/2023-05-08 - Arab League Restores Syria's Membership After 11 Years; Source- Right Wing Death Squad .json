Texas mourns the eight people killed in a mass shooting at a shopping mall. The Arab League readmit Syria after an 11-year absence. And F1's Max Verstappen claims victory at the Miami from Prix. Well, evil has returned and will be defeated. Words from Ukraine's President comparing Russia to Nazi Germany while marking the end of World War II. The evidence of that evil one may argue look no further than here. A punishing wave of Russian strikes fired across the country overnight. Ukraine says it shut down all 35 drones launched at the Capitol but the debris left a ragged trail of destruction. Meanwhile, Russian-controlled areas of Zaporizhzhia are said to be under fire from Ukraine. Some 1600 people had been evacuated from towns along the front lines. One of the big flashpoints of this wall is Eastern Ukraine and the city of Bakhmut. The Russian Wagner group was supposed to be in its final days of fighting there. But instead, its leader is now claiming new gains. CNN's Nick Payton Walsh explains. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Remember, he appeared in front of a collection of his own dead mercenaries behind him saying that they have died because of a lack of ammunition shell. So, he's sort of been having this public conversation almost with himself, with the exception of a brief comment by the Kremlin spokesperson saying that he was aware of media reports about it. But it's been a startling moment, frankly, of dissent inside the Kremlin ranks very rare indeed. And at a very important time to ahead of tomorrow's Victory Day parades inside of Moscow, where Russia talks about his victory over the Nazis. They had indeed almost vowed to take the key city of Bakhmut where Prigozhin is based by that day. That's not going to happen. And instead, we've had this remarkable statement where he unilaterally said we're leaving because we haven't got what we want. Quite what led him to change his mind here. We will probably never know. But it added to that general sense in the last week or so that there were increasing members of Russia's elite, making very vocal comments about how badly the war is going. This just ahead of Ukraine's counter offensive showing signs of being underway at this point. A bad message to Russian troops in the ranks. Already experiencing low munition, low morale. Certainly, overnight though, we've seen some -- again evidence of how Russia is likely to respond to when Ukrainian advances. 35 drones launched at the Capitol Kyiv. All of them taken out but five people injured from the debris falling from the sky and separately eight missiles attacking the port city of Odesa where one nightwatchman in a warehouse that was struck was killed. So, Russia continuing to lash out, sending these messy signals about dissent and its own ranks and Ukraine staying relatively quiet on its military maneuvers. But showing signs that it's counter offensive is underway. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Last estimate from the Defense Intelligence here was 369,000 troops, Russian troops inside Ukraine. That's triple the number at the time of the invasion. The defenses are very heavily well dug in. This will be for the Ukrainians, a tough offensive, but it's one that they must win. And it's one that they must use the psychological warfare, the strategy of trying to deceive the enemy in one area and attack them in another. But the vital fact that they all understand a no to be true, is that they must break through, that they must show that they can get a strong and fast advance to put pressure on Russia and create chaos in the Russian ranks. And show their political and military allies in the West that the investment of money and equipment and support has been worthwhile. They're aware that Western backing for Ukraine is potentially at stake or the level of backing. If they can't convince that they can -- that they can take territory back this year, they're worried that a stalemate could develop and political sustainability among their allies maybe harder to maintain this level of support.",

Now I'm told by authorities and law enforcement sources familiar with this investigation that their investigation of the motive is starting to narrow down to possible right-wing extremism being at play here. And that is because after the suspect was shot and killed by a police officer, as this mass shooting was occurring, authorities found on the gunman and insignia that read RDWS which authorities believe stands for Right-Wing Death Squad. It's the same type of insignia that we've seen extremists here in the United States were at various protests over the past few years. And I'm also told that authorities have been digging through the suspect's social media he had an extensive online presence. I'm told -- the authorities believed that he made several posts pertaining to white supremacy and neo-Nazis. And so again, authorities they don't yet know the full specific motive but they are starting to narrow that down based on the suspects past communications.

There is historyof conflict between them and the Hindu Meiteis who make up more than half of the population and dominate state government. Their push to be recognized as an official tribe to get better access to health care, education and government jobs has caused concern among the Christian groups who believe they will be at a disadvantage. While most of the fighting has now subsided, the problems at the core of this conflict remain far from resolved. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

People fled to Manipur from Myanmar and theybelong to the smaller communities, the hill tribes that are now fighting against the Hindu community, the Meiteis. So, that has led to further clashes, further issues between the two communities over the last two years. As of now, there's a fragile calm in Manipur. We're hoping it last. Becky?",

      "sentences": "Hi, Becky. Yes. I guess when you're a serial winner, like Max Verstappen everyone wants a piece of you, right?And I think Formula One fans, they're very partisan. You know, they want their guy to win. They want their team to win. And Verstappen is just doing what he does best. And I think that actually is a source of motivation to him as third victory of the season. He's won back-to-back Miami Grand Prix now. There's only ever been two at the Miami Grand Prix. He's going for a third consecutive drivers title as well. I will say his Red Bull teammates Sergio Perez is making a real challenge as best he can. He's already had victories to his name this season. It's a long season ahead though, Becky, and I think it's going to be a very compelling one indeed. But that's the key line here. Verstappen looking for a third straight driver's title. And by the way, three races, three Grand Prix is in the U.S. this year as well. Austin and Las Vegas to come. Back to you.",
