Almost a week after Helene dumped a devastating amount of water on the region, 40 trillion gallons of rain. That`s like more than all of the water in Lake Tahoe coming down on the region in just a matter of days. That unleashed unprecedented floods and landslides that destroyed towns and infrastructure. What we`re seeing there is heartbreaking. The death toll from the storm continues to rise. Many people remain missing, perhaps unable to leave their location or contact family as communications infrastructure in some places are nearly non-existent. Officials are working around the clock to clear roads and debris. One nonprofit, World Central Kitchen, has been helping to feed folks who have been affected in the area, even sending a helicopter to areas that are only accessible by air. CNN`s Gary Tuchman takes us to see how and why it`s still so difficult to access some of the areas that have been hit. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

This road is treacherous even in the best of times, when it rains, it`s even more treacherous. But now it has been devastated from the remnants of the storm. You could see the guard rail is gone. The drop here off the side of the road, which has been so heavily damaged about a hundred feet down. Cars are not supposed to be on here anymore. There are also houses below. We`ve talked to some people who live in the area. They said they were trying to get down to the house to see if people they know are still there because they haven`t been able to find out what happened to those people, but they weren`t able to hike down and neither are we. We have been told that there had been helicopter rescues of people who live in the homes below. But there`s absolutely no way to know for sure if there are still people who are in those homes that have been damaged below us. We decided to go down the hill farther and what we saw is the literal and figurative end of the road. The devastation of the storm, look what it led to. This is the street right here and you can see that the street just comes to an end before plunging down here. These boulders that are right here, the locals here say these boulders actually moved from the force of the storm.",

In 1895, the tugboat John Evenson was lost after colliding with a larger steamer in Wisconsin`s Sturgeon Bay Canal. The wreck was widely reported, but search efforts didn`t start until the 1980s and with no success. A local dive club even offered a cash reward for the discovery, but still no luck. Then in September of 2024, maritime historians Brendon Baillod and Bob Jaeck combined historical records with modern search tech and headed out on a planned three-day expedition.
