Your assessment of -- of this convention, there were a lot of nerves going into this week. A lot of nerves about what might take place inside the convention hall. A lot of nerves about what might take place outside the convention hall. But relatively drama free convention, what do you think? LT. GOV. JULIANA STRATTON (D-IL): Well, it absolutely was a drama free convention by and large. I mean, I think that we planned, well, a couple of years of planning. We had on every level, from law enforcement, Secret Service, the FBI, lots of other partners, and, of course, an incredible host committee and team of volunteers, organizers, so many people who have come together. Of course, Governor Pritzker being the governor, leading and inviting everyone to our great state, along with Senator Tammy Duckworth and so many other elected officials. It just was a beautiful week, and we're excited about the top of the ticket with Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walz.

She wants to be the president for all Americans.She wants to make sure that she uplifts every community and ensures that people have a fair shot at living the life that they desire. On the other side, we have in -- as a contrast, Donald Trump and J.D. Vance, who want to take us backwards, strip us of our rights, who don't want to uplift all Americans, but want to be focused on themselves, and, you know, their billionaire friends.

And I think we're at this place. I think one of the things she said that last night that really struck me was, this is not just one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime. But she said this is one of the most consequential elections in the history of our nation, in the history of our democracy. We are at the precipice of being able to say we are going to protect everything that we value, what this country was built on, and how do we move forward with that, versus something that will really, quite frankly, just destroy it. And -- and we just can't do that. And so to see the flags flying and to see everyone talking about freedom, this is showing that we, as Democrats, we welcome everyone to come under this big tent and say, we are Americans, we are patriots, and we want to say we are here to move the United States of America forward with the right leader.

They further endanger women's lives, because pregnant women can withstand a lot of blood loss. They can withstand a lot of insult up until the moment that they can't.And so at what point is a woman's life in danger? You cannot legislate that. You need to leave that decision making to the patient and to her medical care providers. We don't need anti-choice politicians in our hospitals and in our examining rooms making those decisions. The medical nuance is important, and it needs to be left to patients and their doctors. We need to trust women, as Vice President Harris so aptly put it.",
