Plus, violent clashes on college campuses. Reports of Tasers and tear gas used on pro-Palestinian protesters, as a major university cancels its main graduation. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, a breathtaking day in the Trump trials. Two hugely consequential moments happening in two separate court rooms, two separate cities at the very same time. Cross-examination beginning for the first key witness in Trump's criminal trial here in Manhattan and in Washington, the Supreme Court hearing, Trump's immunity claim happened as well. The former president is spending his day in that Manhattan courtroom as he's required to do. And on his way out, he noted the significance.

And you do it inside letter like most editors do, in the first page, here's what's in the issue and all that. But they thought it was a conflict of interests for Arnold to be actively involved in the position, so he resigned his position very publicly at this event, and Arnold holds every year in Columbus, Ohio, the Arnold Classic, which is a bodybuilding event which in itself is a trip walking through that and Pecker comes on stage. I introduce Pecker, and Pecker comes on stage and he's a showman. He's a real showman. And then it brings out Arnold. Crowd goes wild and then he says, Arnold, and were going to the -- congratulations on being governor and all that. We're so thrilled, you're still going to be connected, but with the magazines because we know so much a party you and as this competition shows that your life but you won't. We're not -- he's not going to pay Arnold says, I'm going to donate my salary to charity. So \"The Los Angeles Times\" does a deep dive into this relationship because AMI, even though they weren't publicly traded stock, they were publicly traded bonds. So they had to do the same kind of reporting. And they found that a shell company and traced it back to Schwarzenegger. So he gets the money and then became obviously a major bone of contention in this piece to show the Arnold was trying to make money off of being governor the same way Trump made money being president.
