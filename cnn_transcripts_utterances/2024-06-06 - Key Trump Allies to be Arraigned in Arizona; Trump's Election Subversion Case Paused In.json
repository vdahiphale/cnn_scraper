      "sentences": "In the next hour, key Trump allies are set to be arraigned in Arizona for their roles in the state's fake elector scheme. Among them, Arizona State Senator Jake Hoffman, who was one of the fake electors who allegedly attempted to submit false documents to the National Archive, claiming that Donald Trump had won the State of Arizona.Former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, who was also indicted in the case, is required to appear in court, but He hasn't yet given a specific date when he plans to turn himself in. He did, however, say he plans to do it next week. In Georgia, the election subversion case against Donald Trump and several of his co-defendants is now paused indefinitely, delivering a massive legal victory for the former president, who is hoping to push these legal issues into 2025, perhaps, at least -- at the very least, until after the 2024 election. The appeals court in Georgia ruling the case there cannot go forward until a panel of judges decides whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is disqualified. Now, the D.A. can ask the appeals court to fast track that case. The timeline, though, is completely up to the court. And happening in the next hour, Steve Bannon will be in a U.S. District Court over a Justice Department request to have him begin serving his four-month prison sentence. prison sentence. Trump's former adviser was convicted nearly two years ago of contempt of Congress after defying a subpoena involving the January 6th Capitol riots. CNN Political Correspondent Sarah Murray is live outside U.S. Sister Court in Washington. So, Sarah, what are we expecting in court today?",

      "sentences": "Well, Erica, this is really a continuing legal fight about whether it's time for Steve Bannon to face the repercussions of his decision to defy that House Committee that was investigating the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol. As you pointed out, it was years ago when Steve Bannon was convicted. It was July 2022, where a jury found him guilty of two counts of contempt of Congress for refusing to provide testimony and refusing to provide documents to that House Committee investigating January 6th. The judge sentenced him to four months behind bars for that.But the judge put a hold on his sentence and allowed Bannon to remain free while he appealed his conviction. His first crack at that appeal, though, failed. The appeals court rejected it, upheld his conviction. Now, the Justice Department says it's time for Bannon to be behind bars. Bannon's attorneys say he deserves more time to ask the full appeals court to revisit this decision and go to the Supreme Court if necessary, Erica.",

It comes as some of the former president's allies are being arraigned today in Arizona for the election subversion case in that state.Joining me now, CNN senior political commentator and former specialist assistant to President George W. Bush, Scott Jennings, and CNN political commentator and former South Carolina State Representative Bakari Sellers. Good to see you both this morning. So, Bakari, I want to start with you in terms of what is happening in Georgia. This case now paused indefinitely while we wait to hear from the appeals court. I gave two of your titles, but my friend, you are also an attorney. So, for the folks playing at home, this is what I'm going to have you put on your legal hat here. What are the chances that they would, in fact, fast track this case given its implications with an upcoming election?",

The fact is, there's no legal grounds to remove her. And so, this case will happen. The question is whether or not it's going to happen in early 2025 or later in 2025.RICO cases in Georgia are very, very difficult to bring. They take a lot of time and all I have to do is point the -- point your viewers to the case right now of Young Thug. It's a RICO case. It took eight months to see the jury and it's still ongoing right now and may go into next year. And so, these cases take a while anyway. This is somewhat of a self-inflicted wound by Fani Willis. However, there's no legal grounds to remove her. So, they should fast track it. They simply won't because of politics.",

All of those are fair. She's not ethically compromised. She did not do anything illegal.In fact, you have to have more than the appearance of impropriety in the State of Georgia if you go by the rule of law. Donald Trump is going to have his day in court. It was never going to be had in the State of Georgia prior to 2024. So, that's somewhat of a red herring. These RICO cases just take too long to bring. And so, the question is, when in 2025 will this happen? Like, you know, when does he want to be cooked? Does he want to be cooked now or does he want to be cooked later? That's the question. His time will come. And Fani Willis will be the one who prosecutes him. She brought a legitimate case. She brought a sound case. Some of his co-defendants have already pled guilty. And this is the case and probably the only case where Donald Trump actually has exposure to jail time. And so, he's scared. He should be.",

And you see it sort of showing up in the polling.

Some of it is wrapped up in this.So, do the individual cases You know, cause drastic movements of the needle on a daily basis in these states. No, but I think the overall topic does put something of an anvil on the Trump campaign as voters decide whether that's more important to them or are things like the economy, you know, immigration and other issues that they're weighing in their daily lives.",

      "sentences": "Erica, this is the most significant testimony we have heard so far in this trial. To kick off her time on the stand, Hallie Biden described how she became romantically involved with Hunter Biden, who was, of course, her brother-in-law. She is the widow of his late brother, Beau Biden. She said it began after Beau died in 2015 and described their relationship as beginning gradually.She also said that she occasionally saw Hunter with very large crack rocks that were the size of ping pong balls. She said that she witnessed Hunter smoke crack cocaine in the past and was even with him when he bought drugs from various dealers in Washington, D.C. She also testified that she had conversations with him about his drug use in 2017 and 2018. And she testified that sometimes he would say, look, just leave me alone. Other times he said that he was going to handle his addiction his way. Now, our reporters inside the court, of course, there are no cameras, that's why I'm reading off of these notes we're getting from our reporters inside, they note that Hunter has been watching her very attentively as she testifies. Now, she also testified that Hunter introduced her to crack in 2018 and that she abused the drug. She said that it was a terrible experience and she is embarrassed and ashamed and regrets that period of her life. Now, she says that she quit in August 2018, and that is significant because that's pretty close to the time in question in terms of the criminal charges at the heart of this case. The gun that he purchased was bought in October 2018. And so far, no witnesses or direct evidence has established that Hunter Biden was indeed using or addicted to illegal drugs in October 2018, but then she provided testimony that could potentially make the prosecutor's case. Erica, she said that on October 23, 2018, she went to clean out Hunter's car. And while he was asleep and she found drugs and that gun. She said, I found remnants of crack cocaine and drug paraphernalia. And this was alongside the gun that she actually took and then threw in a dumpster at a local store. Now, this is incredibly significant because this is the first person who has been able to take the stand and testify that they have some evidence that Hunter Biden may have been either using or addicted to drugs at the time in question. Now, I would expect that defense attorneys are going to point out the fact that she has not said that she personally witnessed him using drugs, but this is incredibly damaging for the defense.",
