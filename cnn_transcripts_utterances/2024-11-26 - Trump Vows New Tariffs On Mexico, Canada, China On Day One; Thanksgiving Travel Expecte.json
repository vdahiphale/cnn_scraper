And also boosting tariffs on Chinese products by 10 percent.Trump announced his plan on social media. He says it's in retaliation for illegal immigration and illicit drugs coming across the border, and that he's going to begin this on his first day in office.",

CNN's Matt Egan joins us now live. Matt, a lot of numbers there. But for the average American shopper, the cost of tariffs is ultimately passed on to them.",

      "sentences": "That's right, Boris and Brianna. Look, this certainly looks like the opening salvo of the next Trump trade war.And I think the big question here is whether or not it's going to undermine another war, the war on inflation. And it's just too early to say. Right? Because there's so many unknowns. I mean, will Trump actually go forward and impose these tariffs or will he reach some sort of agreement that allows him to back down? If he does impose the tariffs, how long do they stay in place? And how do businesses react? We know, in the past, they have passed along costs to consumers. But it's unclear whether or not they're definitely going to do the same thing now. I think, at a minimum, it's safe to say that these threatened tariffs, they have the potential to cause chaos for businesses, to invite retaliation from our trading partners and, yes, to raise costs for consumers. And remember, what Trump is threatening to do here is much bigger in scale than what he did during the first term. These are massive tariffs across the board. They are not targeted or surgical. Let's just look at Canada. I mean, the U.S. imported over $400 billion of goods from Canada last year alone, everything from minerals, cement, wood, paper goods and oil. That's why GasBuddy's Patrick De Haan told CNN's Jim Acosta earlier today that if these tariffs go into place, they could cause gas prices in certain areas in the Rockies and Midwest to go up by $0.25 to $0.75 a gallon. That would certainly be inflationary. And we know Americans are fed up with high prices at the grocery store. But we rely on Mexico to get agricultural products, including 89 percent of the avocados that are imported into the U.S. -- they come from Mexico -- 91 percent of the tomatoes. So, of course tariff hikes would increase those food costs. And look, I think that all of this shows that Trump really means business when it comes to tariffs. As one analyst put it this morning, Trump 2.0 is all gas, no brakes. And despite all the focus on his cabinet picks, at the end of the day, he's the one calling the shots on tariffs.",

TSA says things are moving relatively smoothly. They've screened about five million people since the start of this week, 2.8 million people anticipated at airports nationwide today, 2.9 million people at airports nationwide tomorrow. I spoke with TSA Administrator David Pekoske, and I want you to listen to him now. He says that the standard for screening, getting people through the TSA checkpoint, if you have pre-check, is about 10 minutes. If you don't have pre-check, it's about 30 minutes. But things, he says, may be so busy. That, in some cases, airports will simply be too slammed. This is what he told me. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So this would reinterpret the statute to allow coverage for the treatment of obesity, treating it as a chronic disease. And we know that these medications are so expensive. They can cost about $1,000 a month. So that's why expanding access appears to be a priority for the Biden administration. But like you said, Boris, we don't know if this proposal will be finalized. We're hearing there's not enough time to make this final before Biden leaves office. So it would kind of roll over for consideration under the Trump administration.
