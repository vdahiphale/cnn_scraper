The big question, of course, for the Harris campaignIf they can, they will open so many more paths to 270 electoral votes. You'll remember Biden unexpectedly flipped Georgia in 2020, but he was badly trailing there earlier this summer. Now, we have this new FOX News poll. It shows Trump and Harris neck neck-and-neck, not just in Georgia, but also in the Sun Belt states of Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina. If you take a look at the same FOX News polls taken earlier in the year, while President Joe Biden was still in the race, Trump was the clear favorite: five- to six-point lead, safely outside the margin of error. So, then Trump was winning. Now, it's basically tied. Sources I've talked to in both parties say that Kamala Harris hasn't nailed these states down yet, especially Georgia. And the big question is whether she can. They do say she has an opportunity that Biden never had. And Trump seems to be quite aware of it, because he is suddenly trying to end a long-standing feud with the state's Republican governor, Brian Kemp. This is Georgia's Republican governor, who he had mocked on stage at a rally earlier this month.

And so, Kamala Harris -- and this is -- it's almost been miraculous, but she's put that coalition back together in a matter of a month. And so now you're in sort of the persuasion part, right? Where she's got to figure out how to get to swing voters who, you know -- what I've heard from voters about Kamala Harris now for years is they're, like, well, I don't know anything about her. I don't see her. I don't know what she does. Right? And so, she's having this moment right now to sort of reintroduce herself to these voters. And I've done nothing but focus groups since this race changed. Like I'm doing them almost every day now, because I'm trying to get a handle on what voters are thinking. And post-DNC, what they've been saying is, you know, I like her positive message. I still need to learn more about her. But right now, it's -- it's a big contrast with what -- they've talked about the RNC as a \"doom and gloom\" type event. And they were sort of tired of the negative message. And so, they're kind of into what she's selling. And they're taking a look at her for the first time and thinking, you know, I could get there, but they're not there yet. And so, I think what you're seeing in those numbers is she's put her coalition back together. And now she's got to figure out how to get to -- you know, and a lot of that is young voters. It's black voters. It's Hispanic voters that Biden was lagging with. Now she's got to figure out, how do I get more sort of white working- class voters? Maybe white working-class women is, I think, a place where she could really push ahead. Because Donald Trump, as you can see, his support is very consistent. He's hit his ceiling.

So I think people making a huge deal out of the fact that she's not doing it by herself, I think it's a ridiculous thing to make a big deal out of. I would also say that this is an important place to show the two of them together, how they are together. We've seen it on the campaign trail. We've seen it on the stage. But this showing how they interact together is going to be an important thing for voters to see and for voters to do. And I'm sure they will do individual interviews as time goes by, but this is a historical interview that they will do together to show who they are. HUNT: Stephen Collinson, I mean, this -- this is -- they've waited a little bit of time to do this, to the point that they were getting criticism for not doing it sooner.

It makes total sense that the very first one, she sits down with her vice president. It's just a natural thing people do. And I'll tell you, maybe people are playing the expectations game. Obviously, we've all been seeing, over the last few years, the Republicans put together a lot of supercuts of her kind of losing her train of thought or make it sound, you know, like some word salad stuff. I've been genuinely impressed with how she has sounded since she got to sort of be her own voice, right? I think it's hard to be the vice president and carry somebody else's message. But she seems pretty comfortable so far carrying her own message. But I think tonight, she is going to have to answer policy questions. But if she does that well, you know, I think that after that, they should do 100 interviews. Because I think when you put a lot of pressure on just one interview, it like, raises the stakes in a way that I don't think is productive.

When it comes to prices of food, when it comes to housing, you know, voters still really feel behind, and they blame Biden. They seem to be giving her a fresh look on the economy. And so, I think for her, being able to both say the good parts of the Biden recovery that America recovered after the pandemic. But that we're not doing nearly enough for the middle class. You heard some of that in her DNC speech. I think she's really got to go on offense on the economy. And she's got to go on offense on immigration. That's another thing she did in her speech. It's one of the biggest vulnerabilities that she has with these swing voters. And she's got to find a way but not to own that.

It's completely fair game for them to bring up the Afghan issue, the Abbey Gate, how the withdrawal was managed.But that particular section of the cemetery, for anyone sort of who lived through 9/11, it's particularly poignant. Because it's almost within sight of the Pentagon, where one of the planes went in. You see all the young people lying there, ages of 18, 19, 20, who died in the wars that followed that terrorist attack. And to have it caught up in a political event, it seems undignified.
