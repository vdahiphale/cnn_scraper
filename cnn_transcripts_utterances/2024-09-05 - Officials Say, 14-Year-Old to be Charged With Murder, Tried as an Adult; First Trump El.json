But we're also learning about the caliber style of weapon that was used, an AR-15.The community, though, really focused on the victims and trying to huddle around the families that were impacted by this late last night, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, releasing the names of those victims, two of them students, just 14-years-old. One of them identified as Mason Schermerhorn, the other classmate, Christian Angulo, two of them teachers, those adults, one of them a 53-year-old math teacher, Christina Irimie, and the other Richard Aspinwall, who also was a coach on the football team, a defensive coordinator. The 39-year-old was a teacher here. He was beloved. And, in fact, we interviewed a student of his who described him as just being a really sweet person. Among the other victims, though, that were injured nine all together, eight of them students, one of them an adult. And yesterday we're bringing you details of that adult who we know that was shot in the stomach, was in surgery yesterday during the hours that I was reporting, still waiting on an update on their condition. But we are getting new information from the students here who were eyewitnesses. And it was yesterday my colleague, Isabel Rosales, caught up with one of the students here impacted by the tragedy.

When you look at the system and ask, well, did the system work, tips came in from the public, that's people on the internet who saw this threat to shoot up a school coming from a handle on a gaming website.They then sent that to an FBI threat line that you can reach online, which goes to the NTOC, the National Threat Operations Center. They then take those tips and they run it down. Where's this IP address where this threat came from? Who's the subscriber? Does it have a physical address? They then forward that to Jackson County Sheriff in Georgia. And Jackson County does not drop the ball. They send investigators out. They go to the house. They ask, you know, is there somebody here that uses that computer? Yes, we have a son. Are there guns in the house? Yes, there are, but they're locked away and he doesn't have access to them. They question a 13-year-old boy, who turns out to be our shooter a year later, and he says, that wasn't me. You know, somebody else must have done that threat to make it look like me. So, they end up closing the case because it's not arrestable. It's probably not prosecutable. He's 13 years old. They even notified the local school district. But when they move from Jackson County to Barrow County, that information we don't know whether that followed the Jackson County School to the Barrow County School. It's unlikely, but at that point, instead of looking at authorities who checked all the boxes, you really have to shift that look to where was the concern in that home? What was the level of that concern by the parents? How did they engage that child about that threat? And obviously if that gun came from the house, there's another issue there.",

Or it could be a sign that he is feeling ostracized, that he is feeling as an outsider. We find that as a common theme in some of these young people involved in school shootings. And it has become a part of the school doctrine to kind of look for these signs if there are concerns to report them.Even the school had that electronic system that they installed a week ago. I think it's called Syngenix (ph), where they press one button. The entire school goes on alert that there's an emergency or an active shooter. It goes into lockdown. This technology goes then right to the police, to the front office. Police can see on their devices where people are in the school floor plans, maps. There's another company that came after the Fort Lauderdale shooting by an entrepreneur named Gino Roefaro, who set up SaferWatch. It does all that, but it also has an anonymous tip function where if someone has concerns about someone who may hurt people or may be contemplating self-harm, that you can report that.
