I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And we begin this hour with breaking news on the ever-changing status and tone of the high stakes debt talks. Just moments ago we learned that President Biden has agreed to meet with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy tomorrow in the nation's capital. And staff level talks between the two sides will resume in just a few hours. The two men agreeing to a one-on-one meeting after what McCarthy called a productive phone call today with the president as he flew home from the G7 aboard Air Force One. And before departing Japan, Biden painted a grim picture telling reporters that he cannot guarantee the U.S. will not default in 11 days when the U.S. government runs out of money and is unable to pay its bills. We've got team coverage of these new developments. Phil Mattingly is in Japan at the G7 summit. But let's begin with Melanie Zanona on Capitol Hill. So Melanie, Speaker McCarthy just spoke about his call with the president on Capitol Hill. What did he say?",

Speaker McCarthy said they talked about a number of things. It was a cordial phone call. They talked about debt ceiling. They talked about the president's trip abroad but perhaps most importantly is that they agreed to continue talking. President Biden and McCarthy will meet in person tomorrow and some of the key negotiators are going to continue to meeting later today. Here's a little bit more about what Kevin McCarthy said of that phone call. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: I believe it was a productive phone call. And so at the end of the phone call what we agreed to do is we're going to have Congressmen Garret Graves and Patrick McHenry get back together with -- he's going to ask his team to get back together so we can walk them through literally what we've been talking about. I think some of the challenges here is they might not completely understand how we're coming about this. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Sometimes the negotiators just need to step away, cool off, take some time to reset.So now that Biden is back in the country perhaps what we could see is some movement forward. But I would caution here that the two sides are still very far apart. And sources tell me that the biggest sticking point is spending levels. Republicans want to impose fiscal 2022 levels on future spending. The White House wants to freeze spending so essentially sticking where we are now, which they said still would amount to cuts over time when you account for inflation which is how the score keepers score it. But Republicans say that is not enough. So all the other sticking points that also need to be resolved, none of that is going to fall in place until they can resolve this big issue which is the spending cuts. And on top of there being, you know, wide gaps between the two sides, there is also the time line. Kevin McCarthy initially had said he wanted a deal in principle by either today or tomorrow in order to be able to move this through in time to avoid a default. So the clock is ticking and the stakes couldn't be higher.",

It's what he's wanted for several months when the White House has been unwilling to negotiate because they don't think you should negotiate over raising the debt ceiling.That appears to be where things are headed. Staff level discussions on a regular basis and the two principals trying to hash things out. That is a kind of formula that works traditionally if you look at past precedent. The problem right now again it's not only the two is you have 11 days to figure this out. This is not an easy process and it is not just about can the two leaders reach an agreement. Can the two negotiating teams reach an agreement. Then you have to make sure that the votes are there. How many Republicans can you lose? How many Democrats can you lose. That's something White House officials have been trying to map out and game out. And then how do you actually get it across the House and the Senate floors and to the president's desk for his signature. This is a very compressed time line. The two sides are very far apart. However, given how bad things appeared to be over the course of the last 24 hours, this is progress. The question is does this develop into anything real because they simply don't have time for anything else, Fred.",

Here he is, Congressman John Garamendi. He is a Democratic representative from California and a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee. Congressman, great to see you. I mean I wonder, do you agree with, you know, what Phil Mattingly was just saying and that this is late in the game. At the same time perhaps was this or is this part of President Biden's strategy, does he find this is advantageous to be at this juncture on the eve of a face-to-face meeting with Kevin McCarthy? REP. JOHN GARAMENDI (D-CA): Well Fred, it's good to be with you this morning and Phil did a good job laying out some of the issues. But the reality is Congress rarely acts ahead of a very serious deadline. Really, I've been around long enough both in the state and the federal level to know that it is up to the last moment when people have to either give in or pay the consequences of not doing so. We're not quite there yet. 11 days out. We're going to see some back and forth. But the president has been very, very clear. It is wrong. It is wrong to use the debt limit which has catastrophic economic effects in the United States and around the world as a fulcrum (ph) upon which to leverage appropriations. The appropriation process takes place every year. And that remains available to the Republicans in the days ahead. Let's get this debt limit out of the way. And I would hope that when the president lands here in Washington in the hours ahead, that he gets off the plane and he says ok, Mr. McCarthy, we'll meet, but my lawyers are writing up how to use the 14th Amendment to put all of this foolishness behind us. And then you and I, we'll get on, we'll talk about the appropriations process over the next several weeks and months. Why do you think it is important to proceed with the 14th Amendment option? The president said he thinks he could invoke that. You are one of many who penned a letter encouraging the president to do so. I mean do you believe that this is important leverage? Do you believe he does indeed have the authority to use it if and when we get to that point?",

Is that what they're talking about.Do they want children and families to go hungry because parents are unable to find a job and they need the food stamp program? What are they talking about here? So we have to be really careful. There is a lot of hurt. There's a lot of hurt in America. There is a lot of people that are seriously hurting. Hurting for food, hurting for housing, hurting for support, medical support. What are the Republicans talking about here? You either go to work, what kind of work, how many hours a day, where are the jobs, where is the preparation for the work.

It is extremely important who controls the reserve currency around the world. Right now America does. Do you want to hand that to China? Is that what the Republicans want to do? They want to give China one more advantage? They already have other advantages. The reserve currency, China has been trying to make beyond the reserve currency of the world.

Here is what Zelenskyy said earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): I clearly understand what is taking place in Bakhmut and we all clearly understand why all of that is taking place. I cannot share with you the technical views of our military, of our warriors, but as of today, we can see that the country which dozens times is bigger than we are, cannot occupy us, cannot win in this war. And we understand that a bit more and then we will be prevailing. That is why we are acting how we're acting, valuing lives of the people. The hardest is if Bakhmut had some military technical mistake for instance and people could be surrounded. Then all the military know what could happen. How we could create a situation for people not to be captured. Now our people are accomplishing a very important mission. They are now in Bakhmut.

So this may well be apparent (ph) victory for Prigozhin, leader of the mercenaries, because it now creates Bakhmut town which is rubble in any case a free fire kill zone for Ukrainian forces and no doubt they will be taking advantage of that status over the coming days. I think almost inevitably and there has been a lot of hints about that. But this doesn't represent even if they don't manage to do that a very significant tactical step forward for the Russians. It remains a symbolic victory that no doubt and is being drum trumpeted somewhat by the Kremlin because after very many months of bitter fighting and military disasters in Kherson and in the Kharkiv campaigns at the end of the last year, Russia lost ground that it captured very quickly at the beginning of this war and has been on the back foot ever since.

The authorities in El Salvador are saying that they want to get to the bottom of this. They want to start an investigation and the company that manages the Estadio Cuscatlan, the Cuscatlan Stadium which is the largest in the country is being formally investigated earlier today on Sunday. But this is also a test I think, Fredricka, for Bukele himself, the president of El Salvador, who has ruled in the last few years and has cemented his power with a certain disdain frankly for democracy but on the promise that he was the right man to bring back peace, order to a country that has been ravaged by organized crime in the last few decades. And seeing the scenes of total chaos in the largest stadium in the country just a few hundred meters away from the capitol city of El Salvador of course, spells nothing of orderly.

Now, earlier this afternoon, we were able to catch up with them asthey made their way here to Kennedy Space Center, they spent about 10 to 15 minutes saying good-bye to family and friends. As you noted, the Axiom 2 space mission is going to be the second ever private mission to the International Space Station, four crew members are going to be on board. We're talking about Peggy Whitson. She is the commander, a former NASA astronaut with a great deal of experience. She was a commander at the International Space Station and has spent 665 days in space. She was joined by John Shoffner, he is the mission pilot. And they were joined by two Saudi nationals, Ali AlQarni, he is a mission specialist, as well as Rayannah Barnawi. She's also a mission specialist. And she is poised to make some history here later this afternoon with the first Saudi woman in space, the four-member crew is expected to spend eight days at the International Space Station. They just walked out a few seconds ago. You can see them there in their spacesuits, waving and getting ready for this. They're going to essentially undertake well over a dozen experiments during their time at the international space station. We're talking about testing out a new communications system to taking a look at some technology that Axiom 2 says will improve the life of space travelers. They're even going to take a look at some cancer research.

But the golfers are out on the course and we are shaping up into what should be an exhilarating next few hours ahead to see who gets crowned PGA championship winner for this year. A lot of the focus, as you mentioned, on the American player Brooks Koepka. He is a 4 time major winner, but you have to go back to 2019 for the last time he won one of these big 4 of the sports men's majors. In fact, he's won two PGA championships to date in his career. He's trying to win a third. But as you referenced, a lot has happened in his life since then. He's had to overcome injury. He had knee surgery. Last year, he did join the controversial Saudi-backed LIV golf series. And then earlier this, year he took a 2-shot lead in the final round of the Masters, only then to failed to hold off the challenger, the Spanish star Jon Rahm. But he's well aware that there is history on the line here this weekend. And after his 3rd round on Saturday, I asked him what it would mean to add another major to his tally at this point in his career. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BROOKS KOEPKA, PRO-GOLF PLAYER: It would mean a lot. A major championship would mean a lot to anybody. So, yeah, to win one would be fantastic. I mean, I was just told that I think only Tiger and Jack have won 3. That would be pretty special to be on a list in a category with them. So, just got to go out and go play good tomorrow.

This is a 46-year-old cup professional, a PGA head professional teaches golf lessons for a living at a public access course in California. He's had a tournament to remember. He started out with 3 rounds at level par, 70, 70, 70. And he got to play with his idol, Rory McIlroy, out there on the course right now at this hour with 4-time major winner Rory McIlroy. He's just been wearing his heart on his sleeve. He's really full of emotion, as you can expect. The crowd loved him here. The thousands out on the course love him. He's feeding off the energy, and he's produced sizzling golf in return. This is a fairytale run for him to remember. And here's the great start that we all need to take note of, Fred. No PGA professional has ever finished in the top 10 of this tournament. And this tournament goes back 105 years.",
