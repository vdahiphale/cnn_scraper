We'll have two waves of protests in Iran small signs that change could be on the horizon. They're being viewed with skepticism by the international community. U.S. State Department saying the reports are ambiguous and vague at best. Well, it comes up to Iran's Attorney General says the nation's mandatory law that requires women to wear hijabs in public is under public review. Well, there is confusion over another report that the country's so-called morality police are being abolished. These potential moves come amid protests that have engulfed Iran since mid-September. And the demonstrations were knighted by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini who has died in the custody of the morality police. She was detained allegedly for not wearing her hijab probably. Well, let's get some clarification on this developing stories. CNN's Nic Robertson joins us now live from London, good to have you with us, Nic. So is this hijab law seriously under review, and should this potentially be seen as some kind of concession to the protesters?",

      "sentences": "It could be construed that way and that may be the intent of the Attorney General who announcedit and it would be under his purview to be involved in a review of that law. However, it may quite simply be a piece of political theater designed to try to send a signal that the government is listening to the protesters. Of course, the protests have moved on way beyond where they began protesting about the hijab months ago to wanting the removal now of the leadership of Iran. So it's hard to see how what is being perhaps signaled here by the Attorney General can really ameliorate and control the passions on the street, it just isn't clear. And I think the only way to understand that properly, is when the review gets published and that's expected in a couple of weeks. And it also when it's published, it doesn't mean that there couldn't be further reviews. And it doesn't mean necessarily that a review would be implemented, as the review may lay out. So I think we're a long way from having clarity. But it does seem to indicate that some in government see this as a potential to control the anger of people, which just isn't being abated at the moment.",

Themorality police say involvement may not be legal, illegal, direct, explicit involvement in enforcing it, but this is a position that they have come to adopt. So is he signaling some knowledge that he has, rather than actual real, you know, control over the mechanism of controlling the morality police because that's not under his purview. That's under the purview of the Interior Ministry and others. So it's not clear what's going to come, we have heard from one MP saying that a reformed minded MP saying that there was no future for the morality police within the hijab law. But again, this just isn't clear. Is it as vague and ambiguous, as the State Department says, smoke and mirrors, if you will, by the leadership in Iran, or does it lead to something substantive. And certainly the conservatives in Iran know that the international community is watching know that this will be interpreted as weakness of their position, if they try to head off some of the discontent through trying to sort of tinker and change with the laws and the way the morality police work in the country. None of this is clear.",

Take a listen to what it sounded like in Kyiv a short time ago. The sound of air raid sirens blaring across the Capitol, Ukraine's president says his air defense forces intercepted and destroyed most of those Russian missiles. The latest attack appears to be targeting both infrastructure and residential areas. This is the aftermath of the strikes in the Zaporizhzhia region. At least two people were reportedly killed there. The cities of Kryvyi Rih and Odesa both report no electricity and no running water. And like thousands of other people in and around the Capitol, CNN's Will Ripley spent hours in underground shelters; those missiles flew towards the Capitol. You see some of them in the metro station. Will, now thankfully joins us now live now back above the ground.

And then we had to pack up and move downstairs to the underground shelter that they have, in most large buildings across Kyiv, so people who might have been at work or people staying in various hotels probably went down to the shelters in those respective buildings. But there were a lot of people thousands of people who had to basically go underground into the subway stations. And it was either standing room only or a lot of people were kind of sitting on the stairs or just sitting down on the floor. Because that's all you could do. I mean, you have limited, you know, water, bathrooms, food and this is several hours that people are down there, so clearly not a comfortable situation. A lot of people yours truly included, grateful to come back up and breathe some fresh air. And even though the majority of these missiles were reportedly intercepted, the Ukrainian officials say they need a decision from the United States on Patriot missile defense systems. They've been calling for them for months now. And not just Patriot systems, but other advanced systems manufacturing countries like Germany, because the power grid has once again been affected here in Kyiv. There are now scores of people that are without electricity, because the power system is unstable. The same is true in the east in Donetsk and also down south in Dnipropetrovsk and people who are living through this say, well; it is unpleasant, it could be much worse.",

Will Ripley, thanks very much and stay safe. Well, we need to do some video now. Of the Russian president, the Kremlin released images of Vladimir Putin driving on the Kerch Bridge. Now you may recall a large section of that bridge was destroyed in an explosion in early October, becoming a major flashpoint in the war. Putin accused Ukraine of the blast calling it an act of sabotage. The bridge is the only land route that connects mainland Russia to the illegally annexed Crimea. Well, as we have been mentioning, as well, the West is trying to put limits on the Kremlin's ability to fund its war in Ukraine. And to that end, a price cap of $60 a barrel on Russian oil agreed to buy the EU the G7 and Australia has just kicked in. And the U.S. ban on Russian oil imports shipped by sea also now in effect. Be its part the Kremlin says it won't recognize that price cap. And market watchers say the West's tighter sanctions could spark more uncertainty over the energy supply. Right now oil prices have come off earlier highs. CNN's Clare Sebastian is looking into all of this for us joining us live from London. Good to have you with us Clare. So Russia basically saying that it's going to refuse to sell oil at that price cap of $60 a barrel. It already has been working its way around this right selling to India to China to other Asian countries.",

You've seen what they've done with gas supplies to many countries in Europe, Russia's gas exports and are significantly down as a result of this. But we have not yet seen them do this with oil, their most critical export and one that has grown in importance, frankly, as sanctions have eaten in to the rest of the economy. I think the key thing to look at in this regard is that this sanction is a not a finished product. This is a mechanism that has been introduced to show that the West can tighten the screws on Russia's energy supply at $60 a barrel. There's not a lot of damage potentially to Russia's revenue, that there should be a bit according to experts that I've been spoken to, but it could be tightened going forward.",

Russia is the second biggest fossil fuel producer in the world if Russian oil was to come off the market that could lead and it would lead to yet more destabilizing price spikes. So this mechanism is a very delicate balancing act to try to close the loophole in this war whereby Russia has been able to make more not less money from its fossil fuel exports because of the disruption to the market that the war has caused, while also keeping that oil flowing to the world doesn't keep paying the price in terms of higher inflation. I think whether this works, the jury is still out oil prices look pretty steady at the moment. Of course there are demand issues in the oil market to take into account given that we're looking at recession in a lot of particularly the developed world. So that is something that has been factored in there along with of course, the potential for COVID lockdowns to be lifted in China, all of those forces playing into the oil markets today.",

He has been tweeting and I quote, \"when dictatorships know they're in trouble, they begin promising their citizens they will change who they are. These empty promises tend to embolden rather than quell popular demands of fundamental change\". The Iranian regime appears to be entering this stage of its lifecycle.

At the same time, given this as a regime, like most dictatorships that lack credibility with their population, if you suddenly promised them vague offers of change of reform, rather than pour cold water on the protests against you, it could actually project vulnerability to your population and embolden them to continue to protest. And the person who understands this dictator's dilemma better than anyone is Iran's current Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, because he's observed, first with the 1979 revolution that helped bring him to power. And over subsequent years, the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Arab uprisings of 2011 that, as some of the great political philosophers of history have noted Machiavellian Tocqueville, the most dangerous moment for any bad government is when it tries to reform itself. And so Khamenei isn't this dictator's dilemma that if he doesn't offer change, protests will continue. If he does offer change, the protests may actually accelerate.",

It's likely not going to placate popular discontent, and people are going to say; OK, now we've gotten the right to choose what we wear. Now we want the right to choose what we read, what we say, what we eat and drink, whom we love, all freedoms which we take for granted in the West, but which are prohibited inside Iran.

So you have pressure from below. The regime hasn't yet shown signs of splintering either within the security forces are between the security forces and the Supreme Leader.

And China is also allegedly asserting its power well beyond its borders. Some exiles who fled Hong Kong several years ago say China is secretly trying to intimidate them into returning home. CNN's Nina dos Santos reports from London. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NINA DOS SANTOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): For three years Simon Cheng has called London home after fleeing a brutal clamp down on democracy in his native Hong Kong, he sought sanctuary in the UK. But even here he says Beijing's tentacles are never far away.",

I think this is the kind of outrageous demagogic comment that we've got used to from Trump to some extent, he's trying to incite interest, anger among his supporters, this is his political methods. So I think we should take that into account. But at the same time, this is the person who is at the moment, at least the front runner for the Republican nomination for president in 2024. And before that, he's having an extraordinary strong role in the formation of the Republican majority in the new house. He's a very influential figure there; some of his most committed supporters in the house on the Republican Party are seeking to use that majority to punish Biden as a weapon for his political campaign. So that, I think is why we need to take this seriously. As well as the fact that it's yet another indication, not just what Trump's motivation was in inciting the Capitol Insurrection and trying to steal the 2020 election, but the kind of approach he might pursue if he ever got back to the White House after the 2024 election.",

So, you know, that's why I say that it could be an attempt to get some interest to fire up his supporters and to re-launch the kind of political strategies that helped him win the Republican nomination, first of all. But there are an increasing number of Republican politicians who want to get away from this kind of circus, even if Trump's strength still makes it difficult for them to say so publicly. And more significantly, a number of big Republican donors who bankroll GOP presidential campaigns have indicated that they're looking for someone else, perhaps, somebody like Florida Governor, Ron DeSantis, who brings a lot of the ideological currency of Trumpism populist nationalism, but is a bit more of a controlled character and is far more self-disciplined. You know, ever since Trump launched his campaign, he's really struggled to make an impact. He's not really laid out a future program. He's carried on, as you say, on this election denialism that really wasn't successful in the midterm elections, even among some Republican voters.",
