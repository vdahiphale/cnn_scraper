Plus, Israel expanding its war, targeting Hamas in all of Gaza, even in the south where Israel first told Palestinians to flee for safety, the new strikes, as influential voices speak up today in the U.N. calling out Hamas atrocities from October 7th, largely on condemned crimes by the international community. Women sexually assaulted and raped by Hamas. And a Jewish and Israeli restaurants owner targeted and taunted by a mob. This is the latest supercharge moment of antisemitism in America. (MUSIC)",

In fact, when you sort of survey the rank and file evangelical pastor around the country, as I've done over the last couple of years, I think there's almost a resignation to the idea that, you know, Trump, for the short term, probably the intermediate term at least, as a pretty good hold on a lot of their congregants, and that they're not going to deviate from him anytime soon.But Bob Vander Plaats has had a long running feud with Trump. In fact, some of the reporting that's come out of my book, around Trump using disparaging vulgar language to refer to certain Iowa evangelicals, that was aimed toward Bob Vander Plaats himself, among others. So there's no surprise that he would endorse Ron DeSantis. I don't think that there's any question that Trump retains an overwhelming lead among white evangelicals in Iowa and elsewhere. I think the question really, at least in a political frame, Jake, is that whether Trump is winning big majorities of these voters, both in the primary and in the general, but how many of these voters show up next November? Is there any fallout because of the Trump exhaustion we see with some of these evangelicals?",

I only curse on air when, generally speaking, when I'm quoting someone.How do Trump supporting evangelicals square that? The fact that he was ignorant about Scripture? Not to mention all the other ways in which Donald Trump is not exactly square with the good book. Did they just ignore it? Are they just happy with the fact that he was very responsible for the overturning of Roe v. Wade? How did they justify it to themselves?",

They shut down our churches, transgenderism on the march, all of these things.And they will point to that and say, look, you know, desperate times call for desperate measures. Donald Trump did this, you know, if you feel as though barbarians are at the gates, then you might just be willing to turn to a barbarian to do your fighting for you. Our mutual friend and my boss, Jeff Goldberg, said this to me the other day. He said you're almost describing this like a mercenary relationship. And I said, that's kind of exactly what it is. For people who feel that they are threatened in this way, they're willing to turn to a man who shares none of their values, and in fact, perhaps, that is their greatest attraction to him.",

But again, we heard Trump even in his rhetoric on the campaign trail a couple of weeks ago saying -- floating this idea that nobody would be able to come to this country as a migrant moving forward unless they are Christian. So, effectively, a religious litmus test. So you have real strands of Christian nationalism now that are infecting the highest echelons of the Republican Party, and that's something the country's going to have to address sooner rather than later.",
