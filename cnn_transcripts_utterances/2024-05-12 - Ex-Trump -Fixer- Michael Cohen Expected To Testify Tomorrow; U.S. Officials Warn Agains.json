Former president Donald Trump's hush money trial is preparing for the star witness to finally take the stand. Tomorrow, Trump's former fixer and attorney, Michael Cohen, is expected to testify. Cohen's testimony is seen as key for the prosecution's case and could signal the final stages of this historic trial. He will testify to his role in negotiating the alleged hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels on Trump's behalf and how his former boss reimbursed him. It follows a week of blockbuster, contentious and at times graphic testimony from Daniels. CNN's Zach Cohen is joining us right now. So Zach, what can we expect from Michael Cohen's testimony because what's crucial to the prosecution's case is tying it to the fraudulent business records.",

      "sentences": "Exactly right, Fred. And this is the moment we've all been waiting for. Michael Cohen is the only witness who can speak to the two critical parts that you just mentioned.One is tying Donald Trump to that decision to pay Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election, that decision to buy, catch and kill unflattering stories about Donald Trump in an effort to protect him and his presidential bid. And the second part of this is the decision after Donald Trump was elected president. This February 2017 meeting where Donald Trump allegedly agreed to the way Michael Cohen would be reimbursed for that hush money payment. Michael Cohen, again, the only witness that we've heard from who can connect both -- Donald Trump to both of those key pieces of the prosecution's case. But look, the jury has already heard plenty about Michael Cohen from other witnesses who have testified over the last three weeks, and most of it has been frankly unflattering. They painted him has an aggressive, impulsive attorney who was really loyal to Donald Trump. And would go too extreme steps to protect the former president, both when he was just a private citizen and a candidate for president. And then also after he was in the oval office. And we can expect on Trump's attorneys to really go after Michael Cohen when he's on the stand, They'll get their chance to cross- examine him and they will continue to try to reinforce this idea that Michael Cohen is unreliable. He's a convicted liar. Continue to really try to knock down any sort of credibility that he might have with the jury. Now, the prosecution had on the other hand, have used other witnesses and documents like emails and text messages to sort of try to lay the groundwork in the lead up to Michael Cohen's testimony. They've tried to provide a supporting evidence around what Michael Cohen is expected to talk about related to Donald Trump and hopefully are going to have to convince the jury to separate Michael Cohen's past from what he says on the stand starting tomorrow.",

Israel launching fresh attacks against Gaza as the U.S. now warns a ground invasion of Rafah could result in significant civilian casualties. Israel Defense Forces launching a blistering campaign against Hamas overnight targeting northern and central Gaza, as well as Rafah in an effort to prevent militants from regrouping. The Hamas-controlled ministry of health says more than 35,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war began while the U.N. says at least 300,000 have evacuated Rafah ahead of Israel's ground operations. All of this just days after President Biden warned Israel against a Rafah invasion, promising to pause certain weapons transfers if the IDF pushes forward. Today, top White house officials explained why they believe going into Rafah could have disastrous consequences. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Going into Rafah, even to deal with these remaining battalions especially in the absence of a plan for civilians, risks doing terrible harm to civilians and not solving the problem. A problem that both of us want to solve, which is making sure Hamas cannot again govern Gaza. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They're going west and some are going north as well.Now the area they're going to, al-Mawasi, which is where the Israeli military says there is a humanitarian situation set up. We have heard from humanitarian aid groups that it's inhumane. The conditions there are not suitable for significant amounts of more people to be trying to get to that area. But some are unable to leave the Rafah. We know that the sick, the wounded, and some quite frankly exhausted having moved so many times before, are unable to make that journey. Now, what we're also hearing on the grinder, some real concerns about the land crossings on the southern border. Of course, Rafah, the Israeli military has taken over that crossing and it has been closed. We know that Egypt is not willing, they're saying officials at this point to negotiate and coordinate with Israel to try and get the trucks into Gaza. And they are citing security concerns because of course, it's not just trying to get the trucks in, it's then trying to be safe enough to distribute that aid. And Kerem Shalom also along the southern area -- that has barely been opened, although the Israeli military says some aid has managed to get through. We're hearing from U.N. teams that U.N. teams on the ground could run out of aid to give out by Sunday, that is today. They think that some of the four bakeries that are barely functioning at this point, will run out of stock by tomorrow on Monday.

But we're now hearing that they have intelligence that some, as they say, Hamas terrorists are moving north, they are trying to regroup. They are trying to re-establish themselves in that area. And the military says that it is trying to prevent that. So they've actually given evacuation orders to areas of Jabalya as well. So you do see some people trying to move out of that area and it really points to the issue that were hearing as well from some Biden administration officials this Sunday that there are concerns that Hamas cannot be defeated, that we heard Secretary of State Antony Blinken, for example, tell CBS that even if they do manage to destroy some more of the Hamas infrastructure, they could be facing Hamas insurgency or if they leave Rafah for example there could be a vacuum of chaos which Hamas would, then fill, Fred.",

He said that when he lost, speaking about Trump, when he lost in 2020, something snapped in him.President Biden went on to say, \"He's not only obsessed with losing in 2020, he's clearly unhinged.\" So you hear the president really starting to sharpen his criticism of President Trump. Of course, he was on this three-day fundraising swing on the West Coast. Really looking to maintain that cash advantage that he holds over his Republican rival. These fundraisers on the West Coast brought in $10 million. Really that has been one of the unquestionable bright spots for the Biden campaign is their cash advantage at the end of march, which is the last time we had filing records for these candidates. President Biden had almost twice as much cash on hand as former president Trump. And you really do see the Biden campaign putting that to good use. They recently announced a $14 million television ad buy targeting black voters and Latinos and battleground states. You also see them opening up offices in battleground states, really starting to staff up. Now president Trump is trying to close that gap and you have seen him hold a number of fundraisers over the last several weeks that brought in tens of millions of dollars. Former president Trump's advisors are telling their donors that they brought in $76 million in April. We don't have figures for President Biden yet. But we are learning today about a new effort that Biden's campaign is taking to maintain that cash advantage. In June, he will attend a fundraiser in Los Angeles.
