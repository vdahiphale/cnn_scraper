And the way that he's doing it is that he's saying in court after being sued for defamation by two Georgia election workers, Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, who say that the statements he made about them really hurt them in a lot of ways.He's saying that yes, he concedes that he made the statements about them that those statements were false and defamatory. But he's saying it so that he can get on to other parts of this lawsuit and still wants to argue that what he was saying about the election in Georgia after the 2020 vote about vote fraud. They're about these election workers, that is constitutionally protected speech, and also, that he shouldn't have to pay any damages to these women. Because what he was saying specifically wasn't damaging to them. So this is a short filing from him. But it's trying to get him out of some of the accountability in this lawsuit that has just piled up around him. Because not just that this lawsuit has pressed on to a point that has been really risky for Giuliani, it also is a lawsuit that a judge is quite mad at him about because the Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss keep saying that he hasn't turned over all of the evidence that he has, he hasn't searched for all of the records that he has thoroughly. And so he was in some hot water over that with the judge. And so he's making this filing now to try and divorce himself from a lot of that. Those issues that are going on, but whether this is going to be accepted by the judge. How these two women are going to respond to this? Whether it would end the case that is all a major question here and also what criminal investigators might see in his statement here that he's conceding that he's making these false statements about these women. That is also going to be a very big question going forward.",

They're admirable people and their lives were torn apart as they detail. Now they sued Rudy Giuliani for defamation. He is now making the remarkable concession. Yes, I lied about them, which you almost never see. I don't, maybe never see in a defamation case, because usually, that's the whole ballgame. But what he's trying to do here is limit his exposure by saying, yes, I lied to them. However, first of all, either they weren't damaged. We just heard the testimony that allies are torn apart, or other people are to blame for the damages that were done to them. We don't know who he's going to blame for causing that harm to them. And the other question, the other point that he's going to argue is, this was constitutionally protected political speech, you have a lot of leeway to make political speech, you can engage in hyperbole, you can say things that are outrageous but you cannot make knowingly false statements as Rudy's now conceding that he did.",

      "sentences": "A ruling that could have major implications at the southern border. A federal judge has blocked President Biden's controversial asylum policy. It's a big blow to the White House, which learn -- which lien rather on the measure to drive down those border crossings.The Biden administration imposed the system more than two months ago and it barred migrants from seeking asylum if they cross the border illegally or if they failed to seek asylum in another country while in route to the United States. The federal government will appeal this ruling, but it comes as the Justice Department is suing the state of Texas over using those floating barriers in the Rio Grande River. Governor Greg Abbott argues the barriers are intended to deter migrants from crossing. Joining us now is Democratic Congresswoman Veronica Escobar of Texas. She represents El Paso, which has really become the epicenter of the border crisis. She's also on the Judiciary Committee and a Biden Campaign National Co-chair. It is good to have you, Congresswoman. Look, you were critical of the Biden administration doing this a few months ago, you call it the step backward. You said it was choosing to limit asylum against the laws of the United States. So, do you agree with this judge that is ruled against the White House? REP. VERONICA ESCOBAR (D-TX): Well, first Poppy, I have to tell you the other part of my statement was an acknowledgment that the Biden administration is doing everything it possibly can, to do two things. First, to deter people from using human trafficking organizations because the cartels are in charge of that now. And secondly, to create legal pathways to encourage people to use the legal pathways, which are safer, and help keep people away from those human traffickers. So, the Biden administration is doing the best that it can, given that Congress has not acted on addressing our broken immigration system in 37 years. So, while I would love to see a different policy, really, it's in Congress. And today, for example, in the House Judiciary Committee, we're having Secretary Mayorkas and instead of my Republican colleagues talking about a better path, a way to be helpful and do our job as legislators. They're focused on impeaching Secretary Mayorkas.",

But we have to be -- we have to be compassionate in how we handle anyone. I don't want to see them get in the river at all. And I hope when they see these buoys they turn around. But I also don't want to see any law enforcement not handing out water, not treating people with humanity, but you have this. It's always somebody else's fault but mine.
