And those investigations reportedly include a look at actions taken by bank executives just before the failure. Members of Congress are also promising action from Capitol Hill. Here's Democrat Jeff Jackson on CNN just today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JEFF JACKSON, (D-NC): So, I think there should be congressional hearings. I think there will be congressional hearings. I think the purpose of those congressional hearings will be twofold. First, an accountability phase. You referenced stock sales by the CEO in the weeks before the bank collapsed. And the second is going to be to inform the regulatory response. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And I certainly would support putting back in place the tougher regulations with respect to the bank -- a bank the size of the Silicon Valley Bank and these other banks. There may be other issues that we want to address at the same time.The Federal Reserve had undertaken a rulemaking on its own back in January, something I strongly supported, to look into exactly these kinds of risk factors. Obviously, we wish that effort had been undertaken sooner. But we really need to support that effort. I've heard from a lot of my Senate Republican colleagues who at least before the collapse of these banks, were opposing the Fed's action to reduce the risks. I'm hoping now that the Fed will move forward quickly.",

On the issue of that rollback of regs, I talked to the Democratic Congressman, Josh Gottheimer yesterday about it. He supported rolling back those regulations in 2018. And his reason being is, he says they were too much for smaller banks. Let me play for you what he told me.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JOSH GOTTHEIMER, (D-NJ): When Dodd-Frank was passed, it literally had all the same requirements for the biggest banks, the chases of the world, and also your community banks. So, what was happening is all the community banks were going out. They were consolidating and selling to the big banks. And it was going to the opposite effect of what we were trying to create, which was getting away from a few banks that were too big to fail. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That's why it is assembled airlines, trade groups, and labor unions to try and figure out exactly what the problem is here. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg opened this session. I just spoke with him. He says there is no apparent common cause in all of these incidents, but a cause and a fix must be found now. PETE BUTTIGIEG, U.S. TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY: There will be one thing if we found a certain piece of technology in the cockpit or a certain control tower where there were -- there were a lot of issues. But instead, what we're finding is that pilots, ground crews, and controllers alike seem to be experiencing this uptick. Some have described it as a kind of rust but that needs to turn into a very concrete diagnosis and specific action steps. We're not going to wait for something worst to happen to act now.",

Let's take a look at these numbers.So, if we look at this year, we're talking about 6.7 million people being diagnosed with Alzheimer's dementia. In 2050, it'll be 12.7 million. Now, what can we do about this? We need more geriatricians, doctors who treat old people. And also, we need better treatment for Alzheimer's. The reason is, is that there are two drugs that slow the progression of the disease but there are issues. Many people say they don't work terribly well. And they're incredibly expensive. And for many people, your insurance is not going to pay for them. So, right now, all you can do is go to your doctor, see what they can do for you. One of the things this report points out is that too often people don't go to their doctor when they're starting to see the signs of Alzheimer's. Don't be embarrassed about it.

We watch them build a nest, but it's way too late in the season for them because they got all this snow at the wrong time.
