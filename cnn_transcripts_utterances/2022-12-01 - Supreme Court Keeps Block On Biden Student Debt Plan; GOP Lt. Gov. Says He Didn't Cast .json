They have testified but the former president has been making these claims of executive and attorney client privilege, which means that behind the scenes in the federal courthouse judge has been having to hear this litigation between the Justice Department, which has been asking for these men to come back in and answer questions that they had declined to answer as a result of the former president's privilege claims. So now, what we understand is happened is that a judge has given a ruling, which means that they have to come back and answer additional questions. Of course, the former president still has the right to appeal this ruling by the federal judge who is overseeing the grand jury.Obviously, Jake, you know, the importance of the testimony from these two men, they are top White House lawyers, during the key period there, as the former president was trying to overturn the election results, they saw a lot, they heard a lot. They are very important witnesses. And the former president has been busy trying to block their testimony. So we'll see whether they can come in before Trump gets to the appeals court.",

And one of the things we heard from Benny Thompson, the chairman of the committee, is that anyone who came before the committee is possible for them to send a referral over if they believe that there was any perjury, if there was any obstruction, any witness intimidation, those are the things that the committee has been very, very concerned about. They also -- he's also talked about the issue of releasing some of the evidence, some of the transcripts of what they've gathered as part of this. They've made clear that they want to release everything. And one of their concerns, Jake, is the question of whether once they cease to exist, whether Republicans might try to release some of that, and perhaps cherry pick some of the findings, Zoe Lofgren, one of the members of the committee addressed some of that with CNN this morning.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ZOE LOFGREN (D-CA), JANUARY 6 SELECT COMMITTEE: Well, they've been pretty clear that they'd like to undermine the work that we've done, but we're going to prevent that.

So the good news for the Biden administration here is that the Supreme Court has actually fast tracking these arguments, they'll hear them in February, which is quicker than they would have. The bad news is that this loan forgiveness program, it remains on hold.So for all those student borrowers who are counting on maybe between $10 and $20,000 in debt relief, they won't be getting that anytime soon. They'll have to wait till the Supreme Court ultimately makes a decision. And the administration here, they've been sending out these letters basically telling students, you're not going to get the relief that we had thought you would. So, the Secretary of Education sent out letters to those who are approved, 16 million people have already been approved so far, saying that, \"Unfortunately, a number of lawsuits have been filed challenging the program, which had blocked our ability to discharge your debt at present.\" Those court challenges continue with the Supreme Court hearing the arguments. There is a silver lining here though, the Biden administration had put in place a loan pause that was back because of COVID. People -- certain borrowers didn't have to pay their loans. They've now extended that pause so certain borrowers will not have to pay any loans back. And they said that will be in effect for 60 days after all litigation concludes.

In 1980, tests found water is highly contaminated. In 1981, water highly contaminated with other chlorinated hydrocarbons, solvents, that most contaminated wells weren't closed for four years after further testing. In February 1985, PCE dry cleaning solvent was measured at 43 times the current EPA limit for drinking water. Here in Tarawa Terrace, which houses enlisted men and their families. Two months later, the base commander sent them all a letter. \"Two of the wells that supply Tarawa Terrace have had to be taken offline because minute trace amounts of several organic chemicals have been detected in the water.\" No health warning, just a request to reduce domestic water use because supply was now limited. Apparently, a mass health warning didn't come until much later, 14 years later.",
