At a press conference, the FBI announced, as you just mentioned, that it will offer a $50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of anybody with ties to Saturday's mass shooting. Add to that, that amount, an additional $50,000 being offered by Crime Stoppers and you get a $100,000 in rewards.Birmingham Police Chief Scott Thurmond said he believes this was a targeted hit on one person and the other victims were caught in the crossfire.

Police say the shooters are believed to have used illegal gun conversion devices that can be used to override the trigger mechanism of a gun so that it functions like a machine gun. That would explain the reason why police officers here at the scene found more than 100 shell casings that were collected on a Saturday.Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin says that they're doing everything they can to stop those shooters and get them off the streets. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR RANDALL WOODFIN, (D) BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA: As a community, we cannot give safe harbor or shelter to people who want to just simply kill people. We can't give them cover. They should not feel safe in our community. They should not feel safe anywhere. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That's shootings, manslaughter, murder down 3 percent. So that's a good story on a day when we're hearing bad news out of places like Birmingham. Property crime overall down 2.4 percent. So that is from 2022 to 2023. Those are the numbers we're looking at based on the FBI's collating them. If you zoom back, though, and you get the larger story, which is what's the five year trend? We'll take a look at our other graphic, which is you see that over the time, say, from, uh, the five year analysis murder is actually up almost 10 percent, aggravated assault up almost 7 percent -- 6.5 percent. So you see that we are not where we were before pre-pandemic pre- criminal justice reform laws in many states pre- the defund the police movement, all of which had different effects on police agencies across the country.",

After the shake up caused by those other elements, pandemic reaction to the George Floyd protests, police department shrinking, budgets being cut so many different things that contributed to that. We saw that crime start to creep up again dramatically in 2020.And then we've been seeing these declines happen. So there's good news and there's bad news. One, The big picture is crime is still trending down. That's positive. But two, as we just saw in Birmingham, as we see in Baltimore, as we've seen in Chicago, Milwaukee, so many major cities, they struggle with violent crime and guns and shootings and murders that result from shootings and they continue to struggle with them. And, you know, they're working on new strategies every day to try and overcome that.",

It is not at issue in this case whether or not he was the one who pulled this gun when he walked into a King Soopers grocery store in Boulder, Colorado on March 22, 2021. That was not the issue here. What the jurors had to decide was he legally insane at the time. What they were looking to do is the jurors needed to see if he was able to form intent and also could he distinguish right from wrong. Now, if you listen to the defense, the defense had said that while they were not contesting whether or not he was the shooter, they were arguing, quote, he was in the throes of a psychotic episode at the time. They also said that he had severe treatment-resistant form of schizophrenia. They also said that Alissa was telling psychologists that he has heard consistent voices.

Now, we do know that the jurors were deliberating in this case for about five and a half hours before they came back with this verdict, which we are still hearing the results of. But so far, every count that I heard so far today, he had been found guilty. And I'm sitting here watching a feed of Alissa in court, and he's just been taking notes the whole time listening to this, looking pretty impassive and unmoved as we are hearing these counts being read out loud. What's also noteworthy in this case is that a judge ruled just last year that he was fit to stand trial. At first, it was decided that he wasn't fit, now ruling that he was fit, and that's how we've ended up here. I know this seems like a really long time, but as it was working its way through the legal system, getting to that decision made last November that he could stand trial, and now hearing in this case that those 10 people that lost their lives and as well as the 38 other counts of attempted murder that Ahmad Alissa, who's now 25 years old, is now being found guilty in this case right now.",

Those are basically the building blocks of those single-use plastics that so many of us use too much of.So what is interesting, though, and what is groundbreaking here, is ExxonMobil is not being sued for the alleged pollution, but they're being sued over their marketing and PR strategy. The AG Rob Bonta here in California calls it a decades-long campaign of deception in traditional old-school media and on social media. Trying to convince, he says, to convince the public that plastic recycling is the answer to plastic pollution. And he says it absolutely is not, and ExxonMobil knows that it is not. He said that economically, technically, a lot of plastic cannot be recycled, and he said recycling rates in this country for plastic are about 5 percent. So his argument is, by claiming that they can solve this problem of plastic pollution by recycling, ExxonMobil has actually led to consumers using more plastic.
