Also, what the threshold is for him to step in and ended potentially in the middle of the President's address. So we'll talk about that. Also a new low for Diddy and new concerns for what Cassie Ventura went through after the video of him assaulting her. Will there be any legal accountability? We'll discuss that. And this new CDC Schutz study shows that there's an increase in people drowning, especially people of color.

And today he'll meet with black voters here in Atlanta. But his biggest moment will happen tomorrow at the historically black Morehouse College. President Biden will deliver the commencement address to more than 400 graduating Morehouse men, and we've been speaking with some of them, and they recognize a presidential visit is an honor. But this speech will be his first speech on a college campus since Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, and Israel began its bombardment of Gaza.

So I think we've -- the thinking of the board and the alumni and the President is the more engagement we have with young people about this, give them a chance to say what they have to say. Give them a chance to speak to people who they may feel are kind of distant and maybe a little bit removed from their day to day lives. Tell their story about what they believe.I detected something very particular. These children, they're young men, these guys don't know, Joe Biden, right? We think Joe Biden's been in office for 40 years, and every 50 years, and everybody knows Joe Biden. They've been paying attention for two, four, maybe five years. They don't really know Joe Biden. So the things that they would talk about Biden were things that you may have heard the 2020 election, about the crime bill, or you know, his other work, but they don't know about his wife and daughter dying in a car crash, literally. They don't know about what happened around, you know, his son, Beau Biden dying. They don't understand the work he did with even thinking about, you know, talking about the appointments that he's made historically. They didn't know he was poor, right? That he was the least -- he was the poorest United States Senator, when he got chosen to be vice president. People thought he was rich, and that he was just another rich old white guy, frankly, who was trying to leave the country in a way that they didn't necessarily agree with. So it was helpful, I think, to have a conversation with them where they understood some of the contours. I'd advise the President to talk about who he is first, and then talk about what he wants to do for the country.",

There's just not a path to the White House for a Democratic president that doesn't run through African Americans. When the President leaves Morehouse, he's going to Detroit, my home again, I'm putting myself in it. He's going into Detroit. And I was told last night that Detroit NAACP sold out their dinner two times. They sold it out. They announced Biden they added more space. They sold it out again. That's the kind of interest that they've got coming to that dinner in Detroit. So I think, you know, young people are clearly concerned. They're engaged. I think people who are maybe their parents and a little bit older, are a little bit more enthusiastic about the president, but he's got to figure out how to knit some of that community back together.",

The video captured on multiple cameras, shows Combs wearing only a towel, assaulting his then girlfriend Cassie Ventura in a hallway at a Los Angeles hotel in March 2016. A lawsuit filed by Ventura in November last year and settled the next day referenced actions that seemed to match those seen in this video. There is no audio.According to the complaint, Combs became extremely intoxicated in punch Ms. Ventura in the face giving her a black eye, which according to the lawsuit prompted Ventura to try and leave the hotel room. The surveillance video obtained by CNN begins as she enters the hallway. The complaint says as she exited, Mr. Combs awoke and began screaming at Ms. Ventura. He followed her into the hallway of the hotel while yelling at her. The complaint goes on to say he grabbed her and then took glass vases in the hallway and threw them at her. In the surveillance video, Combs can be seen grabbing Ventura in throwing her to the ground. As Ventura lies on the ground, Combs then kicks her twice, and attempts to drag her on the floor back to the hotel room. Ventura is seen picking up a hotel phone. Combs' seems to walk back to the hotel room, then returns and appears to shove her in a corner. Moments later, he can then be seen throwing an object in her direction. According to Ventura is now settled lawsuit, the pair began dating several years after they met in 2005. They parted ways in 2019. Combs attorney said the decision to settle was in no way an admission of wrongdoing. Ventura declined to comment on the video but her attorney told CNN, \"The gut wrenching video has only further confirmed the disturbing and predatory behavior of Mr. Combs. Words cannot express the courage and fortitude that Ms. Ventura has shown in coming forward to bring this to light.\" The video hasn't been seen publicly before, and comes on the heels of a series of civil lawsuits alleging Combs involvement in sex trafficking and sexual abuse. Allegations that Combs has repeatedly denied. Authority search Combs his homes in Los Angeles and Miami in March as part of an ongoing federal investigation carried out by a team that specializes in human trafficking crimes. In a December 2023 statement, Combs responded to the claims and some of the lawsuit saying, \"Sickening allegations have been made against me by individuals looking for a quick pay day. Let me be absolutely clear. I did not do any of the awful things being alleged.\" Clearly very disturbing footage and violent actions that we're seeing coming from Diddy who up until this point has denied many of these allegations from all of these lawsuits that he is facing. Aside from this lawsuit from Cassie, which he settled back in November 2023, he is facing five separate lawsuits and he has been fighting back through his lawyers. In fact, just last week, we reported on a motion that he filed to dismiss a lawsuit from a Jane Doe that claim she was 17 years old, a minor at the time of her allegations in just a few days before that he filed a motion to dismiss a portion of an entirely different claim. It'll be interesting to see now how this may impact all that Diddy is facing. But we have yet to hear directly from him.",

I mean, right now how we zoned schools. You go to your neighborhood school, and potentially your classmates are at the same socio economic level. But talk about income segregation, which I don't think we focus on enough.",

And if your income is larger, and you live in a community, you're paying more taxes, and so more taxes are going to your neighborhood schools. Whereas people across the track who have lower income, their personal property taxes can only afford so much in terms of the resources for public education, which is why the Brown's Promise project at the southern Education Foundation is a wonderful way of reanalyzing not just district lines, but how these public schools are being funded, and the income inequalities that cause disparities.",

And there was a line that stood out to me that said, \"diversity is not the same as integration\".Just because you have a longer list of different nationalities and races and religions that are a school, it doesn't mean there's full integration. So what do people at home who care about this? What can they do to get their schools toward integration and not just diversity?",

But I think on the local front, parents and concerned citizens who pay taxes and who live in communities that have schools and children who are being educated in those schools should be engaged in the governance of the schools to their school boards, and be mindful of the funding formulas, how -- and look at the disparities. The disparities are there.You can look across one school district to another and see one has immensely more funding for more teachers, more resources, more science, equipment, and that puts other students at a severe disadvantage. So to answer your question, people need to get involved. And not involved in terms of just divisiveness in terms of what we see so much of right now. But on how do we create a more equitable school system. Some polls and surveys done by the Brown's Promise project, which is run by two very strong attorneys shows that most Americans actually very favorable to integrated school systems.",

A lot of public schools in urban communities don't have swim teams don't have pools. And then we went through the pandemic, where, like, with so many industries that weren't a lot of lifeguards, or coaches available. So we saw some numbers increase.I wonder, though, for teaching communities of color to swim, are there such things as culturally conscious swim classes? Or is it like a driving course? Like this is the way you drive. This is what all the things are in the car. Let's go.",

It's like with a lot of different situations, you really have to take the time to understand why somebody is fearful of the water, why they haven't started swimming, and kind of talk through that situation. So I always tell people take swim lessons and learn how to swim at your own pace. So if you have a coach that's really pushing you and you're just really, really uncomfortable, take a step back. Go find somebody else that can actually really take the time to walk you through what it means to learn how to swim because the hardest part is, especially as an adult, you're almost fearful of the water already. It's even harder to learn how to swim, so really have to have that patience, and really have to take a moment to celebrate even the little wins.I would say, you know, I've had some clinics where I've had women come in with me and they're just like, I'm never going to get in the water. You know, I had -- I'm 80 years old. I don't want to do this. And I literally sit on the pool with them and have a conversation and their feet are in the water. And then by you know, maybe in the next hour, I may have them sitting on the stairs. So it's really just celebrating that when that they are getting that much further and that much closer to learning how to swim and supporting that journey.",
