Director Sam Pollard talks to Walter Isaacson about a man whose new film, \"TheLeague,\" and how this sport is a metaphor for America. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. In the heat of the American summer, presidential candidates are focused on the dead of winter, that's when the primaries start, just a short six months from now. It is a crowded Republican field, and it's becoming clear that the culture wars will be front and center. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis still waging his battle against \"wokeness\" and his latest legislation raises race to a whole new and shocking level, like requiring school children to be taught that slavery actually equipped slaves with beneficial personal skills. On the Democrat side, there is Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., using his name to spread COVID conspiracy theories, hoping to challenge his own party's president for the nomination. RFK's campaign, much like Donald Trump's, is an undeniable manifestation of a post pandemic conspiracy laden political landscape. That is the view of writer Rebecca Traister. And she is joining me now, alongside Democratic Strategist Joe Trippi. Welcome, both of you, to the program. Before I dive into the theory and the deep reporting that Rebecca has done, I want to ask you, as a Democratic strategist, Joe Trippi, that given both principled candidates, you know, sort of favorabilities are quite low, is it actually time or an opportunity for a viable third-party candidate right now, or even one to -- you know, to question his own party?",

But this is not -- we're not in -- I don't believe we are in an era where there's actually -- you know, it's Republican versus Democrat or ideological fight between right and left, there's -- it's autocratic Trumpism versus democracy. And the Trump vote is not -- there is no way to have a -- there's no one who is going to take moderate Trump votes away from him. They don't exist. There are no moderate centrist voters who are with Trump. So, if you put forth as no labels is trying to do a third-party that would be centrist and moderate, there's only one campaign -- it's just the pro-democracy side of that equation that is going to get diluted. And I think the same is true with Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. in that -- I think all of this is working towards helping Trump get reelected, including Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. I think it would be not surprising to me at all if there is a dark money, independent expenditure campaign launched on his behalf to attack Biden.",

It's always been that case. I think Biden has done a remarkable job. You look at the job numbers, inflation coming down, you look at -- with amazing, you know, tough Republican opposition on everything, the bipartisan bills, the infrastructure and other things, the way the economy is moving, this -- the big recession that was coming is now like the big red wave that never happened in 2022. I just think that Democrats are better served by -- which -- and I think they are, they're pretty much unified behind Biden. I think the threats of Trump will again -- in the contrast, between Trump and Biden, which is what one in 2020 and what stopped the red wave from materializing in 2022 is -- that contrast is really important. That's why Trump cannot win. He has only gotten to 46 percent in both 2016, we've got the 20 to 46. In 2020, he got that 46.8. He cannot win if there's only two candidates.",

And I probablyagree with him that given that Biden is going to be the candidate, that he is the best hope for democracy, there is no question. And so, I want to say that up front. But I also want to say that democracy was also in the balance in this point of incredible precarity for our Democratic institutions, for the globe, for the planet, that was also true in 2020, it was also true in 2016. It's going to be true in every election moving forward that what is in the balance is democracy itself, is the health of the planet and its people, and that these decisions are crucial. But the Democratic Party also has to acknowledge it has to find a way forward that is not going to be Joe Biden for the rest of the future, right? And so, the questions -- I mentioned earlier that there are these generational shifts. Of course, that was going to happen. A generation of leaders who came to power in the second half of the 20th century are aging out of power. And you can see how the different parties are approaching those shifts, right? What is the two-party system going to look like moving forward? I would argue the right has been quite hospitable to takeover by its hard right extremist flank. You saw that from the rise of the Tea Party onto this -- the Freedom Caucus, you know. I would say that the left has been much more ambivalent to hostile about its younger generation, many of whom lean to the left of what leadership has been for the past few decades. This is part of what we are looking at moving forward in these moments of real risk, calamity and peril that Joe is accurately describing. And again, I want to state for the record that I agree, Joe Biden as the candidate, and I've been a critic of him from the left and I also have a lot of good things to say about his presidency and many progressive economic policies he has put into place, I want to give him a lot of credit. But I also want to say that the fact that there are questions about what happens next within the Democratic Party are very real and very pressing.",

And before what we are seeing and what we've seen unfold as a little -- sort of stumbly rocky campaign, he was considered a very legitimate and major threat to the Democrats. But they -- and I want to ask you to weigh in on this, Rebecca, and then I will get Joe Trippi's, they have gone full woke, because as you pointed out, the economy is pretty good, employment is pretty good, the legislation has been pretty successful, but they've gone full woke, anti-women, all the reproductive issues, and this unbelievable legislation of trying to teach Floridian children that actually slavery had beneficial fallout for slaves.

I mean, this is one of the open questions, is how much electoral success can they gain from rolling back the enlightenment, basically. And, I mean, there's a lot of evidence, by the way, so far, just because of the timeline, that some of the hard right rights rollbacks that they have enacted, for example, around abortion in the wake of Dobbs, are actually producing resounding electoral defeats, that's something I wrote about earlier this year that some of this very hard right turn is ending very badly for them, and we have the evidence for that over the past year around abortion, Republicans consistently are losing every time abortion is on the ballot, post-Dobbs. So, these questions remain open, I think, for some of these other extremist, cruel, racist, xenophobic, misogynistic laws that are being passed in states like Florida and Texas, and elsewhere.

Correspondent Nick Paton Walsh has obtained rare and exclusive testimony from those who have been swept up into Putin's brutal war machine. Their names have been changed for their safety.

The bleakest fate, prisoners recruited by the ministry of defense, basically as cannon fodder. These so-called Storm Z battalions surrendering here have death rates hard to fathom. Here are two rare stories, one of incredible survival and another of a young and quick death told to CNN a great risk from inside Russia. Ex-con Sergei barely made it back. Now, he works two jobs and can't sleep because his ears still ring from shell shock. We first talked when he had been shot for the second time, but he was still sent back, injured. From 600 prisoners recruited with him in October, he says, only 170 are alive and only two of them without injury. Sent again and again in waves to attack Ukrainian positions. SERGEI, RUSSIAN PRISONER RECRUIT (through translator):  I remember most clearly the last of the nine concussions I had, we attacked, RPGs, drone flew at us. Our commander yells on the radio, I don't care, go ahead. Don't come back until you take this position. Two of us found a small hole and dived in there. A drone threw a grenade at us and it landed in the 30- centimeter gap between us. My friend was covered with shrapnel all over, yet I was untouched somehow. But I lost my sight for five hours. WALSH (voiceover):  He only stayed in hospital that times and got home, as doctors made him an orderly. He has nightmares that he is told to be first out of the trench again, but daily life in the trench was a nightmare too, the frostbite, hunger, and thirst. SERGEI (through translator):  Sometimes, we didn't eat for several days. We didn't drink for several days. It was a four-kilometer walk to water and thank God it was winter.

So, what we are trying to do is to remain a constitutional monarchy and keep the monarchy above the politics, where monarchy is supposed to be in any country that is governed by constitutional monarchy.

But in doing the research, we learned that there was a gentleman named Moses Fleetwood Walker in the late 1880s who was one of the African Americans to play on these white teams. And there were other black players playing on these teams in the 1880s, 1890s, until the beginning of the 20th century. But then, there was a gentleman's agreement that was really started by a Hall of Famer, Cap Anson, who basically didn't want to play with black players. And that sort of just really permeated all the Major League teams when they decided not to have any black players on those teams, you know. So, that's what led to people like Rube Foster in 1920 with a bunch of other owners, Negro League owners, saying in Kansas City, Missouri, let's put together our own national league of black teams, and they created in 1920 the Negro National League, which really flourished for about 10 years until the untimely death of Rube Foster around 1929, 1930. And then, there was another sort of major upheaval in the '30s out of Pittsburgh, you know, which was a wonderful hub, you know, they had the factories and they had a lot of black people in the community. And two men basically started the second integration of negro baseball, and that was a gentleman named Cum Posey, who owned a Homestead Grays, and Gus Greenlee, who owned the Pittsburgh Crawfords. And those teams and those players and those teams were the things I really got to know about as a young man, and those are people like Satchel Paige, the wonderful pitcher, Satchel Paige, the great home run hitter, Josh Gibson, you know, the player, Cool Papa Bell, Buck Leonard, Oscar Charleston, there was such phenomenal players. And they were so good that they created what was sort of like what we just saw this past couple of days, the all-star game, they called it the East-West Classic. Where the best players from the eastern teams and the western teams would come to the other and they would play baseball. And you know and I know that back then, when we were young then, baseball was the American pastime. Everybody loved baseball. Now, it's not the case so much anymore, but back then, that was everything everybody talked about, you know, baseball, baseball, baseball.",

And then his mantle -- that mantle has passed on to two other great owners, Cum Posey, who own the Homestead Grays and Gus Greenlee, who owned the Pittsburgh Crawfords. And those two men along in the '30s really reignited Negro League Baseball, and they had wonderful players, Satchel Paige, phenomenal picture, Josh Gibson, great hitter, Cool Papa Bell, who could run the bases with lightning speed, Oscar Charleston, Buck Leonard, you know, they had great players. And then, you saw, after World War II, there was another group of players who would be the first group to ever go into the Major Leagues, Monte Irvine who went to the New York Giants after Willie Mays. Jackie Robinson, who we all know went to the Brooklyn Dodgers. Larry Doby from the Newark Eagles, who was the first African American playing in the American league with the Cleveland Indians.
