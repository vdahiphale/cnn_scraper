The President-elect is not backing down on his cabinet picks, even as some of them come under intense scrutiny. A source close to Trump tells me he is 100 percent all in for one of his most controversial picks, Matt Gaetz for attorney general. And his latest pick is Brendan Carr to have the Federal Communications Commission. Carr is currently an FCC commissioner and author of a chapter on proposed changes to the agency and Project 2025, where he says the agency's top priority should be things like promoting national security and reining in big tech, something the FCC does not meaningfully oversee, especially on national security.

We've seen several different factions within Trump's orbits fighting over that job in particular, and Commerce is another one.He also has to name an education secretary, which is an interesting job because Donald Trump has promised that he will eliminate the Department of Education. Meanwhile, his allies spent the weekend appearing on the Sunday shows defending Donald Trump's picks so far and making the case that he deserves a cabinet that he wants after his electoral victory. Take a listen to what House Speaker Mike Johnson had to say on State of the Union. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA), HOUSE SPEAKER: These are disruptors. They are, I think that's by design. Any president has the right to name their own cabinet, to nominate persons that they think will fulfill their agenda.

He is someone who has previously said that Gaetz showed him explicit videos to him and members on the House floor of Gaetz involved in sexual encounters.

The FDA had a similar investigation. It is continuing it, but it reached the same conclusion. So that is going on, but it is not exactly as RFK Jr. represented it was.Secondly, Denmark does use Ozempic both for diabetes and its sister drug Wegovy for obesity. And really they've cut back there because of cost cutting measures. And then finally the idea that Americans are stupid and that's why we use drugs like Ozempic, that's something that doctors who treat obesity really push back on. They say that perpetually perpetuates stigma. And they say, of course, healthy food and exercise are incredibly important parts of managing this condition. But that therapy can work really well for certain people and it shouldn't be something that is demonized. So that's really why they're concerned about these kinds of comments from RFK Jr. about Ozempic and similar things.",

      "sentences": "All right, Meg Tirrell, thank you.Kennedy's opinions are controversial, but in the eyes of many experts, not all of them are necessarily wrong. His views on vaccines and the criticism of those get a lot of attention, with scientists being fairly united that Kennedy is wrong based on the data available in the science and that vaccines are safe and effective. But his concerns about foods and the additives and many of them are being embraced by many scientists and concerned member -- members of the general public. A lot of parents care about this, too. Last month, protesters gathered outside Kellogg's headquarters in Michigan. Advocates want the company to remove artificial food dyes and preservatives from cereals like Froot Loops. Something that has been done in other countries with tighter regulations and something Kellogg's vowed to do in U.S. cereals by 2018, but never did. So could Kennedy actually make America's foods healthier? Let's discuss the science with Marion Nestle. She's a professor of nutrition and food studies at New York University and the author of \"Slow Cooked: An Unexpected Life in Food Politics.\" She's also writing a book on cereal as we speak. And Jason Karp, he's a food advocate and founder and CEO of HumanCo who started the movement against Kellogg's. Great to see both of you. I'm really looking forward to this important conversation. Jason, let's start with you. I want to read this statement from Kellogg's where it says the colors we use in our cereals have been deemed safe by scientific bodies around the world looking at the totality of research. Additionally, the FD&amp;C colors we use in our foods in the U.S. are classified as certified, meaning they are required to undergo certification by the FDA every time a new batch is manufactured. As I noted, Jason, Kellogg's is saying that. You started this movement against Kellogg's. It's gaining a lot of traction online. There was even a petition for Kellogg's to remove these food dyes. That's gotten more than 450,000 signatures. Why are you doing this?",

But to -- to -- to just focus in on -- on what we're starting this conversation with, Marion, on -- on Kellogg's and the Froot Loops and so forth, on the food dyes, as I just read the statement, Kellogg's insist their foods are safe. What does the science show on this topic? And what do you think about this? Do you think that they should be removed for public health?",

      "sentences": "Well, let's just start with why they're there in the first place. They're there for cosmetic reasons. They have no actual function in the cereal other than to make it attractive. And there's research that shows that people like brightly colored foods, they think they taste better and they much prefer them.When cereal companies have taken the dyes out of the cereals and put in natural dyes instead, people don't buy them, they don't want them as much. So from the cereals company's standpoint, this is a marketing imperative. And Americans seem to prefer the brightly colored neon colored dyes more than the Europeans do. The Europeans buy the cereals with natural dyes. But we don't. So it's a problem for the cereal companies. The problem for scientists is that the research is extremely difficult to do. You can't take two populations of kids and lock them up and feed them one set food dyes and one set not food dyes and keep them there for some number of years and see whether it affects their behavior. You're not allowed to do studies like that. So they do studies on animals. And the animal studies are done with -- with much higher doses than are currently available in the food supply. And those studies show harm. So how do you interpret that? Well, as Jason put it, in the United States, we assume foods are safe until they cause trouble. In Europe, they use what's called a precautionary principle, which is, you know, let's make sure these things are safe before they use them. Here, because the Food and Drug Administration is so badly underfunded and -- and doesn't have the personnel or the resources to do this kind of thing, they are forced to take the generally recognized as safe approach, which, you know, people have been complaining about that for decades, that it doesn't work.",

But, you know, the Kellogg's would argue, look, the FDA says it's safe.But the bottom line is, you know, I want to go to you on this, Marion, and then I'm going to go to you on this, Jason, that Kellogg said that it would take out these chemicals by 2018.

I do want to note, Jason, Kellogg's argues 85 percent of its cereal sales contain these coloring chemicals and that, you know, they argue Americans have a choice. They can decide what they prefer.
