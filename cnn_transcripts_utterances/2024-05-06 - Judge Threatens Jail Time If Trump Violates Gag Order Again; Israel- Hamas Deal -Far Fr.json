I'm Jake Tapper.We're going to start today with our law and justice lead, and a stern warning for Donald Trump today from the bench -- keep violating your gag order and your hush money cover of case, and you may well end up in jail. Judge Juan Merchan finding today the Trump violated that gag order for the 10th time. He fined Trump $1,000 which is the maximum penalty. But Judge Merchan went on to tell the former president, quote, at the end of the day, I have a job to do, and part of that job is to protect the dignity of the judicial system and compel respect, as much as I do not want to impose a jail sanction and I've done everything I can to avoid doing so, I want you to understand that I will if necessary, and appropriate, unquote. Today, we've also heard testimony from two witnesses who went through check by check the payments made by Donald Trump to his former attorney and fixer, Michael Cohen. Those payments are at the very heart of this case because prosecutors alleged Mr. Trump took part in an illegal conspiracy to reimburse his former lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen for paying hush money to Stormy Daniels right before the election. Stormy Daniels, the porn actress and director who had claimed she had had a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. Lets get straight to CNN's Kara Scannell who's been inside the courtroom all day. Kara, what's happening in court right now?",

She's been testifying under questioning from the prosecution, and she's explaining to them how the paperwork works, how they were with issued checks in this case, all related to the reimbursement to Michael Cohen and she described how when Donald Trump became president, they had FedEx-ed the checks down to the White House for him to sign to be sent back to the Trump Organization, that then she would then send out to Michael Cohen.Now, the prosecutors walked her through each one of these checks so the juries repeatedly seeing this pattern of a invoice from Michael Cohen saying that pursuant to a retainer agreement, you should be paid $35,000 a month, seeing that entered into the general ledger, and then seeing that on the check stub and ultimately the check that assigned by Donald Trump in his signature, sharpies signing. And that are -- those are the elements of this alleged crime. Those are the falsified documents that prosecutors have alleged that Trump was involved in. Now, we also heard testimony earlier today from Jeff McConney, that was her supervisor. He was that comptroller of the Trump Organization for 34 years. It was interesting when McConney and Tarasoff on the witness stand, they walked past Eric Trump, who still running the company, who was sitting in that first row in the public section. And we saw exchanges between them, Deb Tarasoff had tapped Eric Trump's leg when she was walking out at a break. It is still a she's noting now in her testimony, a family company, a pretty small business. So you can see that familiarity, and even Donald Trump, we've noticed this when he has someone who's worked for him on the witness stand, he really turns to face them. He did that when Rhona Graff, his longtime executive assistant was testifying. Right now, he's dramatically turned his chair to watch Tarasoff as she is giving her testimony question by Trumps attorneys this is something that his business is obviously he knows very well. So he's been very focused on this. Now, there -- his team was trying to make a distinction between the oldest bookkeeping and what Donald Trump knew about it. And that is something that they have brought out on cross-examination of Jeff McConney asking him, did you have any conversations about Donald Trump related to these payments? He said no, related to the doctor occupants said, have you ever given Donald Trump a tour of the accounting software and McConney said, no, he hadn't. So they're really trying to set some distance between how these documents were written into the corporate books and what Donald Trump knew about them -- Jake.",

On part eight in 2016, expenses were incurred by one of the -- one of Donald Trump's attorneys, Michael Cohen. Mr. Cohen sought reimbursement of those expenses and Mr. Trump fully reimbursed Mr. Cohen in 2017, the category of value would be $100,001 to $250,000 and the interest rate would be zero.

Earlier today though, to Carrie's point about business as usual, the people who were testifying today from Trump Organization, these were not hostile witnesses. These were like David Pecker, Hope Hicks, there was no hostility there. And the other things we heard from them were Donald Trump was, quote, the brains behind the organization. Everybody was taking orders. He signed all the checks. This was a personal account. So I think when you add that together with the paper trail, which is needed for the case and then this notion of why did an Allen Weisselberg, they have the documents with his personal handwriting on it, why did they have to make it larger? Because the payment was to cover up. It was to make it look -- meet the threshold for him to pay taxes on it. That's where I, as the juror, I'm not the lawyers say, well, why did they do that?

But my colleague Alex Marquardt and I are now learning that Israel -- that this proposal that Hamas agree to is actually a different proposal than the one that Israel helped craft with Egypt. So, one -- this is according to a senior Israeli and a senior American official, one senior American official telling Alex that this latest framework that Hamas agreed includes a permanent end to the hostilities, which of course has been a red line for the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. And so, in light of all of this, the Israeli prime ministers office is now saying that this proposal is, quote, far from Israel necessary requirements, but Israel is committing to sending a working level delegation to meet with the Egyptian and Qatari mediators in the coming days. It's not clear yet whether that meeting will happen in Doha or in Cairo, but certainly the ball is moving forward. These negotiations will carry on. But while earlier this evening, it might have seemed like a deal was perhaps imminent. We saw these images of people in Gaza beginning to celebrate what they thought was cease agreement.

They asked one or two questions of McConney, then of Tarasoff afterwards. They aren't planning a long cross-examination of anyone except for Michael Cohen, and that includes Stormy Daniels.

Well, we haven't heard from him yet. There's an extensive witness list, of course not everyone will be called, but the prosecution does not near done it. So him saying he thought it was going to be done today, I think is a curious statement at best. And I'll add, there's a couple of things he said and comments after court that we haven't played yet, that were just not true. He said he's leading in every poll. He's not leading in every poll. He's leading in many polls, but we've had a couple of polls in recent days from ABC, from TIPP in which he's trailing. He also claimed that the FEC, the Federal Election Commission, tossed out, not only tossed out this matter, but said you got to be kidding me with this. That's not what happened. In fact, the FEC as often with the FEC was deadlocked. It's divided between Republican and Democratic appointed commissioners, the Democratic ones voted to proceed. The Republican ones voted against it. So it was dropped. They didn't say it was absurd or ridiculous.",

I want to talk about testimony from former top Trump advisor Hope Hicks because she mentioned you once in testimony. A prosecutor read a statement given to \"The Wall Street Journal\" about whether Trump had been aware of a payment to Stormy Daniels, also known as Stephanie Clifford. That article reads, quote: These are old recycled reports which were published and strongly denied prior to the election, a White House official said, responding to the allegation of a sexual encounter involving Mr. Trump and Ms. Clifford, the official decline to respond to questions about an agreement with Ms. Clifford. It is unknown whether Mr. Trump was aware of any agreement or payment involving her. That's \"The Wall Street Journal\", January 12th, 2018. Now, court transcripts show that that Hope Hicks was asked if she's the one that gave the statement she said, no, I'm not. Prosecutor says who was the White House official quoted in the story. Hope Hicks said, I can't say for sure. I can't say for sure, but I think that it was Hogan Gidley, he was the deputy press secretary, unquote. A, was it you? I don't know if you have any memory of that. And what did you make of this moment? Your name coming up in the trial.",

Clearly, which I think really hurt the prosecutions case, bringing her up in that way.And just knowing her the way I do, I can imagine how a gut wrenching this is for her, someone who served in the White House, who always had Donald Trump's best interests at heart. I then she kind of goes into private life, doing what she wants to do personally, professionally, and then kind of gets pulled back into these types of things and you saw kind of where her heart is on these matters when she broke down in tears.
