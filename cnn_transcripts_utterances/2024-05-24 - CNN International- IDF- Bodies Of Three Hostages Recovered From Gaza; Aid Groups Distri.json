Another hour of \"CNN News Central\" starts right now.FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, HOST, \"CNN NEWSROOM\": Hello, and welcome to our viewers all around the world. I'm Fredricka Whitfield, and this is the CNN Newsroom. Just ahead, in the next hour, the UN's top court will rule on South Africa's request for Israel to withdraw from Gaza. This as more bodies of Israeli hostages have been recovered. We'll have the very latest developments. Then, devastating pictures of a landslide hitting a remote village in northern Papua New Guinea. Many are feared dead. Plus, both Joe Biden and Donald Trump are confident they can take the other down in next month's presidential debate. They're preparing for it in very different ways. We'll tell you how. All right. We begin with several new developments in Israel's war with Hamas. In the next hour, the UN's top court will rule on South Africa's emergency request for Israel to halt its Rafah offensive. This as the U.S. works to get hostage and ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas back on track. A U.S. official tells CNN, CIA Director Bill Burns will head to Europe in the coming days to try to revive the process. Meanwhile, the Israeli military says it has recovered the bodies of three hostages from Jabalia in Gaza. Israel says they were killed on October 7. Let's bring in CNN's Ben Wedeman, who is following the developments from Rome. Ben, good to see you. So, what can you tell us about the bodies of the hostages recovered in an overnight operation?",

This was an operation in the Jabalia refugee camp in the northern part of Gaza, which has been the scene actually going back almost to the very beginning of this war of intense bombardment and fighting. The Israelis have gone back into Jabalia again, and during the course of this operation, they came upon three bodies.Now, from the forensic inspection, it appears that they were all killed on the 7th of October. So, Hamas was simply holding dead bodies, not the living. Now, among them was a 59-year-old dual Brazilian-Israeli citizen from the town of Sderot, which is very near the line that divides Gaza from Israel, and apparently he was killed while going to pick up his granddaughter. In addition to that, there were two men who were at the Nova Music Festival, which, of course, was attacked in the very early hours of the 7th of October. One of them was a 30-year-old French-Mexican citizen. The other was a 42- year-old father of two from Tel Aviv.",

I mean, sort of going back, if you were just set the scene, South Africa borders case at the ICJ right at the end of last year, and the ICJ took a view on the allegations that South Africa was accusing Israel of genocide of the Palestinian population inside of Gaza. The very early reading, the first reading, because the actual sort of determination is going to take a couple of years, the ICJ said, look, not determining here that there is actually genocide going on, but with making the determination that the Palestinian people have a right to be protected from genocide, and therefore called on Israel to give monthly reports to improve the humanitarian situation for the people in Gaza, and to make sure that people, civilians weren't being killed.Now, the South African government has three times or is now on its third occasion of trying to sort of stiffen, if you will, and move -- make more active the language and authority of the ICJ here. And in essence, a couple of weeks ago, when the IDF went into Gaza, the South African allegation is that actually moving people to safe areas was not actually making them safer, and this was making the situation worse. So, they went back to the ICJ and said we want to have these stronger preventative measures. And they're calling now for full access for humanitarian aid, full access for investigators for potential other crimes that have been committed, full access for journalists. So, what they are doing here is trying to sort of take up a level and put greater pressure on Israel to stop and curtail its actions in Rafah. Now, Israel, for its part, has said that South Africa is working as the legal arm of Hamas, that these are -- the allegations, morally and factually unfounded. So, the ruling will be, when we hear it in the next hour or so, will it apply more pressure on Israel to allow in humanitarian aid, or will it just determine to continue with its own investigations, the big picture of genocide, and say what we've said already stands?",

And what we've seen often is that they will try to push ahead with their original plans, and how that therefore impacts a possible ceasefire negotiations.It's a moment of huge international pressure on Israel. But, it doesn't seem that it's responding in the way that many in the international community want it to. And it doesn't seem that what the ICJ will say today can bring a bearing on those talks for hostage release, certainly not a quick change.",

Exercise is seen as coercion.

Some lawmakers in the opposition party are trying to pass legislation that would take power away from the newly elected President of Taiwan, Lai Ching-te. And these members of the public say that if they did that, these lawmakers, who are seen as friendly to China, would have power to potentially trade some aspects of Taiwan's freedom in exchange for economic benefit from Beijing, and that is something that they say they just won't stand for, including a man who I met who flew all the way here from California where he has lived for the last four years, even though he was born here in Taiwan.",

Aides telling us that they still do not expect formal debate planning or prep sessions from Donald Trump and that he -- that they haven't really talked to him about it so far yet even, and they think that they can continue to push the case to voters on immigration, on inflation, and the economy overall. And that these two are looking at each other, and each of them, notably, sees this as a really important debate. Each of them believes that they will be able to display the other as having really deteriorated over the course of last couple of years. Of course, this is a historical moment. There is never in the history of American politics been a time where two presidents have debated like this. And these two guys have not debated anyone at all since the last time they debated each other four years ago.",

But also, he says that the former President has snapped. Now, I point that out because President Biden himself has started to say that in his fundraisers. He started to say that the former President seems unhinged, and that he snapped after losing the 2020 election. So, they're clearly building on that in a way to stoke the President's Republican rival and ramp up attacks against him ahead of this debate. [08:40:00] Now, the campaign released a memo this morning where they essentially lay out what they plan to hit Donald Trump on during the debate. That includes on the economy, on abortion, and on threats to democracy, all of those points that we have heard the President talk about over the course of his campaign so far. But clearly, they feel like they have -- former President Donald Trump pegged to the point where they can lay out these policies and these issues and see them as weaknesses for the former President to try to defend against. Now, of course, President Biden is, as you heard earlier from Isaac, preparing behind closed doors for this debate. But, what this ad at the very least does show us is that they are going to ramp up, put this on national television, local markets and on digital platforms to try to get voters revved up, because what the campaign is trying to battle here is this waning enthusiasm and not much energy for President Biden among voters. So, that fighting spirit that they say the President has is what they're also trying to stoke out of voters, especially those who do not want to vote for former President Donald Trump and just don't like him.",

Now, he did not stay for the entire portion of the dinner but he had engaged with the Kenyan President earlier in the day at Blair House.Now, of course, this was the White House rolling out the red carpet in honor of the Kenyan President with hundreds of guests in a transparent pavilion on the South Lawn, where according to the First Lady's office, they had over 1,000 candles, and also served a three-course dinner to all of those guests, which included celebrities and Washington types, as well as former President Bill Clinton as well.

Now, some disturbing allegations against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs in a new lawsuit that was filed Thursday by a woman who says she met the rapper when she was a student in New York in 1994. The complaint accuses him of four instances of sexual assault from the mid-90s to the early 2000s. It also accuses him of battery. CNN has reached out to a representative for Combs, who has previously denied allegations and other lawsuits against him. And this comes as Diddy's former girlfriend Cassie Ventura is speaking out for the first time about a 2016 video showing her being physically assaulted by the music mogul. Ventura's public comments come just days after CNN exclusively obtained that graphic surveillance footage. Elizabeth Wagmaster -- Wagmeister, rather, has more on what Ventura is saying. And we do want to warn you, some of the images in her report are disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELIZABETH WAGMEISTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Cassie Ventura breaking her silence for the first time since CNN uncovered this disturbing video showing music mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs violently throwing her to the ground, then kicking and dragging her. On Instagram, Ventura thanking family, friends and strangers, writing \"The outpouring of love has created a place for my younger self to settle and feel safe now, but this is only the beginning. My only ask is that EVERYONE open your heart to believing victims the first time.\" The surveillance video from 2016 also shows Combs throwing a vase at then-girlfriend Ventura in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel, the security camera footage seeming to corroborate part of Ventura's 2023 lawsuit against Diddy, alleging he punched Ms. Ventura, giving her a black eye, then took glass vases in the hallway and threw them at her. The lawsuit since settled also referenced this -- SEAN \"DIDDY\" COMBS, RAP MOGUL: I got to give a special thank you.

And Combs still faces possible charges related to those federal raids on his homes in March. The LA County District Attorney says the hotel video from 2016 won't lead to new charges because the statute of limitations expired. Cassie didn't address the video directly, but did say \"Domestic violence is THE issue. It broke me down to someone I never thought I would become.\" Advocates say cases like Cassie's are helping to turn the tide for victims of abuse.

But, that being said, look, he did say that he thinks we may see a future where jobs could be optional. You could have one if you want as a hobby, but that AI and robots could provide all of the goods and services that we need, and that -- in order to do that, we would need this universal high income. But, he didn't really elaborate on what that would look like.There are some in the AI industry who think that guaranteed income, universal basic income, payments to people from the government, potentially from taxes on AI firms, could help sort of cushion the blow that AI could have on employment. But, that does feel like quite a far way off. And I have to say, personally, I also think this seems kind of like an out-of-touch comment from Elon Musk. I mean, I don't know about you, but I like my job. I think many humans are fulfilled by their jobs. And having those things taken away by technology may not be what everybody is looking for.

On one hand, he has what some might see is this sort of rosy vision for the future where nobody has to work and all of our needs are provided by AI. But, he has also called this technology his biggest fear. He has previously said that it could cause civilization destruction.

I'm here to visit the headquarters of Nuro, one of the few companies operating fully driverless vehicles on public roads today. DAVE FERGUSON, CO-FOUNDER, NURO: How did everyone get it so wrong? A big part of that is that building a vehicle is incredibly complex. Vehicle manufacturers have a seven-year cycle for a new vehicle program. When you add that to sort of software speed around building new technology and trying to build the AV software, things get stretched out a fair amount of time.
