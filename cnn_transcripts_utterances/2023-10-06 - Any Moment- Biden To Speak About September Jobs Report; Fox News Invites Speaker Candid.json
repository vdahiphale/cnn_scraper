      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, facts versus feelings. On paper, new data that makes a clearcut case that the economy is good. Any minute, the president tries to bridge the gap between the stats and how people feel about so-called Bidenomics.Plus, the speaker's race gives us an early test of Donald Trump's sway with Republicans. Jim Jordan scored the former president's endorsement. The question is, will it propel him to the front of the line to claim the gavel. And a cardboard tycoon, submarines nuclear secrets and the former president. New reporting sheds light on a surreal story that has now been confirmed by the special counsel prosecuting Donald Trump. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. Up first, the Biden disconnect between what's happening and what you believe. Any moment, we're going to hear straight from the president of the United States, who is going to speak just hours after a new and very good jobs number report. Let's get straight to the White House where Kayla Tausche is reporting. Kayla, can you just put this into context? We're going to talk about the specifics but put this into context. How important it is for the White House to try to convince the American people, the American voter, that what they are talking about on paper really will translate to how they feel in their wallets and as they do their budgets at their kitchen table?",

      "sentences": "Well, Dana, it's an effort that's been months in the making with the president and his cabinet officials talking about Bidenomics, with the hallmark of that message being the creation of jobs in this country, millions of jobs created since the president took office.And today when he speaks in just a few moments, he's expected to tell manufacturing in particular and the renaissance there in this country. To be sure, job creation has been on a tear. The numbers this morning more than double what experts and economists had been expecting. But it also shows just how difficult it is to predict where the economy is headed. With many of those experts expecting a recession to begin by now when they were pulled a few months ago. And also, the Biden administration itself suggesting that the economy would return to slow and steadier growth post pandemic and that job creation would have to slow down. So, it does put the administration a little bit on its heels in terms of messaging to try to explain why this is still happening and to take a victory lap essentially, for the fact that it is. All that being said, Dana, there are still reasons why Americans at the ground level do not feel that economic strength, gas prices have been relatively high throughout the summer, inflation while it's been slowing, is still far higher than it was just a couple of years ago. And Americans feel that when they're paying their rent or buying a home or going to the grocery store. You have student loan payments that just restarted this week after three years, though a senior administration official tells me that the administration is confident. They believe that it's going to take several months for that fully to kick in and to be felt by the American consumer. But no doubt that today, Dana, is a day where the administration feels good and feels like this data underpins its argument.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Dana. I mean think about the week that these guys have had up here on Capitol Hill. On Monday they had a Speaker Kevin McCarthy. On Tuesday the historic ouster of that same man. So, there is certainly a lot of reeling, a lot of raw nerves up here on Capitol Hill.And as you can expect, this feeling that they want to hear from the candidates first. Now our colleague Melanie Zanona is reporting this morning that Jim Jordan who was expected to participate has said that he wants to speak with his Republican colleagues in private before he does this forum. We also are learning that Steve Scalise had initially said, he was not going to participate, but then was told these two other candidates were participating. And that influenced his decision. So, a lot up in the air right now. And obviously, there's a question about what this means for the schedule next week and if this will actually happen. So, Dana, so many unanswered questions. But as you can expect, Republicans are thinking what about us. Why don't we have this conversation among ourselves first before going public? Dana?",

      "sentences": "Absolutely, Lauren, thank you so much. Appreciate that. And before we talk around the table, about all this, just a little context. Has there been turmoil at the top of the House before? Yes, but here's the yes part.In my time covering Washington alone, we had a coup to push out Newt Gingrich in the 90s. From the eighth wonder The Washington Post in November of 1998, Gingrich steps down in face of rebellion. Then a plan to replace him with Congressman Bob Livingston of Louisiana. He had to drop out abruptly because of an affair. That led to how alleged affair -- that led to House Republicans settling on a little-known Congressman Denny Hastert. Fast forward to 2015 when John Boehner abruptly resigned, sidenote that was because of a revolt, led by Jim Jordan. Kevin McCarthy was the heir apparent, and then he ran into problems, and they all immediately coalesced around Paul Ryan per speaker. Yes, each of these periods were chaotic. Here's the but now is different, because we really don't know how this is going to end. There is no consensus. There is no they who decide what's next. Let's talk about that with our panel. This is such a fascinating time. And the question that I have at this moment, is whether or not they is Donald Trump, whether he will be the decider, whether he his endorsement of Jim Jordan, will seal the deal for him. We don't know.",

      "sentences": "Well, we'll find out that obviously, we don't know. Obviously, Donald Trump is the leader of the party and has a ton of sway with a lot -- a huge swath of the Republican conference. But I think we have to remember, you're dealing with a Republican conference. What do they have 221, 200, the total numbers.It's such a narrow majority in the House. There are definitely some members, we've heard from them of the Republican conference who are in very tough districts. 18 of them sit in districts that Joe Biden won, who are up for reelection, and who are going to be resistant to this notion of Donald Trump dictating everything. And as we just learned, with the eight members that ousted the speaker of the House for the first time in United States history, which is also what makes it different from all those other examples you just went through. Is that a very small group, just a handful of Republicans can have real say in how this goes. BASH: As we continue this discussion, whether or not this debate happens in Primetime in front of the cameras on Monday night or where the debate happens where a lot of these House Republicans wanted to remain in the short term, which is inside the closed doors of a conference meeting. We do have the beginnings of the arguments that Jim Jordan and Steve Scalise at least are making about why they should be speaker. Let's listen? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "You know, it's interesting to be, Dana, is when you mentioned a couple previous elections for speaker of the House in each of those. And also, the one when Denny Hastert stepped down, that got us Speaker Boehner, eventually Speaker Boehner.In each of those campaigns or battles, there was one candidate who was seen -- one or more candidate who was seen as sort of the low-key legislative craftsman. The guy who came up through the committee system, who really knows his way around the way the hill actually works, right? And I don't think we have that candidate in this race, right? There's not an option right now. Who if all you want to do his craft policy and have somebody who's going to know where to refer this and when to bring this up for a vote? They do not currently have that option. When you think back to the speaker vote in January, you heard over- and-over from allies of Kevin McCarthy? If not him, who else even is there, right. And I think you're seeing the same problem hit now, right? We have two candidates. They're both serious, formidable figures within the Republican Party. But there are real questions about both of them as Nia said. And I think one of the biggest ones is either of these guys really up to the job of managing the House, just on a purely operational level.",

      "sentences": "Meanwhile, on the other side of the aisle, the Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries just penned an op ed, that he put in the Washington post. The headline is, a bipartisan coalition is the way forward for the House, this is fascinating that he's doing this here and right now.Now, he is not saying that there should be a coalition government or anything like that, because that's not a thing in American congress. It's not a parliament. But he is talking about the fact that the narrow majority, and from his perspective, the smallness where the Republicans was McCarthy, apparently, who pushed to kick Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer out of their hideaway offices, that that is not serving people well. My question is whether or not there is a big audience for this. I think on an individual basis, if you talk to moderate Republicans, those in the 18 Biden districts, those who got probably want to get something done and not just blow-up government. Yes, there is an audience for this. But whether there is enough to do what the American people want, which is just everybody calm down, act like adults, and figure things out. CHALIAN: It seems to me that what Hakeem Jeffries is doing that op-ed is also doing a little bit of cleanup work. It's just positioning after his party joined with Gaetz's faction here, I'm not blaming them. I'm just saying, this is what happened to outs Kevin McCarthy a speaker. They were not at all of the mind that they should be part of finding a solution for Kevin McCarthy to keep his job for governing purposes or the like. And I do wonder when I read that, if indeed, he's making a case now so that he portrays his party is not completely in opposed to the idea of reaching across the aisle to make the House function.",

It's the 33rd consecutive month of job growth. You zoom out and a $2.7 million -- excuse me 2.7 million more people are cashing paychecks now versus a year ago.And if you run on the economy, you usually do it with numbers like this. This is what we've seen a cycle after cycle, and yet Americans who will decide who goes to the White House in 2024. They don't seem to be buying Bidenomics yet.

You think this should be such a calling card? Gallup put out new data this week that showed which part -- here comes the president.",
