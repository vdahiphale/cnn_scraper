A U.S. soldier isbelieved to be in North Korean custody after he crossed the border during a tour of the demilitarized zone. We'll have the very latest on what we know about his welfare. Plus, Donald Trump says he expects to be arrested and indicted again. The former U.S. President says he's received a letter telling him he is a target in the criminal investigation in the 2020 election interference. We'll have much more on that. Both of those stories coming up. But first though, we start tonight in North Korea. An American soldier is believed to be in North Korean custody after crossing the border during a tour of the demilitarized zone. The U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin says he crossed on his own accord. Have a listen to what he said in the last hour. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Korea, which put out a statement earlier today, saying that this soldier did willfully cross the demarcation line into North Korea. But Secretary Austin did confirm that the U.S. military is very concerned about the soldier's wellbeing. Now, of course, this is different from other situations where American citizens have been detained by the North Koreans because it does appear, as though this soldier crossed into North Korea voluntarily. But all we really know about him at this point is that he was a junior enlisted soldier. He was assigned to U.S. forces Korea, and he had been facing disciplinary action by the U.S. military we're told. It is unclear why, but we are told that, that could be, of course, a contributing factor to why he crossed that line into North Korea. However, the details are still murky here. Now, importantly, the U.S. military is working with their North Korean counterparts, according to U.S. forces Korea, to try to resolve the situation. It is unclear how exactly this communications are going, and of course, through what kind of medium they are engaging their North Korean counterparts with. But U.S. forces Korea did confirm in a statement that they are working with North Korean military officials to try to see if they can get this service member home. Now, the service member was set to be returned to the United States prior to taking this tour in the demilitarized zone in North Korea, and what is known as the joint security area. He obviously decided to take this tour instead, it is unclear exactly how he managed to get from the airports, where he was set to return back to the United States, to the DMZ to take this tour. So, a lot of detail still unclear here, but the U.S. military obviously very concerned because in the end, it is a U.S. citizen, it is a U.S. service member, Isa.",

Normally, in suchsituations where a U.S. citizen is detained in another country, the State Department, of course, would take the lead on trying to get that citizen back. But because this is a member of the U.S. military, the Pentagon is taking the lead on trying to negotiate with the North Koreans, and try to engage in diplomatic discussions behind the scenes to try to see if he can be released. Now, the State Department, of course, also would be engaged if the U.S. were to determine that this person has been wrongfully detained in a third country. But again, because this individual appears to have crossed the demarcation line voluntarily and willfully, according to the military. It might be a little bit different in how this all plays out. For right now, the State Department really is pointing to the Pentagon as the lead on this, and it is unclear whether this person's status as a U.S. soldier is going to impact how he is treated, of course, by the North Koreans. This may be perhaps someone more valuable for the North Koreans than just your average U.S. citizen, and that may be a complicating factor in all of this, Isa.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Isa, this is a very significant development, to be clear. It's a target letter. What does that mean? TheDepartment of Justice is obviously the lead entity, as it relates to law enforcement in the country, in the United States. They consist of a variety of U.S. attorneys' offices, they also have federal prosecutors. Federal prosecutors investigate and they bring a matter before a grand jury. What is that? A grand jury is an entity that doesn't decide guilt or innocence. They decide two things, whether there's reasonable cause to believe that a crime was committed and, number two, that the subject of the proceeding committed that crime. They consist of 23 members, a simple majority of which have to vote out an indictment, not beyond a reasonable doubt, but again, whether there's reasonable cause to believe. It's been expected that, that grand jury has been hearing a lot of evidence concerning January 6th, concerning what led up to January 6th, concerning issues with respect to whether there has been any illegalities concerning a pressure campaign to overturn the election. But the U.S. Department of Justice decided to do, to send Mr. Trump a target letter indicating that you, sir, are the target of this federal investigation, which means we have enough evidence to believe that you've committed a crime. We invite you to appear before the grand jury that I just spoke of, to give your rendition of the facts. A defendant need not, Isa, appear before a grand jury. You're simply invited to do so. In fact, most of us attorneys advise clients not to do that. But this is the precursor, I believe, to an actual indictment relating to this case, to answer your questions specifically. I do believe an indictment will be imminent, as it relates to January 6th, and the facts and circumstances surrounding that.",

Number one, what was happening and what meetings were taking place after the election in December, after the election in January? Who were you speaking with and what about? Were you making efforts during those conversations? Were you conspiring in any way criminally to upset the democratic process, to undermine the democratic process? If so, with who? And if so, how? Were you doing that as it relates to getting fake electors, which are those people in various states who would come and certify the election? As it relates to January 6th, what role did you play? Was it, in fact, something that was premeditated and planned? Did you attempt to incite any violence at that time? And so, all of these things, as it relates to fraud, as it relates to undermining democracy, as it relates to January 6th are fair game to prosecutors. And in an indictment, we know that they can charge multiple counts relating to multiple acts of misconduct. What specifically they'll be depends upon the evidence they've heard in the grand jury proceedings, which we know are secretive, but we do know that they've spoken to many witnesses concerning the subjects that I just noted.",

      "sentences": "I think there are practical and political implications right now for Trump's campaign if heis, indeed, indicted, in this case, he could potentially be facing three trials during the time in which he's running for president. We already know he's going on trial in March, in the case related to a hush money payment to an adult film star in Manhattan. We will learn later today whether or some more details about when the trial may take place in the classified documents case. Trump has actually argued that, that should go after the election because he's so busy running for president. But you potentially have this third trial, that trial is a real use of time of a defendant. There are times when they have to be in the courtroom. Trials can take weeks. This could interfere with the practicalities of running for election, especially if Trump becomes the Republican nominee. Then you've got the political question, how will it impact the Republican primary race? So far, it looks like the previous indictments may have actually helped Trump because they play into this idea that is at the center of his campaign, that he's a victim of political persecution by the Biden administration. Going forward, if he's the Republican nominee, Trump has already had problems with a wider general electorate in the 2020 election, which he lost, of course, to Joe Biden. How will voters see the prospect of a potentially three times, twice impeached president running for another term in office?",

It makes it very difficult for his opponents because there's no real currency in the Republican Party for siding with a special prosecutor against Donald Trump, who is highly popular. So, it creates a campaign that's all about Trump, and we've seen that in those kinds of circumstances, in the middle of the storm, Trump tends to prosper. So yes, I think, you know, in many ways, Trump's campaign, although he says to his supporters at his rallies that he's trying to save America, I think, in many ways, it's about trying to save himself, either to get elected, in which case, he might be able to make all of these criminal investigations go away, because he would control the Justice Department, or potentially, even if another Republican gets elected, there would be a great deal of pressure on them to end the investigations and potentially pardon him if he was convicted down the road. So, everything in his campaign is now going to be about Donald Trump and the indictments he's facing, at least, on the Republican side.",

Isaac Herzogand President Joe Biden briefly spoke to reporters a short time ago as you can see there. Their visit is meant to symbolize the ironclad U.S.-Israeli ties, but it's also making headlines because the man with the real power in Israel is back home. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hasn't visited the White House since forming a hard-line government last year. Yesterday, his office said, he has been invited by President Biden for a U.S. meeting, but it's unclear where or when that will happen. Mr. Netanyahu's highly controversial push to weaken Israel's judiciary is one reason for those strange ties. Today, thousands of protesters are back on the streets of Israel. It's a last-ditch effort to stop a key part of the sweeping judiciary, the whole package from becoming law next week. Well, let's get the very latest from Washington now. We're joined now by White House reporter, Kevin Liptak.

And if anything, this meeting only underscores the fact that Netanyahu himself has not been invited to the Oval Office for talks.

And the White House said later that the two men had simply agreed to meet in the United States at some point later this year, and they wouldn't say necessarily that would be at the White House or somewhere else, potentially on the sidelines of the U.N. meeting in September. So, clearly, there are remaining -- remains to be strains between these two men, between these two ideologies. President Biden certainly very opposed to this judicial overhaul that Netanyahu has been pushing through his government. And in fact, in an interview with CNN just last week, he said that some members of Netanyahu's government were the most extremist that he had ever seen. And so, certainly, President Biden doesn't necessarily want to reward that kind of policy with though, invite to Washington, at least, just yet, that has caused some anger among Netanyahu and his team.

Four of the major ones, it was on Sunday, I think, thatthey were announcing they were seeing fresh fires being started that were beginning every single hour under these extreme temperatures. And again, we are talking in those parts of Europe of temperatures that hit 118 degrees Fahrenheit over the last couple days. So things that we've simply never seen anywhere in Europe, including in cities and areas that far south. So dry areas near Bordeaux, the ground has never really stopped smoking since the fires of last year. That dry land, so parched as it was by last summer, they fear, will be reignited again in these extreme heats. It's begun in Greece. We expect it to begin in other parts of Europe, as it has even in Switzerland over the course of yesterday. It is that fear that this is becoming something for the long term and something that's not just driven by El Nino, the weather phenomenon, but actually by climate change. I think that are the most terrifying and that are beginning to sink in, Isa.",

Beijing broke its record for the most high temperature days in a year on Tuesday. That's 27 days the southern part of China, meanwhile, is reeling from a typhoon. Typhoon Talim made landfall there Monday morning, flooding certain areas. John Kerry, the U.S. climate envoy, is still in China for talks with his counterpart. We've also been, of course, covering the extreme weather in South Korea. The president there is now calling for an overhaul of the country's disaster response system after less than a week of heavy rains killed dozens of people. And we will be looking at the sweltering temperatures in the U.S. a bit later in the program, as the impact of this extreme heat stretches really right across the globe. In the meantime, I want to recap you on our top story that brought you in the last 37 minutes or so. A U.S. soldier is said to be in North Korean custody after crossing the border from the South. All this, of course, happening in a place almost beyond comprehension. It's been called no man's land, Truce village or the DMZ, the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea. It goes by many different names. But one thing is clear, it's not somewhere most of us will ever go. But our Richard Quest was there just months ago and his report offers a deeper understanding into a place where war and truce collide. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (MUSIC PLAYING) RICHARD QUEST, CNN HOST (voice-over): The two countries are separated by the DMZ, the demilitarized zone, a no-man's border, 2.5 miles wide, stretching 160 miles.

Would I be able to come back onto the South quickly? It is the most weirdest, bizarre, perverse, unusual; it's just mind- boggling that you've got this area, Isa, that is demilitarized, except for mines on either side. And then you've got nothing. You've just got nothing. And nobody wants to cross over, nobody wants to cause an incident.

And then you get to the heart of it. This Truce Village, this peace village, where on one side is the big North Korea headquarters, on the other side is the allies. And the allies, the South Koreans, the U.N. troops, the U.N. forces, they sit there and they wear, obviously, very heavy sunglasses. They wear masks. You can't tell who they are or what they are doing. It's almost like you are glad to leave but you can't believe you've been there. And I still have that feeling.

Even within that building, the building where they had the negotiations, there is a spot for an allied troop to stand, to prevent somebody being dragged across. There used to be cases of that. So the North Koreans have a massive bargaining chip that they are not going to give up lightly. This is not the case. By the way, Isa, they have two phone calls a day, which is basically check calls.
