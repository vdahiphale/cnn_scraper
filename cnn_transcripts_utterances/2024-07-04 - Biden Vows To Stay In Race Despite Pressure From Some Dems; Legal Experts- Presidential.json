Plus, chaos is our friend. That from a person close to Donald Trump on how the former presidents campaign is taking in the Biden crisis.

In just a few hours, we'll hear from President Biden, who admits he, quote, screwed up during last week's presidential debate, but insist, quote, we're going to win this election. Those comments from Biden comes as a growing number of Democrats are publicly raising questions about his ability to beat Donald Trump in November. Here's Democratic Congressman Jared Huffman on CNN earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JARED HUFFMAN (D-CA): We need a reset. We need a course correction.

Let's look at where we are on this July 4th, the day before that big interview, this new reporting that we have that President Biden, Max, told governors he's going to stop doing events after 8:00 because he wants to be able to get more sleep. That may be exactly what the president needs to do. It certainly does not though telegraph vigor. Are you surprised at all that he is saying that out loud, especially actually in such an important meeting? MAX ROSE (D), FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE, NEW YORK: No, no, I'm not surprised about that. I mean, if anything, we've seen a massive staff failure on the part of the Biden team. Part and parcel of that has been pushing the president too hard. In many ways, they've taken their Obama playbook and just applied it to a man who's 81-years-old. But you know, when you take a step back here everybody wants one thing from President Biden as it pertains to the Democratic camp because they all, everyone myself included desperately wants him to be the nominee because we're so proud of his record and his service and believe in his leadership. We just need him to show that he is not in some type of irreversible cognitive decline, and any effort that he can make in terms of engaging with the press corps, with voters, with stakeholders, whatever it might be, that's what people are yearning for.

She went on to say he was clearly making a joke. I mean, I live by this.

And where you're seeing the most sense of urgency here is actually from the group of elected officials exactly opposite that of the incumbent Democratic governors, that are members of Congress and difficult districts who are up in a few short months.Now, these governors, they're dilettantes at this point from a political sense of the word data. They don't have to stand for election for years to come. They're not feeling that sense of urgency, but members of Congress in those tough races, they need Joe Biden to speak directly to the American people and that shouldn't be too much to ask because again, they want him to succeed and desperately want him to be the nominee.",

Immune. Organizes a military coup to hold onto power? Immune. And, of course, she's referring to a future president there. But Chief Justice Roberts, who wrote for the majority in his opinion, really dismissed those concerns. He wrote the dissent's positions in the end boil down to ignoring the Constitution's separation of powers, and the court's precedent.

So I do think that the staff or anyone who is hypothetically order to carry out some sort of criminal activity would not have the same sort of protection. The Supreme Court -- it was very clear that the president occupies a unique role in our constitutional structure.

It's been in power for the past 14 years and the opinion polls going into this election, pretty much reflect that.We're talking about predictions of a landslide victory for the opposition Labour Party, a victory so big, just give you some context, it wouldn't just be the biggest of Labour Party, but the biggest for any single party in the modern, so the modern period for the last 200 years or so. And so we're talking about a seismic shift to the left, the Labour Party is left of center party in British politics. Remember, Erica, its been a very turbulent period in Britain over the past 14 years. There's been five prime ministers, which is a lot for that period. There's been a Scottish referendum which almost tore the country apart. There's been Brexit, which force Britain to leave the European Union. There's been the COVID, pandemic has been a cost-of-living crisis. And British people are pretty disillusioned with actually with both the main political, both the conservative party and the Labour Party in this country, which is why I think some of the smaller parties as well, the Liberal Democrats, the Reform Party, the Green Party, they're likely to see increased share of the national vote as well. So that could complicate the election calculus at the end of this. But yeah, a very momentous election all the opinion polls pointing to a landslide victory for the opposition Labour Party and a catastrophic defeat frankly, for the ruling conservatives.",

I mean, for months now, these two sides have been negotiating on the framework of an agreement, trying to reach that framework agreement before moving on to discussing the details of this agreement. The sequencing of the actual implementation of this deal, the number and the types of Palestinian prisoners, the identities of those prisoners who would be released in change for the hostages.Until now, they have left those details aside, but now, today, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, agreeing to send a delegation led by the Mossad Director David Barnea to Doha, Qatar, to begin engaging in those detailed negotiations. And what that tells us is that it appears that Israel and Hamas now appear to be in a place where they have reached a basics sense of agreements on a framework to move forward and actually try and strike a final deal. We know that this evening, the Israeli Prime Minister and President Biden spoke on the phone, and in the words of the White House following that call they say that these, this next phase of negotiations will be an effort to, quote/unquote, close out the deal. And so, that is really where we are now. The two sides are going to try over the next its two to three weeks according to a source who I spoke with to work out the details of this negotiate, the implementation of it, and to see if indeed they can get to a final agreement. So we could very much -- very well be in a situation in just a matter of a few weeks, where Israel and Hamas are able to actually agree to a final ceasefire and hostage release deal. But that is a big if because the details that they are going to have to negotiate, the implementation of this deal, the devil will indeed be in the details. And so while this is certainly the most progress, the furthest that we have seen these two sides get since the last ceasefire agreement fell apart last December, there certainly remains a lot of work to be done and we cannot say yet that this deal is finalized, nor that the outcome of these negotiations to come over the next couple of weeks is guaranteed -- Erica.",

And indeed a Gaza ceasefire agreement could be what unlocks an agreement between Israel and Hezbollah because Hezbollah has been saying they're firing these rockets, firing these missiles and drones because of this war that is going on in Gaza, they began firing rockets into Israel on October 8th.
