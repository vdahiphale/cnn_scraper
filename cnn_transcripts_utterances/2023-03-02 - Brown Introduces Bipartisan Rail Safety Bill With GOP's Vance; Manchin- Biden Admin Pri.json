      "sentences": "The first week of March 2023, look at the United States Senate. Rich with November 2024 calculations. To defend their Senate majority next year, Democrats need to hold seats in several states Donald Trump won comfortably, if not overwhelmingly.West Virginia, Montana and Ohio lead that list. And Democrats Joe Manchin, Jon Tester and Sherrod Brown are each, to varying degrees, looking for ways to separate themselves from the Biden White House. Our great reporters are back at the table. And just, if we could keep that up there for a second, if you look at it, just in the last week, let's start with Senator Manchin. He has said he's going to have a hearing in his Energy Committee on the COVID pandemic origins, the COVID virus origins. He voted against this retirement rule that Republicans say is wokeism somehow, a Biden retirement rule. And he's taken some other things you see on the left of your screen there. He's taken some other steps. He's opposed to this D.C. crime law. He wants Congress to repeal a D.C. crime law. Look, Donald Trump won West Virginia by, I think, 39 points. So you could understand why he wants to differentiate himself somewhat.",

I mean, someone like Sherrod Brown, I think he even said that he's not going to -- he thinks Biden has been doing a good job.He said that -- has said that publicly. That's going to be a harder needle to thread for him than it is for someone like a Manchin. Tester is right there in the middle.",

      "sentences": "But Tester is, you know, to the Sherrod Brown point, Ohio, Trump carried by eight points. Not 39 points, eight points, but it's still the Republicans viewed as pretty reliably. Red state Democrats won't give you much of an argument, but Sherrod Brown is sort of almost the last Democrat standing, if you will, from a statewide perspective.And you look at this. He says -- to your point, he says that he thinks the President's been incredibly successful. He says if the President were to come there, he would campaign with him. But he says he's not sure on the D.C. crime bill. He just sponsored this bipartisan piece of legislation to deal with rail safety after the horrific accident in East Palestine. So he's trying to do it more gently. Is that the right word than the others? LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: I would say, yes. Sherrod Brown has a very unique reputation in Ohio. He's someone who, as you've talked about before, John, he really fashions himself as this blue collar, but progressive Democrat, and it's worked for him. Even -- I was there in 2018 when he ran for reelection there, and it ended up not being as competitive for him. But at the beginning, Republicans were really hopeful that cycle that they were going to be able to oust him. And he still has been able to hold on to a lot of that blue collar base that he's had before. Of course, it's going to be harder now. Trump won Ohio in 2020 by about -- sorry, not 2020, but Trump -- yes, in 2020, Trump did win Ohio by about eight points. So it still is very much a Republican state right now. And Brown is going to have to try to, on one hand, really explain what he's supporting from the Biden agenda that was passed the prior two years. That's going to be a lot about prescription, you know, drug reform. It's going to be about the other -- the infrastructure elements that he supported that's going to try to bring manufacturing more back to that state. So that's a way that he can try to balance it with the other issues that he's going to try to hold the President's feet to the fire on.",

But you don't -- I think the challenge for them is they don't want to do it in a way that's disingenuous.Everybody knows he's a Democrat. You can only distance yourself from the President, but so much. It seems like he is going to really focus on the accomplishments of the administration and the Democratically controlled Senate and focus on those issues and sort of concede.

Then let's start with Sherrod Brown who, again, a progressive Democrat, keeps winning in a red state, which is to his credit that he can pull that off. It's not a Democrat or Republican statements, to his credit, he can win in a difficult environment.He sponsored this bipartisan rail safety bill. He's not so much taking issue with the President here, but he's saying essentially, you know, maybe you're a Republican. I work with Republicans. We get good things done. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. SHERROD BROWN (D), OHIO: Senator Vance and I with Senator Rubio and Senator -- the new senator from Missouri and the new senator from Pennsylvania and Bob Casey and I are actually working to solve this bipartisan.
