Also new, we're also told that, when Mangione was arrested, he was carrying a spiral notebook. The handwritten notes inside allegedly had lists on how to facilitate a killing. The source says one chilling entry muses about killing -- quote -- \"the CEO at his own bean-counting conference.\" New images also capture Mangione eating a hash brown at the McDonald's where an employee alerted police, where he was also taken into custody. This is the latest mug shot of the 26-year-old suspect. He's being held in Pennsylvania, where he faces five charges, including second-degree murder. He's fighting extradition back to New York while he is being denied bail. In the meantime, this morning, we're expecting new information about the Wisconsin kayaker who faked his own drowning, then took off for Europe, leaving his wife and kids behind. The 45-year-old suspect is now in custody after police say he did return from overseas. CNN law enforcement correspondent Whitney Wild is following all of this. Whitney, what's the latest?",

      "sentences": "Well, that press conference explaining what happened just wrapped up, Jim.And let me just take you back for our viewers who are not super familiar with the story. Basically, what happened was in August this man Ryan Borgwardt went to a place called Green Lake, Wisconsin. It is the deepest lake in Wisconsin. It's about an hour north of his home. He went on a fishing trip, supposedly. But while he was there, he dumped his kayak. He used an inflatable boat to paddle to shore, hopped on an e-bike, later hopped on a bus, hopped on a plane to Europe. And so there was this big search for weeks, Jim, looking for him, because the suspicion had been that he had drowned. But when -- through using high-tech technology and just a long list of deputies and volunteers, they never found his body, that's when the Green Lake Sheriff's Office realized, OK this is a different story and that's when they figured out that he had fled to Europe. So that -- again, that was in August. They said that they were able to establish communication with him in November. And so for the last month, Jim, they have been talking to him pretty regularly. There on your screen was a video that they shared with us where he was saying that he was safe, that he was alive, which had been also the central question, where was he? And so deputies with the Green Lake Sheriff's Office were able to establish this rapport over the last month. And, Jim, they did something incredible. They convinced him to come home. He got on a plane out of his own volition. He turned himself in to the sheriff's office yesterday. Here's how the Green Lake Sheriff's -- the Green Lake sheriff, Mark Podoll, described what happened.

That was the -- that was the sound of Ryan Borgwardt earlier this year saying that he was alive and well.The Green Lake Sheriff's Office had this press conference today. And here's what they kept saying, Jim. They kept saying they were trying to get him to come home so that he could be with his family over Christmas, Jim. And it's a really incredible feat, when you consider that this man very likely knew he would face charges when he came back. And still they were able to convince him to get on that plane in Europe, come home and turn himself in. There are a lot of details we don't know at this point, Jim. We don't know why he went. The sheriff's office would not say. They wouldn't say if he's spoken with his wife and kids. They wouldn't say really much about where he came from, where he landed in the U.S. But, right now, they're saying that the central point here is that they were able to convince him to come home and his family will be able to see him around Christmas, Jim.",

      "sentences": "All right, Whitney Wild, thank you very much.In the meantime, a judge has blocked The Onion from buying Alex Jones' conspiracy theory-driven Web site Infowars. The Onion had the winning bid for the conspiracy platform last month. It was sold off in Jones' defamation settlement with Sandy Hook families. But a bankruptcy judge says he has a problem with how it all went down. CNN media correspondent Hadas Gold joins us now. Hadas, a few weeks ago, when we heard about this, it sounded like this was going to happen. But now there's been a hiccup. What can you tell us?",

So the judge told the court-appointed trustee, go away for 30 days and try to figure out something else, some sort of alternative, but he didn't seem like he wanted it to go up for another round of bidding. And so there is the possibility that it could stay in Alex Jones' hands.There's a possibility there could be some other sale set up in some way.And I should also remind you that no matter what had happened with this, even if The Onion had successfully bought Infowars and taken it out of Alex Jones' hands, there was nothing preventing Alex Jones from continuing to spread his dangerous lies. And he had already set up all these other new handles and domains and was directing people that way and he could continue having his show. There's nothing preventing him from doing that. He has his still First Amendment rights. But the Infowars domain, that would have gone into the hands of The Onion had they been successful. And they still might be.There still might be other steps to this and The Onion says they're going to still continue to pursue this and try to buy Infowars.",

I don't want to put out a plug for my alma mater, but they did lose to my alma mater, JMU, this past football season.And it was a blowout. And I just thought to myself, at the time, I was like, OK, what has happened to UNC? I mean, they're more of a basketball school than a football school, but that would definitely change with Bill Belichick.",

I think if Bill Belichick takes this UNC job, that then kind of changes and gives that program a face-lift.They have an NFL guy in there and they can run that program like an NFL kind of program. And Bill Belichick already mentioned something like that earlier this week when discussing potentially taking this job. So I think, if he comes in there, he will be able to run it like an NFL program. And I know there's questions about how will he deal with the transfer portal, how will he deal with NIL and things of that nature? But if you look at a Bill Belichick, he can delegate those jobs to a G.M. that a lot of these coaches are hiring. If you look at a school like Stanford, a school with a similar academic prestige at that Power Four level two, a school like UNC, that's one of the higher rated academic schools in the Power Four. Stanford just hired Andrew Luck to be the general manager and he's not even a coach.",
