Could you state, like, very clearly, yes or no, is that expert here to participate in anything surrounding the care of the President of the United States? JEAN-PIERRE: So, let me just say a couple of things. We have had a comprehensive - and I just want to take another step back - comprehensive physical examination. The President has had that. We've given a comprehensive report. We've shared that the past three years. Every year that he has - every year that he has had this exam, he sees a neurologist. And just to give you a quote from that - from the report most recently, in February, an extremely detailed neurological exam was, again, reassuring in that there were no findings which would be consistent with \"any cerebellar or other central neurological disorder, such as a stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's or ascending lateral sclerosis,\" end quote. So, that came directly from - in February, in that comprehensive report that was provided by the President's doctor to me that I share with all of you. So, anyone who is watching can certainly go to our website.",

And I will say, and you've heard us say this before or most recently, this is a president who's won the primary, right, by 14 million votes. Eighty-seven percent of those votes, certainly. And, look, I don't have any engagements to read out, you know, outside of that. But I will say that the President was in Pennsylvania. I just mentioned at the top, he got to see Sen. Fetterman, Sen. Casey. He also got to see Congresswoman Dean. He spent some time with them. They traveled across Pennsylvania. And I will say, when the President gets knocked down, he gets back up.

JEAN-PIERRE: I think the Democrats spoke for themselves. I think, you know, you know how stories work. It - there is a lot of back and forth. When you all come with a story from us and we want to make sure you hear from other voices, we make that available to you all. It is up to the reporter if they're going to reach out or not to that particular person. But we expect and we anticipate and we understand that it doesn't matter who, if it's a congressperson or a governor or any elected official, they're going to speak for themselves. They're going to speak for themselves. And I would say that Rep. Greg Meeks has also been very supportive. If you fast forward to where we are today, Representative Meeks has very - been very supportive of this president, continuing moving forward. And we've heard from many others, many others, CBC, more broadly, has been very supportive. We heard from the chair, Chairman Horsford from the CBC.

I think I explained it sometimes when you all are working on stories and we want to hear - you want to - we - and we were trying to provide supporters from the President, that is not unusual.
