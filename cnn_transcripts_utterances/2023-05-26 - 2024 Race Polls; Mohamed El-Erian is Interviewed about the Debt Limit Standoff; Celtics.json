Look, we, just this week, had a campaign announcement on Twitter, although kind of botched, but it still was going to a social media platform to give people information. So, thinking outside the box, how are young people receiving their information? Maybe they're not watching us right now on CNN. They should. But if they're not, they're going to have to talk to them on TikTok. We're going to have to talk to them on different social media platforms. Some that might not even be created yet. I will say, though, a lot can change in this time period. And I really do think young people showed up in historical numbers, not just in 2020, but in 2022. And when they see some of the Supreme Court decisions that are about to come down and really, you know, Joe Biden always says, don't compare me to the almighty, compare me to the alternative.

If this is wrong and the U.S. does default, it will tip us into recession, it will make people feel weak -- even more insecure.

There are those who believe in a pause, which means you stop and you signal that the next one, when it comes, will be down. And there are those who want just a hike.
