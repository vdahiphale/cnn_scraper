All that are information that we need to have an independent investigation done. So, yes, we're very concerned about whether all percussions we're taken and the conditions of the vessel. The bridge took five years to build. And we've noticed that officials have not been wanting to give estimates of how long this may take to rebuild.

And it affects not only our nation, but the global supply chains. So that's our first priority, after recovery, is to get the channel open, get that vessel out of the channel altogether before we even talk about the plans for rebuilding the bridge itself. So it's going to take some time. But the urgency is now. We've got to move as quickly as we possibly can. But we have to make sure it's safe. There are things that are in the riverbed today coming off of the vessel or the bridge that we have to make sure are secure before we have workers there's involved in trying to get the channel open or a bridge replaced.",

They're operating the same actually.I'm going to read a statement from someone who is both the RNC and Trump campaign spokesperson. So goes to show you there. But it's not surprising that both the RNC and the campaign are putting a value on loyalty. Loyalty is incredibly important to Donald Trump. And part of that loyalty is sharing the same beliefs that he has. And he has repeatedly said that he still believes the 2020 election was stolen. Now, it's not that surprising that the RNC is turning its focus to what they call election integrity or a focus on election fraud. So a reminder that Donald Trump's handpicked candidate to run the RNC, Michael Whatley, said he was going to focus on this. That is why Donald Trump likes him so much, because he thinks that Whatley really knows a lot about, quote, unquote, \"election integrity.\" They've also staffed up with lawyers who are going to focus on the election. One of the reasons that Donald Trump had a falling out with Ronna McDaniel was because of the fact he didn't think that we're enough lawyers in place during the 2020 election to help secure his victory. Now, this is the response that we got from this spokesperson, both RNC and Trump campaign. They said, \"Candidates who worked on the frontlines in battleground states or are currently in states where fraud allegations have been prevalent, were asked about their work experience. We want experienced staff with meaningful views on how elections are won and lost, and real experience-based opinions about what happens in the trenches.\" Now, unsurprisingly, we've already heard from the Biden campaign on this. They are going scorched earth, saying elections are only fair if Donald Trump wins. Again, not that surprising here.",

Here we are. That's, I think, a good thing out of something so terrible, is that we're shining a light on what these athletes had to go through. I mean, this is the highlight of their college careers. They have made the NCAA tournament. They're going to dinner to celebrate and get ready for their first game, which, by the way, they won the first round. And instead, they're subjected to hate crimes, to racial taunts, to slurs, to the worst words in the worst of us. Shame on everyone involved. And I would hope the NCAA will look at where they're locating these events. And you can't take politics out of this. If there is any chance that there would be trouble in a state or a city, it is time for the NCAA and any organizing body to understand that that can impact athletes, especially athletes of color and also women. And that's just a fact of our world in 2024. And I think the NCAA has to be very realistic about that, Boris, and understand that they have to be leaders here.

Now they are. Of course, we have Caitlin Clark. We are seeing the TV ratings go through the roof. And everything has really changed. And yet, the idea that you would be housing these teams so far away. Understandably, a volleyball tournament in town. Then in that case, it seems to me the NCAA has to say, OK, Spokane, Gonzaga, you cannot host because you cannot provide lodging near the arena. And we're going to find another place to host.
