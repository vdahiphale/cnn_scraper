It is a strong message of how important, how urgent Biden thinks his presence on the ground, talking to leaders, negotiating, potentially finding compromise deescalating this situation is. That is why he is there to talk to various leaders, of course, including Netanyahu, but also other Arab leaders as well.Now one of the main concerns for the U.S. is that this conflict is going to spread. It's going to go beyond the borders of Israel into other areas. And we've been seeing just in the last day, Israel evacuating 28 areas in the north because of exchange of fire with Hezbollah, the militant group in Lebanon. This is the pattern that the U.S. are concerned about escalating. More and more states around Israel becoming involved in this conflict. So that is why he is there on the ground, talk to leaders, find compromises, ways to find common ground. If there is any at all and see what they can be done. And of course, the big question in all of this. Is what is the U.S.'s involvement going to be? If the escalation continues? How much military involvement is there going to be from the U.S.? And it's very notable that as this visit is arriving, he turns up in Israel tomorrow. We have as well the U.S. head of Central Command, also in Israel meeting with the head of the Israeli army. So clearly a lot of military discussions, a lot of cooperation being discussed here.",

It's something that applies to all actors -- or all actors that are in this conflict. All the people that are there. And its goal is to minimize the suffering, that every precaution should be taken and that people, civilians, who are not part of this fight are able to access food, water, shelter with many people sleeping outside right now.

The cumulative effects of this ongoing conflict are not just having physical effects on people, but also emotional and psychological. But right now, our focus is recognizing that there is a desperate need for food, water, shelter, electricity, medical assistance, and that every effort must be taken by all parties to make sure that actors, neutral actors such as the ICRC are able to meet these needs. We are working in Israel and the occupied territories and in Gaza to provide assistance to all people that are affected by armed conflict, this is our responsibility. This is what the ICRC was created for. But it's up to others, up to States and other authorities to ensure that we're able to do our job. And if we are not able to provide assistance in Gaza, if we're not able to deliver relief, then we're not going to be able to do the job that we so desperately want to do and that is so desperately needed.",

Who is also reporting that the suspect at the time that he was shot, was in fact carrying a weapon.And this happened in a neighborhood in northeast Brussels called Schaerbeek, just about two or three kilometers or so from the actual shooting site. And if Schaerbeek rings any bells in your mind, that's because it was in the spotlight back in 2016. Because some of the perpetrators of the terror attacks in Brussels that targeted the metro, the airport, planned the attacks from neighborhoods in that neighborhood. The Prime Minister also held a press conference in the middle of the night. The Belgian Prime Minister, saying that the suspect was of Tunisian origin living in the country illegally. And obviously there was, you know, plenty of concern raised early on when authorities made reference to a video that had been circulating online, where someone claiming to be the suspect had had said that they were inspired by ISIS and also specifically mentioning the nationality of those who had killed. Two people killed, Swedish nationals, a third person, a taxi driver, shot and injured but expected to recover. The Prime Minister called it terrorism, extreme brutality and carried out with a weapon of war. Obviously, the terror alert level was raised. Why on Earth anyone would target someone specifically because they're wearing Sweden football colors? You'd have to ask the suspect, obviously, but you can imagine, you know, Sweden has been in the news a lot lately. As you guys know, for one person, one man in in Sweden who's carried out Quran burnings there, which have sparked protests across the Muslim world.",

You might have watched the first half on TV it went off as per usual, and then only at half time, I think did the players get word, did the official sort of get word and then it was decided that they wouldn't actually play the second half of the game.And more pressing for officials was the fact that you had all of these people, many of them wearing Sweden colors, who were inside of this stadium with a shooter inspired by ISIS, looking for Swedes on the loose.
