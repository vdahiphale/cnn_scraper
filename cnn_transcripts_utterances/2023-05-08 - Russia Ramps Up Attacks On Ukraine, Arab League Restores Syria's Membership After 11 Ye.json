But first, Russia hit Ukrainewith a barrage of missile and drone strikes overnight ahead of Victory Day tomorrow. Ukraine's military says 61 airstrikes were launched. An investigation is underway into the mass shooting in Texas. The gunman opened fire at a shopping mall killing eight people and wounding at least seven others. In Turkey, the Vice-Presidential candidate for the opposition was hit with stones during a rally in the run up to the elections. Presidential and power -- parliamentary elections are slated for Sunday All right welcome to our second hour of Connect the World; I'm Zain Asher for you in New York. On Sunday, the Arab League voted to reinstate Syria as a member effective immediately. The organization does not dictate policy for member states but the reinstatement paves the way for serious dictator Bashar al-Assad to reinstate -- reenter rather in the world stage. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad became a pariah after he brutally crushed popular uprisings that began in 2011. The country has been engulfed in a devastating civil war ever since. 350,000 Syrians have been killed and millions more have been displaced. The Arab League Secretary General is making it clear that decision on readmission applies to the block itself, not to individual countries. CNN's Nada Bashir has a look this hour and how exactly we got to this point. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER (voiceover): An unthinkable prospect now a reality. The Arab League has reinstated Syria, more than a decade after Damascus was suspended over President Bashar al-Assad deadly crackdown on antigovernment protests. Now talk of an Arab led political process to end the bloody Syrian civil war that has haunted the region for years.",

BASHIR (voiceover): Syria says it welcomed the announcement and that it will participate in strengthening joint action. The decision to welcome Syria back into the fold hasn't come as a total surprise, following a series of diplomatic victories for Assad. Last week, Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi, met with Assad in Damascus, a first for an Iranian Head of State in 13 years. And in April, a similar visit to the Syrian capital by Saudi Arabia's foreign minister. But not all Arab states are supporting Syria's return, including some that have actively supported Syria's rebel groups. Qatar's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Majed bin Mohammed Al-Ansari, said his country continues to stand against the normalization of ties with the Assad regime. And among those most wary of Syria's ascent, Israel, the IDF suspected of hitting targets inside Syria to prevent Iran from gaining a foothold as part of their proxy war with Iran. And for the millions of Syrian refugees brutalized by Assad's war, it may be hard to accept this decision as anything but a betrayal",

Now, of course, there is the hope by the Arab League that this could potentially lead to some sort of political solution, a solution are brought about by the Arab nations themselves, as opposed to through Western intervention. That was certainly the message from the Arab League Secretary General. But of course, this has been condemned by members of the international community, not least the United States. We've heard in the State Department already saying that they will not seek to normalize ties with President Bashar al-Assad's regime, nor will they offer their support to other nations choosing to do so. But the focus now for the Arab League is to establish -- reestablish those channels of communication and dialogue with President Bashar al-Assad regime in order, in their words to bring about some sort of political solution. But of course, as you mentioned there, for many Syrians, millions of Syrians who have already faced so much hardship of these horrific atrocities at the hands of President Bashar al-Assad, over more than a decade. Now, this is a real blow to any hope of seeking accountability. We've already seen countless people killed; we're talking about nearly half a million people killed over the course of the Civil War. Millions of people according to the UN, at least 14 million people made refugees by President al-Assad's war. And of course, here in Europe, we've seen the impact of that. We've seen the countless death a dizzying number of deaths on the Mediterranean with many families risking absolutely everything in search of safety. And there is a real sense of apprehension of fear now amongst Syrian refugees, as we continue to hear conversations around the prospect of potentially being returned to Syria, if those ties are normalized, particularly in countries like Lebanon and Turkey. There's neighboring countries which have already taken in so many Syrian refugees. So, there is a real sense of fear. Now, of course, and for many Syrians, for many members of the Arab community in general, this really has been seen as a betrayal. The Arab League maintains that this is really an effort to secure that political dialogue to bring an end to this crisis. But the road ahead is long, Zain.",

They tell us they haven't zeroed in onone specific motive, but they are certainly looking at the possibility that this suspect this 33 year old Dallas man was motivated by far right extremism. And that's for two reasons. I'm told by a law enforcement source that after this suspect was shot and killed by a local police officer here in the middle of that mass attack, excuse me authorities found on his chest and insignia bearing the letters RWDS which the source tells me authorities belief stands for Right Wing Death Squad. It's the same type of insignia that we've seen, extremists here in the United States were on their chest at various rallies and protests across the country over the last few years. I'm also told that authorities have been digging into the suspect social media. He has an incredibly large social media presence to include postings, images, as well as written text. Authorities believe he posted about white supremacy about Neo Nazi. So as they continue to look into the shooters past and gathers information, it certainly appears that they're getting the prevailing theory is that this could have been yet the latest shooter here in the United States that was dug, committed to some type of act of violence based on radicalization.",

He also had multiple magazines, these are the contraptions that are put into the weapon that provide additional ammunition after you go through one magazine, you reload. He had several of those magazines on his chest. So again, it's so chilling to think that but for that police officer engaging the shooter stopping him shooting him dead, this could have been so much worse. I'm also told by law enforcement source that authorities went through the suspects' vehicle that was here in the parking lot behind me and found multiple weapons. So we certainly came here with an arsenal intending to conduct this mass attack, of course, going back to that AR15 style weapons and of course, we look at mass shooting after mass shooting in the United States this very high powered rifle has been seen time and time again. Of course here in the United States it is legal to own this type of weapon. The same type of weapon that was originally designed for use on the battlefield by military personnel is now causing unspeakable carnage here across the United States, Zain.",

This could be the man who unseats Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and what observers say is perhapsthe most consequential election in the country's modern history. Kilicdaroglu has been described as Mr. Erdogan's exact opposite, a soft spoken career politician sometimes called the Turkish Gandhi. Hopefully we do have a picture of him. There he is. He is leading a wide ranging opposition and has centered his campaign around undoing the authoritarian measures slowly imposed by President Erdogan. Opinion polls are neck and neck and both candidates are in full campaign mode. Just look at the huge crowd at this rally for Mr. Erdogan. Over the weekend though things started to get ugly. The Turkish opposition vice presidential candidate was attacked with stones during a campaign rally. His bus was also pelted with rocks as well. The Republican People's Party calls the attack on Ekrem Imamoglu provocation and says that he is fine. My next guest Writing and Foreign Affairs says \"the Turkish presidential contest may be the most consequential election this year either Erdogan will lose giving Turkey a chance of restoring full democracy or he will win and lightly remain in power rather for the rest of his life.

In Turkey on top of that the opposition is united. So on paper, the opposition should be winning. However, as you said, the race has not been fair. President Erdogan has almost complete control over Turkey's institutions, including election monitoring bodies, many of the courts 90 percent of the media. He can write a narrative of any sort of political debate that he wants. So the race is completely unfair. But I think the vote is going to be free. And that's what matters. Turkey's citizens have been voting in free and fair elections since 1950, longer than the citizens of Spain have. And the vote itself will be free. In Turkey, there is usually quite high turnout nearing 90 percent. Citizens love to vote, show up at ballot stations observed the vote. So I think that we're going to see hotly contested race. Erdogan has narrowed the gap using his control of institutions and the fact that this has been an unfair race, but the opposition candidate is still leading.

He delivered growth lifted people out of poverty, improved access to the services, and he has built a base of adoring supporters, many of whom he has lifted out of poverty who don't love him, but for the last five years or so economy has faced problems. Mr. Erdogan embrace on orthodoxy. He believes that interest rates drive inflation and not the other way around. He's kept interest rates artificially low that are scared away investors. On top of that, he's also become quite autocratic at home, I would say, the way I would describe Turkey is that it's a democracy that has fallen under an autocrat. And in foreign policy, Turkey is a coldly transactionalist (ph) country that plays Russia and the US against each other to get what it wants. This could be a change -- time for a change in Turkey.

And because theopposition had unified, he has since picked up some support. And that was mainly because of financial inflows, money that came from UAE, Saudi Arabia and Russia. Three fellow autocrats, Vladimir Putin, the Saudi Crown Prince, and the Emirati Royal Family that wants to see Erdogan in power, I think because they'd like to see a fellow autocrat with whom they can continue to challenge the US led liberal international order. All these monies help stabilize President Erdogan in the polls, and he was picking up again. The earthquake, I think, stop that trend is normally picking up in the polls. The gap was really narrow, but he hasn't really caught up with opposition leader Kilicdaroglu. I think he's used the unfair nature of the election, the institutions and the race in the country to narrow the gap. So my guess is that if this is a hotly contested race, let's say a margin of victory within one percent for the presidency, or a few seats for the parliament.
