She's Hunter Biden's sister-in-law turned girlfriend. She detailed their past relationship, how he introduced her to crack cocaine, and how she disposed of the gun right at the center of this case back in 2018.Meanwhile, President Biden told ABC News he will respect the jury's verdict in his son's trial.

Right now, an FBI chemist is on the stand explaining to the jury about the testing that they did on a pouch where Hunter Biden allegedly stored the gun that he bought in October of 2018. And prosecutors want these two experts, a DEA agent who described some of the drug terms that are in those text messages that prosecutors have displayed to the jurors and this FBI agent to sort of wrap up their case. We expect that they're going to rest sometime this morning before, as you pointed out, we will hear from the defense and we expect Naomi Biden, the defendant's daughter to take the stand and Jimmy Biden, the president's brother, to also take the stand. Both of them are intended to try to blunt some of the evidence that prosecutors have put on, including from Hallie Biden, the things that she testified to yesterday, which the importance of which is -- was to place some of his drug use -- alleged drug use into October of 2018, around the time that he bought that gun and why he's on trial here today, Wolf. We expect also that this case is going to go into next week before going to the jury. Wolf.",

To watch Hunter Biden, obviously, he's not at the defense stand, but his mother, Jill Biden, has been here for most of the week, except for yesterday. You have other family members who've come in to try to provide some support. In some cases, where prosecutors are showing these embarrassing photographs and videos, photographs showing him passed out with crack pipes behind him, showing him in sort of his most -- his lowest moments. You can see the family members, in some cases, not looking up at Jill Biden.For instance, First Lady Jill Biden sometimes doesn't even look up at the screen to see what is being displayed. And you can see also the jurors paying very close attention, particularly to the star witness, Hallie Biden, when she described finding the gun and throwing it away. It's a very, very -- obviously, a very tough time for the family. But it is truly what happened, what Hunter Biden himself has described his struggle with drug abuse. And so, the question is, can the defense turn on what is really a mountain of evidence that the prosecution is offering in this case, Wolf. We'll see whether that happens in the day -- the next couple of days of this trial.",

We're going to bring it to you, of course, live as soon as he begins speaking. Stand by for that.In the meantime, as we await the president, I want to turn to another major story we're following right now. A story involving the Israel- Hamas war and a CNN exclusive. A new CIA report says Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu likely believes he could get away without setting up a post-war plan for Gaza. That, despite increasing pressure from the Biden administration to end the conflict. CNN's intelligence reporter, Katie Bo Lillis, is joining us now with more of her excellent reporting. Katie Bo, how did the CIA reach this conclusion on Netanyahu?",

I do think, you know, one of -- there continues to be a real awareness that there's a very narrow path here for potential success, getting all the parties to sort of agree to this proposal.Now, the Biden administration has been characterizing this as an Israeli proposal. They say that the ball is in Hamas' court, but of course, we have heard some very tepid statements from Israel itself about this proposal, and one of the things that the CIA assessment really highlights is how deep the divisions are within Netanyahu's own governing coalition about what a post-conflict Gaza might look like, you know, from a security perspective, from a governance perspective. And so, I think that really just underscores and emphasizes how difficult of a moment this is for the Biden administration to try to achieve the goals they want.",

Now, he's surveying this site by foot. He is walking to the stage. He has a front row that's filled with his top foreign policy officials, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, John Kerry, of course, former secretary of state, his onetime climate envoy.And he also has one living army ranger who arrived here at Pointe du Hoc in the days following D-Day. He plans to talk about that veteran, John Wardell, in this speech as he talks about the power of democracy and what Americans continue fighting for. The president is now approaching the podium and we expect him to begin momentarily, but you can see him taking in just the magnitude of the situation. Honoring those who have died here, looking at the wreaths that serve as memorials to the lives that were lost here, the battle that was fought here and everything that has occurred that led to the liberation of Europe.

Nazi Germany was defeated and the world has been different ever since.You see the president there meeting with some of the dignitaries who have shown up for this historic moment right now, 80 years after D- Day. We saw the secretary of state, Antony Blinken there. We're watching the president go through the receiving line, meeting with others who have come to listen to his words, very powerful words. Among other things, he said, I refuse to believe America's greatness is a thing of the past. Significant statement indeed. Christiane Amanpour is joining us right now.

      "sentences": "Well, he started with an almost a blow-by-blow account of how those several hundred American Rangers not just got off their amphibious boats and had to clear the beach in the hail of Nazi mines, gunfire, shells and the like, but then had to get to the cliff and scale that cliff, up to Pointe du Hoc.He talked about one of them who had been shot in the hip and yet kept going. And he talked about that one who turned around when one of his comrades said, I don't think I can do it. And the injured man said, yes, you can. You have to do it. So, all of that was the illustration of how he described the greatness of these Americans, who, as he said, at that time, many of them had -- couldn't even find this coastline on a map, had never been to a country, they didn't know it. These were people that they didn't know or had never met. And yet, they went there to do the right thing and to, you know, listen to the call of duty. He talked immediately about how that, face down, Hitler and the Third Reich and how Americans, in that moment and all the other allies who helped, showed that this kind of tyrannical bully could not continue and turned the tide of that war. And then, he immediately made comparisons to Putin and the aggression and the tyranny that's undergoing now in Ukraine. And he rhetorically kept asking, would these rangers who scaled Pointe du Hoc 80 years ago, would they have said that we couldn't do the same now when there's a similar aggressor in Europe? And he turned also to the United States saying, would these men have wanted Americans to think just about themselves and their own selfish desires as opposed to everyone in the country, as opposed to defending and remaining committed to democracy? So, this was a speech most certainly about what those incredible people did. Who he said, frankly, and I hadn't even realized it, he's the first president to come to this ceremony and make this speech when no surviving member of the boys of Pointe du Hoc, as Reagan called them, remain. They've all passed away. There were other veterans there, but apparently, none of those who scaled that hundred-foot cliff and turned the tide of this war. But he was very clear that this was about defending democracy, as he said, at home and abroad, and for putting something greater than self at the center of the political project that he wanted to further for the United States and also for the rest of the world.
