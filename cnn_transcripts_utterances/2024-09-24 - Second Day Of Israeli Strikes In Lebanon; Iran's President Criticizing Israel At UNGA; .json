Routh wasoriginally charged with two firearm related offenses after he was discovered near one of Trump's golf courses. Prosecutors say Routh camped outside the course with a rifle while the former president was playing. For more on this now, we're joined by Evan Perez. Evan, what more do we know at this hour? EVAN PEREZ, CNN U.S. SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, we now have these charges. There are six counts that Ryan Routh is now facing, and one of them is attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate, that of course being Donald Trump. That is a charge that brings with it a potential life in prison, if he is convicted. And so, now, these charges, if you remember, initially were just on these gun related charges. And prosecutors made clear, and the FBI and the Justice Department made clear that they were all along pursuing attempted assassination charges, and that's what they finally have done. And so, one of the things that we learned from prosecutors in the last couple of days is that Routh spent roughly weeks essentially stalking the former president, beginning in August, where he was keeping track of Donald Trump's movements, wanting to make sure when he would be at the at the golf course there in West Palm Beach. And so, he was spending a lot of time there based on his cell phone track. We also know, that before he traveled down from North Carolina, where he lived, to the Florida -- South Florida area, one of the things he did is he left a handwritten letter, I can show you a part of it right here, that they filed in court. And one of the things that you learned in there is that he allegedly said that this was an attempted assassination, essentially, previewing the fact that he was going to try to kill the former president and perhaps not succeed. So, now, we have this case is going to go forward. One of the interesting parts of this Julia, is that the judge who is going to be presiding over this case is Judge Aileen Cannon. Of course, she was the judge who is overseeing Donald Trump's classified documents case. She dismissed that, and that is a case that is now going up on appeal in the 11th Circuit.

U.S. officials say RT is involved in covert activities and spreads Kremlin propaganda. TikTok says the accounts engage in covert influence against its guidelines.

      "sentences": "Well, we'll start with John, because John really is still a catastrophic event for here in Southwestern Mexico, fromPuerto Escondido all the way over now to Acapulco. And I will show you how Acapulco was now in the mix from this. It is now only a 35-mile per hour event, the remnant of what was a Category 3 that made landfall yesterday. But it's hours, in fact, days of heavy rainfall that's going to stay in the same place. And talk about Acapulco, this is why I'm talking about it because the white area, here still to come, 20 inches. That's 500 millimeters of rainfall still to come from this. And if you put that much water uphill from Acapulco, all of that water has to run downhill. Now, sure, it's kind of sparsely populated through here. But there's 850,000 people in Acapulco. And obviously, some tourists as well. Now, getting back to what Patrick was talking, about Pinal del Rio, right there where a lot of Cuban tobacco was grown, they're going to get an awful lot of rainfall in a time of the year where they don't really want it. And then the storm is going to run at Cancun. So, yes, likely a hurricane by the time it does get to Cancun tomorrow and then into significantly warm and not only warm water, Julia, but deep warm water for hundreds of feet. This water is still above 80 degrees, 85 degrees, you know, 32 degrees, 33 degrees Celsius. So, this is an awful lot of energy that Patrick was talking about that this storm is going to have. Could it get stronger than Category 3? Sure. Could it be still only a Category 2? Absolutely. We're still talking more than 48 hours before this actually makes landfall, but hurricane warnings are obviously already posted for Mexico Beach almost all the way down to Tampa. And yes, there's going to be surge. So, three to five meters worth of surge. Ten to 15 feet of surge here in this -- well, almost like a catcher's mitt. The water's not going to have anywhere to go. When the storm is going to push up into this angular area, all that water is going to get trapped there and go up the rivers. And even on the east coast, I think we're going to see some surge for places like Savannah, Jacksonville, maybe all the way up toward Hilton Head as maybe three feet of surge there. Now, yesterday, we showed you this where the GFS model, the American model, was so far stronger than the European model. And we were saying, man, let's just hope the European model is right because the GFS is Cat-4, Cat-5 edge. So, now, look, the GFS has calmed down. It is not Cat-4 or Cat-5 anymore, but still, 110 to 115 miles per hour. So, upwards of 180 kilometers per hour coming on shore. The next big thing with this, Julia, is the rainfall. There will be between 250 and 350 millimeters of rain that comes down into places like Georgia, North Carolina, the mountains even of South Carolina. We don't need that kind of rainfall. And here's the area here from North of Atlanta, everywhere that you see pink is 10 inches of rain, 12 inches of rain, and in some spots more. And this is all going to -- again, in this hilly area, going to run down and possibly make flash flooding. That could be a huge concern for us. Yes, there'll be waves in the Gulf of Mexico, 30 feet, you know, I mean, OK, eight meters, nine meters. But this isn't the first storm to hit this area. In fact, just in August, Debby ran right through the same area. So, a lot of infrastructure is already fragile. Trees are already very wet. And if you put that kind of wind into a soil that is soggy mud, I'm afraid we're going to have hundreds of thousands, if not millions of customers without power. Julia.",

The crew of SpaceX's PolarisDawn flying further into space than anyone else in half a century. Commander Jared Isaacman actually left the mission capsule completing the first ever commercial spacewalk. Only an experimental suit between him and the vacuum of space, the mission offers an exciting glimpse into the future of space travel. And CEO Elon Musk is promising more. Just this week, Musk said he plans to send starships to Mars in two years' time. It's certainly a lofty goal. SpaceX client NASA is still working on returning to the moon. Well, anyway, I'm pleased to say we're joined now by Jared Isaacman. He's the Polaris Storm mission commander and the CEO of Shift4. Jared, welcome to the show. It's incredibly exciting to have you with us and to have you back down on Earth. You told my colleague this weekend, which stood out to me that effectively four people went on this trip, but you took, I think, 14,000 people with you. Such was the sheer effort that it took to get you there. I mean, this was an enormous team effort. JARED ISAACMAN, CEO, SHIFT4 AND MISSION COMMANDER, SPACEX POLARIS DAWN MISSION: Yes, there's no question. I mean, there is a reason why it's been more than a half century since we went that far into space. I mean, it's a very hostile environment up there. There's lots of radiation. There's debris and micro meteoroids, which is dangerous. No one is built a new space suit that you can do a spacewalk in in more than 40 years. So, there were a lot of big firsts here on this mission, which is great, because this is all in the direction of getting back to the moon and Mars and really, you know, kind of opening up this last great frontier. But it takes an army. There's 14,000 of some of the brightest minds in the world here at SpaceX that show up to work every day, believing there's no greater contribution they can make then kind of embarking on this amazing adventure to make life multiplanetary. And we may stand to learn an awful lot along the way.",

Asyou said, I mean, this was a lot of experimental aspects to this. You had a short window. You needed perfect weather to get back home. You were wearing suits that we haven't really updated in, what, almost four decades. So, that was a huge part of the science and the experiment here. Were you afraid? Were your family afraid?",

The reality is throughout 60 years of human space flight, you know, 50 percent of astronauts who get on orbit feel terrible. I mean, really horrible. And they have to be treated with medication. I mean, it's all because of the fluid shifts in your body. And this kind of goes to the heart of so much of the science and research that we were undertaking on this mission, because we do believe in a world where space and this last frontier is open for everyone, but we want people to be healthy and happy when they're up there and actually able to construct and repair and build this kind of exciting future for tomorrow. So, I've been up twice, and both times, the odds played out exactly right, where 50 percent didn't feel so well. But you know, we trained for those medical contingencies, got everyone feeling great and got on with the mission.",

So, I think Elon sets out some aggressive timelines always to motivate people. Do I think some uncrewed, you know, test missions could be flown to Mars in the next couple of years? Sure. But SpaceX can't solve all those problems. To your point, I mean, there's medical things, there's suits, there's psychological implications. We haven't done surgery in space. You know, you -- there are a lot of major problems. We don't even know what kind of really our space economy is that necessitates lots of people, you know, in space or on Mars other than it's probably the right thing to do for humankind.

But there are a lot of people that would look at what you said and say, you know, your right in many ways, there are so many things that we need to fix on Earth.

I mean, we absolutely have to take care of a lot of the real problems we have here on Earth.

Look, there are -- there would have been multiple extinction level events here on Earth had humans existed at a different time period. The dinosaurs aren't around anymore. I mean, we have the technical means, you know, to make life a multiplanetary civilization. It's kind of an obligation to do so. And the best part is it is being privately and commercially funded right now. I mean, during the space race of the '60s, that was four and a half percent of U.S. GDP was being funded by taxpayers.
