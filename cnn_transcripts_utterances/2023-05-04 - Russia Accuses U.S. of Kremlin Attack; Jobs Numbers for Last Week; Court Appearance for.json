An apparent reference to the alleged drone strike on the Kremlin itself. The place that took the hardest hammering, however, was Kherson. Now, this could be because the Russians think that this is a place the Ukrainians will launch a counter offensive from, 539 artillery rounds fired into that city by early this morning according to local officials.",

And in Odessa, there were drone attacks overnight. And one of them apparently had this message written on it that said for the Kremlin. Theoretically for the attack on the Kremlin there. Why do you think Russia is targeting these cities in this way right now? GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: I think it's an effort to put more pressure on the Ukrainians, but it's also good for Russian domestic morale. And when I look at the video of yesterday's alleged drone strike on the Kremlin, look at the past record of Kremlin activities, Putin's activities, you see this as mostly a domestic thing. Now, if he can get some international traction by blaming the United States, sure, that serves their purpose and distracts them. I think the Russians are quite concerned about the potential of the Ukrainian counteroffensive when it comes, but this is what they can do right now because they've been checkmated so to say - so to speak trying to break through in Bakhmut, in other places.

It's not uncommon for the boss, the U.S. attorney or the division head, whoever it might be, to sit in on a really high-profile or important witness interview, one, to supervise his folks, two, to help tie the information together. He's overseeing probably lots of people. And this is clearly a critical witness given his proximity to the person being investigated in the former president. It also might just be a sign to the witness of how seriously the office takes the interview. So, it's not abnormal, but it's a big deal when the boss, the big boss, sits in on an interview like that.",
