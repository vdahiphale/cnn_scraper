Just ahead, Buckingham Palace reveals that King Charles III has been diagnosed with cancer. What we know about the state of his health and what it means for the royal family moving forward.Plus, the IDF warns civilians to evacuate parts of southern Gaza but most of them now displaced by war have nowhere left to run. And one year on from the devastating earthquake in Turkey, the signs of destruction are still impossible to miss. We will revisit some of the areas hardest hit ahead in a live report. Good to have you with us. Buckingham Palace is facing new questions today about King Charles III and his cancer diagnosis. The 75-year-old monarch is undergoing treatment in London after the palace made the surprise announcement on Monday, but they did not say what type of cancer it is. King Charles was recently treated for an enlarged prostate, but a royal source says he does not have prostate cancer. In the meantime, doctors have advised him to postpone any public duties, but he will continue with state business and official paperwork. Wishes for a speedy recovery have been pouring in from around the globe and within London. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

What stage is this at? And it is interesting that the palace has given us information, they've given us a cancer diagnosis which is certainly more open I would say than we had with the late queen.For instance, we still don't actually know what the cause of her death was or what her ailments were in the latter years of her life. We have a diagnosis but there are lots of unanswered questions here and I'm not sure whether we'll ever actually get any answers on them. As far as we are aware, the King will be having outpatient treatment. We don't know what that treatment will be or for how long. And the guidance very much is they don't want the media camped outside of a hospital. They don't want us to be running commentary. The King will essentially be working from home. He won't be able to do public facing engagements, but he will be able to go through his red box. He'll be able to go through all those documents. He'll be able to hold private meetings as usual around of course all of those treatments. It's not dissimilar in many ways, Rosemary, to the news that we have of the Princess of Wales who of course recently underwent abdominal surgery. We don't know the ins and outs of why or what it regarded. We know she's recovering for some time. So again, more information that we've had in the past about a royal member's family -- member family's health, but actually not all of the information perhaps the public would want, but perhaps you can never give the public all of the information they might like.",

Regardless of who you are, anytime you have a cancer diagnosis, it really can be a terrifying thing. So, to focus on your question, you know, when you have a procedure, almost any procedure, a lot of other tests sometimes are done.It can be blood work, chest x-rays, CT scans. Any of those other tests sometimes can pick up what we call an incidental cancer. Oftentimes when you do a test, I mean actually a procedure to actually decrease the size of the prostate, what's done is a small tube is placed through the urethra where the prostate then is shaved a bit to make the passage of urine easier and the bladder is nearby.

You know, cancer mortality rates have fallen by about 34 percent over the last 30 years or so, so we know cancer early detection is important.We also know that for folks, even at the age of 75, screening makes sense if you have a life expectancy of 10 years or more. So, whether that's breast cancer screening, colonoscopy, prostate cancer discussions, or lung cancer if you're a smoker, screening can find a cancer early on where it can be treated, oftentimes with a cure. But if you have a symptom that is concerning to yourself, doesn't make sense, trust your body, talk to your physician, have that particular symptom evaluated, and in which case, if there is something of concern, it can be treated before you wait too long.",

      "sentences": "Rosemary, this whistle-stop tour by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has, I suppose, an overriding objective, and that is to try to push along the proximity or to get to a position where we could see an end to the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas. How do you do that? Well, there's two aspects to it. One is dealing with the present and one is dealing with the future.Dealing with the future the day after the war in Gaza I suppose would have been the focus of the conversations with the MBS as he's known the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia holding out the carrot if you like, of normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel as a means of incentivizing Israel to get to that position of ending the war in the Gaza Strip. Now, whereas before October the 7th and the Hamas terrorist attacks, Saudi Arabia seemed inclined to normalize relations with Israel without any concrete steps towards an independent Palestinian state, that now seems to be off the table. The Saudis seemingly saying that is now a prerequisite for Saudi normalization with Israel. So that would have been the focus there. There'll obviously be bilateral issues between Saudi Arabia and the United States to try to sweeten any kind of deal. In Egypt, Qatar and Israel today, the main focus will be on the present, how to get a humanitarian pause in place in the Gaza Strip, how to facilitate the release of the more than 100 hostages that were abducted in the Hamas-led massacre of October the 7th and have been in captivity now for more than 120 days in exchange for the freeing of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, and also how to get more humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. And whereas the Saudis don't really have any leverage with Hamas, the Egyptians and the Qataris do. So that will certainly be a focus of the conversation there. And also, of course, how to talk about the overall security arrangements that could be in place. And that would be enough to secure Israel's backing to withdraw from the Gaza Strip. For now, of course, we know that Israel has said, with Prime Minister Netanyahu emphasizing time and again, that Israel needs to maintain a security presence in the Gaza Strip. Also, worth noting that Netanyahu is dead set against an independent Palestinian state, as is Hamas, of course. How Secretary Blinken is going to square all of those circles is obviously unclear, but certainly he's making every effort to do so. And that's going to be the focus of those conversations now in Egypt, then Qatar, and then Israel and the West Bank later today. Rosemary?",

Really, since before the withdrawal, No One Left Behind and other groups have called for supporting our Afghan allies. That's passing domestic adjustment for Afghans that arrived during the evacuation. But it's also for extending the Special Immigrant Visa program and opening up additional pathways for our allies. Unfortunately, if it doesn't pass, you know, they really cannot waitmuch longer. They continue to be targeted by the Taliban. The SIV process continues to take far longer than it should. By statute, it's supposed to be nine months, but the most recently quarterly State Department report has the process taking 608 days. So, unfortunately, our allies will remain in limbo. They will remain targeted by the Taliban, and it's incredibly worrisome if Congress does not decide to stand with our Afghan allies.",

There are over 830,000 U.S. veterans that serve in Afghanistan. Many of them are suffering from moral injury because we've not stood with our Afghan allies, our brothers, and sisters in arms. This is a good way to address that.Secondly, if we don't stand with them, what message does it send to allies across the world, whether it be the Western Pacific, Eastern Europe, the Levant? I think it shows that America is not necessarily the most reliable partner. I think it would have negative downstream effects for future national security. And then lastly, quite frankly, it's just the right thing to do. I mean, America is a nation that keeps its promise. We have a moral obligation. So really, I think, you know, if we fail to keep the promise to them, all three of those things will suffer.",

Sea drones attacking, and the Ukrainians say sinking, a Russian warship inside occupied Crimea. And he was one of those involved. His call sign is 13 from the elite sea drone unit named Group 13. So secretive we had to hide his face and change his voice.\"We used 10 drones in the operation,\" he says. Six of them hit the Corvette Ivanovets. CNN cannot independently verify that the Ivanovets was sunk, but video provided by the intelligence agency seems to show the mini-sea drones evading machine gun fire from the warship and then massive explosions. \"Their weapons are not designed to deal with such small sea drones,\" 13 says. \"In most cases, they use anti-ship guns.\" Ukraine barely has a functioning navy. But the Magura drones pack a massive, around 500 pounds of explosives. These sea drones might not look like much and they might not go very fast, but the Ukrainians say they've been extremely effective at attacking Russia's Black Sea fleet and even sinking warships. \"The main thing is to feel the drone,\" 13 says. \"Not everyone can hold a firm grip. If you squeeze a little, you can lose control of the drone. I would say it's like working with jewelry.\" Asymmetrical warfare, they call it, and the Ukrainians, outmanned and outgunned, say they need to do a lot more of it. After visiting the southern front this weekend, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy telling Italian media he not only plans to fire his top general Valerii Zaluzhnyi, there could be a larger government shakeup. A front-runner to become the new commander-in-chief, the defense intel boss known for brazen attacks against Russian military and infrastructure targets. \"The Russians are waking up at night to explosions,\" he says. \"Explosions in the air, explosions directly at the facilities. They see the real picture of war. They see burning oil depots, destroyed buildings and factories and so on. This is all beneficial.\" And the Ukrainians vow to continue hunting Russian military vessels in this battle of David versus Goliath on the high seas. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, in southern Ukraine.
