Why some are calling thata private militia and what this could mean for Israelis and Palestinians? First up though, police say the school shooting in Nashville, Tennessee happened over the course of 14 minutes. Three adults and three children were killed. The shooter had assault style weapons. Protesters have taken to the streets of France for the 10th day of major protests there. Unions are calling on President Macron to put his pension reform on hold. Well, on the frontlines Ukraine's top land commander says Kyiv is aiming to deplete Russian forces in Bakhmut to get ready for an offensive. And the Saudi Crown Prince today shared a call with China's President reaffirming his commitment to mending ties with Iran. That conversation taken place just a day off the Saudis Oil Giant Aramco bought a significant stake in a Chinese Petrochemical Company. Welcome back to the second hour of \"Connect the World\" wherever you are watching you're more than welcome. After a dramatic day in Israel on Monday, Benjamin Netanyahu's plans to overhaul the judicial system have been postponed. Mr. Netanyahu struck a deal with his far right National Security Minister Ben-Gvir in order to push the vote down the road kick the can down the road after until after Passover in April. On an exchange, Ben-Gvir will oversee a new National Guard. Keep in mind this is a man that has been convicted for supporting terrorism and inciting anti-Arab racism. And it is yet to be seen whether the delay in this judicial reform will change anything in the plans to overhaul the judiciary? So tonight we ask how much power does this give Ben-Gvir. Well, my next guest was Israel's Deputy National Security Adviser and he now specializes in Israeli Security Strategy Chuck Freilich joins us now live. And I will put that question directly to you, sir. It's good to have you! How much power is this putting in the hands of the ultra-nationalists en-Gvir? CHUCK FREILICH, FORMER ISRAEL'S DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: First of all, let me just say Former Deputy National Security Adviser. I think first of all, we have to wait and see if this really happens. Israel in general and Mr. Netanyahu specifically are famous for coalition agreements that never actually materialized. And I think there will be great pressure on the Prime Minister both from within Israel and from the international community, not to really give Ben- Gvir very much power here. I imagine he will have to do something just to at least to make it look good, because he wants to keep the coalition together. I imagine he won't want to go too far on this. If he does, it would be very dangerous as you correctly noted, Mr. Ben-Gvir has been convicted of charges of terrorism and racism. And he's been indicted many other times.",

Look, we have to see what happens. It will take time; this is not something that's going to happen overnight, at least in any significant way. And what's happened in Israel in recent weeks, I would say both one of the worst moments in its history. This is certainly the worst domestic crisis we have ever faced something that shake the pillars of Israel's democracy. In many ways, it was also Israeli democracy's finest hour because we saw mass numbers of people turning out to protest, and they forced an end to this. And if Ben-Gvir is given the kind of powers that he certainly hopes he will be given, well, but people get - demonstrations aren't over. This is going to continue in any event. And if that happens, we will see the numbers coming out again. In the last few days there have been 500,000, 600,000 people turning out to put that in American terms, multiply that by 40.

Diana Buttu joins me now via Skype from Haifa, in Israel! Netanyahu's decision to delay this judicial overhaul has certainly restored some calm to the streets of Israel. Let's just start there. If he manages to keep this calm and keep his coalition secure, he will likely and already has made some serious concessions to his ultra nationalist partners. And is likely to make more which I think you will agree with me are likely to be to the detriment of the Palestinians. Can you just explain what your perspective is here and how concerned you are?",

Look, when Netanyahu formed a government withthis coalition with these individuals, he was forming a government with people who are fascists, who are people who have made it that their party platform is only about attacking Palestinians. If you look at the party platform of Ben-Gvir, the man you just mentioned, he talks very openly about building and expanding settlements. He's a man who has praised Baruch Goldstein, a man who massacred 29 Palestinians in the City of Hebron as they were praying. He also entered into a coalition with a man named Smotrich who has been at the forefront of calling for the ethnic cleansing of Palestinian towns, and who himself has indicated that Palestinians only remain as citizens of Israel, the 20 percent who are citizens by accident, because Ben-Gvir didn't finish off the job in 1948. So what Netanyahu has done is he has entered into a coalition, not just with right wing but with fascists and right wing is a mild term. And it's because he's entered into this coalition, that we see that Palestinians once again, are paying the price for Israel's electoral choices. So yes, there may be calm in the streets of Tel Aviv, when it comes to these protests, they may eventually die down. But for Palestinians, the reality remains the same, which is that we are living under an apartheid regime where people who are Jewish are afforded supreme rights and those who are Palestinian are not afforded rights at all.

This is a man who has not only beenindicted for incitement and for terrorism, but he's been convicted of it as well. He's made it no secret that he doesn't want to see Palestinians around. And just last night, even after Netanyahu indicated that he was going to back off from this judicial overhaul process, we saw that his supporters took to the streets and attacked Palestinians in Jerusalem. So this is obviously very troublesome and very worrisome, and I don't believe that we should be downplaying it or saying that somehow this won't come to pass, it will come to pass. And even if it doesn't come to pass, the mere fact that he has given such a green light to Ben-Gvir indicates that Netanyahu supports the actions of Ben-Gvir. He supports these statements, these actions that he's taken in the past and that he's going to take in the future. Again, this is a man who was praised a mass murderer and called him his hero.",

We've lived with these condemnations now for decades upon decades, but now is the time for actual action. This is why I and others have been saying that it's the time for Israel to be facing economic sanctions, to not be treated as though it's somehow a normal country, and to not have normalized relations with any country around the world. This is a government that is based on ethnic cleansing it is a country that's based on it.

And as a result, the only option really, potentially, for those who are bitterly opposed to this kind of reform is to continue to maintain pressure on the streets. But the problem there for the unions is two-fold. They don't want to see this kind of violence back and forth, destroying the French economy. This is the tourist season that's coming towards France is very bad, ultimately, for the reputation of the French economy. But also, the prolonged strikes that have been conducted in this country since middle of January this year mean that people are suffering people on strike and not earning any money. And indeed, on Wednesday, the garbage collectors who've been on strike, you're going to go back, they're suspending their strike here in Paris. Because they simply people, poor people, people's families already struggling due to austerity measures due to rising inflation and so on, they can't afford to stay on strike. So, there isn't the energy might go out of these protests and demonstrations. And then, of course, remember that, actually, the numbers on this demonstration, we don't know the official figures yet. But even the union's think that they're down on what they were like last Thursday, there is widespread anger against this policy. But isn't necessarily going to be able to galvanize a government into doing a massive U-turn, the more of this that happens it in all probability, the less likely indeed, that the Macron Administration will do a vote fast.

And this for Paris and for France, you know these images just don't do the place any favors whatsoever. Do they Sam?",

And it shows us the shift that's happening. You mentioned on a political level, we're seeing China brokering deals between Iran and Saudi Arabia. And this is unprecedented. But also on the economic side of it, we understand that Aramco has been given the mandate to make sure that all the MOU's that it signed with China throughout the years, and especially during President Xi's visit in Riyadh last year, materialize. And this is just a portion of it; I'm expecting more deals to be signed. And for Aramco, really and for Saudi Arabia, it's about locking in demand. They want to make sure that their oil ends up in the market with the largest demand. So investing in these refineries is really smart and increasingly expanding their footprint in Asia and in particular, China, they make sure that their oil has a market.",

Formula Equal aims to become thefirst F1 team with an even 50-50 split of men and women from the paddock to the pit lane to the driver's seat and my colleague Don Riddell spoke exclusively with the Head of Formula Equal about how they intend to pull this off, have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DON RIDDELL, CNN WORLD SPORT (voice over): Everyone wants to be first in Formula One, but one new team would prefer to be equal. A startup venture called Formula Equal has been quietly preparing an application to join the sport. And they say their goal is total gender equality from the cockpit to the paddock and the boardroom. In an exclusive interview with CNN, the team's CEO and Co-Founder Craig Pollock explained that it's been years in the making. CRAIG POLLOCK, FORMULA EQUAL CEO AND CO-FOUNDER: So, this has been going on for close on four years, building up of a brand-new Formula One team. But taking into our ambition to deliver and build opportunities and pathways for women to get to the very top level inside motorsports. The concept and the idea was, of course, to try and build a Formula One team 50 percent male, 50 percent female, which is extremely hard to do if you have an existing Formula One team, is a lot easier with a clean sheet of paper. RIDDELL (on camera): Would you expect to have a female driver in the cockpit for the first race?",

I can't put my hand on my heart and say yes, but we are keeping a very close eye on it. I just hope for the women that this is the case. But please make it very, very clear done. This is not just about women driving Formula One cars. This is about throughout the team. We want even up to the board level, if we can do that, we would like to have a gender equal Formula One team going forward. RIDDELL (voice over): Currently there are 10 teams in Formula One, but it's believed there could be room for two more and proposals for four potential teams are at various stages of development. Craig Pollock is one of the most experienced figures in the sport; he wants manage the board champion Jacques Villeneuve. He's been a principal for two teams, including the outfit that is now Mercedes and he's worked alongside former F1 Chief Bernie Eccleston. As he prepares to re-enter the sport, he's assembled a coalition of partners, including the United Nations, trying to figure out how to build and launch a team that would change the landscape of the sport. RIDDELL (on camera): Have you managed to keep it a secret all this time, I'm amazed that none of this leaked out until now.",
