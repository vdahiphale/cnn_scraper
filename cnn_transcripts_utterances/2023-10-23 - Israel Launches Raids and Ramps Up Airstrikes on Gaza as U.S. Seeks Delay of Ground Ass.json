They say they found a USB on one of the Hamas militants involved in the attacks. And on that USB, there was information from what had been in Al Qaeda 2003 operational manual, which included a page of instructions on how to assemble a cyanide chemical weapon and how to disperse it with crude drawings. That's what they're saying.They are, however, clear that there were no indications, at least we've received no indication from the Israeli government, that there were any plans to deploy such a weapon. It's just that it was on that USB. But we do know that there were battle plans found on operatives as well. We've seen those ourselves that go through each of the kibbutz which were attacked, street by street where every camera was, every generator was, an incredible amount of detailed information. And on those plans, we do know, talking to security at least one kibbutz, that they followed those to the T and went item by item by item. So, the significance of the chemical weapons cannot be -- you know, we can't miss that, but there is no indication as of yet that there was any plan to use any such weapon.",

We hear drones in the sky, but no sounds of impacts here in Northern Gaza. And one of the things that we're hearing as well is the reason that the government here is so, Prime Minister Netanyahu's government is so concerned about the humanitarian pauses. They think that that will be used by Hamas to gain an advantage, to alleviate some of the pressure that they're facing at the moment. And this pressure designed to help move along hostage releases. Talking to some of the troops who are close to the front here, they talk about being told to be ready for action and then action not coming and sort of stood up, stood down. But speaking to past veterans of wars here, they say, look, we've been through this here before. We can stay out and do this in the field as long as we like. But when you look at the troops arrayed in the frontlines close to Gaza, that's a force waiting to go. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTSON (voice over):  Bristling with battle-ready troops farmers' fields north of Gaza churn with the controlled fury of a nation readying for an incursion to strike Hamas, yet they are waiting with no explanation why. It feels like the early rush for battle readiness has passed. The troops are deployed standing by. The question is how long can they be kept out here.

For many Israelis, that's going to ultimately look like a sign of weakness. And the calculus will be, well, what will Hezbollah do knowing that, knowing that they are potentially about and have threatened to launch attacks against Israel on that scale if the IDF goes into Gaza.So, I think that all becomes part of the calculus, the calculus that Israelis themselves genuinely don't feel safe after those barbaric attacks by Hamas more than two weeks ago, all that's part of the calculus. Look, I think he can hold back for a while, but I think everyone is poised as an expectation. But I think it then becomes a question, what precisely is the incursion going to do? How big will it be? How many civilians will be in the way of that incursion? I think, you know, those are the points. But when it comes back to how long can they wait, one veteran of the 1967 war, the Arab-Israeli War, back then said, look, we were held out in the desert for a month. And what we did was we trained and we practiced. And he said, actually, that worked to our advantage.

That's according Palestinian doctors and officials on the ground there. Meanwhile, U.S. officials say more than 500 Palestinian Americans are believed trapped in Gaza, desperately waiting for a chance to leave, and that includes a Massachusetts couple and their one-year-old son. They say that they have tried to cross the border into Egypt four times, but they cannot get in.

And among all of these people, they're sharing an extremely limited supply of food and an even more limited supply of water.Abood told me that a couple days ago, they'd ran out of clean drinking water. They had to drink salt water for an entire day. And this is even now becoming more dire, because now they're running out of the salt water. So, they've asked everyone in the house not to take showers, limit the amount of times they're flushing toilets, not to cook anything that requires the use of water, just so they can try to stay hydrated of all things using salt water. On top of that, the airstrikes are continuing in Rafah. Abood told me this morning that all night, there were airstrikes and bombing in Rafah, which, by the way, that's presumably -- or not just this family, but every other American citizen family that wishes to come back to the United States by crossing into Egypt is currently located.

I've been asking the State Department my contacts at the White House. The family has been doing the same. Neither the embassies in Cairo or Jerusalem nor the State Department are providing any information for what went wrong and what, if any, plan there is for a departure option for anyone, or even a timeline to get out of Gaza and into Egypt.

So, no, there's no evidence that Hamas has been standing at the crossing blocking people from getting in there. The reason why I say it's wordplay is I asked the State Department. I'm in an email thread with contacts on the White House National Security Council and State Department, and they told me, they said, we're still working out a three-way agreement between Israel, Egypt, and they said the DFA, which I assume stands for the Department of Foreign Affairs, either under the Palestinian Authority or Hamas, and that they continue to be pressing all three parties for agreement. There just isn't an agreement right now about aid coming in and American citizens getting out. Perhaps what he's referring to is either Hamas is making demands or asking for certain things to happen or stop before they're going to sign whatever this global deal is that would permit American citizens to enter into Egypt.",
