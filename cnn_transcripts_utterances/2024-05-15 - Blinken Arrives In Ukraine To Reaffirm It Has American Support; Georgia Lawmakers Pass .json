But it does look like weeks till they really start feeling the benefit of that long delayed $61 billion held up by a dysfunctional Republican Congress.That is the reason why the Russians are seeing success that north of the second city in Ukraine, Kharkiv. This is essentially you might call it a third invasion, a completely new prong of attack back into areas that Russia was kicked out of in the end of 2022. They're moving fast, they clearly have better resources, better ammunition, and clearly to the Ukrainians failed to build defenses there but also don't have the artillery you'd normally rely upon to stop an invading force like this Russian movement here. They claim to have taken nine villages off the Ukrainians, and they're pushing towards an important one called Liberty where if they got into that, while they might be able to show the second largest city Kharkiv intensely taking the people there, back to the dark days of 2022, their daily life was interrupted by often random Russian shelling. So, it is a definitely a stark moment here where despite the very positive noises from Secretary Blinken in Kyiv. Playing guitar they're almost sounding like you hadn't necessarily felt the severity of exactly what's happening north of Kharkiv, it's really a reflection on the ground of quite how slow that aid has been. We've seen morale deteriorate here over the past five or six months because that money was held up. Well, now we're seeing the Russians move over land because of that delay. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That's all it took to send GameStop shares through the roof. But GameStop is not alone. These failing companies are also seeing huge gains, but mostly temporary not because of their financial fundamentals, but rather because a reawakening of the so-called meme stock craze, where investors rally around a company and generate online buzz with the intention of sticking it to the short sellers and hedge fund managers who bet against the stock. In some ways, it mirrors what's happening with Trump Media. Supporters of the former U.S. president have pumped up the share price, even though the company itself has been hemorrhaging money and is a bad buy.
