His argument already rejected by a lower court but it hinges on the defense that his actions constitute official acts he took while in office. Trump articulating this in a video posted to social media last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Of course, I was entitled as President of the United States and commander in chief to immunity. I'm entitled to immunity. I wasn't campaigning. I was looking for voter fraud -- something that I have to do. Under my mandate, I have to look for voter fraud. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, let's bring in CNN legal analyst and criminal defense attorney Joey Jackson. Good to see you, Joey, Thanks for being up with us. So, for starters, what arguments do you expect to hear today from both the Trump team and Jack Smith? JOEY JACKSON, CNN LEGAL ANALYST, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah, Omar, good morning to you. So I think it will be an uphill battle, for sure, for Trump, but I think the arguments will be as follows. You heard some of them there -- first, starting with President Trump. As the President of the United States, I not only have the right but I have the absolute obligation with respect to looking at the election, determining whether there was any fraud, and taking specific steps in order to prevent that. That is my solemn duty as president. Furthermore, I'm protected by the First Amendment with respect to what I have to say and what I have to do. And by the way, I was impeached and that should serve as a basis for holding me accountable; not the criminal courts. On the flip side of that, Omar, you're going to hear Jack Smith's people say sir, you were acting as a failed candidate. And with respect to you acting as a failed candidate, that deserves no presidential protection whatsoever. Furthermore, in terms of the Senate and their acquittal of you and your conviction, that does not stop the judicial or criminal process. That begins it. You have no right after you're out of office to be indicted or otherwise prosecuted, and that's what we're doing. Furthermore, as it relates to the First Amendment, you have no freedom of First Amendment when you're talking about inciting riots or anything else. And so, sir, to the extent that you're engaged in criminal activities or other activities using speech, that's not protected at all. And as a result of that you deserve and should be prosecuted. You are not above the law. Those will be the arguments that are laid out, Omar.",

That said, we're just six days away from the Iowa caucuses.So, I mean, obviously, things that play out in court can matter in the outside world as far as perception goes, but why does he show up today?",

And then the optical perspective of even though he's in court, right -- on the steps of the courthouse -- there will be every camera imaginable, Omar, so he can wax poetic there talking about the fact that we just saw in the clip to begin the segment. I'm president and I had to do this.As to why he shows up it's a lot like why he showed up in New York multiple times relating to his business activities. This is huge to the extent that a court may consider immunity and that he would not be prosecuted. That would take this case -- the federal election subversion case before Judge Chutkan in D.C. that was supposed to start in March -- it will not -- off the table. I think it will additionally take the Georgia case, supposedly starting in August, off the table as well. So to the extent that the implications are so severe -- I mean, he's got to be there. He doesn't have to be there but certainly, it's in interest. And then, of course, he knows that the world is watching and, by the way, it's a great platform to speak to his followers.",

There's guidance from the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel, as it relates to impeachment, saying that -- and this is from 1973 -- that you know what? You can be impeached. You can also be prosecuted. It doesn't end as it relates to that. And so, I think that that's going to be -- it's an important argument but I think it's a failed argument.As far as any jurisdictional points -- look, the bottom line is that the Justice Department has a duty and a responsibility to prosecute crimes. Innocent until proven guilty, no question about it. But the reality is that should you have an opportunity to prove a former president guilty or should they have this absolute immunity -- you know what? Nothing to see here. I was the president. I was acting in my presidential capacity. You can't touch me. I think that that's a broad, sweeping argument. And final point, Omar, very quickly, and that is that look, I know it's 6-3 conservative justices versus liberal on the Supreme Court. I think that this has implications for decades in terms of their decision. Not at the Supreme Court yet. It's going there. You and I both know that. And so, I think justices in looking at it. And this particular decision, just by the way, in D.C. -- it's -- three people are hearing the case and two of them are Democratic. But ultimately, when it gets to the Supreme Court -- is my point -- is because it has so much implications I just would not say oh, it's just going to be viewed on political lines -- no way. This has got to be done by the law, by the book -- and so I believe it will be.",

Lloyd Austin's sudden hospitalization on New Year's Day. The problem is President Biden and others didn't know until days later that Austin was even in the hospital. The White House says the president has no plans to fire Austin but there will be a review of the process and procedure. CNN's Alex Marquardt has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  It has been a week since the country's most senior defense official has been in the hospital. For much of that time, very few people -- even his boss, the president -- were aware. The Pentagon now says that Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin was rushed to Walter Reed Hospital last Monday, on New Year's Day, due to severe pain after elective surgery right before Christmas. The Pentagon revealed that even for the initial procedure in December, Austin and his team didn't tell the White House or Austin's deputy. Now, shock and anger from both parties are now spreading across Washington for Austin's failure to reveal, for days, to people who should have been told that he was still in the hospital. REP. ABIGAIL SPANBERGER (D-VA):  I do hope that every person in the cabinet recognizes that this was not an appropriate step. Not an appropriate way to handle what was his hospitalization. MARQUARDT (voice-over):  \"That is unacceptable,\" said Roger Wicker, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee. \"We are learning more every hour about the Defense Department's shocking defiance of the law.\" Also in the dark were the most senior members of the Biden administration. ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  I wasn't aware of his medical issue. MARQUARDT (voice-over):  Biden says he still has complete confidence in Austin and isn't asking him to resign. But the White House said today that the way Austin notified them needs to be reviewed.",

His deputy, Kathleen Hicks, was only told the next day that she would have to assume some responsibilities but not why. It wasn't until Thursday, January 4, that Hicks; Jake Sullivan, the National Security adviser; and ultimately, Biden were told where Austin actually was. The next day, on the fifth, the Pentagon told congressional leaders and put out a public statement. Then finally, on Saturday, five days after being admitted, Sec. Austin said in a statement, quote, \"I recognize I could have done a better job ensuring the public was appropriately informed. I commit to doing better.\" While Austin was in the hospital, Hicks was on vacation in Puerto Rico where she periodically assumed Austin's duties. This, during a very busy week that saw Israel carry out a strike against a Hamas leader in Beirut, the U.S. bombed a militia commander in Baghdad, and U.S. forces continue to actively face attacks by Iranian-backed groups, including the Houthis in Yemen.",

But officials say there has been no indication that Austin's hospitalization put national security at risk or hindered operations overseas. Nonetheless, very serious. So let's bring in Shawn Turner, former director of communication for the U.S. National Intelligence. Great to see you.So I just want to start off with what is the normal protocol for the White House to be informed of a senior administration official's absence. And where do you suspect communication might have broken down here in Austin's case? SHAWN TURNER, FORMER DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATION FOR U.S. NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah, good morning, Omar, and thanks for having me. You know, the normal protocol here is something that's very different from what I think Sec. Austin said. You know, Sec. Austin has said that he believes that he could have done a better job informing the public. But, you know, Omar, I really don't think that's the issue here. The protocol for a cabinet official -- one of the most important cabinet officials -- is to make sure that not only the people at the Pentagon or at the agency that official is over are aware -- senior -- certainly, senior leadership are aware -- but also to make sure that people at the White House are aware. Look, Omar, when I was in government I remember days when my boss, the director of national intelligence, would be summoned to the White House. And what you don't want to do and part of the reason this is so problematic is you don't want to be in a -- in a situation where you've got to say to the White House my boss is in the hospital and oh, by the way, I know you didn't know that but that's the case.

Also, there may be developments where the president and other senior leaders need counsel. They need immediate feedback and recommendations. And so, that's part of the reason this is such a concern. When we look at what's happening around the world -- around the world, we've got several major conflicts going on. And so, it's extremely important that the White House -- it's extremely important that officials at the Pentagon know who is in charge at what time and have a good sense of who to reach out to when things are not going as we expect them to go.",
