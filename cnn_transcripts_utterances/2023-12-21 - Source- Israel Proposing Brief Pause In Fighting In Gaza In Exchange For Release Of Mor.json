On average around 266 people a day are being killed.The numbers from Gaza do not separate civilians from fighters. Even so \"The New York Times\" reported last month Gaza civilians under Israeli barrage are being killed at historic pace. There is also close to 2 million displaced people, with very little food or water, no electricity, no sanitation and a whole lot more. And it seems none of that is being reflected by what looks to be a total lack of urgency at the U.N., and question is why?",

Almost everyone, even if there was to be a ceasefire tomorrow, do you know how long it's going take to rebuild all these homes that have been destroyed?70 percent of the housing stock in Gaza has been destroyed or damaged. And now we are approaching winter, it's getting colder and colder here. That means that these people have no hope of going back home. I mean we want to see an end to that. Where is that end? No one knows. And I know that -- (INAUDIBLE) can come in from diplomatic corridors, from the U.N., from Arab countries, Arab states as well. However, I think what is so disappointing for us and this is the first time it happens now in Gaza that we're not able to provide aid even in conflict times, when we used to do that all the time. And now 50, you know, 50 of my colleagues themselves have been displaced. They hardly -- you know, their children hardly eat, their children are now in tents. There is no hope of going back home anytime soon for these people. I mean it's going to take months to just clear the rubble from all the destruction. We haven't even started talking about diseases, that are invisible because everyone is busy with, you know, paramedics and medical teams are busy saving lives. This is, again if we want to see that ceasefire. And even with that cease-fire, we are looking at years of catastrophe for the people of Gaza. Life is probably not going to be the same for the elderly again, for the disabled, people with disabilities and even for babies, for children who lost their parents.

Trying to push that back as long as possible.You know, we do of evidence in polling, and in think even this case has the potential to have the impact, where the indictments obviously have not been a huge problem for Trump, even in the general electorate, certainly not in the Republican primary electorate. But there is reason in polling for him to worry that actual convictions by a jury of his peers, or courts of law on the serious charges he's facing would have more of an impact on the willingness of voters to put someone who has been convicted of a serious felony back in the White House.
