Supreme Court strikes the highest U.S. court removing a Trump-era ban on rapid fire bump stocks used in the deadliest mass shooting in American history. A.I. pontificating. Pope Francis calls for action against artificial intelligence at the G7 Summit in Italy. And Germany's glee, Scotland's sorrow. Germany winning 5-1 in the Euro 2024 tournament in Munich. All that and plenty more coming up. But first, a royal relief. Catherine, the Princess of Wales, announcing she's well enough to attend King Charles's birthday festivities this weekend. Kensington Palace also releasing this new photograph taken earlier this week with her surrounded by greenery in Windsor. It will be Catherine's first public appearance since she announced her cancer diagnosis earlier this year. The princess saying in a statement released just hours ago that she is making \"good progress.\" Max Foster joins us now on this. Max, good to have you with us.

But again, she's taking each day as it comes. So, if she feels like she's having a bad day or the doctors say you can't do it, then she may not appear. And that's really going to be the way forward for the next few months. We've been told that she's receiving chemotherapy. It continues and it will continue the treatment for several months more. But it was a really personal message. She talked a lot about the children. It was quite heartfelt. And I think this is her really saying, you know, I'm being really honest with you. I want my privacy. I understand I'm also a public figure. I need to appear in public. I'm going to take it each step at a time. But don't expect to see a lot of me. But I'll come out when I can.

Now, Pope Francis made history on Friday, becoming the first ever pontiff to attend as well as address a G7 Summit meeting. The pope joined G7 leaders and officials from other nations on day two of their three-day summit with migration too, a main topic of conversation as well, of course, as the wars in both Ukraine and Gaza. The pontiff, who also knows a thing or two about higher intelligence, also making an important remarks on artificial intelligence, urging leaders to protect citizens from the destabilizing, as well as the positive effects, of course, of the new technology. MJ Lee joins us now from Bari in Italy. MJ, a unique G7 experience to have the pope there.

Let's head to China now and talk about the impact of extreme weather, severe drought, and record temperatures that are scorching the north while heavy rains batter the south. It's raising concerns too about food security in the world's second largest economy. Kristie Lu Stout has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Rushing floodwaters in southern China. Drought and extreme heat to the north. It is no wonder some people feel their fate is in the hands of the gods. These villagers in Shandong Province are praying for rain. Their farmlands are part of a precious food bowl for China, helping to feed millions across this vast country. But the hot, dry weather has left little water for crops. It's so hot and dry across parts of China's north, east, and central areas, the government has issued an emergency alert across seven provinces. This farmer in Shanxi says authorities have supplied him with medication for heat stroke as he presses on with his work. I need to drink 15 to 16 bottles of water a day, he says. Spring in China was the hottest on record. That has now given way to a scorching summer. In the capital Beijing, the temperature is predicted to reach 39 degrees Celsius, 102 Fahrenheit by Monday and Tuesday, that's almost 10 degrees Celsius over the average temperature for this time of year. And while drought grips many parts of China, torrential rain lashes the south. In Fujian Province, the wet weather has caused landslides. The landslides have been powerful, this local official says. With heights exceeding 20 meters, we closed the road on June 11th. The rain appears related to the seasonal monsoon pattern, but climate change is making extreme weather events more frequent and intense, and bringing different but equally dangerous challenges to people across the same country.

We still have a lot of moisture coming in from the south and southwest, and that will keep some of these heavy downpours in the picture. Some lightning and gusty winds possible as well. For rain accumulation, additional rain this region here. We're looking at 150 to 250 millimeters possible on top of what we've already gotten. So, again, that heavy rain threat will continue through the next couple of days in parts of India. In the U.S., we're watching this dome of heat that was out west for so many days. And now, that's starting to move back into the Central Plains, eventually getting into the Midwest and the Northeast. As these above average temperatures start to slide east, we're looking at places like Chicago really starting to feel the heat by the weekend. I mean, look at these temperatures in Chicago, getting up to 97 degrees Fahrenheit by Monday. Temperatures, middle and upper 90s in St. Louis through the weekend. Same thing in Little Rock, approaching some triple digit temperatures this weekend. And then, as we go into the work week, the extreme heat risk, again, starts to spread into some big cities in the Great Lakes like Chicago by Tuesday, by Wednesday, starting to spread into parts of Ohio and New York. That extreme heat risk means that we need to watch out for symptoms of heat sickness because these temperatures are just unbearable, especially on the overnight lows. Look at the temperatures for Chicago. Your average daytime high is 80 degrees, and we're looking at these temperatures getting up towards 100 by Sunday and Monday and Tuesday. Overnight lows, though, will be nearing 80 degrees, which is closer to those daytime highs. So, again, not really getting relief at night, which is where that heat sickness problem becomes especially important to pay attention to because we just not finding those temperatures cool off at all.

These are semi-automatic firearms. With the use of these devices, you can fire off hundreds of rounds per minute. And they say that this essentially turns them into machine guns, automatic weapons. Now, what you heard from the conservative majority of the Supreme Court, the 6-3 majority, and it was led by Justice Clarence Thomas, it was a very technical ruling. They were focusing on the fact that they said the way the mechanics of these devices work, it's not exactly an automatic weapon. It's not a machine gun. And they're right in the technical sense. But for the people who suffered during that massacre, obviously in Las Vegas in 2017, there is not much of a difference. If you see the videos of these things going off, you can see how much faster and how many more rounds are fired because you use these devices. And so, that's why you saw from Justice Sotomayor, you saw a reaction. She said that this ruling will have deadly consequences as a result. And you can see also that part of the reason for this is that, you know, in 2017 when President Trump signed this, it was a way to avoid having Republicans, the Republican Congress having to vote on this. It was a rule that was passed by a federal agency and not by the members of Congress. And that's what the Supreme Court essentially was ruling on today, saying that if you want to do this, essentially, you have to go to Congress and pass new laws, which, Julia, you and I know is not going to happen in the United States anytime soon.",

My question refers now to -- I think, it's 17 states that in light of that federal ban that we saw put in place on these bump stocks, 17 states said, OK, we are going to do the same.

But, Julia, you can tell what's going to happen next is that in those states there's going to be gun groups, conservative groups are going to challenge that and it won't be very long before we're back to the Supreme Court challenging the validity of those because, you know, the Second Amendment has certain restrictions that are allowed and the conservative majority does not view very many -- of the many of these things as passing muster.

And then, they were banded when the Soviet Union collapsed, and the economy really has never recovered since then. So, on one side, you have a lot of nostalgia amongst Cubans of a certain age that remember the relative prosperity of life under the Soviet Union. But then you have much younger Cubans, relatives in the United States in South Florida that receive remittances that follow U.S baseball, music, and culture, and they really look at their future as being there. And, of course, a historic migration out of more than 500,000 Cubans that have left over the last several years to go live in the U.S. So, while some people look back with a lot of longing to what life was like under the Soviet Union, I think most people here realize the Russians are not going to come back. They're not going to flip the bill. Billions of dollars are not going to come flowing in because Russia simply can't afford that anymore. And so, whatever this is behind me, it really is not the future. But if you're a Cuban government official, you're mostly interested in keeping the lights on and Russian oil is helping to do that. And so, they're certainly not turning down any gestures of goodwill right now. They don't have enough of those.",
