It was conducted by about 100 Special Forces who were on the ground in Sudan for less than an hour to carry out this operation, getting those U.S. government personnel onto a Department of Defense aircraft and out of the country. Now, of course, the Secretary of State ordered this departure of these U.S. diplomats, along with President Biden himself. And the Secretary of State said that the conditions on the ground simply posed an unacceptable risk to those U.S. government personnel at the time. And now, as we look to see what happens to the State Department's embassy there, in Khartoum, the Secretary of State said operations have been temporarily suspended, and there are a few local staff who worked at the embassy there. Those are Sudanese folks who worked with U.S. government personnel to -- and they can watch over the embassy in sort of caretaker status.

One of the main reasons for that is that the main embassy -- main airport in the country is closed down right now. But what the State Department has said is that they encourage those Americans to be in touch with the State Department if they want to leave the country because they could potentially help in clearing out some of those overland pathways out of the country, helping them identify some that are safer than others. So, of course, U.S. citizens are encouraged to reach out to the State Department, but right now, they're telling them that they're not going to have any flights for them to get on.",

And that effort in itself was quite an undertaking. The roads, of course, very unsafe in the Sudanese capital at this moment. But as soon as those diplomats were out of the country, the President did release a statement announcing this effort. He said he is grateful for the unmatched skill of our service members who successfully brought these diplomats to safety. And I think Djibouti, Ethiopia and Saudi Arabia, which were critical to the success of our operation. The President went on to say, \"We are temporarily suspending operations at the U.S. Embassy in Sudan, but our commitment to the Sudanese people and the future they want for themselves is unending.\" Now, the President also said that he would continue to receive reports on these efforts to potentially help other private American citizens leave the country. There won't be a broad scale military evacuation of those citizens, but he will be kept updated on the efforts that could be used to help them get out. Of course, looming over all of this is that chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. The President, his aides, the White House, are really hoping to avoid a repeat of some of the chaotic scenes that you saw there. In fact, they said one of the lessons that they learned from that experience was to start beginning these evacuations sooner. And if you saw some of these preparation efforts underway, really sort of taking those lessons to heart.

Thank you very much.Joining me now is Aaron David Miller, he is a longtime State Department Middle East Negotiator and a Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Aaron, good to see you this morning. You know, let's take a step back about how this all started, right, because you have two warring generals right now who were once allies after, you know, having the successful coup two years ago. Well, they no longer want a power sharing agreement. They both want to run the country. And there are also foreign actors that want to influence what happens there on the ground. How messy could this get, Aaron? AARON DAVID MILLER, FORMER STATE DEPT. MIDDLE EAST NEGOTIATOR: Well, I think it's already proved to be extraordinary messy. Extraordinarily messy. I mean, Khartoum has never seen this sort of unprecedented fighting between military factions. The humanitarian implications are dire, clearly, and not just for Americans, but clearly for millions of Sudanese. This is easily going to spread. One of the generals, Hemedti, has a base in southern Sudan. So I think this is not going to be resolved anytime soon. And as you pointed out, you have external players, each of which want a piece of Sudan. It's rich in chromite, in zinc and gold. It's strategically located. It straddles the Nile, which involves Ethiopia and Egypt. It's bordering neighboring Chad and other African states, which have histories of instabilities. The Russians are involved. We know Wagner is involved. It may actually be a setback for them because you're going to have increasing instability there, and they're not entirely sure which faction to back. So this is -- I'm afraid. Hopefully, not an example of a failed state, but the third largest mass wise country in Africa is about to enter a period of prolonged instability. When, in fact, as recently as the last year or so, there were some hopes of a democratic transition. I think that's now clearly not in the cards.",

There may be some routes and ways to get out, but basically, you're kind of on your own at this point.

The administration has been clear, previous administrations as well, that American citizens, private American citizens in places of instability or danger should not expect mass evacuation.I know the pictures don't look great. You evacuate American personnel, leaving some 16,000, mostly dual nationals, behind. I think you've described it well. I think there will be efforts. The State Department, I'm sure, will open up a -- it's running its task force in Washington, but it'll open up at another post, probably proximate to Sudan to try to do whatever they can to assist on the humanitarian side and to provide information and contact. There was a Pentagon official who was quoting New York Times this morning as saying that they would monitor the situation in an effort to provide intelligence information if people wanted to run convoys to Port Sudan, which is 500 miles away, and provide assistance once they got there. But what the United States has been able to do in this situation to help alleviate the suffering and the evacuation of thousands of American passport holders, dual nationals, I think, frankly, is very little. Without some additional stability and extended ceasefire when situation returns to something that you and I would describe as normal, I think, tragically, most of these Americans are going to have to think of themselves.",

I see very little way to accommodate an internal reconciliation. I mean, this agreement foundered among many other issues on whether or not this rapid support forces, the RSF, would be incorporated into the Sudanese military.And it's very difficult to imagine that the leader of the RSF, Hemedti, would be willing literally to give up power. Fundamentally mistrustful of General Burhan. So I don't think you're going to see any sort of extended period of quiet, let alone a democratic transition, which means that you're going to end up with military conflict. And I suspect the African Union, the U.N., no one is going to want to put their forces in the middle of this what -- frankly, looking more and more like a full blown civil war. So I think you're going to end up with a number of mediators, self-interested parties, including the Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Lebanon, Libya faction backing the RSF, all of whom may say they're interested in a period of stability, but will continue to pursue their own interests. Again, I think the situation, frankly, in Sudan is going to get worse before it gets worse.",

But that position, not popular around the country.

The strikes stretched from Kharkiv to the southern port of Odessa. At least one person was injured in Zaporizhzhia which was hit by 70 artillery strikes. In Kharkiv, missiles destroyed several homes.

Now, there's only one, basically, land road into the city. And as a result of heavy rains in Eastern Ukraine in recent days, there had -- the access to the city itself is increasingly difficult. Now, we did have one interesting development, not in the Bakhmut area, but down in the Kherson region. In the south, where, according to the Institute for the Study of War, Ukrainian forces have established positions on the east bank of the Dnipro River near Kherson. Now, there is some speculation and there's a lot of speculation these days about the Ukrainian offensive that this is perhaps part of it. Perhaps a diversionary move to draw Russia troops away from other areas. But certainly, their ability, the Ukrainian army's ability to cross the Dnipro River which down there is quite wide and actually established positions on the eastern bank is a significant development.

And I think -- so, the focus is going to be on how did he get his security clearance in the first place? Was he reviewed between February and October, the period in which he's clearly doing this? And then the larger question is when someone has classified information or top-secret security clearance, what are the standards of need to know?One of the things that's interesting in the story, and remember, this is \"New York Times\" reporters finding it. The United States has not has not verified this, but \"The New York Times\" has been way ahead on this story, is that it appears that he was posting this -- some of this information, early information from the military base itself, outside of the skiff of the secure room. And that he was -- as described, he was essentially, sort of, posting or searching for information that was more interesting that then he could post. So, he's sort of looking around, that takes a lot of time. And there should be mechanisms in place, and for some reason they didn't work, that would tell people, wait.

He's just a young kid who's like saying, look at what I have access to.If you look at the information he's disclosed, February 2022, he -- it is real time information. It is information that's foretelling what could happen. But more -- most importantly, as you said, he's DMing people to say, look what I got. Well, that raises questions about what in fact is his motive. He talks about foreign intelligence as well. There's no evidence that he's an asset of a foreign country. Maybe he did just want to show off these platforms, at least the one that -- the smaller one that he was on later on in the year also has, sort of -- not sort of, racist and anti-semitic remarks. So, there's a bigger question about motive from the beginning I never bought the notion that this is just a guy who wants to show off. He is doing things that are consistent with ideological agendas.

TERRY TOZER, FORMER AIRLINE PILOT AND AUTHOR, \"CONFESSIONS OF AN AIRLINE PILOT - WHY PLANES CRASH\": Well, this is rather a perennial problem actually ever since I've been in the industry. Employment has been a roller coaster. Part of that is due to the fact that pilots take a long while to train.
