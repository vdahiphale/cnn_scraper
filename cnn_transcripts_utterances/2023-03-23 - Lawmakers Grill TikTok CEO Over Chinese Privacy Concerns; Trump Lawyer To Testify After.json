They are going to be overseen by the company Oracle, which has its headquarters in Austin. And so, his argument was that that will create a firewall between any U.S. data and TikTok's parent company, the Chinese company ByteDance.Now, he explained that this process -- this project that they're conducting, it is referred to as Project Texas.

HARRY LITMAN, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: Well, for starters, let's see all these documents. But then he now has to testify, Boris, about the very conversations he had with Trump at the time when they were preparing and sending a declaration that was false to -- in response to a subpoena. They said, we're done on a full search and we haven't found anything. That's a really serious transgression, a clean violation as far as prosecutors are concerned. And he is, by the ruling of the court of appeals, required to just give it all up chapter and verse that was -- the same as if it would be for any other witness. We'll see if he possibly tries to invoke the Fifth Amendment. But short of that, he's got to give everything and give it in the context here because it's really crystal in violation of -- and obstruction in making a false declaration to a subpoena.

This is a really serious issue and it's something that's being taken very seriously by the Federal Aviation Administration held this safety summit last week. And after that, it's really laid out this two-pronged plan not only for pilots, reminding them to be extra vigilant about the procedures that take place on an airport to try and avoid these runway close calls, but also to air traffic controllers.This five-point plan that the FAA says will include stepping up oversight by supervisors and air traffic control towers, also trying to get more air traffic controllers through the training pipeline. That's a huge issue because air traffic controllers, their top union says staffing is a really big problem. The FAA just released these numbers saying staffing is only at 54 percent at one of the main air traffic control facilities in New York that governs the three major airports there, only at 90 percent nationwide.

And that was so critical because this pilot onboard this Southwest flight, there are two pilots up in the flight deck, apparently had some sort of medical issue. That's still a mystery right now. And this other pilot who was in the passenger cabin flying for a completely different airline minute, came into the flight deck called upon -- to work the radios to help this flight divert safely back to Las Vegas was in the air only about 27 minutes before it started to turn around.Southwest Airlines thanking this off-duty pilot for coming in and helping out. Really pretty amazing though here it happens very, very rarely. And something that happened very very safely. This flight safely landed back in Las Vegas pretty well, all is well that ends well and it's really a case of the right place, right time.",
