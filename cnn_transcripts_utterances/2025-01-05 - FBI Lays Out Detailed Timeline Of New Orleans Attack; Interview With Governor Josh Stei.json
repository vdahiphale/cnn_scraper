That shocking detail revealed during a wide-ranging press conference with federal and local authorities earlier today. CNN's Rafael Romo is in New Orleans for us.

And one crucial question that surfaced days after the attack was how long in advance did the attacker plan the attack? Did he know with a long time prior to the attack that he was going to do what he did? And it seems like the answer now is yes, that it was not only weeks, but perhaps years that he was thinking about attacking the United States in some sort of fashion.And that's because at a press conference earlier here in New Orleans, the FBI told us that Shamsud-Din Jabbar traveled internationally to two different countries. One was Cairo, Egypt, in the summer of 2023. And then a few days later to Ontario, Canada. Earlier, I asked Special Agent-in-charge Lyonel Northrop here in New Orleans whether he believed that Jabbar was financed, whether he met with people, some entity that might have helped him in the attack, and this is what he had to say. Let's take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

More than 100 lives lost, $60 billion in damages. It's just an insane amount of money. Thousands, tens of thousands of homes damaged or destroyed, private roads and bridges, some 8,000 small businesses lost out on billions of dollars of revenue. Vital infrastructure, roads, water and sewer, wastewater, damaged or destroyed.

We don't want folks in temporary structures that are unsafe, not warm, not adequate, and we want to help people be on site because then they can be overseeing the work.You have to get to your property. One thing that people don't appreciate about Western North Carolina is the necessity of private bridges. The road is on one side of the river. People live on both sides of the river. There are thousands and thousands and thousands of these little bridges that cross the river. 8,000 were damaged or destroyed. Folks cannot get -- even if their house is intact, they can't get to their property. We need to help them reconnect to their property.

I mean, $60 billion is massive. It can only be addressed in a meaningful way when the federal government steps up. And the Congress did pass a continuing resolution, including disaster relief, just before the end of the year. We estimate about $15 billion of that will come to North Carolina.It's a good start, but its wholly inadequate. We're going to come back to the Congress in the next couple of months and seek probably another $15 billion or $20 billion to help the people of Western North Carolina, particularly we need help with small business relief. So many -- so much of North Carolina's western economy is tourism based. October is the number one month. December is the number two month. Both of those months were essentially lost in last year's economy for them. We need to make sure that they can get through this winter so that they can open their doors in the spring and summer and make more money. And there are a lot of businesses that are open for business today. I mean, if you like skiing and you're on the East Coast, go to Boone, North Carolina and ski.

We've had hamster sized snowflakes reported in the metro area and along Interstate-70 in that corridor, we're projected to get anywhere from three to nine inches of snow and even more to the north. Driving has been very difficult. The Missouri Department of Transportation reporting that most roads are snow-covered, except for the most southern portions of our state. We've seen some clearing down there as well, where they mostly got some of that rain. The Missouri State Highway Patrol says that from the Bootheel all the way to Kansas City, we've had 865 calls for service, 330 stranded drivers, and 220 crashes. We've seen quite a few power outages, about 300 power outages across the state right now, which is down significantly from this morning.

Which, of course, is now controlled by the Taliban.And while the Taliban have been occasionally fighting ISIS-K, they've certainly -- the Taliban have been, according to the U.N., there are 20 terrorist organizations that are based there now. So, whether the Taliban has the capacity or the inclination to go after these terrorist groups is an open question. So, I think one factor is the fact that the Taliban are now back in power in Afghanistan. And now, you have a formerly-affiliated with Al Qaeda terrorist group that now controls Syria. And there's some debate about how they change their spots or not. But the fact is, some ISIS prisoners were let go when the Assad regime was toppled. And, secondarily, there are a bunch of camps of -- and prisons that are containing ISIS prisoners in Northeastern Syria, which people are concerned, you know, may come under attack and there may be more prisoner releases. So, some of this is to do with circumstances in the Middle East, and some of this is to do with the fact we still don't know the precise motivations of the New Orleans' attacker. He, obviously, had a very troubled personal history, and he may have been shopping around for an ideology that allowed him to do what he did. But ISIS remains, you know, a revolutionary ideology that losers, like the New Orleans' attacker or others, and we've seen that in the United States before, can attach themselves to.
