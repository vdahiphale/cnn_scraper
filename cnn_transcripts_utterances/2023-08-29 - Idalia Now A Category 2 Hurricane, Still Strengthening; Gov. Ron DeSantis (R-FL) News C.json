      "sentences": "100-mile-per-hour storm now. A hurricane hunter has been flying through the storm, found a much lower pressure. That lower pressure has significantly now increased the wind speed around the storm itself. 100 miles per hour, but gusts could be 120, and then the landfall about 20 miles farther west than it was forecast to be. The cone shifted about 20 miles farther to the west, closer to Tallahassee, making significantly more wind damage there as you shift that cone farther and farther to the left.But something else I've noticed there, Alex, we are seeing lightning now around the eye. That means that the storms are getting stronger, they're getting bigger around the eye itself, which means the storm is not losing strength. In fact, it's going the other way. When you see lightning in the eye, it's getting stronger. So, wind gusts around 30, Sarasota. Every time you see one of these cells, though, head over your home, that's when the wind is going to pick up. And then the cell goes by, the wind is going to be completely gone. There is not going to be anything left for. What the deal is with this whole storm is that, as it moves up into this Big Bend area, that's where the catcher's mitt effect is going to happen and we're going to see all that water get caught with the storm surge that. And that surge is going to be 15 feet high. And if you're on land and right there along the coast, that's where it's going to be the worst. So, yes, this is the area here that we're going to see right there, those 10 to 15foot surges, maybe 7 to 10, and even for Tampa, about 4 to 7 feet, because by tomorrow afternoon, this gets here and the wind is blowing into Tampa Bay. So, you're not getting the surge now, Tampa, but you'll get it probably 18 hours from now. Alex?",

Hurricane Idalia now a Category 2 hurricane, going to make landfall, he says the eye wall will hit Florida tomorrow in the morning. DeSantis warning of what he called a major, major impact by this hurricane, not mincing any words, telling Floridians, you have got to go now.I want to bring back in CNN Meteorologist Chad Myers. Chad, we just heard from the Florida governor. He said that this is going to hit the Big Bend. That is that area, of course, between the panhandle -- the Florida panhandle and the Florida Peninsula. And he said now most of the models are in agreement when it comes to the track of this hurricane. What did you hear in there?",

And if you said, oh, I lived through something, or Hermine or whatever, it's not even close to what we're going to see tomorrow morning.Now, that we're almost to sunset, we're going to see the shear slacking off. And so, all of a sudden, this storm is going to really explode in intensity from 100 to likely 120, 125, as forecast. That's exactly what we expected. But the winds are picking up here. Sarasota, even towards St. Pete, you are still almost 180 miles away and you're still seeing 30-mile- per-hour winds. And as the storm goes by, those winds will pick up. But as the storm goes by tomorrow, all of a sudden the wind is going to blow into Tampa Bay and even cause a surge there. I know we're talking about all of this surge up here, but there will be surge into Tampa Bay. The way the wind is going to go, it's going to go under the bridge and the water is going to pile up in Tampa proper. So, that's something to think about. As the storm gets here on land, it's still going to be a very healthy storm. We have hurricane warnings all the way into Georgia because there will be hurricane conditions probably as far north as Valdosta. And there will be wind, not just rain or even some of these areas where you see lightning. The rain is going to be six inches deep in this entire zone. So, that's going to cause freshwater flooding, not the saltwater flooding that we talk about when it comes to storm surge. And the surge that we have here is a different kind of surge because the land is so flat. And even though we're talking about 10 to 15 feet, we're talking about three to five miles worth of saltwater coming onshore here because the land is flat. So, all of a sudden, you don't see this just stop at the beach kind of surge. It's going to go all the way inland. And then also here, everywhere where you see purple here, Alex, that's 110-mile-per-hour gusts or more. And, yes, there are hurricane gusts, in red, all the way to Jekyll Island. That's New Brunswick. And this is almost up to Valdosta, Georgia. So many trees are going to be in the way, that all of you trying to come back home tomorrow or the next day, you're going to be in traffic jams because the crews are going to have to clear those trees from the roads. It's going to be a power line mess and also a tree line mess. The northern part of Florida is just a beautiful place when it comes to live oak, big tall pine trees. And the big tall pine trees are going to be a problem.",

We're talking about a storm surge of anywhere from four to seven feet. And this time tomorrow will have taken into account some of the rain that has already started to move through the last couple hours as well as high tide, and, of course, all of that water being pushed into the Tampa Bay area. Now, a number of hurricane shelters have opened in Hillsborough County and in Pinellas County, all in anticipation of this storm making its way north just off the coast of the Tampa Bay area. The county sheriff, as well as the city's mayor, they all talked about the threat that this flooding poses for folks even if we don't get a direct hit, which right now it seems the storm is going to pass by.

And this time around, it appears the storm is going to stay off the coast. We're told that all of these hurricane shelters that have opened in Hillsborough and Pinellas County can house up to 20,000 people.

That's because all the briefing on this issue is due Thursday evening.So, the federal judge is asking here both sides, he's asking this question. He's saying, because Mark meadows is charged with two counts, one of them being that racketeering conspiracy charge that actually consists of several different overt acts. The judge is saying, well, if just one of those overt acts falls under the umbrella of Meadows as a federal officer, does that alone mean that Mark Meadows can remove his case to federal court? So really that would be a win for Mark Meadows if it only took one act under RICO to let him move it to federal court. They're going to have briefing on this, and then the judge will take that into consideration. But it's an interesting legal question that this judge is confronting, Alex.",

The right to a speedy trial belongs to the defendant, not to the prosecutor here. So, if the defendant wants to insist on the right to a speedy trial, as Mr. Chesebro and Sidney Powell have done, then, yes, you have the right to be tried under Georgia law in this case by November. But the prosecutor cannot force people who are unwilling to exercise that right to be tried that quickly. I think what Fani Willis is doing here is, A, she's making a statement, and that's perfectly appropriate to say we're ready on everybody, and, B, she's trying to get clarity from the judge, how many trials will there be and when will they be.",

I think it's actually foolish of the two of them to want to try a trial in two months. So I think Fani Willis just wants to get a date on the calendar for the 17 others, which is also another group she'll have to thin down before trial, because even 17 is just not going to happen logistically.",

And it's a really interesting issue because the determining factor as to whether Mark Meadows and eventually perhaps Donald Trump gets the case over to federal court is were they acting within the scope of their official federal jobs or outside the scope. And what the judge is asking here is he's saying, okay, these defendants are charged with racketeering. The racketeering is comprised of dozens of dozens of different acts. And the judge is asking if I find that some of those acts were within Meadows' job but others were outside of the job, is that enough?And the answer, by the way, Alex, is we don't know. This specific question has never been addressed by statute, by a case. And so, I think the judge wants to assess the strength of the arguments. He knows he's going to be appealed either way.
