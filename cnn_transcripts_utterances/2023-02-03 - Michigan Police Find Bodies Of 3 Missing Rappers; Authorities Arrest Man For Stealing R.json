      "sentences": "Well, this morning, Dallas police announced that a 24-year-old man by the name of Davion Irvin was arrested in connection and charged with six counts of animal cruelty.In connection with two tamarin monkeys stolen from the Dallas Zoo earlier this week. They were found safely in an abandoned house south of here. But this is where the mystery to all of this started several weeks ago. This is the habitat for langers, which are kind of an ape species. You can see them. They were around here a second ago, Victor and Alisyn. There's four of them kind of jumping around the enclosure. Several weeks ago, zoo officials noticed that this area had been cut. This wire mesh had been cut. The langers did not escape from this facility. The, you remember several weeks ago you heard the news of the Clouded Leopard that escaped. And that is just a habitat two down from where these langers are. We'll show you that in a second. This was the area that was cut. And the Clouded Leopard did escape from here. That was back on January 13th. And it became clear, zoo officials say, this was something that was a deliberate, an intentional act. And the leopards cannot be seen now. That's the way live television works. But it is cold. They're kind of hiding away. But that leopard was found later that same day just on the other side of that fence. Didn't actually get far away from all of this. But then, several weeks later, on the other side of the zoo, there was a rare vulture that died and they found that it was intentionally wounded. Killed essentially. Then earlier this week, those tamarin monkeys disappeared and they were found just the next day. So all of this is a mystery that has really worried and troubled zoo officials here. They've tried to figure out exactly why they've been targeted in this way. And what zoo officials want to know, is this the work of one person or something much more sinister and part of a bigger plot? We don't know the answers right now. But right now, we do know that one suspect is in custody -- Victor and Alisyn?",

      "sentences": "First of all, that is a very conservative federal appeals court and it's made more conservative because of former President Trump's nominees.As you said, what the court did is it validated this law that blocked a person under a restraining order for domestic violence from possessing a handgun. But here's what was really critical. They based their entire opinion on a landmark opinion that we had at the Supreme Court last term. Ad in that opinion, the justices basically told lower courts they had to change the framework about how they evaluate gun regulations. They said, going forward, they had to look toward America's history and American tradition when seeing if a law passes muster. So this federal appeals court looked at this law and said the government hasn't shown that it's based in history and tradition and they invalidated it. And Attorney General Merrick Garland was quick to react to this. He issued statement and he said he was going to appeal. And he said, \"Nearly 30 years ago, Congress determined that a person who is subject to a court order restraining him or her from threatening and intimating partner or child cannot lawfully possess a firearm.\" \"Whether analyzed through the lens on the Supreme Court precedent or the tradition of the 2nd Amendment, that statute is constitutional.\" Now he's got to appeal. And he has a couple of choices. Either he goes back to a bigger number of judges on this very conservative federal appeals court, or he might have better luck going straight to the Supreme Court. And that's a quandary for this court. They recently visited the 2nd Amendment. They usually like to have things percolate. And now they might be drawn in again sooner than they may have liked.",
