Ron DeSantis and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley took questions from Republican Iowa caucusgoers. Among the topics covered, abortion, immigration, gun reform, taxes, and the race's frontrunner, Donald Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, yes, I think the fact that he's campaigning on something -- that does not mean that he would actually follow through on it. NIKKI HALEY, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I personally think President Trump was the right president at the right time. I agree with a lot of his policies. But the reality is rightly or wrongly, chaos follows him, and we all know that's true. Chaos follows him. And we can't have a country in disarray and a world on fire and go through four more years of chaos. We won't survive it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Iowa is kind of everything for him.Nikki Haley, of course, has been the recipient of momentum here late in the game and she has really focused on -- she was in Iowa last night but she really has focused on New Hampshire to the point that she made a remark about how the role each state, Iowa and New Hampshire, play in the process. She, of course, hails from South Carolina, which is the third -- they call themselves the first in the South primary. But she ruffled some feathers with some remarks she made in New Hampshire and she was asked for the first time about them on stage last night.

I mean, joking about how important a caucus or a primary is can matter. Now, it's important to also remember through all this that for Iowa, Haley's team is prioritizing just exceeding the expectation game. There is not a strong sense that she needs to win Iowa. That she needs to go into New Hampshire having won the previous contest. She just needs to show that there is momentum and that all of the hype that she's enjoyed recently is real and substantive.

And they're definitely previewing it, as you showed in the ad.They're telling reporters on calls previously previewing this. They're really starting to say that democracy is at stake. And I think they're looking at the data. Like, there's two things that I've been looking at is that a) Bidenomics really didn't take hold although the economy is doing very well from a data standpoint -- consumer sentiment. The way people view the economy is really not taking off. But in the polling data around January 6 and around Trump is very clear. There was a poll out earlier this week that said a third of Republicans thought -- or a third of voters thought that the protest was peaceful or was even an FBI false flag. But look on the flip side of that poll. That means two-thirds think it was a serious issue. That it was something that was actually criminal and violent. And majorities of voters say that President Trump is possibly legally liable or criminally liable for what happened on that day. And when you look at horse race polls that are very much neck-and- neck, that majority that say that Trump -- that tie Trump to January 6 in a negative way, I think the Biden campaign is looking at that and saying that that's a winning issue. So they're hitting the road today to kick off the general election campaign to talk about it.",

That's where he very much authentically, I think, goes and honestly, said that he wouldn't be running this time at his age, at this point in his life if he didn't think he was the person to beat Trump and that he had to beat Trump because Trump is a threat to democracy in this nation. And you mentioned also Charlottesville and some of the racial angles of this. Remember, this is a one-two punch for the president. He's going to be in Valley Forge drawing the connections to George Washington today, and then later heading down I think to Charleston to talk about some of the racial strife in this country.

And the balancing act that the U.S. is trying to do right now with only limited success, so far, I would -- I would say, is to both reestablish some deterrents.

And what they're fearful of is that at some point, one of those ships is going to sink where it would be a much bigger incident. The lesson of the fight with the Somali pirates years ago and others suggested you've got to get at their -- at their equipment, their missiles on the land. But President Biden has been very hesitant to do this, in part because he doesn't want to trigger that larger war and in part, because there's been a civil war in Yemen to which there was a negotiated truce that was quite delicate to keep balanced. And that truce has held, astoundingly, for more than a year. And so they don't want to upend that and trigger off another civil war. So it's a real tightrope that they are -- that they're on. But I know there are many in the U.S. military who think if you don't strike the Houthis back on their base you're not going to stop this series of attacks.

      "sentences": "He certainly was happy.All right, Victor Wembanyama, meanwhile, was celebrating his 20th birthday by going up against Giannis Antetokounmpo for the first time. In the second quarter, Wemby picked up his dribble but then threw it off the backboard to himself for the slam. And look at this again. His dribble was picked up at the three-point line. That's just incredible. In the third quarter, Wemby then using that eight-foot wing span to get the steal. Then he goes around the world and slams it over Brook Lopez, plus the foul. Now, Giannis was incredible in this game as well. Under a minute to go, game tied. Giannis drives it in with a monster slam to take the lead. Moments later, up three now, Giannis -- he tried to go right at Wemby but Wemby, this time, with a block -- one of five that he had in the game. The Bucks, though, would hold on to win this 125-121. Giannis had 44 points and was certainly impressed with Wemby afterwards. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
