He was criticizing how the West provides weapons and batches.And it reads in part, quote: The practice of providing military aid to Ukraine in doses, for fear of irritating Putin and provoking further escalation, is fundamentally flawed. When emergency surgery is required, one should not engage in drug therapy. How do you think the U.S. and Western powers would respond to this view?",

You know, as the war started, 19 months ago, President Biden was quite concerned that certain kinds of weapons would cross the red line for the Russians and lead to an expansion of the war, either, horizontally that is to say elsewhere beyond Ukraine, or vertically, that is to say he would begin to reach for tactical nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction.That concern has abated a little bit by 19 months of experience, and that's why the administration appears to be edging towards giving the Ukrainian something that, months ago, they said they never give them, which was the ATACMS. These longer range artilleries that can be fire from the HIMARS and be going pretty deep behind Russian lines. So, while I understand the Ukrainian frustration here, you could imagine the alternative, which was to give them everything at the beginning, before they actually knew what they meet needed, and hope that there wasn't a red line that we were crossing a unknowingly.",

But you don't have a long range unless you have a short term, and the short term emergency as you heard before is for that kind of ammunition.By the way, that applies the Russians as well. And there's a reason that Kim Jong-un has been on this four-day extravaganza tour of Vladivostok and other parts, of Russia -- if the Russians are trying to get a steady supply of artillery shells as well. In fact, some of the earlier Ukrainian shells came from South Korea. So, it wouldn't be surprising if the Russians reach to North Korea. You're going to hear a lot about this in the coming week as President Zelenskyy comes to the United Nations, and then comes to Washington as well to make an appeal for this. And he's clearly worried that there is some war fatigue setting in, not only in the United States, but in Europe.",

The second is that the year Europeans crack their support. So far, they've held on, but there is a right-wing movement in Italy elsewhere that has long been admiring of Putin. And then the third way is if former President Trump or another candidate wins among the Republicans who believe the United States should be not be engaged in this conflict, then it would pretty much be game over, because it's the U.S. that's been whipping the support, it's not only U.S. providing the money, but keeping NATO together and keeping all of the European allies, Japan, South Korea, others, contributing to the efforts.

And back then, we always had criticisms of Rolling Stone and it was interesting to watch in the wake of this article people from back then speaking up and noting how magazines -- competing magazines like \"The Source\" and \"Vibe\" that focused on black artists and focused on rap were created in part because of the way \"Rolling Stone\" seemed to underplay those types of artists in this coverage back then when Wenner was much more involved with the magazine.You know, beyond that, I guess we're in a moment where people are saying the quiet part out loud now. I mean, I was kind of amazed that he would actually admit this stuff. But as somebody from back then who remembered being critical of \"Rolling Stone's\" coverage, at least you have some validation that what you observed back then was real and that some of the concerns that we had about how the magazine was treating women and artists of color were -- turned out to be valid. And unfortunately, he's pulled this back to the bad old days when baby boomer males, white males controlled so much of pop music coverage in the industry itself.",

According to the Red Cross, the United States blood supply had dropped nearly 25 percent since early August. This is partly due to some large blood drives being canceled recently because of extreme weather and climate disasters like Hurricane Idalia.Donor turnout also fell due to a busy travel season this summer, followed by back-to-school activities. And this all has contributed to a shortfall of about 30,000 donations in August alone. The Red Cross says now donors of all blood types are needed and there's an emergency need for type O and platelet donors. To give blook or platelets, simply visit redcrossblood.org or call 1- 800-red-cross to learn more about how you can help. And donations are important for emergency situations but also for some people with conditions like cancer or sickle cell disease who rely on blood transfusions as part of their care.
