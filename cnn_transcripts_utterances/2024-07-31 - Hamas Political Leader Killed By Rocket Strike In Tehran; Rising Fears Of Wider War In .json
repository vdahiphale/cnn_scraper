      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics. Fears of a broader war. The Middle East is at another flashpoint as the world waits for Iran to retaliate against Israel, who it blames for killing a top Hamas leader on Iranian soil. We're following the breaking news across the region with some new reporting about what the strike means for the ceasefire for hostages talks.Plus, campaign star power. Rapper Megan Thee Stallion helps Kamala Harris rally a boisterous crowd of nearly 10,000 people in Atlanta. But will the energy translate to votes putting Georgia back in play for Democrats. And Wolverine state worries. It is almost impossible to win the presidency without winning Michigan. And CNN is on the ground in suburban Detroit, talking to a crucial group of voters about what they think about the presidential matchup. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We start with the assassination of top Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. His Iran's supreme leader is promising revenge for the strike inside his country, issuing this warning to Israel. Quote, you killed our dear guests in our house and now have paved the way for your harsh punishment. Now Israel has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for Haniyeh's death. But it came just hours after an Israeli airstrike killed a Hezbollah commander in Lebanon, in retaliation for a weekend rocket attack on a soccer field in the Golan Heights that left 12 Jews Arab children dead. CNN's Clarissa Ward is now here from Tel Aviv. Clarissa, what are you hearing?",

      "sentences": "Well, Dana, there's no question this entire region really on a knife's edge at the moment. There have been security meetings ongoing throughout the day here in Israel. Israelis, as you mentioned, still not commenting officially on the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh. But they have been much more forthcoming about the strike that they launched that killed, essentially Hezbollah's number two Fuad Shukr.We have heard now from the IDF chief of staff who was speaking in the North. He said basically, that the IDF quote knows as well how to target a certain point underground. Many people potentially interpreting that as some kind of a veiled threat to the leader of Hezbollah, Syed Hassan Nasrallah, he went on to say that Shukr was responsible for the strike that killed those 12 children in Majdal Shams. And he said that essentially the goal now with vis-a-vis, Hezbollah is not to go back to October 6, but to create a new reality. We also heard from the Foreign Minister of Israel, Israel Katz, who said that U.N. resolution 1701 must be implemented. Now that would essentially call for the disarmament of Hezbollah, and for Hezbollah to pull back beyond or behind, I should say, the Litani River. Now, I have spoken, Dana, to our reserve as Brigadier General Assaf Orion, who says that, you know, there is a broad consensus here, given how provocative these assassinations were. How high profile the targets were, the fact that they took place in Tehran and Beirut. There is an expectation that there will be some kind of retaliation, and this could be a dangerous escalation. He talked about a possible attack on Tel Aviv, on Haifa, on Ben Gurion Airport. And he also crucially talked about the kinds of weapons that we may see being used. Now, Hezbollah has far more sophisticated weapons. You could be looking at longer range missiles at higher precision type of weapons. So certainly, the sense that this could rapidly escalate very quickly, not to mention what happens when and if Iran decides how it intends to respond to this. Dana?",

And that's certainly what I'm hearing from an intelligent source in the region at the moment, who also thinks that there will be a major escalation. But he doesn't think that this major escalation in hostilities will happen overnight, that this will be a slow and continued heating of the situation, but he does anticipate this. He thinks that the talks therefore, for the hostage releases and ceasefire are over.But I think one of the questions I know the question that he has and others in his office is what is the United States position on all of this? They'll have heard what Secretary of State Antony Blinken says. You'll have heard what Lloyd Austin has said about supporting Israel's. Security Blinken say, we didn't know about the attack coming on Ismail Haniyeh. But they will have watched the optics of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaking in Congress here. And when he goes back to the Middle East, and you have these two high profile assassinations, it appears to give the imprimatur of the United States benignly, saying, yes, go ahead with this. And that further erodes the United States ability to broker for peace, to call for a calming down in the region and their legitimacy in the region.

Just to follow up with that, because it was just last week that the Israeli prime minister was here, not just speaking to Congress, but having those private meetings with President Biden, with Vice President Kamala Harris, and with hostage families.And the sense that we all got reporting out of that was that the U.S. administration from the president -- the vice president, said, OK, enough, Bibi. Like, let's get on with it, stop dragging your feet on this war. Let's make the deal and move on. And then less than a week later or about a week later, you have this very provocative move. Does it mean that they didn't think that Hamas was really going to give on these talks? Or was it just they had an opportunity to get somebody they consider a terrorist, and they took it.",

But the space that Prime Minister Netanyahu perceives that he has to cooperate, no doubt these two men were people the United States is not unhappy to see removed from the playing field, so to speak. But the notion that the United States can weigh in and have an impact in the region at the moment. We know the Britisher sent diplomats. The Qatar, the message to Qataris to try to keep going with the negotiations. I think that's going to be very, very difficult to continue with. BASH: Yeah. You mentioned the secretary of state -- the U.S. Secretary of State Tony Blinken. Let's listen to what he said after the strikes. ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: I'm not going to speculate on what impact anyone event might have on that. I've learned over many years, never to really speculate about that because we simply don't know. What I do know, is the enduring imperative of getting the ceasefire.

No, and he is making a quote. A couple of points on this, which is, you know, the world is on fire because Biden is weak. And he's obviously now switching that to Kamala Harris. In an interview on Fox News, he essentially said, listen, she's a woman, no one's going to listen to her on the world stage, right? Because she's a woman, they're going to treat her like a play toys. So, he is certainly playing to that. He doesn't even necessarily have a real plan, other than himself, right? I am a strong man. The world will bend to my will, because I'm a strong man. That is essentially his argument. And listen, some people will buy it. Certainly, his followers believe that and believe he is a sort of magic figure on the world stage.
