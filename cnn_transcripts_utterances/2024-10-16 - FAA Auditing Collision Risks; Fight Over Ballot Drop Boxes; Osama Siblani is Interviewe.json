You are also a pilot. You are well aware of all the things that can - can cause these problems. But give us some sense of this, because that number sounds like a lot.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Sara. You know, this is significant because it shows that this industry-wide issue really has not been licked just yet. The FAA says it will audit these 45 busiest airports in the U.S. for the potential of these near collisions on runways. They're known officially as runway incursions. Been reporting on it since the start of last year. And the headlines have really been emerging coast to coast. The catalyst at New York's JFK in January 2023, an American Airlines flight bound for London taxied in front of a Delta flight that was already accelerating for takeoff. Nobody hurt in that incident, but investigators said the pilots of the American Airlines flight were distracted by paperwork, essentially got lost on the ground.But the list really goes on here. Austin, Boston, Burbank, Reagan National Airport outside D.C. in June. And the most recent incident just last month in Nashville. The tires of an Alaska Airlines flight that was taking off blew out when the pilots had to slam on the brakes when a Southwest Airlines flight taxied out in front of them. Now, investigators say that they're still doing interviews in that case. The FAA says it's audit here will really drill down on the risks that are baked in at each airport. Remember, might not always be pilots who are entirely at fault here. Could be something a bit more structural. And the FAA wants to know if there are gaps in procedures or issues with equipment. Maybe there's a process at the airport that's causing problems. Investigators have been concerned not only about the design of some airports, but also the lack of early warning technology. Thirty-five airports have technology that alerts air traffic controllers of these impending collisions. But remember, there are about 500 airports in the U.S. with commercial service. The NTSB has said that technology saved the day in that JFK collision I talked about earlier. And NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy's told me she wants to see it at more airports. Of course, a lot of eyes here on this new audit, Sara. And the FAA says it will be finished sometime next year. A lot of people looking forward to this.",

Whoever wins these races is likely to determine who controls the House of Representatives next Congress. And in my conversations with them, when I went to their districts, they very much pitched themselves to me as moderates who were willing to work across the aisle and even create distance with their own party. Congressman D'Esposito said to me, you know, he gets criticized for not being conservative enough. And that's because these Republicans are walking a very thin tight rope. They know that their districts are home to more registered Democrats than Republicans. Their districts voted for President Biden in 2020. But they also are part of the Republican Party. They support former President Donald Trump. They support House Speaker Mike Johnson, who I'm' told is coming to their districts in the coming weeks.
