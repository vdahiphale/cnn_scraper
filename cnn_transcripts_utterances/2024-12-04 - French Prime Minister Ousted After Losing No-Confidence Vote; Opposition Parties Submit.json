And let's get right to the news.The French prime minister has just lost a no confidence vote plunging the country into further political instability. Just three months into his term, Michel Barnier lost the support of his fragile government after attempting to push through part of the government's annual budget on Monday. That proposal includes $63 billion in tax hikes and spending cuts aimed at reining in the national debt. CNN's Jim Bittermann is in Paris tonight. Jim, what happens now?",

      "sentences": "Good question, James. The fact is what happens is that that Emmanuel Macron, who just got off a plane from Saudi Arabia about an hour ago. Emmanuel Macron will name a new prime minister. The current government Michel Barnier and all of his ministers will resign. They -- it's an automatic thing and they will probably be kept on in a caretaker role.This is something that's happened before like, for example, over the summer months. In fact during the Olympics there was no government here and there was just a caretaker government from the previous prime minister. So Macron will name somebody if he can find somebody who may be able to get the French budget passed, as he would like, so that that the, that the country will have a budget going forward. As it stands now, the previous year's budget 2024 will be the one that will go into use at January 1st. But the question is whether or not that will please anyone and it certainly won't please the financial markets because the present budget also is raising the debt. So its a kind of a head scratcher for the president in terms of who he can find, who can please the various factions in the parliament. And the parliament is now pretty closely divided -- one third, one third, one third. Just before this vote was taken tonight the prime minister, Michel Barnier, got up and made a last ditch plea for his budget and for his government and warned of the consequences of what might happen if indeed he was voted out of office. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHEL BARNIER, FRENCH PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  What I'm sure ladies and gentlemen, what I say seriously before you is that this motion of no confidence at the moment when you are probably preparing this coalition of opposites, this no confidence motion will make everything more serious and more difficult. I'm sure of it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, I will just tell you that Pete Hegseth just walked into Senator Joni Ernst's office. This has been a highly anticipated meeting today for a couple of reasons, one is that Ernst is a sexual assault survivor herself. She told us earlier that this was going to be a thorough discussion. She was looking forward to. Also, she has fought for a long time to make sure that women can serve in combat roles in the military. That is something that Pete Hegseth has spoken disparagingly about in the past. And so that is going to be another issue for the two of them to discuss today in this highly anticipated meeting. Meanwhile, you have people who have continued to meet with him, who have not committed yet to backing him. Two of those individuals I talked to today, Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican of West Virginia, who met with him yesterday, who said that they had a good meeting, that they did talk about some of these allegations that you referenced earlier, Jim, and that she was not sure yet where she was going to land on this vote. She said she had not made up her mind. She's continuing to go through the process. Also, Senator John Thune, who will become the next Republican leader and is the Republican whip right now. That means the man in charge of counting GOP votes in the senate. He said that this is a process that he is telling Hegseth, as he has told other nominees he's met with, that they are guaranteed to have a fair confirmation hearing, a fair confirmation process but he said that this conversation with Hegseth is going to continue as more and more members both on the Senate Armed Services Committee and beyond, meet with him. So, to me, that was a really strong indication that Thune is not saying either whether or not he is going to back Hegseth's nomination -- Jim.",

FOXAnd we should just lay out how hard it could be for Hegseth. Republicans do have a majority in the senate. It only takes a simple majority to get these nominees through. But Republicans have a 53-seat majority, which means they can only afford to lose three Republican members if they lose four. That nominee goes down on the floor. Now, we are still weeks potentially months away from a potential floor vote on someone like Hegseth. But that just gives you a sense of how narrow your wiggle room is when you were talking about getting these nominees through the process, Jim.",

(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) ELIZABETH PRELOGAR, U.S. SOLICITOR GENERAL:  This case is about access to medications that have been safely prescribed for decades to treat many conditions, including gender dysphoria.

And by the way, we ban the surgical procedures as well as use of these harmful prescription drugs, the surgery part is not at issue. The case centers around the use of the puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and so forth. And I do believe -- I'm convinced, after consultation with numerousmedical professionals, we had them come testify. There's a whole organization that's made up of physicians across the world who advocate against using these medicines for kids. And again, we're talking specifically about kids -- kids that are either prepubescent or they're in puberty. We're not talking about adults. If you're an adult and you wish to use these medications or have a surgery, that's certainly your prerogative. We're talking about kids that are 13, 14, 15 years old. We just don't know what the long term implications are. And there are many in the medical profession who share that opinion. So in Tennessee, we said no, we're not going to do that. And I -- and I will take issue with one thing to I think as you introduced the segment that we banned care. No, we didn't ban care. We didn't ban mental health treatment. We didn't -- we didn't ban loving these kids and embracing them and giving them access to mental health treatment to get them through these difficult times.

They added barriers to accessing it, the additional mental health screenings, et cetera.

We're laboratories of democracy, and we should be having intense conversations about this and consulting with medical professionals. The state of Tennessee and the general assembly is reflected by the people of Tennessee, who overwhelmingly support the legislation. We pass decided, no, we shouldn't utilize these drugs for these kids. We don't know enough about the long term effects on them. So we did pass an outright ban, and I'm hopeful the Supreme Court will affirm the right of states like Tennessee to do that if they choose. SCIUTTO:  Before we go, you know that this is a deeply difficult and emotional decision, not just for the young people involved, but for their parents and, you know, you hear the accounts of many parents who -- who are concerned that if their child doesn't get to choose who they believe they truly are, that their life might be in danger for -- for -- not from the medication, right?

So they're going to be drilling down on that and at the same time, they're going to be going through probably a myriad in the last 5 to 10 years of people who have had the same gripe. And that's before you even get to people who had been laid off or fired. The interesting thing here is to me, they either had a very well- trained disgruntled person who could do a hit or they upset somebody who had the means to hire somebody who was very well-trained, which is, you know, going to be an interesting thing to unpack.",

That city, a symbolic stronghold for the Assad regime.In 1982, then-President Hafez al-Assad, father of Bashar, cracked down on an Islamic uprising, killing tens of thousands of his own people in Hama. Its fall would mark another major win for the opposition forces following a lightning offensive that began last week. As we look at the map here, the area in green is under rebel control, as you can see. It includes Idlib and much of Aleppo provinces -- Aleppo following falling earlier in the week.

Of course, the United States and many other western partners still view them as a terrorist organization, but their ambitions are very much so Syria-focused right now. This has been an extraordinary upending of the status quo in Syria. You know, this war, of course, has been going on for 13 years now, but we haven't had a change, a serious shift on the front lines in many years. Now, this is obviously also a sort of group of rebels. It's an alliance, but largely led by Tahrir al-Sham. By taking Aleppo, they've taken the biggest city in the entire country. Over 2 million people live there, and commercially vastly important. And as they move south, they're now, of course, as you've mentioned, trying to take Hama. Now this doesn't mean that they're threatening Damascus or the capital at this point. We've also -- it's worth noting that a decade ago, it was -- Syrian opposition rebels did occupy Aleppo. We've been here before, but this lightning pace has really changed everything. And, Jim, you know what really has become stark is that the multi- layered proxy wars that we see in Syria remain the same. The sides remain the same.

It was very much so a sign of weakness.And we must remember that, of course, Hezbollah, Iran's proxy force in Lebanon, of course, have been fighting in Syria for over a decade, supporting the Assad regime. The Hezbollah fighters have provided extraordinary expertise and ground forces where of course, you've also had the Russian air -- air cover and airstrikes across the country to help support Bashar al-Assad.

The area in the north east of Syria that these rebels have rushed down from is called Idlib and Idlib province is effectively supporting and is home to an extraordinary amount of displaced people, many of whom are living in terrible conditions. But, you know, part of this war and the broader regional wars and the politics around the region has also seen Syrian refugees. So often used as pawns -- you know, these rebels have they have the backing and support of Turkey across the border. Now, Turkey has been in talks with Bashar al-Assad about trying to get the huge amounts of Syrian refugees who have poured into Turkey to return to Syria. Those talks had broken down. So as far as the Turks are concerned, the sooner these rebels can -- can open up areas of land. So, Syrian refugees can return -- the more that the Turkish government would be happy with that situation but, of course, you know, it's impossible to think that this offensive wasn't -- didn't get the backing or at least a heads up for what was given a heads up to the Turks.",

So I think China engages Africans where they are, offering them a lotof money particularly with the infrastructure needs, which are tremendous when you consider that Africa is lagging behind in terms of economic development. So building roads, building ports, building schools have direct impact on the lives, the livelihoods of Africans.
