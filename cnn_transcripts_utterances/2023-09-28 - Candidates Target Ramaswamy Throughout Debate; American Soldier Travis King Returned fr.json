Israel Supreme Court is hearing a case at the heart of the political controversy swirling around Benjamin Netanyahu. Iraq in mourning after a fire at a wedding and trying to make sure such a tragedy never happens again. I'll speak to an advisor to the Prime Minister about exactly how they plan to do that.

Well, before we get to the headlines of the day, let's get you a look at the U.S. futures and the major averages on track for a lower open after what was a mixed day of trade on Wednesday. Stocks also remain on track for a losing week investors, just a little shy at present not looking good as far as a U.S. government shutdown is concerned. That of course, is the deadline end of this week and the macro- economic picture, not one that investors in stocks are particularly happy about at present. New York's trading day starts in just under 30 minutes' time. First up this out the debate that everyone is talking about today. It was a crowded stage of U.S. Republicans plus the elephant in the room. Once again, the dominant front runner in the party's race for the White House, Donald Trump was not there. The barbs were flying fast and furious. But the early consensus is all that bluster didn't make a dent in Trump's lead. Kyung Lah has the latest for you. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KYUNG LAH, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A chaotic second GOP presidential debate, with seven candidates all vying for second place behind Donald Trump criticizing the front runner for not showing up. CHRIS CHRISTIE, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You're not here tonight, because you're afraid of being on the stage and defending your record. You're ducking these things. And let me tell you what's going to happen. You keep doing that. No one up here is going to call you Donald Trump anymore. We're going to call you Donald Duck. LAH (voice-over): The candidates and vote Trump's name more this time around zeroing in the economy and possible government shutdown. RON DESANTIS, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The people in Washington are shutting down the American dream with their reckless behavior. They borrow, they printed, they spent and now you're paying more for everything. They are the reason for that. And where's Joe Biden, he's completely missing an action from leadership. And you know who else is missing an action? Donald Trump is missing an action he should be on this stage tonight. He owes it to you to defend his record. LAH (voice-over): Pence took direct aim at the President's Bidenomics agenda. MIKE PENCE, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Joe Biden doesn't belong on a picket line. He belongs on the unemployment line. Bidenomics has failed. Wages are not keeping up with inflation auto workers and all American workers are feeling it. LAH (voice-over): On the auto workers strike a range of views and blame. TIM SCOTT, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: They want for day French work weeks, but more money, they want more benefits, working fewer hours that is simply not going to stand. DOUG BURGUM, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The reason why people are striking in Detroit is because Joe Biden's interference with capital markets, and with free markets. LAH (voice-over): The debate hit on many red meat issues for the Republican Party, including immigration and border security.",

LAH (on camera): Well, I mean, from that last bit there is that they're arguing about curtains. You know, it's a little hard to say that anything really substantively changed, Becky, in regards to the overall movement and dynamics of this field right now, you have these seven that made the debate hall, and they made the debate stage. And then you have Donald Trump who has already moved on to the primary, he says, and this is his word in advance of this debate. He called a \"stupid\" that in the sentence, he's saying this is all irrelevant that he believes this is more of a coronation than a primary. So as far as that overall trend, it doesn't appear to have changed that much. But what these candidates were really trying to do. The seven who are vying to be the Trump alternative is they need to knock each other down. But yet they need to somehow not Trump while still getting some of the people who are backing him.

Well, in under an hour, House Republicans hold their first hearing their inquiry into President Joe Biden and their determined efforts to find something they can use to impeach him. You're looking at Capitol Hill where that hearing will take place. Republicans claim President Biden abused his office to enrich his family members but have yet to publish evidence of any wrongdoing.

But it is important to know that the backdrop to all of this is the fact that they simply have not yet proved or provided any concrete evidence for any of these allegations. That they are making about Joe Biden in terms of abuse of power, or bribery. So far, all of the documents that they have put up, none of them include any kind of direct evidence that Joe Biden profited from any of his son Hunter Biden's business dealings. But and today's impeachment inquiry is certainly not expected to go any further in terms of providing concrete evidence. That's because this is going to feature a panel of three conservative legal experts who are going to opine effectively on some of the claims that these House Republicans are making. But none of these witnesses are going to be direct fact witnesses to any of the allegations that House Republicans are making. And so the White House really is using this as an opportunity to try and sharpen the contrast between what House Republicans are focused on. And what the White House is focused on, especially as the President today delivers this speech on democracy. And the White House is also saying that House Republicans instead of focusing on what they call partisan political attacks, that they should be focused on trying to keep the government funded just a couple of days before the government runs out of money.",

And this is all of course connected to this massive judicial overhaul the Netanyahu government is trying to push through but the particular case that they're hearing today, this one could have the most personal effect on Benjamin Netanyahu and his ability to serve as leader as discovered, because this is related to a law that was passed in March. That makes it much more difficult for a sitting Prime Minister to be removed from office, because he would be declared unfit for office. And what this law says is the only way a Prime Minister can be declared unfit for office is for physical or mental reasons. The Prime Minister themselves can do it or supermajority in the cabinet, ratified then by the Parliament only that could remove them beforehand. There wasn't really a law on the books, and it was essentially agreed, based off of case law that it was the Attorney General who could declare the Prime Minister unfit for office. And there was a major concern that because of Benjamin Netanyahu's ongoing corruption trial, that that could cause him to be declared unfit for office so based off of this new law, that couldn't happen anymore. And so that's why there are petitions against this law, because the petitioners are saying this was passed solely to benefit Benjamin Netanyahu. And because of that, it should not stand. And what's interesting is what we've heard from the lawyers arguing for this law, the lawyer for the parliament saying, sure, yes, this was actually to benefit Benjamin Netanyahu, it's hard to deny that because those are comments that were made by members of parliament while this law was being debated back in March. But they are arguing that by knowing this law by tearing it down, the Supreme Court will be going against Democratic values would be tearing down the millions of votes that were cast for Benjamin Netanyahu, and that it's not up to the Supreme Court to do so. What's interesting is once again, the Attorney General for the government is not arguing on the side of the government because although she's a member of the government, she's not a political ally of Benjamin Netanyahu. And a lawyer for her has argued that this law cannot stand as it is now because she says a basic law cannot be used as a kind of private resource that removes personal problems from the field of morality and criminal law. Now, Becky, this will take a faster timeline than the other cases in front of the Supreme Court. We do expect a decision on this within the next couple of weeks. But it is possible the Supreme Court could sort of punt on this and say, this law can stand but can only take effect in the next parliamentary session, Becky.",

      "sentences": "Becky, this was a very interesting process about how he got out of North Korea and how this playedout over the course of the last several weeks. Sweden very much a key player here and effectively was the go between the U.S. and North Korea and it was also a Swedish convoy in North Korea. That brought private Travis King to the border with China across the Friendship Bridge, where he was met by the U.S. Defense Attache to China and was then transferred into U.S. military custody, China also playing a critical role here acting as essentially the transport option or the transport venue for King, to leave North Korea and to travel back to the United States. King was brought into China and then flown out into South Korea before he hopped on a U.S. military flight and landed about seven or eight hours ago at Joint Base San Antonio where he'll head to Brooke Army Medical Center. That's where detainees from overseas are taken for medical evaluation, perhaps accurate and psychiatric evaluation and essentially to help them re acclimate to being out of detention and in the United States. So for example, Brittney Griner, and Trevor Reed were taken there after they were released from Russia. But there are a number of interesting questions here. First, the U.S. insists that didn't give anything up to North Korea for the release of King and interestingly, North Korea says or hasn't claimed at least that it got anything in return from the United States. But one of the big questions that hangs over all of this and for which the army hasn't yet given clarity, will King face Uniform Code of Military Justice charges. He was absent without leave when he ran into North Korea and officials here said that he did so willfully and intentionally. And the possibility was raised that he could face military charges. But that question now at least doesn't have an answer, perhaps pushed off to the side a little bit. What's important is that he's home, Becky, he has talked to his family, and he is recovering at a hospital in San Antonio.",

And it's only allocated for these projects. This is this is one preventative measure. That's an example I'm giving you. The integrity commission is working very hard. And we almost every day, they have announcements of capturing people at the act of corruption, either being receiving bribes or asking for bribes. And they are arrested and prosecuted. So it is something that is an ongoing on daily basis. And if you follow Iraq news, you will see this kind of news and this government seriousness about rooting it out.

Essentially, Becky, this is a way to limit which websites the ChatGPT WebCrawler as it's no GPTbot. How much they can crawl, an index from websites? Now a lot of websites have already inserted code, which stops ChatGPT from scraping them. But it is an interesting point. We know about copyright issues and AI.
