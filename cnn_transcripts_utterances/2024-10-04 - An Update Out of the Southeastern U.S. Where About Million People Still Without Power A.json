      "sentences": "For years, the Arctic Ocean has been a point of interest for China amid its strong ties with Russia.While this patrol, if it did indeed enter the ocean, may have just been on the outskirts, the messaging and images from the Chinese government show the symbolism and importance of the region to China. Let me show you some of the pictures we`ve received. We see a shot from above of the Chinese Coast Guard vessel. There`s a helicopter taking off, flying around. Officers are singing the national anthem on deck, along with some ceremonial moments. An officer from the Chinese Coast Guard said this voyage is about security. Analysts point out this is a broader pattern of collaboration and designed to send a message to Washington, whose maritime activities in the South and East China Seas have annoyed Beijing. A retired U.S. Navy captain who has worked in intelligence feels this presence in the far north is significant because it implies China is extending its Coast Guard into areas the U.S. has traditionally considered to be its own domain. The U.S. has raised concerns about China`s presence in the region and its coordination with Russia as we see the two nations tighten their security and economic ties on a broader level.
