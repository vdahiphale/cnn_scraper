Given the amount of time that the jury spent deliberating, given the questions that they brought up, what are you anticipating we are going to hear in a few moments? LAURA COATES, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST: You know, this is a trial of historic proportions, Boris. This will be the very first time in the history of our nation that we have a parent of a school shooter, a mass shooter, who would be held to account for the actions of their child. He is already serving a life sentence without parole. Remember, he was initially listed as potentially on her own witness list. He is not on the witness list. He did not actually testify and did not actually testify on her behalf. This has been to two different trials. One for Jennifer Crumbley, his mother, and the other for his father later down the road. She is trying to build a defense, essentially to say, I had no idea. I was not on notice, whatever he was going through, it was not foreseeable. To the extent that I knew about what he was grappling with, I thought suicide might be the likely result, not at all harm towards others. It's going to be a very telling case in terms of how we regard deterrence and prosecution in the future. Perhaps most importantly here, we saw a woman take the stand when you have parents on that jury, you have men and women, you have a community where they are, in fact, gun owners. The Second Amendment right is still hold dear, particularly in this area, were even a school official talked about the potential of many students hunting before school. The school administrator, Boris, you did not check the backpack on the day of the tragic shooting that claimed four lives and injured seven others.

That she was never there for him. That she spent more time with her horses, three to five times a week after work than she did with her son. But her son texted her in March, beginning in March, saying, \"I think the house is haunted. The bowls are flying off the shelf. I'm scared. Maybe it's my delusions. Help me.\" There was not a response. It may have been a phone call an hour and a half later, but no response. And then, later on, there was testimony that came into this trial that the family didn't know about, but he texted a friend of his saying, \"I've asked my mom and dad for help to take me to the doctor. I need help. And my dad told me to suck it up and take a pill, and my mother laughed.\" The defense had nothing to cross-examine on that, because Ethan Crumbley asserted his Fifth Amendment right. Even though we know he told the jailhouse psychiatrist that he lied right there. But the defense didn't have an opportunity to cross examine it. Then you get to buying the gun, Black Friday. When the jury had to believe there were mental issues here, there was ignoring their son, buying a gun, allowing him to use it. And then Monday, researching bullets in school. And then Tuesday, the math drawing where they saw a figure, gun, blood, bullets everywhere, \"My life is useless. The world is dead.\" And they said they had to go back to work. The board asked them to take him out of school, but they said, we'll do it within 48 hours. And the school felt concerned it needed to be as soon as possible. The jury had to look at all of that and weigh in and balancing. They are the triers of fact. And they had to determine that, based on those facts right there, it is beyond a reasonable doubt of guilt for involuntary manslaughter of a parent. The first time in this country.",

You know, I've been pretty firm in my belief that this would be the outcome of this case.I felt we've been very troubled by the actions of Jennifer Crumbley. I was troubled by the fact that she said she advocated the responsibility the responsibility for safety of the gun to her husband after she admitted that she didn't even trust her husband to handle basic household chores. She texted him throughout the day every day, encouraging him to get out of bed, making sure he had cut the grass, acting as if, in many ways, as if she was his mother. So, someone so irresponsible as her husband, yet, she said she gave him the responsibility of safe keeping this gun. In fact, she testified that guns weren't her thing. I was also very troubled by the amount of time she spent with her horses. The fact that she wasn't spending time with her son. I think, for me, as a mother of three kids, the drawing. A day she was called to that school and she was shown that drawing, she spent only 11 minutes in the meeting with those school officials. And at no time during that meeting did she reached out to her son, did you say, son, do you need some help? Can I take you to my job? We know her job said she could've brought her son to work with her. She didn't do the things that you would think a caring mother would do, although her defense was that she was this very hypervigilant, very involved mother. She tried to prove that through these Facebook postings. But it wasn't credible. It was unbelievable. I think the parents sitting on that jury, many of them with children themselves, and know about the dangers that our kids face in schools, know about these really horrific school shootings.
