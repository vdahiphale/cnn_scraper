But this week, the hospital's reputation is on the line. STEWART (on camera): Up to three hospital staff members are being investigated, for trying to illegally access the Princess' private medical records. It's unclear whether the attempt was successful. The British government has made clear, the breach is serious, it could even be criminal. STEWART (voice-over): The U.K.'s data watchdog told CNN it's investigating. And The London Clinic is taking disciplinary steps. The hospital's Chief Executive was ambiguous on the report, saying only that \"in the case of any breach, all appropriate investigatory, regulatory and disciplinary steps will be taken.\" At Christmas, Kate was the Belle of the Ball. But this was her last public appearance. A statement came from Kensington Palace, in January. \"Her Royal Highness The Princess of Wales was admitted to hospital yesterday for planned abdominal surgery,\" adding \"she is unlikely to return to public duties until after Easter.\" In the weeks that followed, speculation mounted. And it didn't dissipate, when the Prince and Princess of Wales posted this photo, on social media, which was found to be altered. An apology from the Princess followed.

I've been there on many occasions in the past. It's a gigantic complex. They then went in, and from what we hear from eyewitnesses, and from the authorities now, they immediately opened fire, on pretty much every one that they saw, at point-blank. And that's where a lot of those videos that we were just showing, obviously originated from. And you can just see the panic there, among the people, who were inside that venue, some of them trying to get away, others trying to hide. There were some scenes of people breaking the glass of the windows, the window facade of that place, to try and get out. At some point, apparently, the assailants also set fire to the building. We saw that large plume of smoke, and the flames coming out, the Russian authorities having to bring in choppers to try and get that blaze under control. So, at this point, while we're speaking about it, at least 60 people, who have been killed and more than 140 have been wounded.

Some of that intelligence was fairly specific, according to one source, familiar with that intelligence, to the point where the U.S., under the duty to warn, in fact warned their Russian counterparts, or at least parts of the Russian government, that there was a potential for ISIS-K to try to carry out an attack. Now, we haven't been able to connect those dots definitively, and to say it was in fact, that stream of intelligence that led to this attack.

In fact, look at this statement, from that embassy outreach, in earlier March. \"The Embassy is monitoring reports that extremists have imminent plans to target large gatherings in Moscow, to include concerts, and U.S. citizens should be advised to avoid large gatherings over the next 48 hours.\" The caveat there, of course, is that we don't know for certain that this bit of intelligence is the attack that we're looking at now. But you also can't ignore the similarities here. Large concerts, the U.S. Embassy warned about, and that's, of course, what was attacked, here. The difference is that was a 48-hour warning that expired, on March 9th. Here, this is two weeks later.

It has to do with the following. There's a social contract between the Russian people and Putin. And it goes like this. Russians give up some freedoms, in order to get the stability and security of a police state. Well, the Russians have been watching, as the Putin administration has been basically systematically getting rid of all political opposition. But hundreds of -- hundreds of forces, Russian forces, security forces doing that. And yet, they can't be kept safe, when they try to go to a concert in Moscow. If I were a Russian, I think Putin is thinking this, I would be saying, what is the FSB, what are the security services doing?

There have been lots of -- a number of different Islamic extremist groups that have tried to attack in Moscow, some with success and some with less success. But one thing is -- one thing seems to me to be clear. Although we can't make a point-to-point connection between the 7th March embassy warning, and what happened today, it's clear that American intelligence had information that there was going to be an attack. The March 7 thing that came out of the embassy was a public, it's anybody could access that, you, me, anybody inside of Russia, if they could have access on the internet. Certainly, the terrorists could have had that. If they had planned an attack, in that 48-hour period, after 7th March, they could have seen the embassy report, and said, well, we need to regroup, because the FSB is going to be ready for us. It's still early. We don't know all the details. But what is clear is that the U.S. had good information on this and passed it to the Russian government.
