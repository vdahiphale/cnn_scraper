Look, President Biden and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau they took an incredibly rare step here by jointly authorizing the shooting down of this unidentifiable object over northern Canada.And I want to walk you through some of these details, because it's kind of a lot, right. This is the third time that we're having to talk about this. So according to the Pentagon, NORAD first really spotted these objects flying over Alaska Friday evening, it then went into Canadian airspace. And so obviously, the Canadians have been synched up with the U.S. over the last week really dealing with these other objects. So they again continue to monitor this new object until President Biden and Justin Trudeau sometime on Saturday hopped on the phone, and basically decided together that the best option here was out of abundance of caution, to shoot down this on identifiable objects. Now this happened, really, ultimately by an American fighter jet, an F-22, shooting down the unidentified object on really about 100 miles from the U.S.-Canadian border here. But you're right, there are a lot of unanswered questions here when it comes to what this object was, what the Friday object was, and of course, what that Chinese spy balloon was doing as it transverse the U.S. And whether or not all these three things are connected. We still didn't even have that information. But the Canadians gave some small details about what they are -- what they were able to see really including that it was more of a cylinder type of format. And then it was smaller than that Chinese spy balloon that we saw just so we could go. If you can see on the timeline here, three instances where we know that President Biden was very much so engaged in order or jointly ordered the shooting down of these objects kind of flying in the sky. So of course, at this moment we're learning or we're waiting to hear more as the Canadian recovery efforts are underway of what they found. And of course, we're still waiting to hear from the Pentagon about what they found on Friday.",

And that's part of the reason why the Pentagon has been so cautious and not giving a lot of -- out a lot of details, because some of the pilots that went up on two separate trips, one trip Thursday evening, another trip on Friday before it was ultimately shot down before 2Those two separate trips, they saw really conflicting things, sources tell CNN. And that includes that some pilots say that the unidentified objects on Friday was kind of messing with their sensors, other said it was it. Some said that they couldn't see the propulsion on it. So it was really unclear how this objects was 40,000 feet in the sky. And others ultimately said that, really, they didn't see any surveillance equipment on it. So these are kind of the reasons why the Pentagon hasn't given so many full details because of just how differentiating these different really -- what the pilot saw were in as this administration really tries to go into factfinding mode. Obviously, that recovery started Friday evening. For the object that was shot down on Friday, the recovery is undergoing in Canada, really trying to figure out exactly what this is, who owns it and why it was over U.S. territory. Boris, Amara?",

In essence, what happens is they partner a mental health screener, a mental health evaluator with a police officer and the effort is to try and get resources as quickly as possible to those in need.We in law enforcement have recognized that there's a need for officers to not wear as many hats as they are currently wearing. As police officers, we're asking to do multi-functions, whether it be screen, mental health circumstances, play referee in some domestic violence instances, all sorts of different things we're asked to do, and it's definitely an overtask. So, in law enforcement, we recognize that there is a need to try and get these resources to the people that need quicker. And this is how, in essence, implemented.",

In law enforcement today, we have to take different angles and different ways of looking at circumstances. But quite frankly, the way that it's been going hasn't been working to its utmost peak.So, what we've done is we put these officers in this situation with this mental health screeners. The feedback I am getting from my officers is great. We just jumped on -- my department just jumped on to this program about two months ago after the Elizabeth Police Department, the Linden Police Department locally by where we are. But it's been great. And what we're doing with this, which is an added bonus, is there is a component where we, in our department, do follow- ups. So, our officers are riding around with a mental health screener for the eight-hour tour. But if there's an instance where there wasn't a mental health call, our officers are being proactive in finding those people who have had previous calls and they are checking in on them, which is unorthodox. It hasn't happened, but it's been very, very positive results. And those people who felt like they were out on an island now have someone, from a law enforcement perspective, as well as a mental health perspective, actually coming in to check on them and letting them know that they're not alone. But the buy-in on that from the patients has been great, and our officers are finding less instances where people are combative because these people are actually appreciative to see the officers at different light, as well as the mental screener at a different light. They are not rolling off to take them away. They're actually rolling up to say, hey, how are you doing? You know, are you OK? Is there anything we can do for you?

You know, we have years and years and years of police officers rolling in, arriving on a scene, and it's just been the officer trying to make that evaluation right there on the spot.What this is doing, this program, is it's getting the resources to people there quicker, and that's the important part to note here. Our officers -- it's going to be a similar response than previous years where, just to give you some context, the previous response would have been if our officers responded to a call of someone with mental health crisis, we would have to basically page out a mental health screener. Now, we have someone on the road in a police car being escorted, driven by a police officer to that location quicker, faster, safer, so that can de-escalate that situation quicker. So, as far as I am concerned, it's a win-win. I hope they implement this through the entire country.

However, farther north, say the Southern Appalachians, portions of Virginia and North Carolina, you are likely to see that snow stick around and stick to the ground in some of those areas. This is going to be a relatively fast-moving system in the next 24 hours, so it'll take the rain and snow, slide it up through the mid- Atlantic before finally going back out over the open water. In terms of snowfall accumulation, the highest is really going to be across those higher elevations of North Carolina and Western Virginia where we're going to be looking at places about four to six inches of accumulating snow. Once you get to the really high areas, then you could be talking as much as a foot. In terms of rainfall, most areas one to two inches. Keep in mind, though, a lot of these areas got rain yesterday so that one to two inches is on top of another one to two inches that they likely picked up yesterday. Wind is going to be a big factor on the southern edge. So, areas of Florida, Southern Georgia, as well as areas of Alabama.
