It's really a difficult job for our people -- soldiers and civilians, mothers, fathers, and children really to fight for their life and for these values. And thank you very much that all these days you are with us. I mean, you and Americans, all of America -- Americans and Congress. I mean, thank you, Mr. President, that you -- like we say, shoulder-to-shoulder with us from those days of full- scale war. We appreciate for this very much. And really, you know, we understand you're leading support, because when you give such messages and when you gave sometimes some weapon -- I'm sorry that I'm -- but I want to say to journalists, like I said during our meeting, our council, that it's very simple, you know, to criticize, for example, clusters ammunition, which you made decision -- difficult political decision. But it's -- but you have to know that Russia used such weapon from the first days, not only full-scale war -- from those days of occupation of Crimea, from 2014 and '15, in all our territories. In Donbas, they used it. And now they continuing doing. And that you gave us -- this decision will help us to save us. And that's why my appreciation for the -- and I didn't hear from all the, you know, parts of the world when Russia began to use it -- I didn't hear that some of, you know, countries criticized Russia, you know? But I think that it was very useful to put them. So, thank you so much for this help. We really counted on it -- not only on this. I mean, this -- totally. And you gave us huge support. I want to thank to all Americans. We understand that it's more than 43 billions for today. It's big support. And I understand that it's all your money, but we have to know that you spend this money for -- not just for fighting, you spend this money for our lives. And the -- I think that we save the lives for Europe and for all the world. So, thank you very much for this also summit. At the end of the summit, we had -- I think this council had great success and security guarantees, as you said, that we began to speak it -- about it in Kyiv. So, now we see that we had -- you had great idea, that G7 -- and now I know that last message (ph) that also there are countries which joined to G7 decisions, and I think it will help very much because it's real effect that -- it's very competitive (ph) things.

And also hearing President Biden say, we're talking about the resilience of Ukrainian people that they set an example for the world of what courage means.And Zelenskyy speaking directly to the American people saying, \"You have to know that what the money that you're spending is not just for fighting, you're spending this money for our lives\". An important moment, a moment of that -- going -- could be an iconic image, an enduring image, at least as a show of support and solidarity with Ukraine as they continue to fight in this war. Let me bring in Arlette Saenz, who's watching this as well, traveling with the President in Lithuania. That was pretty amazing what we saw in the extent with -- the extent of which the leaders let us hear the conversation.",

      "sentences": "Yes, it really was, Kate. And it just shows the type of unity that President Biden has wanted to project with this summit. Yes, there has been tensions and frustrations that have been voiced heading into the summit, as Zelenskyy had been eyeing that concrete time table for NATO membership, he did not get that. But what the President has been trying to stress here is that the U.S. and allies will be with Ukraine in the long term. That's it that we always hear from him. And over the course of this war, that they're in it to help Ukraine win its fight against Russia.But these commitments that we are hearing from the United States today kind of take things to another level, saying that they will be there giving them those long term security commitments, even as they are still waiting for an accession to -- eventual accession to NATO, if they get through all of the reform processes. But you have the two leaders there sitting side by side showing, one, the President that he supports fully Ukraine, that the allies fully support Ukraine, but also words of thanks from Zelenskyy, recognizing how big of an impact the U.S. and allies have been in helping him move forward in this war. And the underlying message in theme throughout this week has been trying to send a direct message to Vladimir Putin that the U.S. and its allies will continue to stand behind Ukraine. And you've seen that even when you think of the fact that the NATO alliance is now expanding as Turkey lifted their objections to Sweden joining making NATO territory even more vast. But today, that is quite the consequential historic moment, as those two men sitting together, voicing support for one another are really as the President is trying to stress to Ukraine that the U.S. and its allies are here for the long run.",

What this means on the battlefield and the -- in the most immediate is a question and what this means for the long term.And a key question that we heard as we as we go, though, Arlette is that, what we heard from -- the question from the pool, which was important, which is, how soon after the war would end with Russia do you want to become a member of NATO? And Zelenskyy did not have the opportunity to respond, though, it did look like he was open to taking questions.",
