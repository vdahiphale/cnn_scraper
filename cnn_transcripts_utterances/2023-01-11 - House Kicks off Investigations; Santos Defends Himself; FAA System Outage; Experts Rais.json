So that was interesting to kind of see these two next to each other.But what we think will be less bipartisan are investigations into Hunter Biden, for example, into the withdrawal of Afghanistan, the border. We know that they're very interested in oversight over the Department of Homeland Security and Secretary Mayorkas. These are some of the targets that they've been telegraphing now for months, let's say even years, right? And we expect them to go pretty hard at that. And, again, this is the meat of what Republicans want to be doing right now in the House. So, we're going to see more and more of this as they continue to ramp this up. And it will take a little time to wrap - to ramp it up. But once they get there, this is what they want to spend their time doing.",
