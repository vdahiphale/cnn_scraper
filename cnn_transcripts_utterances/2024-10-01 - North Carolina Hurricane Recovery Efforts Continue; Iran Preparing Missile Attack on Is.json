And he has defended his comments, saying he's not telling people that are in dangerous relationships to stay in them. That is what he has said in response to those comments that you're referring to. But you paint a picture of Trump, the Trump/Vance ticket, and what that administration could look like for the American people, saying that another Trump term could be dangerous. But when you look at the polls, this is still a razor-thin race. You know there are a lot of Trump supporters in Kentucky. You're a Democratic governor in this red state. Why do you think this is? Why is it so razor-thin, in your view, Governor?",

      "sentences": "Well, we have had decades of partisanship across the country, where, unfortunately a lot of people, part of their identity is party. And where that's fallen in people's identity has probably gotten a little too strong and a little too high.And then there's far too many attempts to define who we are, as opposed to who we're against. I always thought you need to run for something and not against someone. This is Donald Trump's concept of a plan to replace the Affordable Care Act, which would leave millions without health care coverage, versus actually running to get something done, instead of to attack political opponents. But, listen, all these races are hard. They have been all these last cycles. And it just means we need to continue to remind the American people of the differences between these two tickets, the fact that the Harris/Walz campaign has not only strength and intelligence, but empathy and caring, versus the condescension you see on the other side. It seems like every day another video of J.D. Vance condescending towards adults without kids is coming out. Every day, there's another speech by the former president where he shows he's not presidential. Yes, it's going to be far too close, but we need the American people to just see the reality here, to want something better, to want a president that you can put your kids in front of the TV and not worry about what they're going to say. That's what we have got to get back to. And that's what the Harris/Walz ticket will get us back to.",

I went back months later and there was still so much rebuilding to be done. Many of the small towns in Kentucky said these -- the storm was bigger than them. What is your advice to people in the Southeast and what lies ahead for them?",

At the end of 2021, we got struck by our worst tornado disaster ever, 81 dead, hundreds of people with everything they own wiped out, six months later, in the middle of 2022, the worst floods ever in Eastern Kentucky, 45 people killed, thousands of people without homes.There are really three phases in how you go about this. The first is search-and-rescue. It's saving lives. It's making sure you reach people and get them the supplies they need. The second is the stabilization and intermediate housing, where we have got to get everybody to a stable location for a period of months or sometimes even more as we work on the rebuilding step, which is the third. Those tornadoes, we're approaching three years. And I got to tell you, we have gone from building homes to building neighborhoods. We're going to break ground on the city hall in Mayfield. As you move forward, you get a lot of progress. So, it's -- I know it's really hard for folks in the Southeast, when they're looking at everything they owned and nothing is there anymore, how you see a light at the end of the tunnel. But what we have to do is put one foot in front of the other, get them stable, get them in housing, get all of those documents and other things that they need replaced, get them through the FEMA process. And then we begin that rebuilding in earnest. We in Kentucky are here to help in every single way we can, from our travel trailer programs, to the way that we used our CDBG-DR funds and others. Sadly, I know what it's like to see a community that you love, my dad's hometown of Dawson Springs, totally wiped out.",

Our next guest is an artist born and raised in the mountains of Boone, North Carolina, which was hit hard during the storm. Raleigh Adams posted this video of what he saw while driving through his hometown, and you can see the destroyed roads, the downed trees, but through it all, Adams says you could also see the humanity.

We have had a lot of trees that you can see behind me now, these heavily tempered forests that we're so known for in the Appalachian Mountains. We're not accustomed to being hit by hurricanes. So one thing that is causing a lot of trouble with infrastructure are trees in the middle of the roads, and they're large trees too. We're known for some old growth here. You can imagine a tree like this. It's just in my parents' backyard, but you can imagine something like that across a road or a bridge is quite damaging. So, some of the roads are not accessible. And we're still dealing with a lot of chain saws beginning to clean up, trees that are in various locations. And, fortunately, this one's not on my parents' house, but some people weren't so lucky.

We have seen all sorts of trucks, different license plates from different states coming in to help the community. Some people still don't have fresh drinking water, so I have seen a lot of bottled water being distributed. I have seen a lot of coffee and sort of emotional support that is just set up temporarily on the side of the road. [11:50:03] We also have a lot of animals here. Many people in the rural areas are -- they have their livelihoods based in livestock. And so there's a lot of need for that right now. Obviously, people are of first concern. But we have a particularly unique situation here, because we're not accustomed to being hit by hurricanes. It's nothing that we really prepared for. It's nothing that we had a lot of warning for.",
