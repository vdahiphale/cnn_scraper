His opening statements are being made, but the pictures you're looking at right now the judge did allow some pictures to be taken before the opening statements.

      "sentences": "Yes, Kate, I was originally told by Trump advisors that Trump wanted to be there because he wanted a show of force, that he wanted to look the judge in the eye. But it was very clear when he got out of his car, he knew exactly where the cameras were, that this was intended for optics. He not only knew and walked over to the cameras, but he also waited for the cameras to roll.They knew how many seats were pressed inside of that room. They were following closely the judge's ruling, whether or not the hallway was going to have a camera and if there was going to be a camera allowed for opening remarks. And that's because Donald Trump is the master of optics. He wants to play this out in the Court of Public Opinion, not necessarily in the actual courtroom. And I've been asking advisors for months, how are you going to navigate him going to trial, various trials that he is facing, and running a campaign in 2024, which obviously in itself is rigorous. And they really didn't have answer. They told me that they were talking about ways to do so. But it does appear that with this, they have found at least one way to do so, which is turning these trials into somewhat of a campaign event. And I talked to one advisor who almost acknowledged that, saying that, yes, that is what they were doing. Right as Donald Trump was leaving Trump Tower, they put out a statement attacking Letitia James, almost exactly what you would see in a political statement attacking a political opponent. So clearly, this is how they are maneuvering this. It's unclear how it's going to continue. And as we have continued to report, yes, this is helping him with his base when it comes to these legal issues, when it comes to him painting himself as a victim, saying that this is election interference. But what does that actually look like in a general election? We just don't have any idea. And even people close to Trump acknowledge that this kind of constant coverage of Donald Trump could actually be a bad thing for the former president in a general election because of Trump's fatigue, which polling shows is a real thing. But right now, it appears that they are really honing in on this and using it to their benefit as he runs for president again in 2024.",

And so now he's trying to win in the Court of Public Opinion. He's trying to win over the hearts and minds of the American people because there are no cameras in the courtroom, and so the cameras are not going to be able to show what the evidence is. And so he wants to get his story out that's very one sided without people being able to see what's really being presented in court.",

That was only the paperwork, only the forensic accounting that he looked at, not at intent. Is it just harder to prove? Is it not?",

That is a very broad law that an AG can use in a situation like this. There are six other counts here, all relating to falsifying business records, falsifying financial statements, and insurance fraud, and then conspiracy to commit those three offenses.There's two big differences between what's still in play and what the judge has already ruled on. The first one is levels of intent. The count the judge has already ruled against Trump on does not require a high level of intent. It doesn't really require any showing of intent by Donald Trump, so long as his name's on the documents and the money went to him. That's number one. And the second one is what we call materiality. But what that means in real terms is, did these statements, these misstatements matter to anybody? Was there a victim? Was there some loss? Is somebody out of pocket? Again, for account one, which the AG has already won on, Trump is already lost on, materiality does not matter. But for the remaining six counts, it does matter. That's going to be more difficult for the AG to prove.",

And certainly CNN has, you know, a lot of people there. But there are sort of ineffable things that you get just by observing a courtroom a glance, you know, the way somebody is seated, whether or not we're hearing about sort of tis James and her eye contact with or, you know, not with Donald Trump, things like that I think are really important.

It could only impact the courtroom when it sort of veers off into that tips over the balance of, you know, potentially interfering with witnesses when sort of danger comes into play. If he's actually, you know, advocating violence, for example, things like that.You know, we're seeing that aspect of it play out in some of his federal cases about, you know, where to, you know, really rein him in on his First Amendment rights.",

He could continue to -- he's obviously trying to continue to spin the events of his legal cases that are certainly different than what is -- the substance of which is happening in the courtrooms there.He's not sharing with any of his supporters, you know, through fundraising appeals or through his statements that he did lose this first case. So this is at some point, these two competing strategies, I guess, if you will, the politics and the actual legal cases going on there are going to collide here, and there is going to be a real time interpretation of what happens there. At some point, there will be a finding of innocence or guilt in all of these cases. But for now at least, the former president's presidential campaign is simply trying to do one thing, and that is to run out the clock until voting begins and consume all the oxygen in the field so none of his rivals can break through. He is campaigning in early states on weekends. He is in the courtroom today when he certainly does not have to be. So this is part of this campaign. They simply are intertwined. There is no differentiation. There's no daylight between his presidential campaign and his illegal activities, no matter how many times we say that here. So we will just have to see how this plays out, how voters view all of this, how this is sort of explained through conservative media, how they are getting a sense of what is actually happening here. But I think we know. I mean, one thing that we've always known about the former president, I mean, his finances, his stature at Trump Tower as the chairman of the board, if you will, has always been the centerpiece of his identity. If that is stripped away, that could be very damaging to him, at least personally. But politically, who knows?",

We're getting new developments coming out of court. We're going to bring those to you as well.We were also following some important news out of Capitol Hill. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, yes, found a way to avoid a government shutdown hours before that was supposed to set in this weekend. But the way he pulled it off, he worked with Democrats in a bipartisan way in order to avoid that government shutdown, what this now means for his job as speaker. We have new reporting from Capitol Hill on Kevin McCarthy's approach this week. We'll take you there. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [11:22:20] SIDNER: New this morning, we're learning top House Republicans are planning to try to block Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz's attempt to oust House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Gaetz is threatening to file a motion to remove McCarthy this week. It's all happening because the Speaker relied on Democratic votes to pass a short term funding bill over the weekend and avoid a government shutdown. GOP hardliners have been threatening to oust McCarthy if he reached across the aisle, and he did. CNN's Manu Raju joins us now from Capitol Hill. Manu, I hear you have some brand new reporting for us. What is the plan going forward?",

It does look very much like there will be a vote one way or another on keeping Kevin McCarthy as speaker. How do you plan to vote on keeping Kevin McCarthy?REP. ADAM SMITH (D-WA): I haven't decided yet. I mean, first of all, I will listen to our leadership Leader Jeffries and the caucus to figure out what the best approach is. Look, one of the problems, you know, I heard your quote about a member of the Democratic caucus saying they wouldn't come cheap. McCarthy has made it clear that he doesn't keep his promises. He promises whatever he has to get through the moment. And then the second that moment is done, he wipes the slate clean and starts over. So there's really nothing he can quote, promise us that's going to make any difference. I mean, he made a deal on the debt ceiling, on what the appropriations bill should look like and bailed on that the second it wasn't convenient. So promises aren't going to get us there. And for Kevin McCarthy to be talking about protecting the institution, the guy who ultimately sided with Trump and the insurrectionists over January 6th, it's really hard to see Speaker McCarthy as a credible figure in any of this.",

And every time you do that, you know that some members of your own caucus aren't going to like it, but you stand by the agreement because that's how the institution works.Kevin McCarthy does not do that. I mean, he will make a promise to you and he will break it the second it's in his best interest to do that. And so we have to factor that in as we're figuring out how to vote on this. Now, all of that said, as bad a speaker as Kevin McCarthy is, as a friend of mine likes to say, it can always get worse. And we have to contemplate that. What is the alternative? What will happen if McCarthy's not speaker anymore? It's bad enough while he is. We've seen the chaos of the first eight months, nine months, whatever it is.

They're not fully formed at this point because this is an unprecedented situation, but it seems likely that if McCarthy was ousted as speaker, the Republicans -- we would go through an extended period of time without a speaker because the Republicans would have to try to figure that out. How extended a period of time? What are the consequences of not having a speaker? Because as I understand it, the rules of the House are that once you -- if you don't have a speaker, you can't do anything else until you get one. We saw that last January.So vote after vote, after vote, after vote trying to get to 218 for a speaker, what are the implications of that? That's something that I'm weighing as well. But look, again, I want to emphasize Speaker McCarthy brought this on himself. He sided with Trump and the insurrectionists. He's broken his word countless times, and he's governed from the far right. I mean, Democrats are supposed to be excited about a speaker whose plan for the continuing resolution was to cut everything but defense by 30 percent, to cut housing, to cut education, to cut DEA agents, to cut health care by 30 percent. That was his plan. And this is the guy we want running the House. I mean, from my perspective, from a Democrat's perspective, you can see why we would have a problem with that.",
