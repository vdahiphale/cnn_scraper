We know the New York state attorney general, Letitia James, she has attended public events at the White House, and they are trying to misconstrue that as secret meetings to engage in a conspiracy to, quote, get Trump.Now, he's also talking about not being allowed to participate in closing arguments. And he is sort of characterizing this as a refusal by the judge. But CNN has obtained correspondence between the Trump team and the judge here. The judge was open to allowing him to take this very unusual move of participating in closing arguments, but the judge wanted some guardrails, some restrictions. And, John, there's good reason for that, because what we've seen repeatedly during the course of his proceedings, Trump has attacked the judge, the district attorney, members of the court staff. So, the judge said, look, I'm willing to let you participate in closing arguments, but we have some restrictions. You have to focus on the material, relevant facts and not attack your accusers. That's pretty reasonable. But his lawyer, Trump's lawyer, Chris Kise, said this was not tenable and the judge closed the door on this possibility. I fully expect that this issue is probably going to be re-litigated at the top of these proceedings.",

But it has worked for him to a certain extent. Look where he is in the polls. You see all of his followers today, his followers in Congress, his supporters in Congress are tweeting attacks on the judge for not having postponed the proceedings so that he could be with his wife, Melania, who just lost her mom, but the same guy who wanted to be with his wife, Melania, was in Iowa yesterday campaigning. And the same guy who wanted to be with his wife, Melania, was hosting a New Year's party while his wife was in the hospital with her dying mother. So, it seems like it's very selective when he actually wants to be with his grieving wife. So, you know, it does have some effect. This is Donald Trump being Trump.",

That's why nobody is talking. It's a little awkward. So, we at least have some pictures set the scene. You see the former president, he's sitting between his attorneys, Chris Kaise and Alina Habna, and that's the last we're going to see from inside the courtroom. Now, we're going to be relying on our colleagues who are in there giving us live reports.And what we expect is going to happen now is the question of whether former President Trump can participate in today's closing arguments. That I expect will come up at the top because there was some discussion yesterday of whether he would participate in closing arguments, highly unusual. That's why you hire a lawyer for, right, to summarize your case at the end. The judge was open to it, set some pretty reasonable restrictions. He said, look, you can't turn this into a campaign speech. You got to focus on the relevant material facts, and you can't attack people. They did not agree to that. The deadline for negotiations was extended multiple times. Then the judge shut the door on it. But based on what we heard the former president say as he was heading in, I expect they're going to bring this up again, but it's unlikely that he's going to be able to participate.",

This is a concern that we have seen across the multiple cases that Trump is facing because he, of course, will attack judges, attack prosecutors, and we've seen there's some really serious consequences. For example, the federal judge overseeing the election subversion case, Judge Tanya Chutkan, her home was swatted a short time ago, several days ago. We've seen other people face threats.So, when Trump turns his ire, his threats, his bully pulpit on individuals, even when they're judges, when they're public officials, the consequences can be really serious. So, probably best not to bring more attention to that at the top. Now, the question is whether Kise, now that he's at the podium, is going to push the issue of Trump participating. Now, I'm sure Chris Kise would prefer that Trump not participate in closing arguments, but, look, this is what his client wants to do.

But inside those doors, you have rules of evidence, you have rules of procedure. And so the judge basically said, I'll consider it if you abide by the rules of court. And Trump's team did not agree to that, their own choosing. They could have agreed theoretically. They could have said, sure, he'll abide by that.

And so it makes it very difficult.I mean, of course, we've got a lot of different prosecutors, I agree, it's not a good look for Tish James to know, speaking on the courtroom steps. It only adds to this argument that Trump is making, that it is political. It tends to look political. But then you have to think about the actual facts of the case. And as Elie said, I mean, square footage doesn't lie, right? Some of these things are just on paper. It's a paper case to some extent, and the facts don't lie.
