A U.S. official tells CNN the Biden administration has paused a shipment of bombs to Israel concerned about their potential use in the invasion of Rafah. The weapons held back last week include 2000-pound and 500-pound bombs. Meanwhile, the White House is expressing optimism that Israel and Hamas can reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal.But on the ground in Gaza there's only death and destruction. The Israeli military operation in Rafah has killed at least 27 people since it started late Monday, including six women and nine children. An IDF spokesperson says approximately 20 terrorists have been killed so far. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant visited an artillery battery at the Israel-Gaza border near Rafah on Tuesday, where he outlined the IDF's mission. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YOAV GALLANT, ISRAEL DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator): This operation will continue until we eliminate Hamas in the Rafah area and the entire Gaza Strip or until the first hostage returns. We are willing to make compromises in order to bring back the hostages. But if that option is removed, we will go on and deepen the operation. This will happen all over the strip in the south in the center and in the north. We know that Hamas only responds to force. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We know that Prime Minister Netanyahu is feeling pressure at home within the protesters, he's also polling suggesting that most Israelis want him to prioritize getting a deal done to get the hostages home, rather than the military invasion into Rafah.In terms of this shipment, we know this according to reporting from our colleague Oren Lieberman, citing a U.S. official that the Biden administration has paused a shipment of bombs to Israel citing concerns that they will be used in densely populated areas like Rafah. We are talking about a shipment involving some 3500 bombs about half of them are one-ton bombs or 2000-pound bombs. The other half are 500-pound bombs. Now the concern in particular is with these one-ton bombs because they had been used prolifically. According to a CNN analysis done early on in the war by Israel thus far, but they do a heck of a lot of damage. They leave a massive crater, they spray shrapnel hundreds of feet. And so, this is not the kind of precise weaponry that is used to go after one particular person. These are the kinds of bombs that really cause mass damage and that is the concern. And it also comes after the U.S. paused a shipment of ammunition over the weekend to Israel. Now, the U.S. official told Oren Lieberman that look, no final decision has been made on the status of this shipment. And the Pentagon spokesperson says that this in no way affects the U.S.'s ironclad resolve to protect Israel's security or to defend Israel. It is also worth noting briefly, Rosemary, that today is also the deadline that the Secretary of State Antony Blinken has to report to Congress. His determination as to whether the statements made by Israel are the assurances made by Israel that weapons supplied to Israel by the United States are being used in accordance with international law. Blinken needs to certify that those assurances are credible and reliable. Rosemary?",

There have been some 100,000 people ordered to leave part of Rafah but the mayor says that the area that they're going to is inadequate, it simply does not have the infrastructure facilities.It also is lacking a large hospital now because the biggest hospital in Rafah has been deemed by the IDF to be in the conflict zone and has been effectively shut down. The Israelis have insisted that the best way to get the hostages back since the outset of the war is with military pressure. This move in Rafah is obviously putting a heck of a lot of humanitarian pressure on ordinary Palestinians as well. And Hamas made clear yesterday that it's not helping to get a deal. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OSAMA HAMDAN, HAMAS OFFICIAL (through translator): If the aggression continues, there will be no ceasefire, because the Israelis are the ones attacking and shooting.

Involves withdrawal of Israeli troops, involves the return of displaced people. And it also involves an end to the siege. And the wording of that is pretty important, because a diplomatic source who spoke to CNN said that this is essentially a way of Hamas agreeing to a long, prolonged ceasefire or permanent ceasefire without actually calling it a permanent ceasefire, because we know that Hamas will not agree to any ceasefire that is not permanent or effectively permanent.And the Israelis won't agree to any kind of a ceasefire that is permanent.

Putin urging the West to halt military support for Ukraine as he himself continues to send hundreds of thousands of his own citizens to fight there. The Russian military unleashing a massive aerial bombing campaign on Chasiv Yarchess making small gains here on the Eastern Front. It is due to the active use of aviation the Ukrainian commander says. Attack aircraft carrying guided bombs after the upgrade guided bombs began to hit more accurately than before. Thus, it is much harder to influence them with electronic warfare. More than ever, Vladimir Putin's presidency is defined by war greeting his troops as part of the inauguration events. His position strengthened his power and nearly unchecked after a landslide victory in recent presidential elections. Putin has made clear he does not intend to change course or to back down as he continues to steer his country on a confrontation course with the U.S. and its allies.

So, way up there and same story for the warmest sea surface temperatures on record globally. Not everywhere is warm, there are some cooler spots, but with the El Nino in the Pacific and also the very hot areas here in the Atlantic Ocean, yes, the warmest sea surface temperatures globally that we have ever had. This red zone right here, and mainly right up in here, the development region for Atlantic hurricanes, the warmest it has ever been for this date, not the warmest it is going to be in July or August, but we are already starting out very, very warm. In fact, warm enough to probably equal June or July, already into hurricane season, although we haven't had any tropical cyclones here in the Atlantic Ocean yet. But that is likely to come.
