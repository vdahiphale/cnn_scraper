But people take the fruit, and right at midnight, they smash it on the ground as hard as they can.And the more seeds that come out, the better. The more shrapnel there is from the pomegranate, the better the luckier that you'll be in the year 2023. That's the myth. That's the superstition legend. So what I'm going to be doing just before midnight is smashing one of these pomegranates. And I know that's not exactly the rules, but the reason I'm going to do it before is because I need all the luck that I can get, because one of the other popular things that they do here in Turkey is they buy lottery tickets. This is the regular old Turkish lottery. But it is particularly popular on New Year's Eve because the jackpot is absolutely massive. So I've got these tickets to win potentially 200 million lira, which I think works out to about 13, 12, or I think maybe 11 or $12 million.

We have a couple of kids actually on top of cars here, waiting to have vantage points so they can catch the fireworks over the Indian Ocean in about two hours when we hit 12, one hour and 50 something minutes when we hit that midnight hour. And East Africa gets to celebrate New Year's Day in 2023.Back on the stage there, I see a cultural celebration. Mombasa has been having a food festival all day today celebrating Swahili culture. And some of it is because of the connections between the Arab world, the Indian world, and the East African coast. This is Chapati. We had biryani. We had lots of other foods that are native to this region, the Swahili culture along the East African coast. But I think it's going to be a very big party when we start midnight here. Becky?",

They've come from all over the world. Athens is increasingly becoming a much more year round destination. This is what people have been telling us. They choose this place to come for New Year's. And you can really see why, because I think when you're about to go into something new, make that transition, just being under the shadow of the Acropolis, seeing this landmark site that has survived so many millennia, you know, it's gone through so many historic moments and shown so much resistance and resilience, really gives you a sense of place.

Along with that, people will be playing cards. That's not so large amounts of money or anything like that. But again, just for luck, for the New Year. This is something we see a lot across Greece. And we have a special cake. We call it a basil cake. This is a cake that has a coin baked in it. We cut it in families after midnight or the following day, and whoever gets that coin is the lucky person for the year ahead. This is something that children in particular look forward to.And one thing that's very different about Greece so compared to a lot of other parts of the world is that actually we do give a presence on New Year's Day.

We're getting up to about an hour before midnight here, and I can see why people want to be out here to celebrate the New Year, because one poll out today, Becky, said about 50 percent of Kenya's think 2022 has been a terrible year.And I think many people around the world would agree that we've had a lot of grim stories even here on CNN to cover. But the same poll also said 82 percent are optimistic that 2023 is going to be a great year. So being out here in Mombasa symbolically marks the end of 2022, at the beginning of this optimistic New Year that they're hoping for, which I think Ali, too, is looking forward to as, OK, we are doing something here. There -- as lot of -- there's a lot of families here, a lot of kids, right, coming up to 11:00 p.m. but I'm seeing a lot of kids all around who are here with the families and their parents. Look at all these kids back here who come to celebrate the New Year. And the parents have brought them out. I guess they get to stay out late because it's not a school night. It's one day that they can celebrate people from all over the world. Hey, you take a video of me? Come, I can put you on T.V. You want to be on T.V.? You're live on CNN right now. He says he doesn't speak English, speaking to me in English. Anyway, so that's the kind of mood here. People from all over the world come and celebrate. The reason is because Mombasa is a really popular tourist destination in Kenya, in East Africa. It's some of the most beautiful beaches in the world. And so, around the New Year, hotels sell out months in advance and getting a hotel, getting flights into the city is so difficult. That's why you have this diverse crowd from all over the world come in to celebrate the New Year and ring in the New Year with a huge celebration of fireworks, who have been promised in just over an hour.

For our New Year's Eve special, I'm coming to you live from the Attiko Rooftop Lounge here at the W in Dubai, where we have dancing disco balls, let me tell you. We are counting down the seconds here about to bring in 2023 across the United Arab Emirates especially that iconic shot of the Burj Khalifa.Now, let me just tell you, we're a minute 30 away. The Burj Khalifa in Dubai is the tallest building in the world. With over 160 floors and certainly one of the most famed, it's always ready to ring in the New Year. Every year, the lights illuminating around this structure are watched around the country and indeed around the world. A lot of work goes into those preparations, let me tell you, 828 meters of fireworks, 2,500 firing directions, 287 firing positions, 22,000 gallons of water in the air, 344 underwater robots, 145,000 watts of light power, 4,000 watts of lasers. Yet you never thought this was going to happen, did you? Back with me to welcome 2023 is footballing legend Clarence Seedorf. I promised you a good night.",
