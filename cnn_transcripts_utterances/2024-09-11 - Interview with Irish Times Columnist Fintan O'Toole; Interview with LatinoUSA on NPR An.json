Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. President Joe Biden was in Downtown New York today, marking the 9/11 anniversary alongside the next president of the United States. As both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump were there too. Just hours earlier, both of them had been sparring on stage in Philadelphia. The first and potentially the only debate. The former president says he's not sure he wants to do a second one. The vice president, by almost all accounts, managing to make a case for herself and dominating the entire encounter. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Remember this, she is Biden. You know, she's trying to get away from Biden. I don't know the gentleman, she says. She is Biden. The worst inflation we've ever had a horrible economy because inflation has made it so bad that you can't get away with that.",

And so -- and you know this, Christiane, we can't lose it in the middle of a debate and say you're crazy and you're lying, which I think she probably wanted to say. But she has to keep that under control to present herself as presidential. You know, having just been in South Florida talking with Latino and Latina voters who are consuming mis and disinformation that's coming at them pretty quickly through YouTube and other social media and many of them saying that they like what they hear from Donald Trump. And so, watching Donald Trump at the beginning, just kind of in the barrage, just coming, you know, really bullying and coming after her, one of my colleagues said, I'm Venezuelan. I know what a strong man looks like. And that's exactly what Donald Trump is giving. So. I -- it's hard for me to say that she absolutely won the debate hands down because how do you effectively debate with someone -- and I'm going to say this, and I know that people are going to be a little shocked, but Donald Trump is a pathological liar. He lies. Every other sentence is a lie. And so, when you're in a debate like that, you really can't win. What she did do is she did not engage, which is pretty heroic, because I know that I was engaging just from my little perch. I was taking notes and engaging.

I'm against IVF. You know, I'm OK with exceptions. The people who I speak to -- who I spoke to when I was doing this reporting were like, no exceptions. And woman goes to prison if she attempts to have an abortion. What's important to realize, Christiane, and you know this because you've covered it, is that the majority -- I can't say the majority 100 percent, because I don't have the data, but many, many women who are having abortions -- and I had two of them, OK. And I'm OK saying that because I have two adult children. I've been married for 34 years. I'm OK. But many of the women who are having abortions already have children. Many of -- when I was in New Mexico witnessing and reporting on this, who is the first person we saw coming into the abortion clinic in Albuquerque to get an abortion was a teenage Latina girl accompanied by her parents. So, this notion, these lies that women are just like, oh, my God, it's eight months in, I think I'm just going to terminate, that is not how women think. The question is whether or not white women will choose to side with reproductive rights and our choices for our bodies or will they choose to side with fear, immigrants are taking over, the country is going under, and everything is about fear? And that we don't know. That's what we're going to have to see. It could be that because Donald Trump is so extreme that maybe there's some loosening and white women will end up voting for Kamala.",

So, that I would say, I would have liked for the debate to have spent a little bit more time on international issues, on the question of Gaza. And I just have to say that in that moment when Kamala looks at Donald Trump and says this, right, when she looked at him and said it to his face, you are considered a disgrace. On the international scale, this is where people are just like, well, this is going to be the president? This is going to be our president again when it's not just Ukraine, now, it's Gaza? But sadly, she was not able to seal the deal on the question of her position on Gaza.

But what we do know is that violent crime has plummeted in the United States over the last 30 years by about 50 percent. And we also know, according to the Congressional Budget Office, that the U.S. economy has grown steadily over the past 20 years. So, what was strange, Christiane, was to hear a legitimate question being asked about January 6th, right? What I call the beginning of the perpetual state of attempted coup d'etat in the United States, which I believe we are still living in until Donald Trump accepts the results, assuming he loses in the election. And at that moment, you know, we needed to see how he was going to respond, and instead, he said, you know what, January 6th, what's happening at the border? And he was like, what are you talking about? There has not been a violent crime by immigrants. And, Christiane, yes, you and I were both working at CNN 24 years ago -- 23 years ago here in New York City. And I reported on undocumented immigrants giving their lives. But the truth is, is that the American economy, over the past 23 years, with undocumented immigrants has grown and crime has decreased. Those are the facts.

How is that going to play out in Europe, Fintan? O'TOOLE:  I think you're absolutely right. It's a key question. You know, the experience has been -- I mean, even if you leave aside, again, the ethics of it, the experience has been that trying to tack to the right, you know, to see off the far-right by addressing their concerns, so-called, is a total political failure, you know. So, what happens when center right and even center left parties move there is they just legitimize and normalize xenophobic rhetoric that the kind of lying that Maria has been talking about, these tropes that Trump is using, of course, are saturating European politics, identifying migrants with criminality. You know, the -- I mean, let's -- you have a former and potentially future president of the United States using Nazi rhetoric about the poisoning of our blood.

First -- let me just first ask you, because, you know, probably American audiences are muchmore aware of the history, and maybe react in a certain way. Did you notice a difference between the American audiences and the London audiences? J. HARRIS:  You know what's funny is that I think that I was told that I would, that there would be this wildly different thing, but I mean, a wildly different response. And yet, you know, the play is about British people as well, one of the lead characters is British from the get-go. And this is a history that, I think, you know, a lot of Brits like to feel separate from, but like, you know, I've been to Liverpool. I've been to Manchester. I know that like a large part of this country's wealth and it's like sort of dominance came from its relationship to slave trade, even if they don't talk about it as often, right? So, I think that like people being able to have a safe place, which the theater is, to like, sort of interact with these ideas has made them have a very similar response to the American audiences, which is to laugh, to cringe, to cry, to like scream out, to like be disgusted, to say they hate the play in the same way that Americans said they hated the play, say they love the play in similar ways the way that Americans said they loved it. And that's been really cool, to see that this play that could be like considered a very like American work has this echo and translation across the pond.",

And they're not tickets that are in the nosebleeds, they're tickets right in the middle, like three seconds away from Jon Snow himself, you know. That, for me, has always been a cornerstone of my process to the chagrin of many investors around the West End and Broadway who want to make sure that people will still pay $300 for their shows, $400 for their shows. In my mind, I think that like, I would rather see a play run for a long time in a lot of different cities, in a lot of different countries for an average ticket price of $50 to $75 than have one play run for six months at like a $400 ticket price.

And so, I believe that we are now at kind of this precipice where, you know, it will change. It will look different, but still honoring the history and the incredible legacy that the organization has. And certainly, obviously, you know, supporting our Mexican American community, but also Peruvians, Colombians, Venezolanos, all Latinos. And that's really what we stand for, is all Latinos.",
