      "sentences": "That's absolutely right. And that's why those stories of survival are really becoming rallying cries in some waysfor many people across Turkey. They're those glimmers of hope those little bits of survival that are really keeping people going, they keep playing these images on television, of people still being pulled out. And as you said, this is a rare and beautiful exception when we see it. But overwhelmingly all across that quake zone, people are simply waiting to get the bodies of their loved ones and prepare to bury them, prepare to lay them to rest. They just want to give them that final dignity of putting them in the ground. And they're pleading with authorities really, who are now stretched thin and overwhelmed to retrieve these bodies, again, from under the rubble, many, many thousands their entire families are wiped out. I just want to give you a number and update here on how the Turkish authorities are handling the other part of this crisis of course, which is the homeless, right? Tens of thousands hundreds of thousands in fact, now made homeless whether that is because their homes have collapsed or they're simply too scared to live with them. Now they're on the streets, Turkish authorities saying they've been able to evacuate just over 75,000 people out of this quake zone into areas of relative safety. I say 75,000, it sounds like a big number. But that is only a tiny fraction of the people who need help immediately. We heard just recently from President Erdogan who has vowed to pay the rent of any victims for a year he said we're going to cover your rent if you need to stay in apartment, we also have hotels. The authorities are also setting up tents in these quaint zones. We understand 140,000 tents have been shipped in President Erdogan also making this remarkable promise to rebuild the entire area in just a year. I think it's hard to fathom that that could take place but very much right now. He is a President who is facing the anguish and grief of his own people and they are demanding answers. How was there so much loss of life? When you look at the video of the quake zone, when you look at the images of those buildings completely pancaked, completely collapsed, questions are being raised. Were these buildings safe enough to live in? Could life have been saved? President Erdogan trying to address those questions and trying to meet the demands of hundreds of thousands right now who need help?",

There is so much here for the Turkish authorities to sort out. That question you're asking, that's the same question being asked on the ground. And I do not think we have answers here. Yes, there are multiple operations going on here. Right, you have the operation to pull out survivors. Remarkably, we are still seeing people being pulled out alive that are ongoing. Then there's the operation to retrieve bodies. Remember, we have countless bodies under these buildings. That's one operation, then there's the other operation to try to find shelter for hundreds of thousands of people who have been made homeless in the very bitter winter cold. And then there's the operation to try to provide the long term support for this humanitarian crisis. There is a great deal going on here and only entering the fifth day, again of this catastrophe. There are still so many things that need to be sorted out by the Turkish Government. And you really sense that anger not just in the earthquake zone, but all across Turkey.",

What is significant about the Netherlands is that they are decommissioning their F-16 program that maybe opens the door for Ukraine to access those fighter jets. But the Netherlands and other allies are holding back for now on providing Ukraine with the sophisticated weapon systems. They say in part because that it's a complex system. The F-16 is not just the plan, you need the support, you need the training to get them in the air here in Ukraine, but not ruling it out, according to an affiliate of CNN who spoke to the Defense Minister there, he said all of these requests by Ukraine are taken very seriously. But it is significant that they're not saying no. And up until now, even with weapons system that seemed inconceivable at the very start of this war around a year ago. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has been very persuasive and getting allies to give them what they want.

Many of these missiles say the Air Force were in fact down by air defense systems. That's a significant one. They say more than 70 were fired at this country and more than 60 were, in fact brought down not reaching the target. But there were several strikes on energy infrastructure. And this has been a pattern, Rahel, of the Russians to target civilian infrastructure. According to the Ukrainians that has done significant damage. Overall, it's been pretty remarkable that they've managed to keep the power on in large parts of the country. And you ask the question, what's the impact? Well, they've had to have planned outages to deal with potential shortfalls, as well as emergency outages in areas where coal and thermal and hydro plants might have been struck at this stage. The Ukrainians have been successful in limiting the damage today, but it does point to this strategy to try and cripple the grid of the Russians continuing, Rahel.",

Russian crude oil regularly sells at a discount of more than 30 percent compared to Brent. And even if this production cut does succeed in pushing the price up, which is obviously the goal here; it still has the price cap to contend with. But remember, it's not imposed on countries; it's imposed on Western shipping and insurance companies. So even third party countries that maybe don't care about the war in Ukraine, don't care how much they're paying for Russia now? Even they will find it very difficult to pay more than $60 per barrel for Russian crude oil, which is what that price cap is actually set out. Of course, that's the goal here for Europe and for the West to try to choke Russia, off of its funding for the war in Ukraine. And in some ways it succeeded. The Russian budget deficit hit $45 billion last year, though, in other ways, maybe it's not so clear, considering the IMF is forecasting that the Russian economy will grow ever so slightly this year.
