But this is just one component of actually what is combined to be the worst affordability crisis in housing that we've seen for four decades. You have sky high - relative sky-high mortgage rates. You also have a lack of supply of homes on the market. Then you also have actually near record home prices, too. Combine all those things, you've got a triple whammy that's having a pretty devastating effect.Let me just show you, to your point, what mortgage rates have looked like over the last few years. Now, if you were lucky enough to lock in rates of August of 2021, well done. Let's say your mortgage repayment was $1,000 there. Today, your option is paying double that, even for above income -- average income families. That's a huge whack. So, you understand the problem here. Now, it's great -- let's be clear if you're a homeowner. But if the big American dream is to own your home, perhaps leave that money to your kids one day, that's getting further and further away and it doesn't really change until the Federal Reserve starts to bring rates down, these things ease, people start to sell their homes, and that's going to take some time.",

You know, after last year where we saw those scary injury to Damar Hamlin and Tua Tagovailoa on the field, you know, just really hoping that everyone has a safe and healthy season this time around, but the cart did have to come out on the field twice in last night's Eagles/Bowns game, both for neck injuries. The first happening here. Tyrie Cleveland, his head slams into the ground while he was trying to make that catch. So, the cart came out and took him off the field. Then later defensive lineman Moro Ojomo, he was chasing down Kellen Mond here. But while making the diving play, his head hit his teammate causing it to get bent back. Both scary moments. But the good news was, the team announced that both players had movement in their extremities afterwards. All right, the NBA, meanwhile, announcing their regular season schedule yesterday. The Brooklyn Nets borrowing a page from the Tennessee Titans' hilarious video from earlier this year. They went to Coney Island and asked tourists to name that logo. And, well, watch how it went.
