So we've had some factions, some commanders from within the organization confirming to CNN that they were behind the attack, but then the official spokesperson put out a statement saying that they would never attack a mosque and that they weren't behind it.What we do know is that the Pakistani government had a ceasefire with the Pakistani Taliban in November of last year. That's fallen apart. And since then there has been an incredible increase in attacks in Pakistan. So, cities like Islamabad where I am, and Peshawar, which isn't too far away, have been on high alert since the beginning of the year. There was an attempted attack -- suicide attack in the heart of the capital at the end of December and now this in a police compound in one of the most secure parts of the city of Peshawar, which is no stranger to such attacks but which hasn't seen these kinds of attacks in the past couple of years. It's a horrible, horrific sense of deja vu for the people of Peshawar. They've been burying their dead overnight. Funerals are continuing into the day today. There are still rescue efforts -- well, actually search operations taking place in the rubble of that mosque where we've been told by police officials that a suicide bomber walked in with about 12 kilograms of explosives strapped onto him and then exploded himself, which we ended up seeing and hearing from eyewitnesses. They said that they saw a huge burst of flames, dust all around them, and then the ceiling crashed in. So these are big numbers -- one of the deadliest attacks that has happened in Pakistan in the past couple of years. Pakistan is no stranger for the past two decades to these kind of attacks taking place within their country. And Pakistan's prime minister hasn't really named the Taliban. He's been accusing for the past couple of months the Ogran (PH) Taliban for harboring the Pakistani Taliban for providing them with safe havens to carry these attacks on Pakistani soil. The Pakistani prime minister said yesterday that terrorism is once again the biggest threat to Pakistan's security. And that is something of concern here for Pakistanis and for the people in the region -- Christine.",
