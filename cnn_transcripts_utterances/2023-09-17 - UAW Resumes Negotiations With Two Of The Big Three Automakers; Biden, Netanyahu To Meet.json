I'm Fredricka Whitfield.Striking autoworkers and representatives from two of the big three carmakers are coming face to face today in a new round of talks. The historic strike is now in its third full day. Today's talks are expected to be with Ford and General Motors. The UAW said it had, I'm quoting now, \"reasonably productive talks,\" end quote, when it met with Ford yesterday. And for the first time ever workers are striking at plants from GM, Ford and Stellantis all at the same time. Workers say they want big pay raises and other benefits after years of concessions during rough times for the industry. The carmakers say despite big profits in recent years the raises being demanded would drive them out of business. CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich is at a Ford plant in Wayne, Michigan. Vanessa, just moments ago you spoke with House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, who was at the plant today, and what did he say?",

But it comes at a time when the president has tried to stress the alliance building that he has done during his time in office. And in that speech on Tuesday to the U.N. General Assembly the president is expected to talk about America's leadership on the world stage and the need for countries to work together.That's something we've heard from him when he had traveled to the G7 Summit in Lithuania over the summer. And the president is also set to have a number of leader meetings, including with the presidents of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan on Tuesday, and meeting with the U.N. secretary-general. But some of the closely watched meetings will come on Wednesday where he will sit down with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The first time the two men will be meeting since Netanyahu came to power last year. There had been some questions about whether there would be any type of meeting, especially as the Biden administration and the president have expressed some concerns over the judicial reforms that Netanyahu's government has been trying to make. But ultimately they've decided to have the two leaders, long-time allies, to sit down on the sidelines of UNGA. Now he will also be meeting with President Lula of Brazil on Wednesday and then the president heads back here to Washington. And on Thursday he will host Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy here at the White House. You'll remember Zelenskyy came to the White House last year as that war against Russia continues to rage on. But it comes at a critical time as the president is trying to get additional aid for Ukraine passed up on Capitol Hill, but he's running into resistance from many House Republicans. So that is potentially an item that will be discussed over the course of the week as the president is continuing to try to drum up support for Ukraine as that war continues.",

They say that they're consolidating some of the gains that they've made in the east of the country around Bakhmut, especially south of Bakhmut.And there was some pretty remarkable video that came out from the Ukrainian forces showing them advancing through the settlement of Andriivka, and you know, the place can probably best be described as looking like a moon scape with this utter destruction that we see there. It's a very small settlement to begin with but certainly the houses that we can see on that video absolutely reduced to rubble. The Ukrainians also saying, the ones that are operating in that area, the Russians are now firing a lot of artillery towards that place, obviously trying to stop the Ukrainians from advancing any further. Nevertheless the Ukrainians say for them this is a very important tactical gain that they've made. But of course it's also important for Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as he's about to head to the United States both to go to the U.N. General Assembly and to speak with President Biden as well. And the Ukrainians say for them they obviously want more longer range weapons from the U.S. and its partners, but they also say that immediately they need a lot more ammunition, especially artillery ammunition and ammunition for the HIMARS. In fact we were able to speak to the deputy defense minister of this country and she told us that there are areas on the front lines where the Russians are able to fire 10 projectiles for every one that the Ukrainians can fire. So a big mismatch and all that as the Ukrainians are trying to advance. Nevertheless, Kyiv says that by and large they believe that their counteroffensive while a lot slower than many had predicted and certainly a lot slower than they would hope for, they believe there is a degree of success because the Ukrainians are the ones putting pressure on the Russians across the front line while the Russians are on the defensive -- Fredricka.",

So of course this is a department that is now grieving and extremely heart broken by this loss. But I also want to point out that this is not the first time this happens. Just three years ago here in L.A., there were two sheriff deputies ambushed and killed while they were in their patrol car waiting at a train station.

I've worked very closely with him for the better part of a decade. And I've gotten the chance to obviously know him very well.

It doesn't mean that you don't do what you can to try, as I said, move the needle. But I think more on the issues, Fred, that's where we're going to find his leadership. I mean, one great example is on entitlement reform where all Republicans basically have said, look, we're not going to do anything about Medicare and Social Security. He's essentially said we can't have that position, it's not sustainable. So I think you're going to see on these key issues he cares about like the debt, like how we continue to deal with the challenges from China, like climate change. There's an issue, Fred, no Republican ever talks about.
