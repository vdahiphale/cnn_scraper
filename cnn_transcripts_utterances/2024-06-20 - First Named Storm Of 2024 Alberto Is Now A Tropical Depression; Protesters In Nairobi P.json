It makes that heat last longer, more frequent. And that's why we're dealing with such extreme heat so early in the season. When you look at the heat across the globe, you see the usual hot spots around the equator, which we typically do see, especially today, actually, when we hit that astronomical start to summer in the northern hemisphere. And we've got a couple of heat domes that are responsible for some of this heat as far as weather goes, but we know that climate is fueling this heat, again, to be more extreme and last longer. One of the spots we've been watching some extreme heat temperatures in the '40s in New Delhi, parts of India. The problem here is that their monsoon season is starting a little bit slow, so that's letting that extreme heat bake a little bit more before the rain and the relief comes in. Another part of the world that you mentioned was the Middle East, where some of this heat has been deadly. I mean, we're talking about some of the hottest temperatures ever recorded in this part of the world, with temperatures up at 50 degrees in Kuwait City, Baghdad, also nearing 50 degrees, so just incredible. This is extreme heat. This is deadly heat. And we know that this heat was made at least four to five times more likely because of climate change. You can see these deep reds across the Middle East here where we're finding some of that deadly heat. We've also been talking about a lot of heat in Eastern Europe the last couple of weeks, right? Athens had problems with tourists. That also, again, made more likely because of climate change. In the U.S., we've been talking about heat this week. You can see some of these signals, as well. Maine broke temperature records, all-time records, and that was made at least two to three times more likely. You can see there in the orange as we broke some of those records yesterday. So, basically what's happening is we're warming our average temperatures. When you warm an average, right, that's normal. Well, if warm is going to become normal, then what's hot going to be and what's really hot going to be? So, you see that the extremes are just getting hotter and hotter because what used to be normal in the middle is now shifting to the hot side. So, it just lets that extreme heat, again, be hotter, last longer, become more likely, and this is what we're looking forward to in the next couple of decades if we don't cut back those emissions.

But as the evening has worn on, it's become a lot more tense, and they're being a lot more heavy-handed in making sure that they don't get any closer to the National Assembly, also because the Kenya police has put out a statement this evening saying that they will not entertain any attempts to occupy parliament or any other government buildings across the country, because we've seen these anti-taxation protests all across the country. So, right now here, just hundreds of meters away from Kenya's parliament, you see that fire that's been lit there, all these officers with a water cannon truck trying to make sure they don't make it to the National Assembly.

And, of course, that has triggered a lot of debate in the country. Granted, this came in the context of a very prolonged seventh review of Kenya's program with the IMF. And one of the things that stood out in that program with the IMF is that Kenya has been failing to meet its revenue targets.

And therefore, we have had a lot of challenges when it comes to elevated inflation, especially eroding the purchasing power of households. And that has impressed many Kenyans. If you look at statistics from the National Bureau of Statistics, real earnings have been declining for about four years straight.

And I'm wondering politically how relevant these cases are for voters out there who are yet to be undecided, factoring in that Monday will be the two-year anniversary of the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Was this a calculated and a smart calculated move viewed by Democrats on the part of President Biden to speak out against the Supreme Court? LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  I think that more and more Democrats want to hear language like that and an argument like that from President Biden because they believe that it could motivate their base come November. Because Democratic voters, as well as moderate voters, some who, you know, live in the suburbs, women, are voters that Democrats think could be motivated by reminding them about the overturning of Roe v. Wade at the hands of the Supreme Court, as well as other issues that have come before the Supreme Court and really making the Supreme Court more of this wedge issue for their voters the way we've seen Republicans do in recent election cycles.

And then even with the whole sort of delay with the decision regarding presidential immunity, a lot of people look at that and say, well, is the Supreme Court acting in a way that benefits Republican interest? Because the longer you wait until there is a decision, then the longer there's going to be a delay in terms of there being a trial, as well. That obviously benefits Donald Trump. So, just give us your take on that. BARRON-LOPEZ:  Well, polling shows that trust in the Supreme Court is at an all-time low. Voters that I've talked to don't necessarily trust it. They're questioning its credibility. They're questioning the Supreme Court's political motivations. For so long, the Supreme Court has been seen as this co-equal branch of government, which it is, but is one that is supposed to be built on impartiality. And no longer do Americans view it that way. And then on that second point that you made in terms of the presidential immunity case for this January 6th overturning of the election case, criminal case that Trump is facing, yes, there are a lot of questions about why it's taken so long. The Supreme Court moved a lot faster when they had to hear whether or not Trump should be allowed to be on Colorado's ballot. They moved much more quickly in determining that when it was brought before them versus this question of whether or not he has overarching immunity. And even if they end up ruling against Donald Trump and saying, no, you don't have absolute immunity based on your actions surrounding January 6th, by the time they do it, it may be too late essentially for Jack Smith, the special counsel, to get this trial going and to be able to have the trial done before the November election.

The headlines from his trip toPyongyang splashed across front pages here in Seoul with the new mutual military defense treaty that we're still parsing through. But now he's in Vietnam, and that trip is significantly different from what we all saw, the pageantry in Kim Il-Sung Square in Pyongyang. And, you know, when we're talking about, when we're trying to analogize his neighborhood Asia trip, when you think of a neighborhood pariah where you live, if the neighborhood pariah does something terrible, make no mistake about it, something that that pariah might do is go from home to home after the fact to say, you know, are we okay? Are things still good? So, obviously, North Korea is a reasonable home to stop in at. Vietnam, also a logical move for Vladimir Putin's chess piece. And here's why, Bianna and Zain. A full 70 percent, or I should say up to 70 percent, of Vietnam's military hardware comes from one place and one place only, and that is Russia. So, Vietnam is not a country that will loosen or will lose its ties with Russia any time soon. There's a giant oil field in Vietnam that's a joint project with Russia, as well. Communist leaders in Vietnam waxing poetic all day today about their fond memories of being educated, studying and learning communist ideology for many years in Russia. And then, of course, we can't forget the history of the USSR being one of the first nations in 1950 to recognize North Vietnam, helping North Vietnamese in their fight against the French and the Americans for years. But Vietnam is being very careful, the rhetoric certainly very different, where we heard Vladimir Putin denouncing the imperialism from their point of view of the United States. Vladimir Putin's rhetoric much softer because Vietnam prides itself on being a non-aligned nation, courting President Biden, hosting President Xi Jinping of China, in addition to Vladimir Putin, now, in very rapid succession. So, Bianna and Zain, I would say that the key thing to watch is how Vladimir Putin leaves Vietnam. With what deliverables does he leave? Now, with North Korea, we have the new treaty, this new era of bromance. But if Vladimir Putin leaves Vietnam with just like, all right, that was fantastic, and President Lam says, all right, well, don't worry, we'll call you, bye, without too many deliverables, that certainly can be perceived as a hollow visit. We need -- our Vladimir Putin certainly is hoping that he brings home more deliverables to his domestic audience to try to convey that he has more friends on the international stage and is not as isolated as the West is portraying him and Russia to be. Bianna and Zain, let's send it back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

But over 70,000 tickets have been sold for this one. This storied Copa America, a tournament that goes all the way back to 1916. And there's really nothing left for Messi to win in the game. Let's be honest. We had hundreds of fans outside the team hotel earlier in the week. They're staying in the heart of downtown Atlanta. Fans quickly got wind of that. And it's been a procession monitoring the team's every movement, trying to get to training sessions as well some miles away. But Messi's won it all. He's won it all with his club, of course, over the years, his clubs over the years, huge success. But it wasn't until 2021 that he finally won the Copa, his first major international tournament for his country. So, he wins the 2021 Copa America. And then a year later, he wins the prize, the coveted FIFA Men's World Cup, the 2022 version in Qatar. So, the pressure's off. Yes, this could very well be his last ever major tournament for the Alba Celeste, his country. He scored 108 goals and counting, as well, for Argentina. He's the one everyone wants to watch. And ahead of the tournament, we've been hearing from the Alba Celeste head coach, Lionel Scaloni, who's been talking about the potential of seeing Lionel Messi and another great Argentinian player, Angel Di Maria, potentially playing together for the last time for their country in a major tournament. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LIONEL SCALONI, ARGENTINA MANAGER (through translator):  On the contrary, I am not worried. I say it doesn't make much sense to be thinking about when they are gone. We're talking about them so much, but let's just enjoy them. That's the most important thing. The football world, not only the Argentinians. I think they have to enjoy these guys, these players.
