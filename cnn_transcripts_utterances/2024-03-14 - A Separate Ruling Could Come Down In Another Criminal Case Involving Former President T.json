They were not his. They were clearly national security records. No way would they be personal. And Prosecutor Jay Bratt told the judge, even with other former presidents, there was never a situation remotely similar to this one. The prosecutor even brought up that meeting in Bedminster, New Jersey, where Donald Trump said to people who were not members of the federal government, who did not have security clearances, talked about a classified document and lamented how he wished he could declassify it.

And that's essentially what Chuck Schumer just did on the Senate floor. It is also significant because Schumer not only is the highest-ranking Jewish member really ever in the United States, but also the first Senate majority leader who's Jewish and has been aligned with some of the more hawkish Israel policies for some time. Back in 2015, he was one of the most prominent critics of the Barack Obama struck Iran nuclear deal, voting against that at that time as Netanyahu came to Congress and tried to lobby members to kill that Iran nuclear deal. That time and other times as well, Schumer has been on the side of Netanyahu. But at this point in the war, with growing concerns about how it's been waged and fears about that this will just carry on without the humanitarian relief that is needed for all the people who are suffering now in Gaza, Schumer is hearing a lot from his own caucus, from his own party and the President, too, as well. He's mentioned he's going to Michigan as a state that more than a hundred thousand people in the Democratic primary voted \"uncommitted\", even though Biden essentially had nominal opposition in his primary. Why? Because of their concerns about his handling with the Israel-Hamas war. The question now is how will Joe Biden respond? We know how Republicans are responding. You heard Mitch McConnell there. And right now at this moment, the Speaker of the House called a hastily arranged press conference, Bianna, to rail against Chuck Schumer. So, this is rallying Republicans. Will it rally Democrats? That's another question. We'll see how the White House and others respond to this call for Netanyahu's removal. Bianna.",

Should he address the protest vote directly? And if so, what should he say? Well, I think Biden needs to because Michigan is one of the five most critical states in the upcoming presidential election. He -- Biden won Michigan very narrowly in 2020, and he can't afford any slippage heading into this set of elections. And so, if there's any sort of unrest within the Democratic Party and some of those voters either don't vote or choose to vote for Trump, then that will hurt Biden's ability to win Michigan and win the presidential race overall. And it's not just about, though, the Democratic Party. I think it's independent voters who see the videos and the pictures that are coming out of Gaza, and they're concerned, as well.

The other incidents, like the LATAM 787 issue, like the wheel falling off of a 777 leaving San Francisco just last week, another 777 operated by United Airlines trailing hydraulic fluid as it was leaving Sydney this week, those things are primarily one-off incidents. And so, it does seem to be that there is a perception problem that the public has when it comes to thinking that Boeing airplanes are constantly and consistently the only airplanes that have issues. A lot of these things happen on other airplane types all of the time without much fanfare, but now they have risen to the top because of this one really significant, really dramatic, really dangerous issue back in January, and now Boeing is scrambling to course correct here. That will take some time. But aviation, to point out, is so incredibly safe, especially here in the U.S. The last time that there was a fatality onboard a U.S. commercial airliner was back in 2018. That was one person in a freak accident on a Southwest Airlines 737 when part of the fan blade of the engine came off, hit the cabin, and killed that woman on board. The last time there was a fatal commercial airplane crash where everybody died in the U.S. was back in 2008, the Colgan Air crash, which led to really significant changes when it comes to pilot training and experience requirements. So, there has been so much that has changed, and aviation is so incredibly safe. I would say to passengers who are worried about what they see right now, sure, these things are freak incidents, sure, it is interesting to look at, but it's really not a big change.
