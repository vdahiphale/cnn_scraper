We'll take you inside the heated arguments that happened today. Plus, the White House is hopeful that negotiations, between Israel and Hamas, for the release of the hostages are quote, \"close to the end.\" The aunt of a 3-year-old Israeli-American, being held in Gaza, who sure hope so, will speak with us, in moments. And a tech titan's sudden ouster has upended the world, of artificial intelligence. The shakeup leaves the future of OpenAI, in doubt, tonight, with more than half of its employees, threatening to walk out. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, we are closely watching a decision that could come down, at any moment, and would have significant consequences, for the criminal defendant, and presidential candidate, Donald Trump. Three federal judges, right now, are deciding whether to keep or get rid of a gag order, in that criminal case, in Washington, D.C., accusing him of plotting to overturn the election. When it was in place, it restricted his ability, to directly attack the Special Counsel, members of his team, court staff, and maybe most importantly, potential witnesses at his trial. Americans actually got to listen in on these arguments, today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) D. JOHN SAUER, TRUMP ATTORNEY: The order is unprecedented, and it sets a terrible precedent for future restrictions on core political speech. JUDGE PATRICIA MILLETT, D.C. CIRCUIT COURT: This is only affecting the speech temporarily during a criminal trial process by someone who has been indicted as a felon. No one here is threatening the First Amendment broadly.

And I can say with certainty that the First Amendment, free speech, is by far the hardest, to figure out, because everyone, in America, regardless of citizenship status, is entitled to free speech. No one is entitled to threaten anybody else. But the line between those two can be very complicated. And particularly, when you're dealing with candidates for office, it is just incredibly complex. And the judges, today, who were very exceptionally bright individuals, all three of them, I know them a little bit, in town here, were really struggling with that.

I mean, as we're waiting to see what these judges are going to decide, as you heard Elliot talk about, part of this centered on, he's been attacking potential witnesses, in this case, Mike Pence, Bill Barr, General Milley. It's kind of in Trump's DNA, to do that. He often does it in very personal terms. But if the panel rules against him, do you think he'd be able to help himself here?",

I mean, we saw what happened, on January 6th, when Trump put so much pressure, on Pence, that it literally unleashed a mob, seeking his execution. And Trump, just a couple of months after that, told me that the mob was chanting \"Hang Mike Pence\" because they were angry. And he had absolutely no criticism, whatsoever, of the people calling for the execution of his Vice President. So no, I have a hard time, imagining that even with a gag order that Trump won't test the limits, of that gag order.",

And by the time you got to January 6th, there were very few people left, to challenge the President. But there were a few. There were people, like White House Counsel, Pat Cipollone, who tried to keep him, from doing things that were blatantly illegal. Of course, gone shortly before January 6th, but Bill Barr, at the Justice Department, and Jeffrey Rosen, who replaced him. The thing is, I believe, based on the reporting, in this book, that a second Trump term begins with all of those people, who would have kept him in check, who did keep him, at least partially in check, in those final days of his presidency, would be gone. They wouldn't be there. They're going to hire for loyalty. As one of Johnny McEntee's top aides, back then, has put it more recently, that loyalty is more important than policy. You can teach policy. But you can't teach loyalty. They are going to make sure that this is not a team of rivals, not a team of people, supporting the Constitution, first and foremost. But a team of people, supporting, at all costs, Donald Trump.",

And Trump didn't want to hear about it. Just wanted to -- berated her, over the phone. \"You want help from me? You want me to help you, after you voted for Joe Biden?\" So that's the attitude. It's loyalty above all cost. It is loyalty above policy. It is loyalty, not to the Constitution, or to the country, but loyalty to Donald Trump.",

He admires these strongmen leaders, whether it be Putin or President Xi, or Kim Jong Un, or Viktor Orban, in Hungary, the newly-elected soon-to-be-leader of Argentina. There's an incident that I wrote about that I -- that had never come to light before. At the very end of the Trump White House, the leaders of the Army put out a statement. This is the Chief of Staff of the Army, and the Secretary of the Army, put out a statement.You remember, when Michael Flynn had come out, and called for martial law, or suggested there could be martial law, to rerun the election? And the leaders, the active-duty leaders, of the Army, put out a very simple statement, saying there is no role, for the U.S. Military, in determining the outcome of an American election. Very basic and fundamental statement. There's no role for the U.S. Military in determining the outcome of an election. Trump was infuriated, and directed his man, Johnny McEntee, to make sure that that never happened again. McEntee reported back to him that he had spoken to the Secretary of Defense, who spoke to both those Army leaders, and assured him it would never happen again. And if it did, they would both be fired. I think that Trump, in a second term, kind of fancies himself, as somebody that will be the commander, not just of the Executive branch, but the Military, the Commander-in-Chief, but not in a way, and the traditional sense that we've seen presidents, but that they will respond to him, on all things, including things, domestically.",

We've been speaking to Israeli officials, regularly, about how fluid these talks are, where they're going. They've been urging a lot of caution. But what we do know is that the pressure, on the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is only growing more intense, tonight. The families of Israeli hostages met with him, and his War Cabinet, earlier. They want answers and a written commitment to bring their family members home. 3-year-old Abigail Edan is the youngest-known American hostage. Her parents were killed, in the October 7th attacks.

On a bigger level, and I'll wrap up here, we should all hope that the Board was wrong.
