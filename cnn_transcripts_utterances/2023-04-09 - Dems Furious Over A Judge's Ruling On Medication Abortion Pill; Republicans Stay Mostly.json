Here's what he had to say. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MAJORITY LEADER (on the phone): I think the Republicans know that these -- their decisions, the Dobbs decision, the court decision, are wildly unpopular with the American people. They're probably, at least in some of the survey data unpopular with a large number of Republicans. So they are afraid to speak out, but that is outrageous. (END AUDIO CLIP)",

And we saw that very clearly in the 2022 midterm elections.As for what Congress can do, they don't have many options. The bills that they want to pass are essentially dead on arrival. They can and have already begun applying pressure on the Biden administration to appeal the ruling, but legislatively, there really isn't much that Congress can do. Schumer has said, however, that Senate Democrats remain committed to passing the Women's Health Protection Act, which is a bill aimed at preserving abortion access nationwide, but that legislation failed to pass last year due to the balance of power in Congress and remains unlikely to pass now given Republicans control the House and Democrats have a narrow majority in the Senate.

So we've just found out that the leader of the Lebanese militant and political group Hezbollah has met with the leader of Hamas, the Palestinian militant group, to discuss what has been taking place in Jerusalem at that Al- Aqsa mosque, and the readiness of the -- what they described as the resistance access to respond to what has happened.Now, Hezbollah has not claimed responsibility for any of the rocket fire into Israel nor are they even being blamed. The Israelis, the Lebanese government, they are blaming Palestinian militant groups. But Hezbollah has such a huge influence on this country that what they say may well set the tone for what actually happens next. In the meantime, it is the job of the Lebanese military to try to prevent any potential future attacks in southern Lebanon to try to locate rockets or rocket launchers and to try to keep some of the militant groups at bay. And yesterday we went to southern Lebanon and frankly realized very quickly how difficult this task is with all of the militant factions. And also, on a more practical level, all the potential good hiding places for weapons amidst the orchards and the hills. There are also there plenty of people who have an ax to grind with Israel, frankly. We went to one of the sites that Israel struck, and we found some locals who made no apologies about rockets fired from Lebanon into Israel. In fact, I asked one man if he wanted peace with Israel, and he said, of course, not. Not everyone feels that way, obviously. It's a different story when you talk to the farmer down the road whose family was sleeping about 200 yards away from one Israeli strike, a strike that had so much impact it left a crater that you could easily fit several cars inside. He actually fled Syria to escape this kind of war. The last thing he wants to see is it follows him into Lebanon. And one other thing to mention and that's -- that we also went to the town that the Lebanese military says that some of these rockets were fired from or at least in that vicinity. And we couldn't find anyone there who wanted to talk to us on camera. But we did speak off camera to one guy who said that -- look, he's not on board with what has happened. He doesn't want to see any kind of escalation. In fact, he says, look, when I see my kid is terrified, frankly, so am I. Victor, Amara.",

But certainly today, Easter Sunday, we've seen the Pope at his best. He's been around already. The mass is finished. He's giving his Urbi et Orbi blessing that's to the city and to the world. I just want to share with you a few of the things that the pope has said. This is an address when he speaks about conflicts in the world, and he mentioned in particular, help the beloved people of Ukraine on their journey towards peace, shed the light of Easter on the people of Russia. The pope said he also prayed that prisoners may be returned to their families. And, of course, for families who have lost loved ones during the war.He also mentioned the resumption of dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians, and mentioned conflicts around the world in Syria, Lebanon, Myanmar and various African countries. This is the moment when the pope makes a comment about peace in the world. As you can imagine some of those themes for the pope, very important health wise. He missed a Friday evening event at the Colosseum, the Via Crucis, the Way of the Cross, because it was at 9:00 at night, very cold in Rome. The Vatican said due to the intense cold the pope was not going to be there. Probably a wise decision for an 86-year-old getting over bronchitis. But he has managed to make all of the other holy week events. It has been a very busy week for Pope Francis. Obviously, his mobility is still a problem. He goes around in a wheelchair. He can't stand for very long periods of time. But certainly, we've seen him in good spirits these days. Amara, Victor.",

But they do appear similar to the initial trove of documents having to do with the U.S. support for Ukraine that caught attention earlier in the week. And U.S. officials did confirm that those documents appeared to be authentic. Now, in addition to the Department of Justice opening this investigation, the Pentagon says they are looking into the matter. And looking at these documents is pretty surreal because they are photos of crumpled up pieces of paper that have classified markings on them. Some holding top secret markings, which is the highest level of classification. Some holding markings of the office at the Pentagon that advises President Biden.

They're not validated by any, what you might call, sort of establishment reporters or media that could determine what their veracity is and whether they have been altered.But the second thing is that they really don't touch on any malfeasance by the United States. I mean, in other words, you know, maybe you could have an argument that, you know, you released classified documents, if it shows that we're doing something illegal or lying about the war, say, Iraq or Vietnam, these basically are sort of what we understand them to be are essentially sources and methods in terms of how we collect information. They are about data and numbers that there's no reason to believe that they're inaccurate, and they've often been reported by the Pentagon. And finally, they are about an ongoing conflict.

NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Indeed a moment of jubilation despite this exceptionally dark moment in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, in which Ukraine charges 20,000 children have been forcibly deported to occupied areas of Ukraine or to Russia itself. Now, over the past weeks, a Ukrainian NGO has taken some parents of those children who have been deported through a circuitous route up through Belarus, through Russia proper, then background again into occupied Ukraine to try and get some of those children back. 13 parents and the last group taking out 31 children. In fact, you see pictures there of the joyous reunification of some who have not seen their child for months. We met Irina and Bogdan, age 13, mother and son from Kherson. And this is how they described their months apart. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): We were driving here for nearly a week. And I met my mother for the first time in six months. We went to the summit camp for two weeks, but we've got stuck there for six months. Why should I cry now? But I cried when I saw my mom from the bus. I'm very happy to be back. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): There was no phone connection. I was very worried.
