So by that measure, you could argue that she certainly has much more to gain by filling in some of the gaps. But she also faces some risks if they do not like what they hear. Trump, of course, is well-practiced at this. But which Trump will show up, what will his demeanor be, his tenor and tone be? I'm told the Vice President has been practicing for all of them, but it'll just be those two candidates face to face. And remarkably, it is the very first time they have been in a room together.

But that's because one candidate is so far ahead of the other candidate that even a small change in the polls won't make a difference.But right now, this race is as close as it could possibly be. You know, if you take my average of the polls, it's just a two point race nationally between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. You go to a state like Pennsylvania, the polls are tied there. And of course, that's obviously at this particular point looking to be the most pivotal state that we're looking at. So this year, the debates matter more than ever before. We obviously saw that back in June. But more than that, who is the debate important for this evening? It's Kamala Harris. Because let's take a look at how undecided voters feel, right? We're talking about a small smidgen of the electorate, part of the electorate that's going to decide everything. Look at this. How do they feel? Well, they don't really like either Kamala Harris or Donald Trump. You can see that just 13% of them view Kamala Harris favorably. Just 8% of them view Donald Trump favorably. But look at that need to learn more about, this is the key nugget. Of all the numbers I've seen, that really tells you what's at stake tonight because the bottom line is there's only a very small percentage of those undecided voters who are already a small part of the electorate who say they need to learn more about Donald Trump, just 18%. But look at Kamala Harris, it's 48% of undecided voters who feel like they need to learn more about her. The bottom line is undecided voters already know how they feel about Donald Trump. They don't like him. It's Kamala Harris who they really want to learn a lot about. And that's why tonight is so pivotal.",

So you put it all together, Brianna, you put it all together. Yourealize that there are a ton of undecided voters who feel like they need to learn more about Kamala Harris. You put it together with the fact that most voters or the plurality of voters think that Kamala Harris is going to win tonight. You can just see how pivotal this debate is for her because she had all that momentum that seems to have slowed over the last few weeks. Can she turn it back around the night just as early voting is going to get underway in a lot of these different states? And the bottom line is, I can't really recall a debate perhaps outside of the one earlier this year in which there's so much at stake.

The stimulus package measures that he put into place was when the economy was flat on its back because the world was shut down because of COVID- 19. When Joe Biden and Kamala Harris came into office, many states were already back to work. Their economies were already opening. And when they wanted to do his American Rescue Plan, which she co- signed because she was the tie breaking vote, we told them on Capitol Hill, you're going to create a labor shortage, which is going to create inflation. Because what they wanted to do was do a massive child tax credit, which, by the way, is the cornerstone of her economic agenda. That child tax credit coupled with all of the other unemployment benefits that Joe Biden wanted to do, that's what caused the labor shortage. The labor shortage in an economy that was already opening up is what caused the massive inflation. So we need to be crystal clear on this. There were bipartisan packages to support the Apeople during COVID-19 everybody knows we would do that stuff again. But Joe Biden and Kamala Harris need to do the American Rescue Plan. He wanted to do that for his own agenda, for his own name, and it wrecked our economy. And that's why Americans are suffering today.",

That doesn't make any sense at all. The legislature in Pennsylvania, led by their governor, Josh Shapiro, they should fix that right now.If the Philadelphia Eagles are there -- if they're playing a football game, trust me, the Eagles fans here in Pennsylvania, they know the score of the game when they're leaving the stadium or when they turn off their TV. But when we're talking about elections, we don't know who won simply because they're not even going through that process in an earlier fashion. Georgia does it. Florida does it. Many other states do. Pennsylvania should change that. But to a broader level, when you're talking about mail in ballots, one of the key issues is security of that ballot. Depending on your state, you can have a universal mail out process like Oregon, which, quite frankly, I find to be ludicrous. People should request a ballot if they're going to mail it in. That's a simple control procedure to protect the franchise of voting in America. That is Donald Trump's concern. And I will add, when you take a look at it, that's a concern of a lot of Americans.",

So it's not necessarily cause for concern in states that he won, it seems, among Republicans. I also want to point out since you talked about Pennsylvania, his claims of election fraud in 2020 were adjudicated. And there was a judge that led an appeals court of a three judge panel, but it was actually a judge that he appointed that said that his team brought zero evidence of election fraud in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania.Beyond that, you talked about Josh Shapiro changing the election laws there. It is a republican legislature in Pennsylvania, so they could easily address those concerns. It seems like they don't necessarily have that as an immediate priority, again, because there was no evidence of widespread fraud in 2020. Lastly, Congressman Donalds, there is one more question I have for you. Famously earlier this summer, Donald Trump made some comments about Kamala Harris's race during the National Association of Black Journalists Conference. And he essentially said that she sort of used her blackness to advance her career, saying that he didn't even know that she was black because she didn't put it out there. And I'm paraphrasing his remark there. She said in response that she invited him to say that to her face. Do you think Donald Trump might do that tonight?",

It's securing our border so we don't have illegal aliens taking resources from the American people, hardworking American people, Americans who are down on their luck, something's gone wrong in their life, and they need help. It is the illegal alien crisis created by Kamala Harris and Joe Biden that's taking those resources away from the American people.It is fixing our foreign policy because we need leadership in the White House, not pandering and not weakness. And that's what Kamala Harris and Joe Biden have brought us. Those are the things that he's going to say to her face. He's not talking about her identity. Frankly, nobody is. She might try to bring it up, but that doesn't matter to the American people. It's one of the reasons why her support in this race might be broad, but it's an inch deep because she's not talking policy, she's not talking about the things that are going to help the American people.

Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is facing tough questioning from congressional lawmakers about his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the thousands of nursing home deaths on his watch. A GOP led Subcommittee is expecting to pounce on Cuomo for his one-time policy, essentially forcing nursing homes and long-term care facilities to readmit recovering hospital patients without a negative COVID test.CNN National Correspondent Gloria Pazmino is here with more. Gloria, Republicans on this panel released a 48 page memo ahead of this hearing. What does it say?",

      "sentences": "Well, Brianna, much of what they concluded in the report has already been covered by several outlets, including CNN. And that's the fact that the Cuomo administration knowingly lied about the number of COVID-related deaths in nursing homes, and that they did this in part to tamp down criticism and to protect Cuomo's legacy.Now, the report by the Subcommittee specifically looked at this so called March 25th directive. And this was an order that the Cuomo administration gave to nursing homes, telling them that they had to accept patients who were COVID positive that were being sent in by the hospitals. And they say that they did this knowing the risk of transmission. Now, separately, the Committee also focused on a report that was crafted by the state health department and specifically that the Cuomo administration officials worked to edit that report and that Cuomo himself had a hand in doing it and that the whole report was only created in order to tamp down the criticism that the administration was receiving as a result of this policy. Now, the Subcommittee reviewed thousands of pages of documents, including several emails. And there's one email from top administration officials where they're going back and forth discussing this report specifically. One of the Governor's top aides writes in part, \"this is going to be the great debacle in the history books. Get a report on the facts because this legacy will overwhelm any positive accomplishment. Don't you see how bad this is? Or do we admit error and give up?\" Now, Brianna, of course, we know what happened after that. They did not admit error. Only several months later, a report found that they had undercounted these debts. Now, this is the former Governor's most high profile appearance since his resignation in 2021. This is the first time that he is in such a big political spotlight. And the question after this hearing is going to be not just how he performs, but also whether or not this is going to affect his supposed political comeback here in New York. There's a lot of talk about whether or not that is going to happen and whether or not Cuomo is going to have a political future after all of this. Brianna?",
