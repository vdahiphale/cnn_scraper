      "sentences": "Hello everyone, I'm Kate Bolduan. At This Hour, we are tracking this massive winter storm sweeping across the United States. It's impacting the vast majority of Americans today, just two days before Christmas. The storm is bringing blizzard conditions, I mean, I don't need to say it. You can see it. Blizzard conditions, ice, freezing rain, and very strong winds to cities coast to coast. Areas near the Great Lakes, like Buffalo, New York could see up to three feet of snow. However, the big story with this storm is really the cold, record breaking and life threatening. More than 200 million Americans are under wind chill alerts. The storm has knocked out power already to at least a million customers so far. And travel is starting to get back. More than 3,700 flights have been canceled today and more than 2,000 others have been delayed. That's not even to speak of what the roads are like right now. We're going to get to it. We have reporters stationed all across the country. Let's start with meteorologist Allison Chinchar. Allison, where are you most concerned right now?",

      "sentences": "I would say honestly, going forward, Kate, it's really going to be up and down the eastern seaboard. And part of that is because we're already starting to see those power outage numbers tick up very quickly. But for many of those places, they have yet to bottom out in terms of temperatures. So you really don't want to see those folks getting colder without power or access to heat, so that's going to be a big concern.Even here in Atlanta, it's very cold by Atlanta standards. Current temperature is 18 degrees. This is a towel that has completely frozen over, rock solid. The concern here is it's not just towels that are freezing, but also spots along the roadways, making travel very dangerous. That's not just here, but elsewhere across the country because you have basically this polar vortex, this arctic mass of air that has really started to push down across the country. And you can see there on that map again, showing where that air has really started to push back down across much of the country. It's also why you have so many people under these winter -- wind chill alerts across the country. Likely over half of the U.S. population is under one type of those alerts. Now the other thing too is it's the wind component to this. Not only is it making it bitter cold outside in terms of the wind chill, but it also means anywhere that it's snowing, it's taking that snow and blowing it around, reducing visibility even lower. In some cases, you're talking less than a quarter of a mile, also making travel even more hazardous than it already was. Then, when we talk about the snow of where it's actually expected to be, most of the snow for today will be limited across portions of the Northeast as well as the Midwest, where we're still looking at some of that lake effect enhancement. Now, most places likely still to pick up about an additional two to four inches of snow, but you will have some of those areas along the Great Lakes where you're talking one to three feet of additional snow. So again, the concern there, Kate, is not only do you have the snow making travel dangerous, you also have the cold air. So people are without power, again, those cold temperatures are bitter to deal with when you're outside, stay indoors if you possibly can. And don't forget to bring your pets inside.",

Unlike yesterday, this is normally a very busy street where businesses and, you know, office workers are milling around. They've plowed. We got about four inches of snow yesterday. So, yes, things are returning to normal, but it still feels painfully cold.We are now approaching something like 39 consecutive hours, Kate, of subzero temperatures. And in terms of the wild swings in temperature that we saw from this arctic blast, Wednesday, a high of 50 degrees, it dropped down to a minus 24 yesterday. And of course, with the wind chill, it feels, like, a lot colder. They had opened warming centers, including this huge one at the Denver Coliseum, a 24-hour warming center. The demand was so high yesterday evening that the city was forced to open two more emergency centers. But those are not going to be necessary. In just a couple of hours, we are expecting the temperatures to go up above zero and we might even be in for a 50-degree weather Christmas, which is great news for us.

But this is even brutal for the most seasoned and hardened Chicago resident. Joining me now is the executive director of the Chicago Office of Emergency Management, Richard Guidice.

But by no means should anybody spike the ball just yet. We still have a long way to go.Obviously, like you said, temperatures will be in the teens. We have a Bears game tomorrow, so we will be expecting additional people on the roads. But, you know, we got in front of this one in the beginning. We really got the message out, thanks to our friends in the media and our PIOs within our respective agencies.

But had we had gotten six inches of snow with those 50 miles an hour wind gusts, that would have caused significant situations for us that would have been challenging even for us here in Chicago.You know, one thing we pay close attention to is Lakeshore Drive. Lakeshore Drive, obviously adjacent to the lake, we've experienced white out conditions up there during situations like this.

What was it like overnight in Kansas City and what's it like there today?MAYOR QUINTON LUCAS (D), KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI: Well, it is cold, and that to us is more of a challenge than anything right now. The snow and ice on the streets has been challenging. While we have 300 trucks out, the roads are still slippery. But the biggest thing is the challenge to families, those experiencing homelessness with the cold.

But beyond just the roads and the slickness is actually our homeless population. Every year in cold weather cities, tragically, we experience deaths. We experience serious injury relating to those who are out in the cold. Right now, both our emergency services, our police department and others are trying to make sure they're reaching out to folks and we're trying to open up every warming center possible.We recognize that our shelters are not enough, and so getting folks to know where they can go, making sure that some of our homeless population are not sleeping outside is our biggest thing right now.

And his quote was, Mayor, I'll throw that little neck warmer thing on that I always throw on. It doesn't look good, but it keeps my neck warm. Should Chiefs fans be concerned, Mayor, about this?

And, you know, while tailgating is a lot of fun, maybe curtail just of it, given just how cold it will be. Frostbite sneaks up on you.

It doesn't deal with any negative evidence, inconsistent statement of witnesses, that thing. So it's not the analysis that prosecutors will now need to go through. But I think the Committee did a tremendous job. And the parts of their work that prosecutors won't do, things like legislative proposals and trying to get some sort of enforcement mechanism in place for the disqualification provision, those things are really, really important.

They really did tailor their recommendations to the evidence that they were able to collect. Now, again, DOJ is going to have to make their own assessment and DOJ will be able to collect additional evidence the committee couldn't get to. So we'll see what DOJ does.

There was no reason to believe that they wouldn't do that here.
