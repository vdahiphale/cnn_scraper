He's such a positive influence on the field. He scored that goal as we mentioned last night.We got the update last night from the hospital that he had suffered a pelvic contusion. We did see those pictures of him back at the team hotel. But the update last night was very much, we are taking it day by day.

So, if this is early, we should note, but if this, in fact, proves to be helpful, what can it do for cardiologists and what they look for in patients?DR. TARA NARULA, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, so it's important to understand, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in this country for men and women. And we don't yet have the perfect tool to identify people who are at risk. We have something called a risk calculator, a little equation, a formula, that we plug information into and it gives us a percent risk score that we can tell our patients. The problem is we don't always have all the information we need for that risk calculator and it's not perfectly accurate. So. in comes artificial intelligence. So, how can we incorporate that to complement our ability to predict who might be at risk, and, most important, to get them on treatment, medication, like statins, or to encourage them to make lifestyle changes. So, this study, as you mentioned, very preliminary. I want to point that out. It has not been published and it has not been peer reviewed. But really what it does is open up the door to us understanding, could this conceptually be used? And so what researchers did was use a single or simple chest x-ray to try to help predict if someone might have a heart attack or stroke. How did they do that? Well, they first took about 150,000 chest x-rays and generated this AI model. Then they said, let's test this in the real life. So they took 11,000 outpatients and applied that tool and saw, does it correlate with the number of patients who then went on to have a heart attack and stroke. And, in fact, it did. About 10 percent of those 11,000 went on. And the chest x-ray tool was able to kind of accurately match that. In addition, when they compared it to that risk calculator that I mentioned, it also correlated very well to that and added information to that. When I spoke to one of the radiologists who led the study yesterday, he said it was really interesting. You know, many times we look at a chest x-ray and we can tell signs of who might have a problem with their heart based on an enlarged heart or enlarged aorta, the big blood vessel that comes off the heart. But what was fascinating about this is he said you would look at some of these chest x-rays, as a radiologist, and never be able to tell what it is that the AI is picking up on that then goes on to increase that person's risk. So, it's really still a little bit of a black box in terms of our understanding of how this is working.",
