What do you make of the fact that even some of his harshest Republican critics and rivals are supporting him on this one? JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Bianna, it simply just underscores what has really become a growing reality throughout the course of this year that Donald Trump still has a tight grip on this Republican Party and every legal challenge, every criminal case, every civil case becomes a rallying point for his supporters and for Republicans. We have seen this again and again throughout the calendar year starting last April when the Manhattan district attorney was the first to indict the former president and the Republican base simply rallied behind him. So, we are seeing that again now. What we are not hearing is the Republican rivals talking about the substance of this Supreme Court case, which of course is the insurrection. This is something that most Republican candidates have danced around for the last year or more. But we did hear some interesting comments earlier today from Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. He's been drawing some contrast in recent days with the former president. He talked about that Supreme Court ruling in Colorado this morning, called it unfair, thought it would be overturned. Then he also asked voters if they want this drama hanging over their next presidential campaign. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We will have different states throwing different people off the ballots for different reasons. So, first things first, the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution says that anybody who engages in or gives aid or comfort to insurrection is ineligible to hold office. The complicating part, though, is we don't know exactly how that works. The 14th Amendment actually also tells us that the U.S. Congress needs to pass laws to tell us how it works. But they haven't done that in the 150 or so years since the amendment was ratified. So, what the Colorado state courts did is they sort of created a procedure. They created a hearing for Donald Trump. It was a procedure that existed in Colorado for other purposes. And at the end of that, the district judge found he did engage in insurrection, but the law does not apply to a President. Now, the Colorado Supreme Court yesterday did it one better and said he did engage in insurrection. It does apply to a president, and he's off the ballot. That was a four to three ruling. I think it's very likely this is headed to the U.S. Supreme Court next, which can take cases from the State Supreme Courts.

There are something on the order of two to three dozen different lawsuits following the same basic line of attack pending in various states. Now, this is the first one that's been successful. There's been about six different states or federal courts in six different states that have rejected this exact challenge, primarily for the reason I said it right up front. We don't know how this process works. It would violate due process to create something now. And then the plaintiffs that people have sued have withdrawn their lawsuits in about a dozen other states.

And if there's an appeal pending at the Supreme Court by then, it will continue to be put on pause and on hold until the Supreme Court rules. And that's really important because if, and I think likely when, Donald Trump appeals this, that means nothing goes into effect unless and until the U.S. Supreme Court signs off on it. And what that means as a practical matter is because Colorado's state deadline to get on the primary ballot is January 5th. As long as Trump files an appeal, he will still be on the primary ballot.

Officials took no chances though, evacuating the population after weeks of tremors. Thousands of shakes were felt in November, and all knew what they could bring.

I was also listening earlier to what the Secretary of State Blinken said that this war could be over if Hamas unconditionally surrendered and released all the hostages and laid down their weapons. There would be no need to continue the war. Unfortunately, it was Hamas, and it is Hamas, that has determined the battleground behind the people of Gaza who are paying dearly for the failed leadership of Hamas. Our efforts currently and we continue to bring in and facilitate humanitarian aid every day, the numbers are increasing. Today, Israel is not preventing the amount of aid that can go in. It is the capacity on the Egyptian side and on the Palestinian side of Rafa that is preventing that and limiting it. We are increasing our activity, some 80,000 tons of good of medical supplies, food supplies, shelter has gone into Gaza.

Do we just say, let's hope the sixth, the seventh of October doesn't happen again, because Hamas want to rule the Gaza Strip as a staging ground for ruthless, merciless, brutal attacks against our people? The reality is one that there needs to be a paradigm change, a change where Hamas never has the powers to build such a ruthless war machine against Israel, a terrorist entity, a governing authority that has used 16 years, not for the good of the people of Gaza, but for tunnels. You've seen the extent of these tunnels. They are the most expensive, expansive construction projects ever to exist in the Gaza Strip. Imagine if they would have built above ground. Imagine if they would have invested in education, in health, in the infrastructure. The people of Gaza could have benefited from all of the aid that they got. But unfortunately, Iran gave Hamas 100 million, or continues to give Hamas, 100 million dollars a year, not for the good of the people of Gaza, but precisely for acts like the 7th of October. That's a reality Israel just can't accept to re-occur. And so, I would say, yes. Our goals are two-fold, dismantling and destroying Hamas and bringing home the hostages, every last one of them.",
