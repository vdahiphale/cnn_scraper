Tonight, President Biden signs the long-awaitedforeign aid bill that will see desperately-needed equipment as well as ammunition sent to Ukraine's frontlines, we have the very latest for you. Also ahead, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson will visit New York's Columbia University, refuse in the coming hours as a standoff between pro- Palestinian protesters and administration continues. We are live on the campus this very hour for you. And a CNN exclusive. New video tells a very different story from what the Pentagon says happened during an attack outside Kabul airport in 2021. We'll show you what it planned. But first tonight, U.S. President Joe Biden calls it a good day for world peace after he signed off on a desperately- needed $95 billion foreign aid package for Ukraine, Israel, as well as Taiwan. Now, the funding includes $61 billion for Ukraine. Biden says the U.S. will begin sending military equipment there within a few hours, he says. He believes the funding will save lives as well as send a message to friends and foes alike. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I think there are still some restrictions on how Ukraine can use these weapons in terms of how deeply could go, for example, not just in Ukrainian territory, but into Russian territory. And I'm sure there were some political reasons why that wasn't announced while this whole debate was going on about how much and when the U.S. should send weapons to Ukraine. But it is an interesting development. And I think the fact we're learning about it now is the White House wanting to show not just the Ukrainians, but the Russians as well, that this U.S. aid is now forthcoming and will be fairly quickly.

The President does understand the rhythm of passing bills in Congress. He was a senator for decades. He understands that sometimes you have to give your adversaries space, he didn't want his people coming out and attacking Johnson. To make it even more difficult, sometimes politicians need time to work their way to a -- and their caucus to a different position. Johnson also got a lot of classified briefings from the CIA and other agencies which seem to have helped change his mind, which was quite interesting, given the fact that the Republican Party, because of Donald Trump is very suspicious of the Intelligence agencies. So, you know, the President -- he's not just passed this bill. He's got a really good record of legislation passed, like bipartisan infrastructure for example, that his predecessors didn't manage. And I think in this case, it really helps that Biden was a creature of the Senate, he understands Congress. He understands how to give your adversaries some space in politics.

The first year of the war, bringing three successful counteroffensives to the Kyiv region,and eventually, we see in the Kharkiv region here and then down in Kherson. The second year though very different. Territorial gains or losses grinding almost to a halt. Then from October last year, if we go back there, and you see the months go by, if we zoom in on this crucial area of the eastern front, things start to gradually change. The Russian advance begins, and then by the middle of February, Ukraine had had to withdraw from the town of Avdiivka. The town that it had resisted for the best part of a decade. And the Russian advance didn't stop there. (GUNFIRE) Well, if the red-shaded area is Russian-occupied territory, you can see that by the end of March, Russia had taken a few more villages down here, tiny amounts of territory, but signaling an unstable frontline. And now, the advanced continues towards Ocheretyne up here and Novokalynove. Again, just villages, critical higher ground and more potential Russian progress. And it's not just there that Russia is attacking down in the south, it's fighting to regain villages like Robotyne that Ukraine took back last year. And Ukraine's second city of Kharkiv is under relentless attacks. SERGEY LAVROV, FOREIGN MINISTER, RUSSIA (through translator): We need to move back the line from which they can hit us.

      "sentences": "Hi there, Isa. Well, first of all, I think most Ukrainians who are watching us right nowprobably wouldn't mind listening to the national security adviser because, of course, they want all the details about this weapons package as well. But as far as the ammunition is concerned, first of all, you're absolutely right. Some of these reports that we did do about the Ukrainians using smoke shells on the frontline. That situation is actually even worse than most people think, because the fuses that the Ukrainians had on those smoke shells, they didn't even allow the smoke to get released. They were essentially using these shells just as iron cannon balls, almost in medieval ways, trying to hit Russian vehicles or Russian troops, obviously doing very little damage. So, in other words, the Ukrainians really have a massive shortage of ammo, and I think right now with this new weapons package, they're not expecting that this is going to turn the tide in the war here, or they won't be able to gain ground back fairly quickly, but they do hope that there'll be able to hold up some of those Russian advances. And of course, artillery, ammunition, some of the other ammunitions also that are mentioned in these weapons package as well, those could go a long way because the Ukrainians have been saying that in some cases, they are in their positions and their artillery positions, they can see the Russians going towards the frontlines trying to advance, but they can't fire at them because they simply don't have enough shells. And the Ukrainians have said -- you've heard this from frontline troops as well, that they expect that once these shells come across the border into Ukraine, President Biden, of course, has sensitivity, wants to get all that going in the next couple of hours, that they will reach the frontlines very quickly. So, that could make a big difference. Of course, all that depends on how many shells the United States is going to send. But I was quite interested to see in this new package -- this weapons package, that ammo really played a big role in it. And I think for the Ukrainians right now, that certainly is the most urgent, indeed, Isa.",

And one of the big issues that I think the Europeans have had, we know that they've had because we reported about it, was that their production line simply weren't big enough and weren't ready to start production on that scale. What you are seeing now however, and I have been at a big weapons producer, ammunition producer also in Germany, is that a lot of that ammo production is really starting to speed up, and it's starting to get underway. And one thing that leaders in Germany and Europe have told me is they believed that a lot of that ammunition that was promised, that has been very late, has been delayed. A lot of that is going to start hitting Ukraine and also European countries that are also increasing their stockpiles towards the latter half of the year.

And for a while, as we have heard, American officials have resisted this. We have heard -- learned in the last hour the U.S. secretly sent long-range missiles to Ukraine earlier.

Abortion access in U.S. is an issue we talk about a lot, particularly since Roeversus Wade, of course, was overturned back in 2022. Today, Democrats in the Arizona legislature set to meet once again in an attempt to repeal an abortion ban that dates back to 1864, and that ban applies to all abortions except to save the life of the mother. And on Tuesday, U.S. President Biden highlighted Florida's lack of abortion access, whiles as you can see there, campaigning in the same state of his rival Donald Trump's adopted home. Now, the focus shifts to Idaho. Today, U.S. Supreme Court justices heard arguments on whether abortions can be enforced in medical emergencies even in states that ban the procedure. It's a monumental case that could, of course, could reverberate nationwide. I want to bring in our Jessica Schneider, who's been across the story and joins us now from Washington. And Jessica, great to see you. Look, just explain to our viewers right around the world the arguments we heard today and the questions we heard from the judges, and whether that gives us any sort of inkling, which way they may go.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Isa, you know, actually this case, they were very divided, so, it's kind of a biting-our-nails, waitingand seeing when they finally issue this opinion probably, likely sometime in June, it was a very heated two hours of arguments. And this is somewhat of a very technical case. However, it could have wide- ranging implications when it comes to abortion around the country. And this is only two years after the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade. So, at the heart of these arguments, this is about a federal law and a state law in Idaho, and the Biden administration is arguing that they conflict. The federal government is saying that federal law should really append or preempt the Idaho law. So, the Idaho law, it's this near-total ban on abortions. It is currently in effect and it does make it a crime to perform or assist in an abortion. The only exceptions are if a woman's life is in danger, or if the woman was a victim of rape or incest. Now, the Biden administration is saying that the Idaho law conflicts with another federal law, that law is known as EMTALA. It was enacted in the 1980s. And what is it -- what it does is, it requires emergency room doctors to step in and offer what's called stabilizing treatment. When a woman's health is in danger, they have to offer this treatment even if, you know, her injury isn't life-threatening. The law says the doctor should offer all necessary treatment, and the federal government is saying that includes abortions, Idaho disagrees with that. They're saying there's nothing in the federal law that says anything specifically about abortion, and says that this law was only enacted with the intent that emergency doctors would have to treat patients regardless of their ability to pay. So, a somewhat technical argument about which law should really apply in the state of Idaho, obviously, the justices were very passionate throughout these arguments. And it does seem that they were very divided. It wasn't clear which way this court will go. Two of the conservative justices though, Isa, they did seem very concerned about how Idaho's law is administered. You know, how doctors are being judged if they determine that a woman maybe is knocking on deaths door and needs an abortion. So, we'll see how they rule here. A decision will likely be handed down sometime in late June, you know, just as we're in the thick of the presidential race. And of course, abortion is just a huge topic that has really dominated, you know, elections both this year and in previous years as well, Isa.",

Those were banned -- those with legal with gestational limit as well as banned in two weeks, and I want to couple that graphic with what we've seen in terms of polling. I think it's important because we know from recent polling, a majority of women think abortion should be legal in all or most cases, including two-thirds, 67 percent of women in states where abortion is banned, and 71 percent in states where abortion is limited by gestational limits. A larger majority, 81 percent women, states where abortion is currently legal say abortion should be legal in all or most cases.

We know that those negotiations between Israel and Hamas have really been stalled over the course of the last several weeks. They have even been backsliding with Hamas, offering fewer hostages than has been the basis for these negotiations, going to less than 20 hostages for a six-week ceasefire, rather than the 40 that have been discussed for months now.

Two Pentagon investigations insisted all 170 Afghans and 13 U.S. military who died here were killed by an ISIS bomber and nobody hit by gunfire. GENERAL KENNETH F. MCKENZIE, COMMANDER, U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND: No definitive proof that anyone was ever hit or killed by gunfire. WALSH (voice-over): But this new video, which begins outside the airport's Abbey Gate entrance reveals much more shooting after the blast than the Pentagon said. Combined with new accounts to CNN of Marines opening fire and gunshot injuries in Afghan civilians, it challenges the rigor and reliability of the two Pentagon investigations that declared no Afghan civilians were shot dead in the chaotic aftermath. The bomb detonates. The footage then stops and picks up three seconds later.",

The Pentagon has insisted all injuries and deaths were from the bomb and its ball bearings.

Key was Sayeed Ahmadi, head doctor at the Kabul hospital treating most of the wounded. Back then, he was afraid to speak openly and his account was dismissed by the Pentagon. But now, we met him safe with asylum in Finland. He says, he and his staff had the expertise to diagnose over 50 dead from gunfire that night. DR.

WALSH (voice-over): Even though we described the video and our findings in great detail to the Pentagon, they said they would need to examine any new unseen video before they could assess it. They said their first investigation had thoroughly looked at allegations of outgoing fire from U.S. and coalition forces following the blast. They said their review, released earlier this month, focus not on gunfire, but the bomber and events leading up to the blast, but found no new evidence of a complex attack and uncovered no new assertions of outgoing fire, having no materialistic impact on the original investigation. Investigators have also not interviewed any Afghans for their reports, the Pentagon said, leaving the question of how hungry for the truth are they? Nick Paton Walsh, CNN, London. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
