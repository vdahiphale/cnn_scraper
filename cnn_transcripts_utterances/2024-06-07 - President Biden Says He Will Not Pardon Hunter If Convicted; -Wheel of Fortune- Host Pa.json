Donald Trump says the justice system only has it out for Republicans like him, but there are two big trials that prove otherwise.Plus, President Biden's message from Normandy, his pitch for democracy, on the very soil where Americans fought against autocracy. And there's a new Shyamalan in town, the daughter of horror legend M. Night Shyamalan, on her new movie, \"The Watchers\", and what she thinks about her dad's films. So, the American justice system, if you haven't noticed, is facing a pretty critical moment. Donald Trump has been trying to chip away at its credibility ever since the first charges were brought against him. But this past week, it has been a whole different beast. He has opened the floodgates in the days since his conviction in the New York hush money trial. Repeatedly and forcefully, Trump is vowing revenge. He said it this weekend. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: My revenge will be success, and I mean that. But it's awfully hard when you see what they've done. These people are so evil.

They were setting him up with some softballs, almost T-balls, really. A chance to bury the hatchet, take maybe a higher road, but he refused to budge. In fact, he doubled down.Trump is being cheered on by his allies and a lot of potential V.P. picks who are raising their hand to be second in command, who say this is all political persecution. A two-tiered system of justice filled with lawfare, as they like to claim. But that just, I mean, it's not the case. We've got the evidence to show it. In exhibit number one, Senator Bob Menendez. He is on trial for corruption, federally. A sprawling case involving gold bars and envelopes of cash and a brand-new Mercedes convertible. Menendez announcing this week he has actually changed his party to Independent, but that was just this week. For years, he has been one of the most powerful Senate Democrats, and he is facing federal charges and federal trial with those brought by the DOJ, not some local or state prosecutor of a Democratic administration. And today, a witness for the prosecution testifying that he directly bribed the New Jersey Senator. Exhibit number two, Hunter Biden, President Biden's own son, facing possible prison time over felony gun charges. Hunter's daughter giving emotional testimony today in her father's defense. Now, given how personal, all of this must feel, it would be easy maybe for President Biden to follow Trump's claimed playbook and claim the system is biased against people with the name Biden.

Wouldn't it have been great to actually watch it in some form or fashion? But, Tiffany, let me go to you on this because there is this, like, split screen happening. You know, there's accusations about how the DOJ controlled the hush money trial. They did not.That was through the local D.A. But there is a federal trial happening. It involves Hunter Biden. They had his daughter up there today. It is a bit of an uphill battle to prove that there was this narrow window of time that he, in fact, was using in violation of what he stated. But talk to me about this split screen that you're seeing, that this seems to still have legs for people. TIFFANY R. WRIGHT, FORMER LAW CLERK FOR JUSTOCE SONIA SOTOMAYOR: I think it's unfortunate, I think. And a lot of it comes from the lies that the former President tells, right? Like, either he was the leader of our entire federal government for many years and doesn't understand that the state of New York is not within the control of the federal government, or he's patently lying to people. And either way, it's unacceptable. But I think what we see with Hunter Biden really is an unfortunate picture of how addiction can rip apart a family. And that is what I see when I look at it. You have a man who has recovered, who is in his sobriety trying to recover, and all of that is being brought back up. His daughter is on the stand. It is heartbreaking. And to see the current President in a model that I wish President Trump would follow say I'm not going to consider intervening in the legal system even for my own son, even though I know he was suffering with addiction when he did this, is a really powerful model that I think should be one for all of our Commanders- in-Chief.",

I mean, a top-ranking Democrat who only recently is Independent, the President's own son, how should voters evaluate the two?",

You can backfill your rationale as to why the fact that Menendez is still a senator and Chuck Schumer hasn't called for him to resign, that's just proof that the system is rigged.The fact that he's taking Mercedes or gold bars or what have you, that's proof that the system is rigged. The fact that Hunter is on trial not for the things that they think he did, the Biden crime family or what have you, this is for, you know, lying on a gun application, that's proof that the system is rigged. So, I think you can always, you know, if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. But from the standpoint of how voters should look at it and, frankly, how voters do look at it, I think they're disgusted by the whole thing. I think even having to look into these issues, you know, it's not comfortable. I mean, as we were talking about, as a father, as a son, you wouldn't wish this on anyone. I think it's how voters really recoil from this stuff. And, frankly, if they're thinking about what voters care about, especially as it relates to law and order, they're not worried about what politicians who they already are sort of disgusted by are doing. They're more worried about crime in their cities and the concerns over, you know, what's coming through our borders and those sorts of things. So, I think the idea that we're focusing our time, that prosecutors are focusing their times on things that they think is as a sideshow are a distraction from the things that are driving people when they go to the polls.",

But I do think it's important to distinguish that the criminal justice system, be it New York or the federal system or anywhere else, is not designed to convince people who to vote for. Prosecutors don't bring cases because they're trying to commit election interference or they're trying to split off, you know, moderate voters. They bring cases because the facts and the law demand it. That's their job, right? Alvin Bragg was voted -- was elected by the citizens of Manhattan. He has the authority to bring cases where he thinks the facts and the law support them. He chooses to bring that case. That's his obligation under the responsibility that's been vested in him by the citizens of Manhattan. If they don't like the way that he's making those decisions, they can elect someone else the next time. But the results of any of these individual cases are not designed to decide elections.

I mean, a sitting President's child in a criminal trial. It involves I mean, some of the same narrative, same statements. This would never have been brought up. The last name wasn't this. This is a trumped up charge or this is never a standalone, whatever it could be. A lot of these things had been said about the hush money trial, as well.

And so he may not want to open himself up to that.I think it's a calculus between how certain does conviction look? If it looks pretty certain, then maybe this is a Hail Mary testifying as something that could work or couldn't. There's not much risk.

And I think, you know, it's one of those things where maybe the scandal is what's legal, because he was under no obligation, didn't break any rules, he didn't break any laws.Of course this doesn't look good, but the idea that he's been the most consistent person on the bench throughout his tenure. And so, I don't think there's been any mystery as to how he's going to come down, certainly not on something like a Dobbs.

I mean, that's one of Reagan's greatest speeches, \"The Boys of Pointe Du Hoc\". That was Peggy Noonan wrote it. It was perfectly delivered by Reagan. Mike Deaver, who in presidential history we consider a master of stagecrafting, figured it all out. And back in 1984, it gave Reagan a big boost. For his re-election, Ronald Reagan in early '84 only had about a 27 -- 30 percent approval in foreign policy. But after that June 6th speech, Reagan kind of went up in the polls.

And it was effective and moving. And I think it was really aimed to let the Ukrainian people that have been suffering so much know that we still have their back. We're working to get it funded. We kind of had a hiccup, but we're -- we're on track. So, it was, I'm sure, a big morale boost for people in Kyiv and elsewhere in the Ukraine. And it would add to the admiration of Biden, who they might have some suspicion he hasn't done enough. So, that apology will go a long way in that particular theater.",

I mean, Sweden is the newest NATO member.And so, Biden didn't really get credit for that. And I think American people need to learn more about how important NATO is. This is the cornerstone of democracy. Canada, the United States, Western Europe, the Atlantic community. And one must defend Ukraine. If we're allowing Putin to take over the Ukraine, Putin will go into Lithuania or he'll go into another. He'll try to reconstitute the old Soviet Union that broke up in 1991 and put democracy in tatters in Western Europe. And it'll affect us here in America. So, I think Biden can't say enough to say that the United States is a leader of NATO. And we can plan on continuing to not only lead, but to encourage everybody to be part of the pro-NATO alliance.",
