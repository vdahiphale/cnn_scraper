The blue and white Finnish flag is going to fly today from this empty flagpole that is just outside the NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. Obviously, this is a blow to Russia in the war against Ukraine. NATO's secretary general says the move is going to make Finland safer and the alliance stronger. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now according to this Russian official, Gershkovich has been permitted to go on walks, has access to a library, and has so far raised no complaints regarding the conditions he is facing. He has even, according to this Russian official, appeared cheerful during their conversation. But, of course, it is important to underscore that this is being reported by Russian state media. Gershkovich is, of course, being held at a pretrial detention center in Moscow's notorious Lefortovo prison, set to remain there for at least another eight weeks.

That is according to the campaign. We actually haven't seen any FEC filings. The attention Trump is getting is set to hit a fever pitch today here in Lower Manhattan when he is going to turn himself in in the building behind me, 100 Centre Street. The judge in this case has rejected overnight the request to broadcast the arraignment live on television -- something that CNN and other media outlets advocated for in the interest of transparency -- but he will allow some photos before the proceedings begin. In his order overnight, Judge Merchan acknowledged the historical significance of this proceeding that we are about to witness, writing, quote, \"That this indictment involves a matter of monumental significance cannot possibly be disputed. Never in the history of the United States has a sitting or past president been indicted on criminal charges. Mr. Trump's arraignment has generated unparalleled public interest and media attention. The populace rightly hungers for the most accurate and current information available.

You talk about that. Don't fall for it. Bet on Bragg.

And Alvin Bragg's office secured last June a 17-count criminal conviction of the Trump Organization for misstating a lot of its taxes, its compensation, and putting false records out there.And he said at the time this is a two-chapter case. The first chapter was last summer when they got the conviction on all counts. In fact, the CFO of the Trump Organization is in jail this morning behind that case. And then there's the next chapter. What we're seeing right now is the next chapter. False business records -- we'll know for sure when the indictment is unsealed.
