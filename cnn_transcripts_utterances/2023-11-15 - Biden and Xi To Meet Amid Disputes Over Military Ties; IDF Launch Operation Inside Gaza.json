      "sentences": "Hello and welcome everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, we begin with a high stakes meeting between the leaders ofthe world's two biggest economies. In just minutes from now, U.S. President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are to meet in person for only the second time in three years. The two men are then set to talk behind closed doors at a historic estate south of San Francisco. And they have, I think it's fair to say, plenty to discuss and to talk about -- Taiwan, trade, national security as well as restoring military channels of communication. Relations, as you know between the nations are at low point, but both sides say they are ready to mend the frail relationship. And the stakes for this meeting are high, but the expectations are actually low. U.S. officials say -- list of outcomes to come out of these talks. Let's get more analysis really from the deputy director of the Atlantic Council's Global China Hub, Colleen Cottle who joins us in Washington D.C. Colleen, great to see you. I mean, it does seem here that the goal is to keep the two sides talking, restoring like I said, those channels of communication. But I was intrigued by what I've heard from Jake Sullivan; the National Security adviser, that says that the driving aim it seems is to keep the relationship from tipping over. I mean, if this is a starting point, Colleen, what does that say? COLLEEN COTTLE, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, ATLANTIC COUNCIL'S GLOBAL CHINA HUB: Yes, I think after a difficult year with starting with the balloon incident earlier this year, and then some more tit-for-tat trade measures on both sides, restricting trade, I think the importance of this meeting really is, on a more symbolic level, trying to ensure that both sides maintain a commitment to high-level communications. This is also important because there is a chance that the leaders will not be able to meet next year. And so they're really setting the tone for the entire year ahead with this meeting and with that commitment for high-level communications.",

We were -- we heard some word in the last day or so that there's going to be an agreement announced on fentanyl, precursor chemicals as China has been a large source of shipping some of those precursor chemicals to Mexico. And there is once a higher level of cooperation between the two countries, and it looks like there may be set to resume some of that cooperation in exchange for the U.S. removing one of Chinese entities from one of its list here, reducing restrictions there. I think another area that there might be some more movement, and it seems that at lower level, we've had some movement on the increased military-to- military communications, we're opening channels there to again, prevent that risk of an incident that escalates into something larger. And then, there may be some -- there was a State Department announcement today that there had been an agreement to improve -- increase the use of renewable energy as a replacement for fossil fuels, and that, you know, would certainly be a well-timed, even if more symbolic announcement and cooperation ahead of the climate change talks and to -- by later in the next couple of weeks.",

If we leave the topics that may be discussed today, let's talk about this visit, Xi's visit, it's the first time he's visiting the U.S. since 2017.

And as you heard there, how much really there is for them to discuss after not meeting, and relationship being a bit soured for several years. But tensions over, of course, as we were hearing over the surveillance balloon, disagreements over Taiwan. We've got -- and obviously, the military communications. But what we have heard from officials from the U.S. side at least is that restoring the channels of communication, that's the most important. Colleen, you're back with us.

What he is -- you know, he is looking for in terms of the bilateral relationship, and the same would be said for Xi.

Some major news coming from a letter sent by the Israeli first lady tour to her U.S. counterpart. According to the Israeli prime minister's office, Sarah Netanyahu wrote to Jill Biden that an Israeli hostage has apparently given birth in Hamas captivity. In the letter, Netanyahu writes, quote, \"You can only imagine, as I do, what must be going through that young mother's mind, as she's being held with her newborn by these murderers.\" This is as Mr. Netanyahu comes under intense criticism by some families for not doing more to secure the hostages released. A large group of people are marching from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The families of hostages are holding signs and placards of the missing. The five-day march is expected to end on Saturday at prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence. Evyatar David is among the hostages that Hamas is holding in Gaza. His brother, Ilay David, joins us now.

Ilay, really appreciate you taking the time to speak to us. First of, all what do you want to see and hear from prime minister Netanyahu? ILAY DAVID, HAMAS HOSTAGE EVYATAR'S BROTHER: Firstly, thank you for the opportunity. Second, the most important thing that we want to do right now is actually make our voice heard and our cry heard. It has been 40 days without any information about our loved ones. We know nothing about the deals that maybe are going to be or maybe not. We are being fed from the news and so I don't think that, as a family, we deserve that.",

It has been in Gaza since 2009. The services it is providing is vital. And obviously we are demanding an investigation into what happened so that we can see what legal action will be taken. But the issue now is to make sure that the hospital continues to operate, continues to offer help to people in need. That is why we are continuing with airdrops that are providing them with supplies on a week to week basis. And so that is the enormity of the challenge they are having.

So again, we are looking into the facts and we try to establish them as the investigation continues.

You saw babies taken off incubators because there is no power to keep them functioning. Again, we have thoughts and we have claims. The fact is that there are people that the whole world can see being denied the right to proper medical treatment with no medicine, no water, no electricity, nothing. And we have Israeli claims that, as you said, have yet to be proven. The only thing that would prove such claims is an international investigation, something which Israel has refused to do thus far. And so again, I think what we need to focus on, I think the whole world saw the horrific images of babies off incubators, of mothers screaming for an aspirin to the ease the pain of their kids. Why this is happening? Because Israel is denying them medicine and Israel has attacked the hospital. So again, there is international law. There are obligations that Israel needs to uphold. And I think it's imperative for the Security Council to act. It has been almost 34 days and the Security Council has not yet taken one decision urging the humanitarian pause. So nothing can justify the images that we see in Al-Shifa Hospital. This war has got to stop; 11,000 Palestinians, 67 percent of them are children and women have been killed. When is enough enough? How many people have to die before the whole world realizes the absurdity and the brutality of this war? And the fact that it will not bring security to Israel or peace to the region. This war has to stop and all of us need to come together and figure out why we got to where we are and what is the only path to making sure that nobody has to live this horror again. And we believe in Jordan and we've been working for years for Jordan for the two state solution, which would guarantee the safety and security of Palestinians and Israelis. Meanwhile, Israel is obligated, the whole world is obligated to make sure that Palestinian patients do get the treatment that they deserve as hospitals are under attack. That babies have incubators to keep them alive. And hospitals like our hospital have provided the protection it needs for it to be able to continue to keep it alive (INAUDIBLE).",

Wiping Hamas out, how are they going to do? that At what cost, those wiping Hamas out means? I think the only thing that we all know for certain is that this war has already killed 11,000 innocent people, displaced 1.6 million people, destroyed the health infrastructure, denied people food and water. Since October 21st, by the way, even though Israel said it would allow humanitarian aid, only about 985 trucks have entered Gaza. The daily average before the war was 500 trucks.
