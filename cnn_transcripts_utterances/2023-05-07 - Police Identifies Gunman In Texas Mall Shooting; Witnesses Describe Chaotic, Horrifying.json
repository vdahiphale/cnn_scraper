We're learning new details about the gunman in the deadly shooting at a Texas outlet mall. Eight people were killed, seven others wounded. Plus, at least seven people are dead after a car hit a group of people outside a homeless shelter in Brownsville, Texas. That facility also sheltering migrants who just reached the United States. But we begin this hour in Allen, Texas. First, a warning that some of the things you're about to see are disturbing. CNN obtained this photo that appears to show the dead shooter heavily armed and dressed in tactical gear. A senior law enforcement source familiar with the investigation tells CNN that the suspect, the gunman, is 33-year-old Mauricio Garcia. A dash cam video captures the moment the killer hops out of his car. We are pausing it before you see him gun down men, women, and children on this busy sidewalk at that outlet mall. Take a look. This is the sound of terror and explosion of gunshots and people frantically running for cover. A police officer already at the mall on an unrelated call kills the gunman. CNN's Ed Lavandera is at the scene of this senseless attack. Ed, what more can you tell us about the gunman. We have some new information, I understand, coming in to CNN this afternoon and this evening. What can you tell us?",

We spoke with a witness a short while ago who was on the northwestcorner or the northeast corner, excuse me, of the building and witnessed the gunman pass him by. And the officer also pursuing him in that parking lot where the shooting started and where it ended, separated by several hundred yards, basically on the opposite side of the building.

This one in the early morning hours at a night club in Miami Beach. One person is dead, two others are injured. Miami Beach Police are investigating but have not yet released any information on a suspect or suspects at this hour. And a post on Instagram today the club called the shooting isolated and targeted. And of course, as we get more information about that just coming in, we'll get that to you just as soon as we can.

It comes from Congressman Henry Cuellar's office, and I'll be speaking with him later on this evening. But first let's go to CNN's Rosa Flores, who is in El Paso for us but she has some information on what took place in Brownsville. Rosa, what can you tell us?

The Brownsville Police Department says that the driver is still uncooperative. And the city of El Paso issued a statement in response to what happened there saying that it all reinforces their decision to put these barricades that you see right here in front of me because of the situation here in the streets of El Paso, where the last now came from the city of El Paso, there were more than 2,000 people on the street.But back to Brownsville. Here is what we know. According to the director of that center, he says that this occurred right across the street from his shelter. He says that about 20 to 25 migrants were sitting on the curb earlier this morning at about 8:30 Central Time. And he says that the moment of this incident was captured in his surveillance video. And from watching that video, this director says that what that video reveals is that at about 8:30 this morning, there was a Range Rover, a 2007 Range Rover, that was driving at a very high rate of speed and then ran a red light and hit a curb about 30 feet from where these migrants were on the curb. And at that point in time, he says that this vehicle completely lost control. Now this director says that from him talking to some of the witnesses that the witnesses say that this appeared to be intentional. So, I asked the director, that based on his witnessing of this video if it indeed looked like this was an intentional act, and he said no. He reiterated that what this video shows is a vehicle going at a very high rate of speed, running a red light, hitting a curb, and then going out of control. Now, back to the driver of this 2007 Range Rover, Jim, what we know from police is that he's not cooperating. They're having to fingerprint him to get his identifying details. But police have taken blood. They're doing toxicology tests -- Jim.",

In fact, the administration officials I've been talking to in the past few days tell me that even though Title 42 hasn't expired yet, they're already seeing an increase in the arrivals here in New York City.And the problem that the administration here is facing is that they are running out of room. New York City is unique in some ways in terms that it's legally required to provide shelter to anyone who needs it. So, as the city tries to tackle this crisis, they are coming up with all sorts of ideas, some of them, you're seeing them there on the screen. They include putting up tents in Central Park and some of the city beaches, leasing out college dorms, even using unused airplane hangars at JFKennedy Airport. All of this was outlined in an internal memo that I obtained earlier this week where you can see the Adams administration is dealing with this as an all-hands-on-deck moment. They are running out of shelter space and they're trying to come up with other ways to shelter people. They're estimating the city of New York could see up to 800 migrant arrivals per day. Already last week, 500 arrived on just a single day. So the city of New York hurting for shelter, for money, and waiting for the federal government to step in in terms of providing that funding so that all these migrants who have so many needs and need to be connected to resources can be connected to what they need as they begin to arrive here after being bussed from the southern border -- Jim.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VINCE GILLIGAN, BREAKING BAD CREATOR/EXECUTIVE PRODUCER: You know, AMC was the network that made the bet on us, and our thanks to them. But it's true, \"Breaking Bad\" didn't really catch fire until it started streaming on Netflix. And we just got lucky. If we had been a couple years' earlier, I wouldn't be interviewed by you right now. No one have ever heard of the darn thing. But it just hit at just the right moment and streaming, binge watching, the idea of consuming episodes of TV like potato chips, one after the other, that really -- that hit just at the right time for us and it helped us turned into what we turned into. But I give credit to the advent of streaming and to Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul and a wonderful cast. I think people just wanted to watch them. I think they were secret sauce.",
