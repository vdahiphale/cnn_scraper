And let's be one - let's be clear about one thing, this is not a humanitarian gesture by Hamas. My view is going all the way back to October 7th, this is what they planned, to take innocent Israelis in order to swap them for Palestinians, Hamas operatives who have been held legitimately by the government of Israel. So, now we're looking at a three to one swap going on.So, I think, look, the pressure has built so much domestically within Israel that Bibi Netanyahu has to get a release of these hostages. I think from a military perspective, it's not good because a four to five-day postponement or pause in the actions will allow Hamas to rearm, to refit, to reposition troops. That's why they are pushing so hard that there not be any surveillance over northern Gaza during this period. So, look,  you've got to take the good with the bad. I think it would be really good to see innocent civilians released, particularly the - you know, the children and the elderly. But you've got to take this one hour at a time, one day at a time. POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: Mr. Secretary, I want to ask you about \"The Washington Post\" reporting that you were asked to comment on, and you did not comment to \"The Washington Post.\" This is about a number of people who were in Trump's cabinet and surrounding him, including his chief of staff, John Kelly, who have turned against him and who are now struggling with ways to sort of puncture the lead that he maintains in the Republican primary. John Kelly, for example, saying, \"what's going on in this country that a single person thinks this guy would be a good president.\" You have previously said that Trump is, quote, \"unprincipled and should not be in the position of public service.\" Will you work to publicly fight the lead that he has now or are you going to stay on the sidelines?",

I think we have good Republicans in the Republican primary that can - can deliver on conservative principles and goals and objectives, but also unify the party. And when put into the White House, elected into the White House, I think can unify the country. So - and any one of those, whether it's Haley or Christie or DeSantis, will defeat Joe Biden.

Up until now Israeli officials, if they've said anything at all, have said very, very little. They have hinted there was progress, but nothing like this. Nothing like a public statement that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will convene first the war cabinet, then the wider security cabinet, then the full government to vote on the issue, the exchange, the agreement in place.And this is moving fairly quickly. So, these are each an hour part. Local time, at 6:00 p.m. it will be the war cabinet, which is Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the defense minister and then the former defense minister, as well as a few advisers in there. That's a very small group. Then it will be the wider security cabinet with more members of the government. And then it will be the full government set to vote on this. This was what we had heard coming into this day, that it could happen fairly quickly if it gets to this point, that the whole approval process, which also requires some time for anybody who opposes this to appeal to the supreme court. But the whole approval process could take less than 24 hours. And we are seeing the beginning of that movement here with that first meeting of the war cabinet at 6:00 tonight. I would very much expect there would be a statement from Netanyahu sometime this evening where either he outlines the framework of the deal or at least acknowledges that it is in place if - if we get to that point, as it certainly seems like we're moving in that direction here. We have heard all sorts of rumors that there was progress in the past, but I think, at this point, with what we see, especially from the Israeli government and the announcement of these meetings and votes for later this evening, it is perhaps safe to use the word imminent when we talk about what we expect here later on today.",

You know, that's normally a time where you're going to stand up and be incredibly supportive of the president. So, I worry a little bit it's about education.

ANA NAVARRO, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: You know, I think that's very natural for Joe Biden. The truth is, the man has a sense of humor and he is self-deprecating. And, frankly, it's something that Donald Trump doesn't have. Donald Trump is very defensive, has very thin skin and does not take jokes about his age, about his anything, very lightly. So, I think it's the right thing for - for Joe Biden to poke fun at him. I mean, finally, you know, that cake looked like a fire hazard in the White House. I'm not sure how the alarms didn't go off. And Sarah is completely true, if Donald - completely right, if Donald Trump is the candidate, and it seems likely, the age point is largely moot. It's very different if Joe Biden were to be running against Nikki Haley or against Ron DeSantis. But the age issue vis-a-vis Donald Trump, yes, OK, so Joe Biden fell off a bike. Donald Trump has never been on a bike. They both make gaff. You - you know, we can - I mean we can sit here for days looking at reels of gaffs made by Joe Biden and made by Donald Trump. I don't think there's been that -- the same level of focus on Trump as there has been on Biden because he's not president and he doesn't have that bully pulpit. On the issue about the young voters and the Israel-Hamas thing, the administration needs to do a better job at tooting its own horn.
