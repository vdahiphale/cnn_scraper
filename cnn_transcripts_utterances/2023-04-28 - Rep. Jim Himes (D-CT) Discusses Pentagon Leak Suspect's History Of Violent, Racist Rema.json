Namely, how someone like this fell through the cracks and yet still got a top-secret security clearance.The Justice Department says, just a few months ago, Teixeira posted that he wanted to, quote, \"kill a blank ton of people\". And allegedly asked a user for tips on carrying out a mass shooting. Court documents allege that a pennant with the insignia of the Russian military general staff -- you see there -- was found hanging in the suspect's bedroom. Joining us is the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, Democratic Congressman Jim Himes. Congressman, thanks so much for taking the time today. REP. JIM HIMES (D-CT): Thanks for having me, Jim.",

And the list of things that we need to do as a Congress and that the DOD And the I.C. need to tighten up on is very long.I mean, some of it is really kind of head-shaking. You know, interestingly enough that this individual had access to the information. He was just a network administrator, didn't really need to read the information. But he could print it out. I mean, that just boggles the mind that -- there's obviously a technological issue there. There are culture issues. My understanding is that the leadership of that particular unit has been dismissed. You know, I'm sure there was a lot about not sufficient training. But you raise a really interesting question, which is, are we screening people well enough? You take me back to when Edward Snowden blew all those secrets from the NSA. I looked at Edward Snowden's resume and I thought, I would not hire this guy to be an intern in my office, and yet he had the highest security clearances there are. So I think we need to do a much better job at looking at people's background. Not just phoning up to see if somebody may be disloyal, but looking at the data that is out there that might raise red flags.",

We constantly have people retiring from places like the CIA and the DIA and the NSA. You can't stop granting clearances. You really need to fix the plane while it's flying.But look, there's some things that feel like a no-brainer to me. Right now, at least the Pentagon doesn't look at your publicly available social media, your Twitter feed, your Facebook, et cetera. Publicly available so you have no expectation of privacy in that. And they don't look at that. Well -- and by the way, I should acknowledge that that could get -- there are a lot of gray areas, right? You wouldn't be denied a security clearance because you're an ardent Republican or ardent Democrat or because you have strong political feelings. But if somewhere, you're posting that you would like to kill a whole lot of people, at a minimum, that should lead to further conversations, and today it doesn't.",

The National Football League honored the lives of the three University of Virginia football players who were killed in a shooting during a class field trip, you may remember, back in November. The NFL commissioner, Roger Goodell, welcomed the families of the three Devin Chandler, DeShawn Perry and Lavel David Jr on stage for a tribute celebrating the legacies of these young athletes. And it was a harrowing journey home for a group of middle schoolers in Warren, Michigan. You've got to watch this. Their driver -- you can see on the camera there -- fell unconscious. That prompted one student to jump into action. You can see there he took the wheel. Carter Middle School honored seventh grader, Dylan Reeves, during a press conference on Thursday. They called his actions -- and they're right -- quote, \"an extraordinary act of courage and maturity.\" Reeves was able to bring the bus all the way to a full stop. No students were injured.

Albeit, that cooperation is very fragile. But I think it really drives the point home that when we find the low- hanging fruit, when we find those points of commonality, those things we agree on, we need to double down on those, and we need to keep the doors of dialogue open and we need to keep talking. The worst thing we can do in any crisis, any situation is to stop talking to each other, stop -- you know, close those lines of communication, stop working together. So I think it's really, really important that we see this as a shining example of international cooperation. And, you know, we're going to get past this present crisis, and we're going to learn from it, hopefully mature from it, hopefully evolve past this because it's obviously a very, very horrible thing that's happening.
