We'll talk about his bid to try to shake things up here in New Hampshire and the pushback he's getting from some in his own party. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DEAN PHILLIPS (D-MN), 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm only doing this to defeat Donald Trump. Nobody seems to want to do that in the Democratic Party right now other than me because Joe Biden can't is my proposition because the data says he can't. No one in the country right now cares. In fact, most of the people in the country are going to the Trump rally right now because he's listening to them. No one's asking about this stuff. I'm just frustrated. I hope you understand why I'm getting tired of it. You're doing your jobs, but you're not asking the questions that Americans give a (EXPLETIVE DELETED) about. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

[06:35:01] The New Hampshire \"Union Leader\" editorial board putting their weight behind Phillips' bid, writing, quote, \"For anyone who supports Joe Biden for his policies but would prefer a president born during the Vietnam War rather than World War II, they will not be disappointed with Dean Phillips.\" And Dean Phillips joins us now.

And the fact is, we have a duopoly, a two-party system that is literally working against voters, and voters who don't want to show up and vote in primaries and then get frustrated by the choices we have in November. That's part of the problem. We have a crisis of participation. And I've got to tell you guys, I went to a Donald Trump rally a couple nights ago. Never been to one. I had an event across the street. I saw the line of people waiting in the cold for hours and I thought, what the heck, you know, I'm going to be a leader who actually invites people, doesn't condemn them, Met probably 50 Trump people waiting in line. Every single one of them, thoughtful, hospitable, friendly, all of them so frustrated that they feel nobody's listening to them but Donald Trump. A diverse crowd. People who had never been to a Trump event before. My party is completely delusional right now, and somebody had to wake us up. And if that's my job, so be it.",

And most people say that they felt better under Donald Trump. And that's on both sides of the aisle. And so that's number one that he has going for him.The second thing is, more than 60 percent, some polls have over 70 percent, of voters are looking for a fighter, saying that the system seems like it's unfairly working for some than others. Only 4 percent believe that the political system is working for them. And so they're looking for a fighter. Donald Trump represents to them a fighter and no one else does. And so when you see these people who are feeling like things are worse, they feel like the system's not working for them, they're feeling like they're getting left behind, they feel like they're being judged, they're talked down to, Donald Trump is the one for them. And - and it shouldn't be surprising to anyone. The other thing that I think is fascinating is, if you look at Biden and Trump voters from 2020, only 79 percent of voters that voted for Joe Biden in 2020 are likely to vote for him again, while 90 percent of Trump voters are likely to vote for him again. And 5 percent of Joe Biden voters are more likely to vote for Donald Trump today. So, the math isn't looking good for Joe Biden right now. And we're - we're not even, you know, all the way to a general election right now. But it's really fascinating to see the enthusiasm that's with (ph) Trump. ERROL LOUIS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: This is - this is, by the way, this is where Nikki Haley's comments about chaos trails him and we don't want chaos. If you're that voter who thinks that the system is working against you, that Washington has ignored you and Wall Street has swindled you and Hollywood is laughing at you, you want chaos. You want something to sort of shake up the whole system. That was always, from 2015 on, that was the Donald Trump appeal. And I think we're seeing it play out in New Hampshire and throughout the Republican primary.",

He failed as a Republican, right? There's selective memory amongst the base right now. Donald Trump did not actually build the ball. And certainly didn't get Mexico to pay for the 20 miles of it. He stashed $8 trillion worth of additional debt. He fumbled the ball on Covid. These are things that they were reluctant to - they tried to play cute. And I think now we're having to play a catchup game and the base has got selective memory. And that's - that's painful.The only thing that's really keeping Donald Trump alive, in my opinion, in this race, or so strong amongst the other contenders, is that Joe Biden is doing that bad, right? If there was actually a threat to the White House and if Joe Biden was actually polling up or even with Donald Trump, I think there would be a melting of support for Donald Trump.",
