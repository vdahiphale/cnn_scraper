They still don't have any direct ties to President Joe Biden. But what you are hearing from Kevin McCarthy is that perhaps they could get more information if this was part of an official impeachment inquiry.We should also note that House Republicans have been talking for months and have their sights set on impeaching other members of the Biden administration. Including potentially Merrick Garland, the attorney general, as well as the Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas. We should also note that McCarthy said earlier in a call with Donald Trump that he supported expunging the impeachment record of the former president as part of his efforts in the House. He told Donald Trump at the time that he still needed to talk to his conference about whether or not they would be interested in doing that. But just a stark difference there between how he's handling this Biden issue and how he has talked to the former president. Rahel.",

He tried to overthrow the federal government, overthrow our electoral process in order to assert something that everybody knew was not true. As Liz Cheney said, he cannot be allowed back in the White House again. If the third party -- if No Labels puts a candidate up against -- if Biden and Trump are the candidates, they will elect Donald Trump to a second term. So, if Donald Trump is the candidate and No Labels says they do not want to be a spoiler, they don't oil like Donald Trump, then why don't they say that they will put up a third party candidate if Donald Trump is on the ballot as the Republican candidate?",
