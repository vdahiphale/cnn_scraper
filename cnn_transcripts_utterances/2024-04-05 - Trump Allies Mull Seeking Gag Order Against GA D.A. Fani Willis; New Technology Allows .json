And there's a couple of reasons why it's probably not a great idea for Trump and his team.Number one, they are trying to get her removed from the case on account of some of her behavior and statements and so on. If, in fact, they get a gag order that silences her, that takes away all they're or a big part of the reason for getting her off the case in the first place. That's number one. Number two is you open the door to a gag order against former President Trump as well, you know? Because all the parties here, including the judge, who is himself running for office, they're all out speaking about this case. So if they put a gag order in place on her, they ought to put one on Donald Trump as well. And I just think, if you're a defense attorney, they're really weighing this and it's probably not a great idea.",

I'm so sorry. I'm going to do this whole cycle myself without letting you weigh in, apparently. (LAUGHTER) OK, so, \"Recently, they tell me they don't like me to talk about race.\" This is what she told a crowd. \"Well, I'm going to talk about it anyway.\" And I wonder how you think the judge sees that.

Is she calling something -- you know, does her -- do her comments in some way touch on the substance of the proceeding?And I think people hear the word \"race\" and sort of their ears prick up and think that she is inherently saying something problematic. The rule is, and when we're talking about gag orders and things that are permissible, is the judge saying something that will impede a party's administration -- ability to get the fair administration of justice? And when you start talking about race, that's a little bit of a gray area. Now, look, I'll be the first to say that everyone in this case, including that prosecutor, is guilty of probably going too far and saying things they shouldn't have about the other parties and about the judge in the court and so on.

And those two things come in conflict -- conflict, and they really are here. Judges and law professors have struggled with these issues quite a bit. They need to be allowed to speak and speak their minds about other candidates and, frankly, about the system but not at the cost of messing up somebody's trial, even a former president that many people take some issue with. So if I had the answer today, I'd be a much richer man. I don't think anybody does.
