They have been attacking U.S. forces across Iraq and Syria ever since the October -- ever since October 17, about 10 days after Hamas launched that terror attack.And most recently, we're told that today, a U.S. military aircraft actually fired on a vehicle in Iraq, that U.S. officials say was attacking forces at Al Assad airbase in Iraq. And it's unclear how many people inside that vehicle, those hostile -- those that -- those threats actors were killed in the strike. However, the U.S. does say that they believe that a significant number of people -- militants were killed in those strikes. And this comes really after six dozen or so attacks have been launched on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria. And many, many U.S. personnel have been injured as a result of those attacks. So, the U.S. clearly stepping up its response here.",

That would be women and children.Again, that process will go through the war cabinet, which is supposed to be meeting now, then the wider security cabinet, and then the full cabinet as part of the process that it takes to approve this. Following that there is a 24-hour window where appeal is going to be followed to the Supreme Court. So, wait and we just got official word here that the war cabinet meeting has begun. Let me bring in Gil Dickman, who has two family members held as hostage in Gaza. 39-year-old Carmel Gat, your cousin, as well as 36- year-old -- year old Yarden Roman. The first and most important question is, is the government giving you information? Do you know where the process stands right now?",

We're going to make the deal happen, winning -- we're going to bring people home.

And there is no trust between the Israeli government and Hamas right now. So, both of them should be built and it's very, very difficult to do.So, the fact that it could be built and there's actually a deal in which the two sides can trust one another is huge. And it's very meaningful for us. And I can only imagine how we're all going to feel when 10-month-old Kfir comes back home with his mother and his 4-year- old brother. We're all going to be extremely happy and hopeful that it's going to mean that soon enough, Geffen -- baby Geffen, three-and- a-half-year-old is going to meet Yarden, the wife of my cousin, and they're going to meet -- and my cousin's going to meet his wife, and that we're going to hug Carmel.
