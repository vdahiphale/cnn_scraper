Scores of walkie- talkies exploded across the country Wednesday, killing at least 20 people, wounding more than 450 others. Dozens of emergency crews and first responders were sent to help the injured and put out the fires.In one instance, a walkie-talkie exploded during a Hezbollah funeral in the southern suburbs of Beirut. A witness telling CNN they heard a loud bang followed by screams and saw a man covered in blood. His hand blown off. It comes a day after 100 of pagers some owned by Hezbollah members blew up nearly simultaneously across Lebanon in an unprecedented attack, which wounded about 2,800 people. The death toll rose to 12 on Wednesday. An Israeli source tells CNN Israel carried out the pager attack after it believed Hezbollah had discovered the device's capability. These attacks have led to an outpouring of anger on the streets. Video shows people throwing rocks at vehicles for the U.N. interim force in Lebanon following Wednesday's explosions. Well, the Israeli military says it struck several Hezbollah infrastructure sites in Southern Lebanon in the past 24 hours after identifying about 20 projectiles launched across the border. Israel's defense minister tactically acknowledged his country's role in the exploding devices. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YOAV GALLANT, ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator): I believe that we are at the start of a new phase of the war, and we must adapt. This is true for everyone. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): I have said it before, we will return the citizens of the north to their home safely and that's exactly what we are going to do.

I fact, the reason why they used pagers in the first place was so as to avoid, I have to say evade the surveillance from drones and elsewhere. But that hasn't proven to be so effective as we know now. And so, I mean, in terms of I think a long-term effect on Hezbollah, I don't think obviously this would have an issue. I mean, the group has enough cadres to reconstitute itself. But in terms of the short-term effect, of course, you are talking about losses of leaders, but also the losses of mid-level people that are (INAUDIBLE) and logisticians, not to mention, there is now going to be a crippling of its communications network because they'll have to revamp it completely to try to avoid I guess further penetration.

Since then rates sat at a 23-year high for more than a year. Fed chairman Jerome Powell says the move is a sign of commitment to keep in step with the ever changing U.S. economy.But the move wasn't unanimous during the first dissent from a board member in nearly 20 years. One member wanted to see a smaller cut. The Dow briefly spiked upon the news, but chorus concerns about the jobs market began to creep in.

The fact that they went with a jumbo-sized interest rate cut, it's telling on multiple levels. First, it shows they're not worried about inflation anymore. But Chair Jerome Powell, he stopped short of declaring victory over inflation. But they're all but doing that.It does also suggest, though, that they're all worried about what they're seeing in the jobs market. Now Powell, he said repeatedly that he's not alarmed with the jobs market. He even said at one point, the labor market is in a strong place. We want to keep it there. But there are some economists who are concerned that the Fed is late and that they need to play catch-up before the cracks in the jobs market turned into something more ominous. So the Fed has made clear that they've switched the mission. They've gone from fighting inflation to fighting unemployment. Of course, all of this is happening just weeks before this hotly contested election. Now, Powell, he stressed politics played no role here and that the Fed only does what they believe is right. And I asked Powell about the idea from former president Trump that the sitting U.S. president should have a say in where interest rates go. And Powell, he made clear, he's not a fan of that idea. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEROME POWELL, CHAIR, U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE: We do our work to serve all Americans. We're not serving any politician, any political figure, any cause, any issue. Nothing. It's just maximum employment and price stability on behalf of all Americans. And that's how the other central banks are set up to.

They do suggest slightly higher unemployment rates than had been forecast a few months ago, slightly lower inflation for that matter, and lower interest rates. But still not a recession, right? I think what the Fed is trying to communicate is that the economy is slowing. They are on top of that softness that we're seeing in the labor market. But we shouldn't panic.

In fact, many, many months, people -- for many, many months people had been expecting these rate cuts to happen and the Fed had in fact put out forecasts suggesting that they would happen. So because of all of that, many financial institutions have already priced in some of those loosening financial conditions into the kinds of credit products that they offer, whether we're talking about mortgage rates, mortgage rates have already come down, you know, since, let's say, April.Credit card rates, auto loans, some of those rates have already been coming down. That said, you know, there's this expression coined by Milton Friedman that monetary policy works with long and variable lags, meaning that it'll be a while before these rate cuts that the Fed put in place today are actually felt throughout the economy against some of that's being priced in.

Like I said, there is a long lag time generally between when the Fed makes the decision to either raise or reduce interest rates and when it really takes an effect throughout the economy. So the fact that they waited as long as they did should in and of itself be a clue that this was not about helping one party or another.But the broader point is that the Federal Reserve is politically independent, prizes that political independence. And in fact, relies on public perception of their political independence for their tools to work, right? If people don't believe that the Fed is disconnected from the whims of politicians, from the day-to-day pressures of politics, then whatever they do won't really work because people will just believe inflation is going to come and it'll become a self- fulfilling prophecy. That's what has happened in many other countries where politicians have had control of the money supply. You look at places like Argentina or Venezuela, pre-euro Italy, Zimbabwe, et cetera. These are places where the central banks were not really independent and as a result, they had lots of problems with inflation. And in some cases hyperinflation. So this is really important for the Fed. They have tried to communicate that. I understand why Republicans might be trying to cast this decision as being politically motivated, but it's just not. Again, if it were, they would have acted a long time ago and that's just not what they're about.
