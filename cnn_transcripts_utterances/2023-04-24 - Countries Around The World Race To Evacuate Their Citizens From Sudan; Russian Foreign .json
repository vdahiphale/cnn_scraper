I'll be speaking to the French Foreign Ministry about their evacuation efforts. Then Russia takes over the rotating presidency at the U.N. Security Council amid anger from the West. The U.N. Secretary-General is warning the conflict in Sudan can engulf the entire region as well as beyond, saying the world must do everything in its power to pull the country back from the abyss. His words there. Well, Sudan's doctors union is reporting heavy bombardment again in Khartoum with a number of serious casualties. Fighting is raging for a 10th day between the army and a powerful paramilitary force. And with no end in sight, countries around the world are racing to get the citizens back home. Urgent evacuation efforts are underway, with many diplomats being airlifted to safety. Others are traveling in convoys to the ports of Sudan on the Red Sea or escaping to neighboring countries including Egypt as well as Chad. Sudanese civilians who have the means to escape are also fleeing. But many others are left behind, fearing that the world's attention may fade once foreign diplomats are out of harm's way. I want to bring in CNN's David McKenzie, he joins me now from Johannesburg, we're also joined by Kylie Atwood in Washington. And David, to you first. I mean, we have seen now many nations rushing to get their citizens out, but it is proving difficult. It's also tricky. Of course, there is no ceasefire, and for those remaining, it's causing a lot of anxiety.",

The doctors are overwhelmed. The hospitals are largely closed. It's an awful situation, people making the very difficult decision whether to stay or to try and leave.

We've evacuated approximately 500 people, now they are safe and in security in Djibouti in our Air Force base there. And we've been evacuating, as you know, the vast majority of our diplomatic staff and nationals, French nationals from Sudan. But also we offered support to our friendly partners and allies. And there's more than 36 nationalities, different nationalities that have been rescued, so almost 200 people from 36 other countries that we managed to evacuate.

The situation has worsened with the loss of trust in multilateralism when the financial economic aggression of the West is destroying the benefits of globalization when the United States and its allies are abandoning diplomacy and demanding clarification of relations on the battlefield.

And owing to some of the restrictionsplaced on reporters here in Ukraine, we couldn't necessarily tell you all the details of what we learned if we indeed learned them without possible ramifications. But clearly here along the frontlines, there is a multiple series of exchanges of information. You were referring there to pro Russian official in occupied areas, saying that -- in his information, there were 10,000 Ukrainian troops building up around the town of Hulyaipole, which is not far from where I'm standing, and certainly on the frontlines of Zaporizhzhia region, closer to Russian occupying forces. Now, many analysts think that if Ukraine needs to get a strategic success for this long-held counteroffensive, essentially has to push down towards the Azov Sea, and really cut off the Crimean Peninsula that it took in 2014 through occupying forces from the rest of occupied Ukraine and the Russian mainland. That would be a real blow to Putin's vision from what he wants to do to the occupied parts of Ukraine. Now, the suggestion that these forces are building up around Hulyaipole might potentially suggest the Russians know something that we've not seen after a number of days in that area. We saw no evidence of that ourselves, but you would possibly think that Ukrainian forces are smart enough to hide that. And so, there's a continuing build-up of noise suggesting that something maybe afoot, be it suggestions by Russian officials that perhaps or western analysts indeed, that maybe Ukrainian forces in very small numbers might be landing in Russian-controlled parts of Kherson near the Dnipro River. Also reports over the past week of intensified clashes in the villages in the areas between Ukrainian and Russian forces. A lot of noise here, very little coherent proof that a Ukrainian counteroffensive is underway. If we recall what happened around Kharkiv, the last successful Ukrainian push at the end of last Summer, the Ukrainians didn't really let anybody know what was going on until it was kind of done. And so, they are proving quite good operational security to some degree, and the Russians have proven themselves in the past they're quite good at collapsing under pressure. So we have no idea really, exactly how far advanced any Ukrainian maneuvers may be, even indeed if they're even happening. And so the important point I think Ukrainians are making and their spokespeople keep reiterating is silence is important for the success of their operations. But the strategic issues here are enormous. Ukraine clearly knows that the support it's getting from the West, from NATO, they can't rely on this forever. They can't really rely on it this time next year, let alone maybe even through the Winter. Elections, economies, things change the whole time. Will it exert pressure on that rare unification from NATO members. So, they know they have to achieve a change on the ground. At the moment, some of their officials sounding bullish that they can do that, certainly, but when it happens, how it happens, something at times that is hard for us to see and also tell you. So, a lot resting on what we see in the days ahead.",

In the same poll, nearly half of all those who oppose another Biden term say his age is a major reason for that view. At 80 years old, the president's age is certain to be a central issue in the campaign. The fact that even many in his own party privately acknowledge. Joining me now is CNN's White House correspondent Jeremy Diamond. And Jeremy, given the polling that we just showed, and the public perception here over the president's age.

Should President Biden go ahead as we expect him to announce a re-election campaign, campaigning for a second term. At the end of which, President Biden would be 86 years old. And so, that's certainly something that this White House and this president's campaign are going to have to fight against. Right now, the president's advisors are putting the final touches on this re-election campaign. We expect that the president could be announcing that re-election campaign tomorrow with a video announcement. But of course, advisors have warned us that President Biden sometimes chooses to delay things, and so there is still a possibility of yet another delay. But nonetheless, the fact that we are now expecting this campaign to launch this week is a shift from what we have heard in recent weeks, where people close to the White House and the president's advisors have told us and other Democrats across town that they -- that they did not expect President Biden to announce this Spring. That they thought that it would perhaps slide into the Summer, saying that the president felt no pressure to announce, given this Republican in- fighting that is happening on the other side. But something seems to have changed. One of those factors potentially could be fundraising. Over the Summer, fundraising tends to be quite slower, especially with some of those big-dollar donors. And one of the things that the president is trying to do in pushing back against this notion that there is not sufficient enthusiasm for his campaign, posting a big fundraising number at the beginning of the first quarter of his re-election campaign would certainly send a powerful message. Now, we are told that President Biden has landed on campaign manager, that is Julie Chavez Rodriguez, who is currently a senior adviser and the director of Intergovernmental Affairs here at the White House, to be his campaign manager. But he also was huddling over the weekend with his advisors at Camp David, putting the final touches on some of those final staffing and operational decisions that have to be finalized before the president can announce.

IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Comments by China's ambassador to Paris on French television claims that former Soviet republics don't have any real status according to international law. They triggered somewhat of a diplomatic firestorm in Europe with the governments of three former Soviet republics, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, all saying that they would be summoning Chinese diplomats to try to clarify these claims. And meanwhile, a statement has come out on the Chinese Embassy in France's website today showing a pretty sharp 180-degree U-turn with the statement quote the, \"Ambassador Lu Shaye's remarks on the question of Ukraine were not a statement of policy, but an expression of his personal opinion. They should not be the subject of over-interpretation.\" And going on to say that China respects the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of all countries, and that China would like to help mediate a peaceful settlement to Russia's ongoing invasion and occupation of Ukraine.

His first major scoop put the spotlight on his constant internal dilemma, how to balance pressure from his community versus the story. In 2020, Maswadeh showed how COVID restrictions were being violated at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, one of the holiest sites in Islam. The backlash was swift.",
