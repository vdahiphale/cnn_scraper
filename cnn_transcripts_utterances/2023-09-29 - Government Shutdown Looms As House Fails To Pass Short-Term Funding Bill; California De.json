The House of Representatives just voted down a short-term spending solution. And another short-term proposal in the Senate is also not likely to get passed before Saturday at midnight. And if that deadline passes without new funding, about 3.5 million federal workers will not get paid, including active duty military.Also, an alphabet soup of federal agencies would face some kind of closure or cutback or reduction in services. And that includes the IRS, the SBA, the FDA, OSHA, SNAP, Head Start, among many others. CNN's Lauren Fox is live for us on Capitol Hill. So, Lauren, you've got the breaking developments. This last-minute attempt by McCarthy with a stopgap measure was essentially doomed to fail.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, and more than 20 conservative hardliners voted against that measure, a show that they are not sticking by the Speaker, that they have not bought into his argument, that they need to have some kind of Republican plan to go to the negotiating table with the United States Senate, which is working on a bipartisan basis. Our colleagues caught up with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy just moments ago, and he told our colleagues, quote, it's not the end yet, I have other ideas. Those ideas you can expect him to unveil during a Republican conference meeting now scheduled for 4 p.m. But just to take a step back, this means that there is likely going to be a government shutdown.House Republicans don't have a plan so far that they can rally around. And Senate Democrats and Republicans are working on a bipartisan basis on a bill that is currently being slow-walked by Senator Rand Paul because of the fact it includes Ukraine aid. That is the dynamic at play right now. And every lawmaker that you talk to up here, no one is promising that on Monday morning the American people won't wake up to a federal government shutdown. And the impacts of that are going to be very real for Americans. And as time goes on, if there isn't a plan, and if House Speaker Kevin McCarthy doesn't want to work with Democrats, it's very possible this shutdown could go on for a very long time. So watch that dynamic. Obviously the question remains, will at some point House Speaker Kevin McCarthy reach across the aisle, work with Democrats to find a path forward, something that could pass out of the House? Again, we are talking about just a short-term spending bill. This is not even the bigger fight over spending -- funding the federal government for an entire year, Boris.",

And just one of my favorite stories, look, she was tough. She was fierce. She was a fighter. She was independent. But one of my favorite stories about her was actually from New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, who told me many years ago about when she first came to the Senate, she really was overwhelmed.She didn't know how to put together her staff and everything. And Dianne Feinstein took her to lunch and said, how can I help you? And she asked some questions. And then Feinstein said, I have something for you. This is a memo. It's very confidential.

But Joe Biden, let me just say, was very close with Dianne Feinstein and served with her for, I believe, 15 years and worked with her on the assault weapons ban. And she was older than he is.

Scott Grubman, who's the attorney for Ken Chesebro, that pro-Trump attorney who's expected to go on trial, said that short of all charges being dropped against Chesebro, that they fully expect to go into this trial on October 23rd.And earlier this morning, during a procedural hearing ahead of that trial, the judge asked the district attorney's office if they would be in a position in the near future to offer a plea, to which the DA's office responded yes. So they seem to signal that that may be coming soon. But even if a plea deal is offered,this case could still go to trial depending on what these defense attorneys decide to do. One of the big outstanding questions right now is whether Chesebro and Powell will go at this alone or whether they will be joined by others of their co-defendants. There's still a handful ofthese 19 co- defendants that have not indicated one way or another if they want a swift trial. Ken Chesebro and Sidney Powell did ask for a swift trial, so that's what they're going to get.The question, though, is will they get a loan or will they be joined by others? Boris.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, that's right. This happened actually yesterday, just as Bob Menendez was meeting behind closed doors with Senate Democrats, telling them that he would not resign, but not giving any indication about whether he would run for re-election next year. That is a major question for Senate Democrats, because this is a seat that ordinarily Democrats would have a very good chance of holding on to in a blue state, but now that Menendez is facing these bribery charges, there's real fear. If he runs, he could jeopardize that seat and potentially theDemocrats hold on power in the United States Senate. Now there's a clear indication here from this invitation that I obtained last night that Menendez might in fact be running for re-election. He is a PAC, a political action committee tied to the senator, said that told its donors in a message yesterday that the event is still on. This fundraising event is still on. A donor retreat in Puerto Rico at Dorado Beach in Puerto Rico at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in mid-October, saying that there will be a reception in the evening with the senator, along with his chief of staff. The next day they could go play golf with the senator. They may have lunch with the senator's chief of staff that evening, finish up with an evening reception before any donors who come can take off here. This will undoubtedly cause concerns within the Democratic ranks. One key Democratic senator, Gary Peters, who chairs the Senate Democratic Campaign Committee. I asked him, will you support Bob Menendez if he runs for re-election? He was non-committal on that question, which is unusual. Typically they do support their incumbents who are up for re- election, but also underscoring the real concerns among Democrats about what Bob Menendez plans to do here. But by this indication and what he's been saying to his members behind closed doors, he doesn't plan to resign. He plans to fight these charges and now potentially could be running for re-election, causing some concerns within the ranks. Brianna.",
