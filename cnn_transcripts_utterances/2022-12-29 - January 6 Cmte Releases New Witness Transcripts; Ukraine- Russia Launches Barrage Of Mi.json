Plus, a message from Moscow, nearly 70 missiles pierced the Ukrainian sky in a massive attack, the target, Ukraine's energy grid, the objective, to force war-weary Ukrainians to spend the holidays in the pitch black. And, the United States revives a COVID travel restriction for passengers traveling from China. That's what we're watching this hour.Hello, everyone. I'm Amara Walker, in for Kate Bolduan. Developing \"At This Hour\", the January 6 Committee releasing deposition transcripts from 19 witnesses, many of them, Donald Trump insiders. Now, the list includes the former president's son Donald Trump Jr,; Kimberly Guilfoyle, the former Fox Anchor and Trump Jr.'s girlfriend; Stephanie Grisham, the former White House Press Secretary; Alyssa Farah Griffin, the former White House Communications Director; Stephen Miller, a former top Trump Advisor; Christopher Miller, the former Acting Defense Secretary, and others. Paula Reid joining us now with the very latest. Hey there, Paula. So, what did Donald Trump Jr. tell the Committee?",

      "sentences": "Well, Amara, a lot of news in this most recent batch of transcripts. We have a whole team of people pouring over these right now. But, some of the highlights, specifically from Donald Trump Jr.'s transcript, he was asked about money, all the money that was raised after the election, $250 million. Now, about $10 million of that was spent on litigation. But, but he was asked, Hey, where did the other $240 million go? Now, Donald Trump Jr. was not able to answer that. He said he didn't know. So, definitely more questions than answers on that topic.Then it came to these text messages that he sent to former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows on January 6. CNN has previously reported on many of these. But, Amara, we're getting new details. According to these transcripts. Donald Trump Jr. acknowledges texting former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows on January 6 saying that his father, then President Trump, had to \"condemn this expletive\" and that Meadows needed to press his father to condemn what was going on at the Capitol. Investigators pressed Donald Trump Jr. on why he went through Meadows and why didn't just - he just reach out to his father directly. He noted that his father doesn't really text and he couldn't really reach out to him directly. He also confirms that he told Meadows to \"go to the mattresses\", confirming that is a godfather reference, to try to get his father to condemn the Capitol attack. Now, interestingly, when Donald Trump Jr. was pressed on whether he believed that it was his father's supporters who were carrying out this violence, he sort of demurred and said that he blamed the media for this violence. But, Amara, one thing that we keep seeing again and again in many of these transcripts, as they're being released, is Mark Meadows, as a central figure in all of this, via these text messages, people trying to get unsuccessfully to the former president, efforts to get pardons. Of course, these other revelations we got the other day about the former chief of staff of burning allegedly documents in his office. He is clearly, based on all these witness transcripts, a central figure in the January 6 investigation, but of course, they didn't get a chance to ask him any questions because he'd declined to sit down across from the Committee.",

Thank you so much, Paula.Also, this hour, a swarm of Russian missiles and drones bombarding targets across Ukraine, all too familiar scenes of devastation in Kyiv, bulldozers clearing debris where homes once stood, after nearly 70 bombs rained down on cities and civilians. Giant swathes of the country are now in the dark. Let's get right to Kyiv and CNN's Ben Wedeman.

      "sentences": "Ben Wedeman, appreciate it. Thank you.Joining us now, CNN Military Analyst, and retired Air Force Colonel, Cedric Leighton. Cedric, first off, tell us more about this massive missile barrage from Russia. Why is it happening? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, U.S. AIR FORCE (RETD.), &amp; CNN MILIRATY ANALYST: So, Amara, the basic idea behind this is, this is part of Russia's strategy to go after the civilian infrastructure. We've talked a lot about this. But, what they're doing now is they're really concentrating on the energy grid. So, they want to make sure that Ukraine, as Ben said, is really pitched in darkness for this New Year's celebration, New Year being an incredibly important holiday, of course, in both Ukraine and Russia. And, the other thing to think about here is that they're doing this all across the entire country. So, they're trying to show that no matter where you are in Ukraine that you're going to get hit by these missiles, or at least be impacted by them, and your energy supplies are going to be at risk. So, that's what they're doing. They're trying to, in essence, go in after the civilian infrastructure in order to really impact morale, and that morale, then the idea would be that they would impact the Ukrainian war effort. I don't think it is working. But, that's the Russian plan at the moment.",

And, the reason I say that, Amara, is yes, you're going to find pockets where people are going to be discouraged in places like Kyiv or Kharkiv that are really impacted by this a lot. However, what it really does psychologically for a lot of people, and we've seen this in other conflicts as well, when they are bombed like this, they redouble their efforts at resistance. And, really what the Russians are doing is they're really making the Ukrainians into a very big resistant force, and that means not only are the people in uniform resisting, but the entire civilian population, everything from zero to 98 plus is going to really go after the Ukrainians - after the Russians that is as long as they're able, and that's really the difference here. It's a very bad strategy for the Russians to use at this point.",

But, this time yesterday, we couldn't even walk through this area because it was filled with bags. If you're new to this story, just check out your screen and you can see what this area looked like for the past several days. The majority of those bags were moved to a secure location on site here at the airport. We are told that the luggage will be transported to its original final destination. It's unclear whether or not the bags will be loaded onto planes going out or if the bags will be shipped.Meanwhile, Southwest laying out steps for travelers who were impacted to take when it comes to reimbursement. The airline says they don't want travelers calling because the phone lines are overloaded. Instead, they want everything done online. For example, if you're missing your luggage, if you want to request reimbursement for your flight or canceled flight, you can do all of that online. And, they have forms for you to fill out. Some travelers say it doesn't help them at all because they didn't get to where they needed to be. For example, a woman we heard from in Baltimore, was trying to get to her sick grandmother. Her grandmother died on Tuesday, and she didn't make it. That's time she will never get back. That's a one sad story someone shared with us. On the flip side, we have seen people rejoicing here at Midway. See for yourself. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Adrienne Broaddus, thank you so much for your latest reporting.Well, another big change for travelers, the U.S. will start requiring all travelers coming from China to show a negative COVID test before their flight. The policy goes into effect January 5. COVID cases have exploded in China after the country lifted the bulk of its zero COVID policy restrictions. Joining me now is Dr. William Schaffner. He is a Professor for the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Thanks for your time Dr. Schaffner. So, what's your reaction? Is it the right call, the decision? DR. WILLIAM SCHAFFNER, PROFESSOR, DIVISION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES, VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER: Amara, I think it's a very prudent thing to do, and the main reason the CDC has made this new obligation of testing people coming into this country is that we're concerned about new variants cropping up in China. With all of the spread of the virus, the virus keeps multiplying, and that's when new variants can crop up, perhaps worst case scenario, a variant that could evade the protection of our current vaccines and therapeutics. But, the Chinese government is not sharing the genetic information about these viruses with the rest of the world. So, at the moment, what we're saying is, should a new variant crop up in China unless we're testing? Well, we won't be able to find it. So, at the moment, prudence rains. I think, if you'd like to come from China into the United States, you have to have a negative test.",

We know that of the 39, 11 were found in a house. So, that - that's really telling in terms of houses losing power, and the like.You also spoke about the apology we heard Mark Poloncarz deliver to the Mayor of Buffalo, Byron Brown. He had been criticizing him publicly, saying that he wasn't doing enough coordinating, that he hadn't been on the calls with the county and other municipalities. He did something really, really interesting. We don't often see this from politicians. He apologized not once but several times about losing his focus, and these families who are having to deal with deaths and even missing loved ones, they don't deserve to have him change the focus to a conflict like that. And so, he says, he apologizes for losing focus. But, citywide, I should tell you that the city is now getting back to normal. The driving man is over. There is still an advisory in effect. The mayor said this morning there were over 600 pieces of equipment out removing snow. We also heard some good news from the county executive. We've been talking in the last few days about concerns about flooding, and he said that it appears that those - that the flooding concerns are going to be minimized.
