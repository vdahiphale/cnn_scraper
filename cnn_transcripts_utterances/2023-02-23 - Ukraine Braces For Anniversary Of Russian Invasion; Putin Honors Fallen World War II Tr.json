Tonight, we are hours away from a somber anniversary of thenight Russia fired the first missiles and rolled the first tanks, of course, into Ukraine, sparking the biggest land war in Europe since World War II. Well, the U.S. calls it an attack on democracy itself. And Russia's actions have once again thrown major world powers into a stark divide. It's been a year stained with blood and grief. We have seen grave human rights abuses, entire towns leveled, countless families, homes, as well as lives utterly destroyed. There's a generation of Ukrainian children scarred by war. And it sparked a massive migration, with more than 8 million refugees fleeing to safety right across Europe. The war has brought Ukraine closer to the West than ever before -- closer, I should say. And the EU and NATO nations are rallying behind Kyiv and working to bring it into the fold. EU leaders promising they will not rest until Ukraine wins and is rebuilt. Well, tonight, Ukraine's allies are holding vigils. In France, as you can see right there, the Eiffel Tower is lit in blue and yellow, the colors of the Ukrainian flag. But despite solidarity and resolve, the war goes on with no end in sight. Russian bombs are still falling. The frontline is a long, bloody mess, and Ukrainian cities are under attack. I want to go now to Ukraine, where we find our Sam Kiley. And Sam, you are in eastern Ukraine, of course, where we have seen Russian forces really concentrate their offensive. What are you hearing from Ukrainian forces on the ground there, a year into this war? What is their assessment?",

Andthe reason that they believe that, Isa, which is it might have been a boast that they would have made perhaps in the middle of the Summer last year, and they have been a little hollow, is that they have proved that they can do so. They managed to recapture the whole of -- almost the whole of Kharkiv Province, at least, all of the areas that were captured by Russia in their very rapid advance. They have held the Russians at bay here in the east of the country. And in November, they captured 40 percent of Kherson province crucially with the Kherson -- the city itself, the only provincial capital that the Russians captured at the beginning of their war in their very rapid advance. Now, at the same time, the Russians are now picking on those frontline towns and villages, whether it's Kherson or Kupiansk, much further north. Every day, civilians have been targeted. Civilian areas are being targeted whilst of course, the Russians are focusing their military rage on the military mission, which is here in the east, to try to at least capture the rest of the so-called Donbas Province. But the Ukrainians believe that they can win, they know that they've got to win, quickly. This is really important to them. The government does not admit -- does not even talk about casualties. But I can tell you anecdotally, from the people that we've been talking to over many months here, but particularly in the last 5 weeks or so, which is the period we've been here, we are hearing again and again that the casualties among the Ukrainians are high. They are paying a very bitter price indeed for just holding the Russians at bay. And that gives added energy, I think, to their demands and pleas for the strategic weapons they want to be able to force the Russians back, perhaps cause a collapse in the Russian lines before more Ukrainians have to die, and that is a phrase they use frequently, Isa.",

And you know, the Russian troops that we saw there were very confident, they thought they were going to win that thing within a couple of days. Now, of course, in the meantime, there have been all of these setbacks, some of which Sam was talking about for the Russian military.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  This fight for Vuhledar right now is one of the most important and difficult in the country. While the fight for Bakhmut is largely symbolic, this is a very strategic fight for both sides. Vuhledar is unique and that it sits at the intersection of two main active fronts in Ukraine, the southern and the eastern front. That is why Russia wants to try to push through here to launch an offense into Donbas. It is believed that this is one of their shaping operations, the beginning of a larger offensive to come in the next few weeks. But they are struggling very badly right now. They have lost a huge amount of men and armored vehicles as they try to cross fields, including minefields, where the Ukrainians have been able to inflict a huge amount of damage on their troops. At the same time, the Russians are absolutely pummeling this town. You can see all around me, these are soviet-era apartment blocks now largely empty, the residents have fled and almost every single one destroyed in varying degrees. All of the windows have been blown out. Craters here in the ground where children used to play. Ukrainians have the benefit of the higher ground here and these buildings to use in the fighting. But as with so many of the battles here in Eastern Ukraine, it is a fight of attrition, who can hold out the longest. The Ukrainian side saying they need more ammunition to be able to keep the Russians at bay, to keep them from advancing -- Alex Marquardt, CNN, Vuhledar, in Eastern Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
