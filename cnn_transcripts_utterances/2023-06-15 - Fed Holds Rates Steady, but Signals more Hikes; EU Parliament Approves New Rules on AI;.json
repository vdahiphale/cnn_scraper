Another quarter point to the ECB raised China though the outlier time for rate cuts it says. A complex economic and geopolitical picture but today will appraise or at least Binky Chadha well, he's the Chief Global Strategist at Deutsche Bank, and he will be joining us shortly. And from Central Bank actions to changing superpower factions, Ian Bremmer, the Founder of GZERO media joins us to discuss what he calls the new digital world order. And what it will mean for us all perfect timing amid some serious artificial intelligence alarm. Although I have to say it's less alarm and more caution really, I think across global stock markets, U.S. futures are weaker as investors pass the Federal Reserve's rate pause announcement. Powell and company hitting the snooze button after 10 straight hikes higher. But that alarm call could be coming soon. Powell says the July meeting remains live. And officials are penciling in the possibility at least two more rate hikes to battle still sticky inflation. Lots of debate today too, though over whether Powell can should and will then follow through. Meanwhile, there's no go slow in the land of the Euro. Stocks mostly lower there too, as the European Central Bank announces its eight consecutive rate hike and more hikes likely to follow the ECB of course playing catch up. With the Fed its borrowing costs still more than one percentage point below Fed levels. To Asia now out and a higher HANG SENG as Beijing lowers a key policy rate for the first time in almost a year as growth there slows weak new Chinese data today too, with youth unemployment. We still to discuss this a lot hitting fresh all-time highs, a busy day indeed for Central Bank economics. And Christine Romans joins us now, Christine, great to have you with us, a unanimous vote to skip this meeting, which was what you and I were discussing. But there were a few pointers there that were at least giving investors pause for thought the possibility of more hikes but also suggesting that if you're hoping for rate cuts, get over it.",

There'll be a pause here, as you rightly point out July is a live meeting, which means there could be a rate hike on the on the horizon there. And I think what's really interesting, especially coupled with this morning's U.S. economic data, this economy is resilient. I mean, it's holding in there after all of those rate hikes. They raise their growth targets for the year. They lowered their unemployment rate targets for the year. And this morning, we had strong retail sales, decent retail sales, I'll call it and you know jobless claims that are still at historic lows. So you have this American economy that is sort of impervious in some ways to these 10 rate hikes. I almost wonder after seeing what the EU did today, you know, maybe it wasn't the right call to pause at this point, because the U.S. economy has been pretty, pretty strong and chugging along here.",

They took it by force last year it has been used since then, as a Russian fire base. It is absolutely on the front line of this war. It is used to fire that its location is used as a firebase to shoot artillery in particular to Ukrainian targets on the other side of the Dnipro River or the dam indeed that on the Dnieper River there, then over to a Kakhovka dam. But the other aspect of this is that as the Ukrainians advanced that location is going potentially to become much more dangerous, much more fraught, much more possibility of some kind of accidental damage being done to this nuclear facility is in a kind of warm. Well, one of the reactors is in warm shut down and the others are in a cold shutdown. So it's relatively safe. It very difficult to breach one of those reactors, but there's lots of nuclear material around there that could suffer damage and leak and do certainly a degree of local damage.

      "sentences": "Yes. Good morning, Julia. And thank you for having me. I wouldn't characterize the meeting aslargely expected. So you know, our economics review is penciled in a rate hike in July. And that, you know, currently is a forecast for, you know, the last hike, so to speak. So, I think, you know, what is important to sort of keep in mind is that, even though we are already in the middle of this year, what is fresh in everybody's minds is what happened last year. And I think the important point to note is that, you know, the big sell off that we saw in equities and risk assets, in general had been our view as much to do, if not more. Or, you know, almost entirely to do with the volatility and the aggressiveness and the speed with which they moved. And as Powell himself noted yesterday, they've already raised rates, you know, by five percentage points. And what they're talking about now is much smaller increments. So if you take the speed and the volatility view, which we would argue is what explains the big sell off that we had last year? You know, it's a reason for volatility to come down. And if you look at equities, for example, the S&amp;P 500, or even better, the S&amp;P 500 equal weighted. We will see that it's been pretty well glued really over the last year or so to, you know, an indicator of rates volatility, the move index, and quite a bottom line from yesterday's meeting, is it the move only comes out, you know, once a day, at the end of the day, and what did the move do yesterday, it fell basically to the bottom of the range to small move. But, you know, relative to history, I would say rates ball still remains very elevated. So it has room to call. And what the meeting yesterday did is it did not increase the move is the way that I would put it, and this move and rates volatility that's really been a driver of equities and risk assets.",

As Investors review the read Fed rate hike pause, the Fed as we've been discussing morning, it will raise rates at least another two times this year due to persistently high core inflation.

And also, none of the CEOs were polled, none of them are worried about AI outsmarting humanity outsmarting humans and wiping out humanity in the next five years. But I don't know I was kind of startled to see that 8 percent are worried about a potential existential threat posed by AI in the next in five years and 34 percent in 10 years. That is a lot. Jeff Sonnenfeld, the Yale Professor known as The CEO Whisperer, he told me that he found these findings; these survey results, \"Dark and alarming\". And they do come after a number of high profile warnings. Recently, we had dozens of AI leaders and academics warn about a potential existential risk posed by AI. And also Geoffrey Hinton, the godfather of AI, he has spoken out about the risks that eventually AI could, potentially outsmart humanity and maybe even manipulate humans. And he pointed out that there are very few examples of things in life, where you have the more intelligent thing getting controlled by the less intelligent thing, which I think is a fair point. Also, we should note here, though, Julia, that the doomsday scenarios, of course get all the headlines. But you know we do have some more immediate, more pressing issues when it comes to AI right now in terms of the risks around misinformation and the impact to jobs.

The Chinese project most of their power commercially, because their state capitalist, even though their economy is smaller than the U.S., the Americans project most of their power, actually militarily.

And when you meet people that run these new technology companies that are driving AI, and some of them aren't so new, some of them are that it's not like they have horrible values. They don't care about their families, those bad citizens. Rather, it's that 98 percent of their time, and their headspace, and their resources and their labor, and the labor of their employees are just being oriented towards making sure they can build it as fast as they can, so that other companies don't destroy them. It's a completely creative destruction, entrepreneurial Doggiie Dog World. And so they're not thinking about how you're going to regulate it, or implications for society or cold war between the Americans and Chinese. And that would be fine if the government's had the expertise or the institutions to think about those things themselves, but they don't. And it's true that governments have more power overall than companies do. Of course they do. But they need to have the institutions, the framework, and the expertise, to be able to regulate them. And that doesn't exist right now. Keep in mind, Julia, like six months ago, there wasn't a head of state I spoke with that would ask me about AI, it just didn't come up in a single conversation, and not from the multilateral is not the G7, not G20. Today, it's coming up in every single conversation, literally every conversation, but there's a huge head start from these technology companies. As we look forward the next one to three years, this space will continue to be dominated by a very small number of very powerful, very rich men that are driving how AI is going to be deployed and experimented real time on people like you, me and our kids.",

The jobs market to your point as well. There was a part of the TED Talk, though, that I really loved. And it sort of takes us back a little bit in this conversation. And it said, the tech companies increasingly define our emotional identities and lots of that's determined by their algorithms. And the big question that you asked and you've sort of already posed it. The question is what do they want? And what do they do with this power? And do they act responsibly, whether it's unleashing AI, whether it's holding the data that they have, or as a result of our access to their platforms? And I think that's the question to be asking about all of these in what you've defined as a sort of techno polar moment. And so much power shifts to the hands of a small group of companies away from governments. And they have to work out how they it back.",

And I think today, the most powerful individuals on the planet, may well be the people that control these AI tools, and for thetime being, at least, and that may not be sustainable. It's not, these aren't the government actors. These are actually these technology players. And I think that's why the governments are suddenly paying such extraordinary attention from a starting spot stop of zero. But it's also the questions that we need to be asking. It's not just about can the markets continue to operate properly, when so much disinformation from AI is being flooded into the system? Can we have democratic elections, when we don't know what real and fake news happens to be driven by AI bots? But it's also about who we are, as people. And this idea that, you know, when you and I grew up, our emotions were driven by, our identities were driven by nature or nurture, how we were raised and our genetics and increasingly today, it's actually also driven by algorithm. And young people, when they're have their faces in their phones. And you know, when they buy their new Apple vision, and they're being intermediated directly by algorithms, that are how they perceive the world around them and the people around them, that are going to change who they are as people. And when we roll out a new vaccine, even during a national global emergency of a pandemic, we test those vaccines first, before we release them, a new GMO for food, we test them first, before we released them. We are releasing these AI algorithms, real time on 8 billion people in the planet on young people. And we don't know what the implications will be for their development. And what we're testing for is addictiveness. We're testing; we're doing AB testing on what's more effective and driving profitability. That's a perverse thing and when governments need to stop that, because of the business models of the corporation's world.",

Does AI lead us into some kind of digital Cold War in to go back to the sort of geopolitics of the beginning of the talk and where we started here?
