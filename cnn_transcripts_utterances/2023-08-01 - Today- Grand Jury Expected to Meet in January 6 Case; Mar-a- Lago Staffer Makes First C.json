The grand jury investigating the former president's efforts to overturn the 2020 election is expected to meet this morning. Also, newest defendant in the special counsel's classified documents case is out on bail this morning. Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos de Oliveira made his appearance in a Miami courtroom on Monday. He didn't enter a formal plea to the four charges in the grand jury indictment, including conspiracy to obstruct justice and lying to the FBI. More now from CNN's Jessica Schneider. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOHN IRVING, REPRESENTING TRUMP'S CO-DEFENDANT:  The Justice Department has unfortunately decided to bring these charges against Mr. De Oliveira. Now it's time for them to put their money where their mouth is. JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Carlos de Oliveira leaving the federal courthouse in Miami Monday escorted by his lawyer and federal agents. A 20-year employee at Mar-a-Lago, de Oliveira walked out of court on $100,000 bond after being charged along with former Donald Trump and Trump's aide close aide Walt Nauta, with attempting to delete security footage from Mar-a-Lago after it was subpoenaed by a federal grand jury. De Oliveira alleging telling the director of I.T. at Mar-a-Lago, the boss, an apparent reference to Donald Trump, wanted to delete the server where security footage was stored. CNN also reporting that another Mar-a-Lago employee received a target letter from federal prosecutors. Yuscil Tavares oversees the property surveillance cameras and has met with investigators in recent weeks. It's unclear if he is cooperating. So far, he is not facing charges. But at least some of the allegations in the latest indictment were based on information he provided.",

And that these speakerphone calls along with a dinner where Joe Biden was present is proof that the president was more intimately involved in his son's business deals than was previously known.

We're talking about three drone attacks on Moscow in the space of just over a week. So I think that is significant.There is no claim of responsibility from Ukraine explicitly. Russia has explicitly blamed them. But we do have this morning a tweet from a prominent Ukrainian official, the adviser to the head of President Zelenskyy's office who says Moscow is rapidly getting used to full- fledged war, which will soon finally move to the territory of the author's of the war. He goes on to say that everything that will happen in Russia, objective historical process, more unidentified drones, more collapse, more civil conflict, more war seems to suggest this may be a part of a process to destabilize Russia. And that may well be the point here literally and figuratively shattering the facade that's been created for the Russian people that everything is going well, that this is a special military operation on the front lines miles away. Certainly from the Russian capital that Ukraine is losing in its counteroffensive. This really does, as you say, bring it home. And we did, of course, hear from President Zelenskyy on Sunday saying the war is gradually returning to Russian soil. It will involve symbolic centers, he says, and military bases. I think when you talk about Moscow, that's certainly a symbolic center, but there were military targets allegedly in play as well. Overnight, Russia claiming it thwarted a maritime drone attack on two patrol vessels of its Black Sea fleet. It says it destroyed those maritime drones. But certainly seems these attacks are intensifying. Russia in response promising to intensify attacks of its own which we have seen play out over the last 24 hours. We are in a period in this car of escalation on both sides -- Omar.",
