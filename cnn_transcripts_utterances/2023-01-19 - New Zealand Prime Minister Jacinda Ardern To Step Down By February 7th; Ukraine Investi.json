KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): You know, this was a bombshell announcement and it came as a surprise to many people inside New Zealand and all around the world. Earlier today at this press conference in Napier, we heard from the Prime Minister of New Zealand Jacinda Ardern. As she said she doesn't have the energy to seek reelection in October. She said that in the last 5-1/2 years, she's been serving as prime minister in New Zealand. It has -- you know, she has given her absolute all and it has taken a lot from her. She added that she will stand down as a leader of her country in early February. And she also had this to say, take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, the opinion polls here have really plummeted for her government and for her personally. So, you know, yes, after that COVID crisis, she won 50 percent of the vote, which was an historic high, but in recent months, her support has gone down to about 32 percent. So, about a third of her support is gone, and it's going to be a very tough election for her government when we've got an Election Day coming up in October. And I think she knew that it was very unlikely she'd be able to win that, so she's gone now. Better to go now then to be turfed out by voters I think.",

Xi Jinping said he's worried that COVID virus could spread to rural areas with already poor medical facilities as millions prepare to leave the big cities and head home. CNN's Ivan Watson has details. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) IVAN WATSON, CNN, SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): A population on the move. After three years of restrictions due to their government's war on COVID, Chinese can finally travel again just in time for the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday. In pre-pandemic times, this was described as the world's largest annual human migration. I haven't been home in three years says this man at the main Beijing train station. Millions of Chinese people are traveling as COVID-19 spreads out of control. Chinese officials say COVID infections have passed their peak in many parts of the country. But there are clearly still concerns about the scale of the outbreak. For example, here in Hong Kong, authorities require all of these travelers arriving on high speed trains from mainland China to get negative COVID tests first, before they can cross the border. Last month, Beijing abruptly scrapped its strict zero COVID policy, the ensuing surge of sick people putting a strain on hospitals and health workers. Several social media videos showed nurses sick with COVID collapsing on the job. I felt unwell says this nurse in Shandong. It had been a week that I had COVID-19 until that day when I finally collapsed. Over the weekend, health officials who once prided themselves on keeping COVID out of China abruptly raised the COVID death toll since early December from several dozen COVID deaths to nearly 60,000 people killed by COVID. But the Official U-turn on COVID has had other unintended consequences. At a factory in Chongqing workers pelted police with what appeared to be boxes of COVID tests, some biotech companies, withholding salaries or laying off workers after the government suddenly stopped demanding the population take millions of COVID tests a day.",

Now, Greenland has a thick sheet of ice on top of it. It's one of the biggest ice sheets on the planet. And these scientists dug down into the ice, and they took -- they extracted some ice. It's called an ice core. And when you take the ice out of the ice sheet and take it back to your laboratory, you're able to tell what the atmosphere looked like in the past, what the temperatures were like, and you are able to also figure out how long back in time the atmosphere and temperatures existed, sort of like the rings on a tree. If you cut a tree open you count the rings back in time. We can do that with ice course. So these scientists use ice cores to measure temperature, and the information that they got from Greenland is, as you said, pretty dire. It's as warm as it's been, or warmer that it's been in over 1,000 years, and that should give us all pause.",
