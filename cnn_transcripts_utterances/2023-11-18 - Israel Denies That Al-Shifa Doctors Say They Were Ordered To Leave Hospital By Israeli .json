      "sentences": "Hello, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me this Saturday. I'm Fredricka Whitfield. And we begin with new questions emerging following Israel's raid on Gaza's largest hospital.Video evidence analyzed by CNN, suggests Israel Defense Forces may have rearranged weapons found at the Al-Shifa Hospital before international news crews visited the scene. And it comes after the IDF claims, they raided the facility in an operation against Hamas earlier this week. Israeli defense officials have long claimed the hospital housed a large-scale command center and Hamas tunnels, like the one that they said was revealed in this video. Well, doctor say they were ordered to evacuate Al-Shifa hospital by the Israel military through the IDF. Though, rather, the IDF disputes that claim. A head doctor says six doctors are staying at the medical complex to treat around 120 patients, two vulnerable to evacuate. Meantime, the first plane carrying children from Gaza with urgent medical needs to the UAE today. And it comes as the Palestinian Authority's ministry of health says only nine of Gaza's 35 hospitals are still operating. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is monitoring all the latest on the ground there from Tel Aviv. Jeremy, you're at the scene of a rally that is about to begin and supported the 237 hostages still held captive by Hamas. What are people saying there?",

We know that there has been a deal on the table to potentially free women and children, civilians held hostage in Gaza in exchange for a multi-day pause in the fighting. And certainly, we know that, that is something the Israeli government has been considering. And so, these hostage families over five days marched from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Tens of thousands of people were in Jerusalem today in front of the prime minister's office to pressure him to reach a deal to bring some of these hostage family's home. And now, we are here in Tel Aviv, right next to what has become known as hostage plaza, where there have been regular demonstrations to pressure the Israeli government to bring these hostages home. It is right in front of the defense ministry here. And we know that some of the families of these hostages are set to meet with members of Israel's wartime Cabinet, including Benny Gantz, Yoav Gallant, the current defense minister, and others. We don't know that the Israeli prime minister at this hour is going to be in that meeting. But following that meeting, those families are expected to come here. We're already were seeing hundreds of people -- we're expecting thousands of people to continue to flood in here to raise their voices and demand that these hostages be released. Fred?",

It made these claims for weeks that one of the reasons the main reasons it was closing in on Shifa Hospital, was that it was allegedly site of a command center, something that the White House also said that separate U.S. intelligence backed up.Someplace where Hamas had a nexus of its operations. But in making those public claims, Israel also handed Hamas an opportunity to move whatever it had in that location away. There is a huge tunnel network that Hamas in Israel have talked about, that Israel has found evidence of underneath Shifa, as it is underneath many buildings throughout the entire Gaza site. So, in those tunnels, they can move, say, was it a bunch of computers? Was it a bunch of communications equipment? Was it a bunch of weaponry, they had days of Israel's advanced above ground to move that sort of thing below ground. And what Israel has also had to do to explore those tunnels to find this evidence is because they've already found many of these tunnels have been booby trapped, and left wired with explosives of various sorts. Instead of sending troops down they are sending down robot drones, things like that. And whatever those drones have been able to find, it's not the pictures that the public was expecting to see. And it's a public relations coup of sorts for Hamas.",

That while they had a goal that could take weeks, if not months, of taking out all of the Hamas' military capability and its political capability, that the pressure on them would inexorably increase.It seems that the Israeli Defense Forces had hoped that by taking Shifa, they would have a win on the public relations to the information war side of this fight that would buy them some time to keep pursuing their military operations. Instead, since so far, they haven't been able to produce that, and what they have produced, now, it seems there have been some soldiers on the ground doing something with that equipment, maybe trying to please their bosses. But it looks to from open-source reporting of those photographs, as CNN has analyzed, that someone tampered with the evidence. So, that further damages their credibility. And that's going to increase the calls worldwide for some form of ceasefire, some form of longer pause in fighting, and the White House is inevitably going to have to pressure Israel to follow through.",

Now, the campaign itself has been quite upfront about the purpose of this, in fact, an affidavit that was signed by Eric Adams earlier this week, the mayor's campaign, saying that it is \"necessitated by, and intended to defray, legal expenses in connection with inquiries by the office of the U.S. Attorney,\" General, rather, the \"U.S. attorney,\" I should say, \"for the Southern District of New York related to the operations of the Adams' 2021 mayoral campaign committee.\"Now, we should mention that according to that guidance had been posted by the city's conflict of interest board, city employees are actually permitted to establish these kinds of funds to pay for any mounting legal bills. However, there are certainly restrictions and regulations that they would adhere to not only with that board, essentially monitor that fun, but also, here is just a few of the restrictions that the campaign will have to adhere to, for example, donations, individual donations will not be able to exceed $5,000, all of their legal expenses will have to be disclosed to the board. Adams cannot solicit money from subordinates or anybody essentially doing business with the city. And then, finally, this fund cannot accept any donations for any companies or any corporation. So, it is fairly restrictive in terms of who can donate and exactly just how much. Those are just a few of the restrictions. And, of course Adams since the beginning maintains that he has not been accused of any wrongdoing. He did, however, retain the services of a private attorney as this investigation continues to press forward. And finally, as you mentioned, this comes after new information came to light that now shows that two additional people with direct ties to Adams had their home searched earlier this month, not only a second eight of his, but also that official with Turkish Airlines.
