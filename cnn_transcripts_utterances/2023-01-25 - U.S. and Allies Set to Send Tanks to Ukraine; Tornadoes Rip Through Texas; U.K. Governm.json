Tonight, President Biden sends a message to theworld allies are sending tanks to Ukraine strictly for self-defense as Russia calls them a dangerous escalation. Then tornadoes ripped across parts of the United States. We'll show you the damage and the cleanup. And the U.K. government has dismissed recommendations designed to make life easier for menopause sufferers. Some argue the measures could backfire women in the workplace. Still others say, they are unfair to men. We'll discuss. Well, after weeks of negotiations, pleas, as well as pressure from European allies, the U.S. and Germany have just announced they are sending dozens of tanks to Ukraine. Germany is pledging to send, of its 14 Leopard 2 tanks, which it describes as the first step according to the German defense minister, those Leopards could be on the battlefield in just about three months. And a short time ago, U.S. President Joe Biden announced he will give 31 Abrams battle tanks to Ukraine, and at least, six other countries have promised as well to send tanks. Mr. Biden says it's clear proof really that nothing will divide Ukraine's allies. Have a listen to what he said earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's very significant. It opens the doors for more weapons upgrades that the Ukrainians say they so desperately need. Now, roughly speaking, if you take into account, the Germans are talking about being able to stand up to battalions of tanks, ultimately, that's about 80 with the 30 pledged from the United States, 14 Challenger from the United Kingdom, you're getting up to just over a 100 tanks of the 300 to 400 that the Ukrainians say they desperately need. In particularly, because they fear a Spring offensive coming from the Russians. That said, they have also got plans of their own to maintain their own momentum, and try and push forward and rid the country of the Russians. This is how the Ukrainian defense minister reacted to this development with Christiane Amanpour earlier on today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "That's right. President Biden began and ended his remarks by talking about the unity in this NATOalliance, as it relates to providing weaponry and support to Ukraine. And the subtext of that unity, of course, is the fact that the only way that the United States was able to get Germany to provide those crucial Leopard tanks to Ukraine, and to allow other countries that have Leopard tanks to export those tanks to Ukraine was for the United States to have some tank-skin in the game, and to send its own tanks to Ukraine as well. The United States, for weeks, we've heard officials as recently as just a couple of days ago talking about the fact that while these M1 Abrams tanks are very sophisticated, very effective tanks, they are also very difficult to operate and to maintain. And that they believe that essentially, the message from the United States was, these tanks aren't necessarily going to be the effective response to Ukraine's tank needs. Instead, they were hoping that Germany would send these Leopard tanks which are easier to maintain and to operate. But ultimately, what was very clear was that, over the course of the last week, the diplomatic discussions between the United States and Germany intensified to the point where it became clear that Germany would not send those tanks unless the U.S. also send the M1 Abrams tanks. And so, when you hear President Biden say -- he was asked this question about whether that is indeed the gambit, he said, \"I want to make sure that we're all together.\" And that is ultimately the diplomatic way of saying that yes, we needed to get into this as well in order for Germany to come through here. But I do think, 30,000 foot here, this is a pretty significant moment --",

Really tailor the kinds of weaponry that it provides to the needs on the ground. Instead here, it's providing these tanks mainly as a diplomatic kind of a trading card, it seems. And then more broadly, the fact that these are very clearly offensive weapons that the United States and these European countries are going to be providing to Ukraine. And that adds a different dynamic, and it changes the calculus, of course, from the U.S., and that is why we're seeing these strongly-worded statements from Russian officials as well here. And finally, I just think it's important to note that President Biden really made an effort today to single out the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for praise. We've heard U.S. officials say that it's been remarkable to see the kind of shift in Germany's defense policy over the course of this war in Ukraine. And clearly, the United States and Germany had to work this out in order for Ukraine to get this. And it is according to defense officials, going to make a big difference on the ground, particularly, the provision of those German-made tanks.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JENS STOLTENBERG, SECRETARY-GENERAL, NATO:  Ukraine has the right for self- defense, and we have the right to support them in upholding that right. Because if President Putin wins, it's a tragedy for the Ukrainians, but it would be dangerous for us.

Ukraine may not become a member of NATO, but it would be armed by NATO, it will be trained by NATO, so its troops will be compatible with NATO forces. And this is why I think we've heard from the Russian ambassador to Washington overnight last night, the Russian ambassador to Germany today, essentially saying that this is not defensive, it's offensive. And this is -- this is crossing red lines. They -- both -- those ambassadors also spoken about the breakdown of trust, this huge breakdown of trust. It is slowly beginning to sink in, in Russian diplomatic circles. That this unity and sense of purpose and support of Ukraine isn't going away. And when Russians say the breakdown of trust, they seem to be deluding themselves, it would appear. Because no one trusts them anymore. The message hasn't gotten through, but it's getting through now. That doesn't mean that a more bloody phase of the war isn't going to be averted, but the message, the signaling that has to come from the diplomats to Putin, which are channels that are never normally breached, that's where we're at.",
