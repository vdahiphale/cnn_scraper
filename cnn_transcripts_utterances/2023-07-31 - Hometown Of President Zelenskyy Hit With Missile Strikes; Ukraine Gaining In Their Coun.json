Even then, his own national security, number two in the national security, Dmitry Medvedev, the former prime minister, former president, is saying, well, if Ukraine does make advances with its counteroffensives just as Nick was reporting there, then perhaps Russia will have to use its nuclear weapons.So, you know, on the one hand the Russian narrative is we're doing well, on the other hand is maybe we're not and we'll have to -- we'll have to up, you know, up our attacks to nuclear attacks. There's no evidence by the way that that's actually happening. But on the ground in Moscow, most people there, all they get is the Putin propaganda. They think the war is going well. Well, here, Ukraine is able to show them something else. Last weekend, there were also strikes in Moscow. A couple of weeks back, there were more strikes in Moscow as well. And we're also seeing in other places just over the border from Ukraine in Russia, vital military hubs, where Ukraine is also increasing its number of drone attacks there. Now, Russia's defense minister has said that they will respond, that they will double down back. The Kremlin is saying that this is all a sort of a desperate act by Ukraine to strike into Moscow. But it very clearly tries to puncture Putin's propaganda. Can it let all the air out? We'll know because the Russians still control the narrative. But it does get that message to Russians.

And one of the reasons they think Donald Trump is electable against Joe Biden is they think that Donald Trump already beat Joe Biden. They have completely bought into the big lie.

You've probably heard that term before, but let me show you. It's this ligament right here. It runs diagonally in your knee from the outside of your femur to the inside of your tibia. It's what helps players do this, lateral movement. And it's an injury now that has become almost synonymous with soccer, but remarkably more so among women.

So the NCAA data indicates that the risk for women is about three to four fold per male counterpart. GUPTA (voice-over): Holly Silvers-Granelli is the chair of Major League Soccer's Medical Assessment Research Committee. And this is a disparity she's been trying to draw attention to for decades. (on camera): What is going on? SILVERS-GRANELLI: We started looking at this data literally 23 years ago. We had determined that there's anatomic risk factors, there's hormonal risk factors, there's environmental risk factors, which would take into consideration are you playing on grass or turf or what type of cleat you're wearing? GUPTA (voice-over): The anatomy is also pretty fascinating. For starters, women's ACLs they're just smaller than men's. But look over here. Women also have a greater Q angle, that's the ratio of hip width to thigh length, which basically means this can happen. The body can more easily go into a knock knee position, making the ligament more vulnerable. (on camera): Just standing here, how are we different in terms of our biomechanics? SILVERS-GRANELLI: We know that women tend to be a little bit more quad dominant. We tend to be a little bit less underdeveloped on our back muscle groups. Also, when we tend to do things, we tend to do things more upright or erect than men do. Yes. GUPTA (voice-over): Yes, easy fixes for anyone, Holly says, an extra 10 minutes twice a week to reduce ACL injuries by around 70 percent. SILVERS-GRANELLI: So if we're running and we go to the side, we would plant and cut and then change direction, plant and cut. GUPTA (voice-over): The idea, strengthen the muscles around the ACL, play low and avoid the knock knee position. SILVERS-GRANELLI: This is engaging these muscles, which is your gluteus medius, and that's a massively great muscle to help control your lumbar spine and your pelvis when you're cutting and changing direction. So this is called a Nordic hamstring. GUPTA (on camera): Oh, yes, I feel that. SILVERS-GRANELLI: Yes. It's very hard. You'll feel your hamstrings engaged?",
