Sources telling CNN Fulton County investigators now have e-mails and text messages that directly connect members of Trump's legal team to the breach of a voting system in rural Coffee County.This new development coming as District Attorney Fani Willis prepares to present the case to a grand jury. She's expected to seek an indictment. of more than a dozen people as early as Tuesday. And that means this week, a former U.S. president could be facing criminal charges in four U.S. jurisdictions. We are covering all the latest developments in this, from the legal and investigative angles to this week's grand jury proceedings. And we begin with CNN's Zachary Cohen who helped break this exclusive reporting we just discussed. And Zach, start first with walking us through how significant this is, this evidence linking members of Trump's legal team to the breach of a voting system.",

Now, Coffee County is about 200 miles south of where we are right here in Fulton County, Georgia, where behind us, you know, court proceedings will play out next week.But this breach has become a central part, one of the central parts of Fani Willis's criminal investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election. And these text messages really lay out for us how Trump's attorneys help coordinate and were directly involved in a plan to try to recruit a local election official in Coffee County to get them --- to get the official to give them access to the voting systems there. And they ultimately did get access to those voting systems, unauthorized access. But that breach does date back, the planning for that does date back almost a week before these operatives gained access to the voting systems in Coffee County on January 7, 2021. You know, Rudy Giuliani, Trump's former personal attorney, his also former attorney Sidney Powell, these texts showed that they were integral and both funding and their awareness of the planning process itself. So, these texts do add another element and really do help prosecutors establish that link between Trump's close attorneys and what happened in Coffee County on January 7th, 2021.",

And what has kind of struck me is that when you're doing that, when you're prosecuting that sort of case, you really need -- everyone needs to be responsible for everybody else's mood. You have to tie the story in as you're talking about. So how will she do that and does this sort of evidence, these e-mails, text messages, we have the phone call, the recording with Trump asking for those to find the extra votes, how does that all play together?",

There is a federal model, but the states have also adopted it. And Georgia has one of the most powerful in the country. A long list of federal crimes plus 40 Georgia state crimes can allow Fani Willis to charge RICO. She's done it numerous times on high profile cases in the past and that's exactly what RICO does.It pulls together those three conspiracies we were talking about, including this hacking conspiracy into one large case that you can present to a jury where you say, hey, what was the point of those fake electoral certificates? What was the point of pressing Georgia officials to do the wrong thing? What was the point of the computer hacking? The same point. All of these people were working together in one, as we put it, enterprise in order for Donald Trump to allegedly hang on to his office when we know he had lost the election.

So, you don't want the first RICO case you give to a grand jury to involve the former president.I think that we know that two witnesses are confirmed, a journalist as well as former Lieutenant Governor Jeff Duncan for Tuesday. Prosecutors often -- she could have just put an investigator on the stand. She had a special grand jury that sat and produced a report. She could just give the grand jury that report. But prosecutors like to warm up a grand jury with live witnesses. So, we could very well see an indictment come out of that grand jury as soon as Tuesday. I've been a criminal defense lawyer for over three decades. Criminal law is full of surprises, no guarantees.

And an e-mail obtained by CNN, she spoke about messages, racist and sexualized messages that she's received and also similar vile voicemails. The man in charge of security around this local area, that is the sheriff of Fulton County, Patrick Labatt. He says that his team is prepared. Not only that, but he's been taking notes at other cities where Trump has been indicted and bring -- he's brought back those good security details back home here to Atlanta. Listen.
