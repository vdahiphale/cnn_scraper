      "sentences": "Today we saw Peru's president attempt to dissolve Congress to avoid impeachment that sparked the mass resignation of government officials in protest has ended with Pedro Castillo ousted from power under arrest, the country's first female president sworn into office.Supporters of President Castillo faced off against riot police as this tense drama unfolded in the Capitol, prosecutors accused Castillo of leading a criminal organization profiting from government contracts awarded to family and friends. In just hours before an impeachment vote, Wednesday, he attended to stage what many have described as a coup by trying to install an emergency government and rule by decree. The country's top court declared the move unconstitutional, the armed forces and police refuse to support him. And by days in, Castillo had been impeached, taken into custody for the alleged crime of rebellion. Here's Vice President Dina Boluarte is now Peru's Head of State in just five years. Reporter Stefano Pozzebon joins us now live from Bogota with the very latest on this. So, is this now over? Or is this just the beginning of a political crisis? STEFANO POZZEBON, JOURNALIST (on camera): I think John, we could say that this is just a new chapter in a cycle of political crises that have happened in Peru for at least five years. Boluarte, the first woman to hold the office is actually the sixth president in less than five years. Most of her recent predecessors did not complete their mandates too have been removed from office by Congress's action. You can understand what is her priority if you listen what she said in her very first day in her possession speech, take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DINA BOLUARTE, PRESIDENT OF PERU (through translator): I asked for a political truth to install a national unity government. This high responsibility calls upon us all, I am not asking for my government to be immune from scrutiny. What I am asking is time. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Among Castillo himself lasted a mayor of 14, 15 months after being sworn in at the end of July last year and facing already two congressional votes for impeaching him, and then resulted to these dramatic last minute gamble of dismantling Congress and calling for early election, completely against the constitution to avoid yet another vote.Perhaps as an international community, what he's specifically looking at right now is whether Boluarte can bring that stability that proves needs. In the last recent years, Peru has experienced that a gigantic economic boom, we've always talked offer these proven miracle that even though the political situation was an earthquake after an earthquake, the economic -- the economy still managed to grow and been stable. That is -- that has changed with the COVID-19 pandemic, the lockdown, the inflationary spiral, and everything that is going wrong with the economy this year in particular. So, the Peruvian economy is also taking a hit. And now there is a political crisis on top of a very serious economic crisis. And for the first time in Peruvian history, there is a woman at the helm trying to solve this problem. And what she's asking for us is time to be able to complete her mandate. Her mandate runs through the July 2026. And whether she will able to finish it or and break this trend is on everyone's guess, John. [00:05:10] VAUSE: The only thing more unpopular in Peru right now than Castillo is the Congress. But Stefano, thank you for a long day from you. Many more long days to come laid out. One of the largest police operations in post war Germany, 25 people have been arrested in nationwide raids accused of plotting to overthrow the government and return the Kaiser to power. (INAUDIBLE) believe this plot was such as aspirational where some of those arrested ex-military had operation capability as well. CNN's Fred Pleitgen has our report from Berlin. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The raid started in the early morning hours. Several thousand police officers searching dozens of locations across Germany, including the castle Waidmannsheil, home of the alleged ringleader. CNN has tried reaching out, but it's not clear if he has a legal representative. Based on current findings, the suspected terrorist group uncovered today was founded based on coup d'etat fantasies and conspiracy ideologies, Germany's interior minister said. The group is called Reichsburger or citizens of the Reich, and the alleged plotters were trying to overthrow the German government and install a monarchy with a prince at the helm, German authorities say. Militant Reichsburger are united by the hatred for democracy for our state and for people who support our community, the interior minister said. Conspiracy theorists have a massive following in Germany. In August 2020, tens of thousands including QAnon followers and right- wing extremists took to the streets of Berlin praising Russian leader Vladimir Putin and then U.S. President Donald Trump.

According to our information, individual members of this military arm were in the past active in the German armed forces.

And this is a spin off. And what I think is so interesting is when you have these conspiracy theories, in this case, the COVID restrictions were part of this. This looks very much like a carnival mirror reflection of some of the very types of strange conspiracies that we see here in the United States. Indeed, they travel in a similar stream, but they localize it to their own particular regional biases, as well as to charismatic figures that can take this forward. And as we've seen here in the United States with the insurrection, elected people, former military, this kind of thing is not -- is not the last thing you'll see out of Germany, or the United States. There have been plots before, not from the Reichsburger, well, we certainly seen cops and killing of a police officer last decade from this particular group.
