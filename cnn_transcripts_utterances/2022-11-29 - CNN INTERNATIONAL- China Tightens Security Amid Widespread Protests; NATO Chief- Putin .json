      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to CNN NEWSROOM. I am Zain Asher in New York. My colleague Max Foster is off today. Just ahead this hour, China tightened security. Police are out in force on the streets of many cities after widespread protests over the country's zero-COVID policies. We'll have all the details coming up for you later on the show.Plus, Team USA and Team Iran prepare to meet for a critical World Cup match as, of course, controversy swells both on and off the pitch. We will have a full report on that. And take a look at this. Hawaii's Big Island experiences a rare double, double volcanic eruption. We're going to give you all the best pictures from that. Right, China's top health officials are promising to modify some COVID-19 restrictions following a weekend of unprecedented protests against the country's zero-COVID policy. But they're also deflecting blame over the fallout as well. And then there's this, from Monday into Tuesday, so overnight, an overwhelming presence of the police on the streets and pretty much no sign, if you look closely at this video, of the angry demonstrations that shook the nation over the weekend. Now, as COVID spikes across the country, the Chinese government says that it is launching an action plan to boost vaccinations among the elderly. They're also adjusting COVID-19 measures that in some cases have kept citizens under very, very strict lockdowns for months at a time. Because that is, of course, how all of this started. CNN's Ivan Watson joins us live now from Hong Kong, where he's been sort of talking to protesters. So, Ivan, we know that some of the protests, in terms of what we're seeing on the streets there in China, some of the protests have died down, but there is a very strong security presence on the streets. Just walk us through it.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I think that what China witnessed, what was so striking was a weekend of these protests just erupting in city after city across the country, and now the state is kind of reacting. And on the one hand, we see a large police presence in the streets of Beijing and of Shanghai, hearing from people who participated in the protests of the weekend in Shanghai about police putting up barricades to prevent people from being able to gather on the sides of roads and of detentions.And even anecdotal accounts of police going through pedestrians' phones and looking for images to show whether or not they have been witnesses of the protests. We're hearing about universities starting to send students home early in the semester after some of the university campuses became the grounds for some of these demonstrations over the course of the weekend. And at the same time, we've been hearing from top health officials who've kind of been acknowledging maybe there were some excesses in the implementation of some of the COVID restrictions, saying that they're going to be adapting some of these to ensure that they don't put as much pressure on the populace. Also saying that they've announced an action plan to vaccinate the elderly who have much lower vaccination levels than the rest of the population in China. And again, it is all a response to this remarkable phenomenon we witnessed over the course of the weekend in Mainland China. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WATSON (voice-over): Anger on the streets of Chinese cities. The biggest nationwide display of discontent this tightly controlled country has seen in a generation. Protesters pushing back against police and the government's zero-COVID policy. The unrest triggered by a deadly fire in Urumqi, in China's western Xinjiang region last Thursday. Videos emerge of fire hoses barely reaching the blaze, which killed at least 10 people. Among them, Karminissahan Abdurahman (ph)and four of her children. WATSON (on-camera): What happened to your mother and your brothers and sisters? SHARAPAT MOHAMMAD ALI, FAMILY KILLED IN APARTMENT FIRE (through translation): The fire started on the 15th floor. The smoke poisoned my family. The government could not stop the fire in time. WATSON (voice-over): Two surviving adult children of Karminissahan to me from Turkey. Unable to see their family since 2017 due to the harsh crackdown. The government accused of putting up to 2 million of their fellow ethnic Uighurs and members of other minorities in internment camps. They say their loved ones were trapped in the building by COVID measures. MOHAMMAD MOHAMMAD ALI, FAMILY KILLED IN APARTMENT KILLED (through translation): They could not escape because the fire escape was blocked and the fire escape to the roof of the building was also blocked. [08:05:00] WATSON (voice-over): Accusation CNN cannot independently confirm, but Chinese authorities have been seen literally locking residents into buildings. Outrage over the Urumqi fire, compounded by previous deadly incidents in recent months directly linked to COVID prevention. Though CNN verified 16 protests in eleven Chinese cities this weekend, a Chinese government official told a journalist, they just didn't happen. ZHAO LIJAN, CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESPERSON (through translation): What you mentioned does not reflect what actually happened. China has been following the dynamic zero-COVID policy and has been making adjustments based on realities on the ground. WATSON (on-camera): On Monday, the white papers that have become a symbol of the protests in Mainland China spread hereto Hong Kong, where these small groups of demonstrators are holding a vigil for what they say are the victims of China's zero-COVID policy.",

Meanwhile, siblings Mohammad and Sharapat cannot even pray for closure after suffering the unimaginable loss of five immediate members of their family. (on-camera): Will you go home for the funeral of your family? M. ALI: We want to attend the funeral of our family members. But if we went back now, China will put us in jail or even torture us.

Those two siblings, they hadn't seen their loved ones in Xinjiang, in China, since 2017 because of that mass crackdown, and they couldn't even make phone calls to their own mother and siblings. And they discovered that these family members died after seeing their bodies on social media.They say that their father and another surviving brother were taken away years ago to internment camps. And they don't even know how to geta message to them that five immediate members of their family died in this terrible fire. Now, moving back to the reaction to these protests, one of the strangest developments has involved a stationary company in China called M&amp;G Stationery. It has more than 80,000 retail outlets across the country. And on social media in China, a statement came out where it announced on Monday a ban on the sale of A4 paper, printer paper, stationery, presumably because those pieces of paper became a symbol for the protest. The company has since denied that they've banned the sale, but we are hearing anecdotally that you can't order paper online anymore. Zain?",

NATO Secretary General says that Russian President Vladimir Putin is trying to use winter as a weapon of war in Ukraine. Jens Stoltenberg spoke ahead of a NATO foreign ministers meeting in Romania to mobilize support for Kyiv. A wave of Russian strikes on critical infrastructure has left millions of Ukrainians without water and without power. The NATO chief says that more attacks can be expected because Russia is failing on the battle field. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JENS STOLTENBERG, NATO SECRETARY GENERAL (THOMPSON: President Putin is failing in this brutal war of aggression. He is responding with more brutality. We see wave after wave of deliberate missile attacks on cities and civilian infrastructure, striking homes, hospitals, and power grids. This is terrible for Ukraine. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

God bless the Ukrainians for their resilience. Salma Abdelaziz live for us there. Thank you so much.All right, as Iran prepares to face the U.S. in a hugely symbolic match at the World Cup later, new global pressure is mounting on Tehran. France says a new round of E.U. sanctions is being prepared over Iran's ongoing treatment of protesters. This as Tehran has summoned the German ambassador over a U.N. Human Rights Council resolution which has agreed to investigate the crackdown on protesters starting first with a fact-finding mission. Nada Bashir is monitoring the developments from London. So let's talk about this new round of sanctions that France is talking about at this point. Nada, you know, obviously symbolic in nature, but can it actually have a real impact, do you think?",

      "sentences": "Well, there are certainly focus on the international community now to really drum up pressure on the Iranian regime as these protests continue, but also, of course, as the regime's crackdown intensifies. We've already seen sanctions in place and expanded against the Iranian regime and other entities in Iran by the European Union and the U.S. and other Western allies.This would be the third packet of sanctions from the European Union. And of course, we've previously seen sanctions being placed against individuals, part of the Revolutionary Guard Corps, part of Iran's state media and other security entities in Iran charged with perpetrating human rights abuses. This is expected to be an expansion of these sanctions and it's set to be prepared ahead of a meeting of E.U. foreign Ministers on December 12. So there is still some time before those sanctions are put before the European Union. But of course, while pressure is mounting from the international community, we are still seeing that crackdown intensifying. In fact, we heard from Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, speaking over the weekend, a concerning remarks from the supreme leader describing the paramilitary troops charged with these human rights abuses, praising them, but also describing the protesters as rioters and thugs. The same sort of rhetoric we've been hearing for weeks now. Zain?",

So, Bill, I understand that you traveled to this area, travel to the big island last year. And, you know, what I found interesting about part of the piece that you add earlier was this idea that for a lot of native Hawaiians, there is a sort of spiritual significance to the eruption of this volcano because many of them worship Pele, the Hawaiian goddess of volcanoes.
