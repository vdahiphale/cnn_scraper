Four days before the all-important New Hampshire primary, former presidential candidate and Senator Tim Scott is about to weigh in on race and endorse Donald Trump. Will his pick make a difference? Is Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley barnstorm the Granite State, trying to put the brakes on Donald Trump's road to the GOP nomination? Plus, President Biden, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, have a lot of catching up to do. They spoke today for the first time in nearly a month, as Netanyahu openly rejects the U.S.-backed plan for the future of Gaza and the Palestinian people and the possible Palestinian state. What we know about that critical call coming up. And two major developments in two major criminal cases. Actor Alec Baldwin indicted today for his role in that deadly accidental \"Rust\" movie set shooting. And the L.A. Innocence Project is looking to defend and exonerate one of the most notorious convicted murderers ever, Scot Peterson, whom a court found killed his wife and unborn son. (MUSIC)",

Tonight, South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, a former presidential candidate himself, will endorse Donald Trump, a source close to the Trump campaign tells me and a video that Tim Scott just posted makes very clear, that's a very public repudiation for the former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who personally appointed Scott to the U.S. Senate. Now this is the kind of endorsement you might usually expect after the New Hampshire primary, closer to when South Carolina is scheduled to vote, which is the end of February. But one political observer suggested that it's possible Trump -- the Trump campaign is just trying to blunt any more of Haley's momentum, anything left, and put the nail in the coffin of this race as quickly as possible. As of New Hampshire, sources say Governor Haley's campaign was caught completely off guard by the announcement. Haley released a statement saying, quote, interesting, the Trump's lining up with all the Washington insiders when he claimed he wanted to drain the swamp, but the fellas are going to do what the fellas are going to do. We should note, this announcement doesn't come without some calculations from Senator Scott's team either, as one source tells me close to the Trump campaign. Senator Scott is on Trump's, quote, medium list as opposed to shortlist for vice president. CNN's Omar Jimenez starts off our coverage today from the campaign trail in Goffstown, New Hampshire. And, Omar, not the kind of announcement the Haley team wanted to see as they go into the last weekend in the New Hampshire primary and blitz the state for every last vote.",

And the only time you've ever seen Netanyahu in the mode of concession or compromise is mainly to fend off American presidents.

It was -- it really turned out to be, to use the expression, baloney. He, right now, his appeal to whatever base he has left and really only 15 percent of the Israeli people want to see him continue as prime minister is I am the person who will uniquely defend against there ever being a Palestinian entity at all.

There hasn't been much information at all for quite some time, despite multiple attempts by CNN to determine what that office was actually investigating. We know that that investigation, as we often see in government agencies, provided somewhat of a cloak -- you know, authorities referring everyone back to the district attorney basically, in response to any question about law enforcement and who would be held accountable. This special purpose grand jury, according to the local newspaper, will spend the next six months, Jake, looking at evidence. The way these work, you know, they can call in witnesses. They can look at information to include that information that the DOJ assembled throughout their lengthy investigation and then make an ultimate determination. You know, we're talking about a jury of citizens to determine whether presumably any of these officers should be held accountable. Final point, Jake, it's worth pointing out as well, the grand jury secrets -- proceedings are secret, which means that were likely not going to hear anything from the prosecutor for that period of time. Witnesses who were called before a special purpose grand jury can talk about what they said and what they saw.
