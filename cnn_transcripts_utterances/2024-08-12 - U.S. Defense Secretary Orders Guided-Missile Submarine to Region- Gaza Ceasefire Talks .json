Max has the day off and it's Monday, August 12th, 9 a.m. here in London, 4 a.m. in Washington, where U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has now ordered a guided missile submarine to the Middle East. A message of deterrence to Iran and its proxies, as fears grow of a potential attack on Israel.CNN political and foreign policy analyst Barak Ravid reports that according to a source, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told Austin that Iran appears to be preparing for a large-scale attack and this all comes days ahead of Gaza's ceasefire talks due to take place this week. In a joint statement, the leaders of France, Germany and the U.K. are endorsing calls from mediators urging Israel and Hamas to accept a ceasefire and hostage deal amid concern that a wider regional conflict could break out. CNN's Paula Hancocks is joining me here following developments and Paula, let's first talk about that missile submarine. It's a quite unusual move for the Pentagon to be so public in its arrival to the region, so what's the strategy here?",

So the fact that this has been announced so publicly shows that the main purpose of it being there is for a sign of deterrence to Iran. The fact that this has been publicized shows that it is a very clear message to Iran that the U.S. is backing Israel, that if they are going to carry out some kind of retaliation, that the U.S. will be right by the side of Israel.This is a nuclear powered submarine, it's armed with cruise missiles, it was carrying out drills in the Mediterranean Sea and then was deployed here, but it is highly unusual to be publicizing this, which shows that the U.S. is being very vocal in its messaging to Iran. There's also a carrier strike group which is heading to the region, that's been accelerated now as well to make sure that they are seen to be very much by the side of Israel, because they are waiting for this Iranian retaliation. Iran on Friday once again said that it will come, because its sovereignty has been violated after Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas chief, was assassinated on its territory.",

She did conclude a five-city introductory tour of the new Harris Walz ticket. It was followed by an enormous amount of enthusiasm and energy.All told Vice President Harris spoke to tens of thousands of people at her rallies across last week. That has also extended to her fundraising. On Sunday, the vice president spoke to 700 donors in San Francisco bringing in around $12 million to her campaign war chest and her message to those donors was don't be complacent. She told them she's never been one to really believe in the polls and that they can take nothing for granted. She does acknowledge that it's been a good couple of weeks but we have a lot of work to do. And I think Vice President Harris would be the first to acknowledge that good vibes alone are not what's going to win the election in November. And to that end she did tell us on Saturday that she plans to unveil new policy proposals in this upcoming week specifically related to the economy and bringing down prices for Americans. In fact she did unveil one new piece of policy at her event in Las Vegas on Saturday evening saying she would work to eliminate federal income taxes on tipped wages. That's something that's enormously popular among workers particularly where she was in Las Vegas. It's also a policy proposal that Donald Trump has raised on the campaign trail and he wasted no time calling her a copycat. A Harris campaign official said that her proposal would need to be worked through with Congress, that it would include income limits and would also include provisions to protect against fraud. Now in this upcoming week she will continue this push on the economy. We will see her for the first time with President Biden, their first official joint appearance since she replaced him atop the Democratic ticket and it was interesting. In an interview just this weekend the president discussed how he would be campaigning for Kamala Harris in the months ahead. He said he was planning a tour of Pennsylvania, his home state, and he said he plans to do whatever Kamala thinks I can do to help the most. Kevin Liptak, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

If you look at the polls from 2020 and 2016 in August and then what happened in the actual election in November, there was a lot of movement. So this is not over of course.You know she's enthusiastic about the recent New York Times-Siena College polls as the Democrats are as well because in three key swing states in Michigan and Wisconsin and Pennsylvania she's now ahead by four points and this is a must win either for Trump or for Harris. They have to win one of those states or all of those states in order to win and this of course is a huge change from when Biden was running against Trump. I mean Biden was down by four or five points in those states and other polling is showing that Harris is neck and neck in states like Arizona and Georgia and apparently the New York Times reported that there was private polling in Ohio that showed that it was really, really close there and that's of course where J.D. Vance is from and has been a state that has gone Republican. So the campaign has a lot of momentum. There seems to be a big movement. The crowd size is huge. All of this is irking Donald Trump and he's going to need to reset and so far he hasn't. He's just been focusing on personal attacks. He's been caught off guard. He's been talking about this idea that Biden is going to join the race again. He's been throwing out falsehoods about being on a helicopter. He'll have to focus a lot more if they're going to turn things around and thus far he hasn't shown the discipline.",

He will help just to provide unity and she's going to rely on the help of other surrogates like Josh Shapiro who's going to be very important in Pennsylvania as the governor of Pennsylvania and was a likely vice presidential pick. But she has chosen a really good vice presidential pick of Tim Walz and the two of them have a lot of good chemistry and he's a lot more charismatic than I think people originally thought. And so they're on the campaign trail and they themselves as a duo seem to be in lockstep. They seem to be really connected and they're also connecting with audiences and large numbers of people are, you know, waiting in line in the heat to see them.This type of energy behind the campaign is something that that Trump is lacking and he maybe thought he would get that with J.D. Vance. J.D. Vance turned out to be a terrible pick for him. In fact they weren't even on the campaign trail together. Donald Trump was doing a press conference. J.D.

I think that they should focus on issues that resonate with Republicans of course but also those that are maybe undecided issues like immigration, issues like inflation and just keep hammering that home again and again. Instead they've been focusing on personal attacks.J.D. Vance was questioning the military record of Tim Walz and how is that going to play well with veterans? That didn't look well -- that didn't look go across very well to attack someone who served in the National Guard for 24 years. The past comment of calling the leadership in Washington that it's been run by childless cat ladies again he could have just apologized for that. J.D. Vance also had a softball question of what makes you happy? Instead of saying something like, you know, spending time with my children. He comes up with some convoluted response that what makes him angry are the policies of Harris and Walz. So they need to reset badly and they have a really well run campaign. It's a lean machine compared to, you know, 2016 when they had a lot more people involved. But Trump just isn't listening. He's lacking the discipline and more importantly he's just not on the campaign trail very much. If you compare to 2016 and 2020 he was campaigning all the time. 2024 he just thought he was going to have to campaign against Biden and he has very few campaign stops. So he's going to have to campaign much more and be much more focused on the issues that his constituency would care about.",

There's no radiation risk as of yet.But look, Russia occupies this plant. It does, as we know, and has throughout this war rattled the nuclear saber at various points. It did so back in the autumn of 2022, when Ukraine was in the midst of a series of very successful counteroffensives. We later learned via our colleague Jim Sciutto that the U.S. had been actively preparing for the potential use by Russia of a tactical nuclear weapon. So look, we don't want to cause alarm here. We don't know what's happening. There is no radiation risk. But Russia pulls this lever on occasion. And we have seen a pattern in the past where they've done it at points where Ukraine has the initiative.
