A squad of F-15s will fly those 26.2 miles. And then the runners, they're going to be hitting the pavement.

He did not need to engage with the content of these documents on a day-to-day basis. He was more responsible for kind of making sure that the network operated correctly and that everyone whose job it was, actually, to review these documents had access to them. So the question now not only is why was he able to retrieve these documents, and also apparently print them out without anyone noticing, but also was there proper vetting of him? Because he had a top-secret clearance, and he was given that in 2021, even though he had been on these chat rooms, including the chat room where he allegedly leaked these documents, for about five years. So there's going to be a lot of questions here for the Defense Department about how they disseminate this information.

This was reported by \"The Washington Post.\" CNN has not seen the document, and we've reached out to the Pentagon for comments and are waiting for a response.But basically, what \"The Washington Post\" says is that this document suggests Taiwan's air defenses are not ready for a real-world event, that it could be overwhelmed by the number of missiles that China could potentially fire; that there are a whole host of areas where Taiwan is not ready, where its radios are not compatible between the different units of air defense. And it also goes on to say that China is conducting so many operations with planes and ships around Taiwan that is making it difficult for U.S. intelligence to assess what is just a drill and what could be escalatory activity by China; what could actually be a preparation for some type of an assault on the self-governing island. Now the Taiwanese defense ministry has responded to these reports saying, quote, \"We respect outside opinion on our national defense, but a foreign media cited unidentified documents and the content was obviously not factual.\" The defense ministry going on to say it is ready for any kind of eventuality that might involve the Chinese military. I might add some more context. The Chinese flew four warplanes across the median line of the Taiwan Strait, this according to Taiwanese officials. This is kind of everyday activity. And meanwhile, a U.S.-guided missile destroyer, it conducted a transit of the Taiwan Strait on Sunday, a so-called freedom of navigation operation, something the Chinese don't like. But the U.S. does to show it can operate in international waters.",
