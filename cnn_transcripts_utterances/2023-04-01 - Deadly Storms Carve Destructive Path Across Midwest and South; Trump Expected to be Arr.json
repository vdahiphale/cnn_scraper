A deadly tornado outbreak wreaking havoc across much of the Midwest and South Friday. There were more than 50 preliminary tornado reports in seven states and at least 10 people have been killed and dozens of others injured.Most of the deaths are in Arkansas, where the damage is catastrophic. Reports of at least a dozen tornadoes there. Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders declaring a state of emergency and activating the National Guard as the storms gutted entire communities. She spoke about the destruction earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. GOVERNOR SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS (R-AR): I've had the opportunity over the last couple of hours to speak with the Homeland Security Secretary as well as President Biden who have offered a tremendous amount of support anything that Arkansas need from a city, a county, a state and a federal perspective. I would say that everyone is working in total lockstep and we're going to do everything we can to make sure that people of our state are back on their feet again. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Their neighborhoods littered with debris. But the threat is far from over. Some 70 million Americans are now bracing for more severe storms today. CNN has teams tracking all the latest developments from these destructive storms.Derek Van Dam is in Wynne, Arkansas this hour. Derek to you first, what's going on? DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Fredricka, the mayor of Wynne, Arkansas described it best. He said that the tornado was like it tore the town into. Where we stand right now is when -- within that destructive path of the tornado that tore through this area on Friday evening. And I'm going to set the scene. But I want to show you this first, because we did have an opportunity to speak to the First Responders, the search and recovery crews last night when we were on the scene. And you see that X on this building. Well, that is because they cleared this building. They indicated that there was no one inside. And they went from home to home to business to business, making sure that there were not people indoors trapped in. And unfortunately, there were some rescues that took place here and unfortunately some fatalities as well. So, the First Responders is crucial in those few hours after this tornado struck. Just look down this road, you can see just the number of trees that were toppled by this twister. And then you can see, obviously, you hear this familiar sign of -- a sound of chainsaws in the background. But look at this massive construction vehicle that's set to clear the roadways to make them accessible for the various utility trucks that are moving through the area. This is a business. There's a nursery that has been destroyed directly behind this. And I'm going to have my cameraman pan to the left here. That is a church. This is astounding to me. That is the steeple of the top of the church that was toppled over by the tornado landed on the adjacent building, took down a tree alongside it as well. I've got a very powerful story to share with you. What you're looking at behind me over my right shoulder. That is Wynne High School. An area that was hit particularly hard by this tornado. And we saw this gentleman walking across the parking lot in the distance there draped by an American flag over his shoulders. And I approached him and asked him what he was doing. And he told me that he had found the American flag that you see now hoisted onto that flagpole there. There was a moment when they wanted to take that flag and bring it back to its original position. It was dirty, it was brown. But it was in a sign of solidarity, a sign of unity for the town of Wynne, Arkansas to say hey, we're going to get through this. We're going to make it through this stronger than we were before. And we will rebuild. To see that moment was really, really incredible, impactful for me and there was quite a crowd that gathered around to see that American flag hoisted once again in its original position. Fredricka?",

Meantime, all eyes will be on New York in the coming days which are likely to be stormy of another sort. On Monday, former President Trump is expected to travel to Manhattan where he will voluntarily surrender on Tuesday to New York law enforcement. Trump's indictment marks the first time in U.S. history that a current or former president has been criminally charged. Sources say Trump faces more than 30 counts related to business fraud. Joining us right now to discuss is Michael Moore. He is a former U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Georgia. All right, Michael. I mean, buckle up, right? I mean, this is not all in fun. But really, this is a -- this has become a real mystery. So many wants to know, what is going to be revealed in these more than 30 charges. What do you believe the district attorney's office will reveal? How much detail? MICHAEL MOORE, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY, MIDDLE DISTRICT OF GEORGIA: Well, I'm glad to be with you. I'll say, you know, we are in unchartered waters here. This is the first time this has happened. And we don't know what the indictment says. But I expect when it's unsealed to the public, and we get a chance to look at it, we'll see mostly just business-related, sort of transactional-related count by count. My guess is they probably stacked a number of individual entries, maybe in a ledger or filings that were made as a separate calf for each one.

What Soros did do though, is make donations to a PAC, Political Action Committee that supported Bragg's campaign. Now Soros is a longtime supporter of criminal justice reform and Democratic D.A. candidates promoting such reform.And his spokesman told me that he ended an affiliated political action committee. Gave $4 million between 2016 and 2022, including one million in May 2021 to a pro-reform pack called Color of Change. Now, Color of Change told me it ended up spending just over $500,000 in support of Bragg's campaign. Color of Change President Rashad Robinson told me though, he says it's a wild reach to suggest that Color of Change is 500k in spending was like the one thing that won the election for Alvin Bragg who has a distinguished legal resume. And it was way outspent, anyway, in this competitive, Democratic primary, even with the color of change effort. Robinson told me his group was one of many important factors in the race. And he said to me, \"Up until last week, we couldn't get people to write about our PAC. Now all of a sudden, we single handedly elected the Manhattan D.A. When he was elected, I didn't get that credit.\" Now, Robinson also called the Soros-related attacks, anti-semitic and anti-black. And I think this is important context for the Soros attacks. Soros has been for years targeted with a centuries-old anti- semitic trope about sinister rich Jewish puppet masters supposedly orchestrating big events. And Oren Segal, an executive at the Anti- Defamation League which works to fight anti-semitism. Totally the Trump's campaign -- the Trump campaign's own fundraising e-mails about Alvin Bragg have \"increasingly promoted potentially problematic language often used as anti-semitic dog whistles including calling Soros a puppet master or puppeteer.\" Now it is certainly possible. Emphasize this. You can talk about George Soros' role in D.A. races and U.S. politics. He's an important political player in this country. But there's no sign Alvin Bragg is taking orders from him on this or anything else. And there are big issues to say the least around the puppet master kind of language.",

Here's what the judge said about that. \"The evidence does not support that Fox News conducted good faith, disinterested reporting.\" That's striking.

That's why you're seeing him nonstop on social media. And I will say, it seems that a lot of Republicans have bought into this narrative.

What we've seen on social media from the former president is clips of allies, of Republicans going on air, going on conservative media attacking Bragg, attacking the district attorney's office, attacking this indictment overall and defending former President Trump. And really, this goes to a plan of action we have seen from the former president and his allies for years. The theme is that, if they can go after Trump, they can go after anyone. If they can go after Trump, they can go after you. But one thing to point out here is that no one has actually seen the indictment.
