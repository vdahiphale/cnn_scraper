It is so important because it will be a jury question of fact when they get in there to deliberate. What we just heard was that the kennel video began at 8We just learned it ends at 8:45.45. Alex Murdaugh just admitted not only that he was down there, but he admitted that maybe he didn't leave the area on the golf cart right at the kennel until about 8:47, and then went about two minutes to get back to the house. We know from previous testimony that at 8:49, Maggie and Paul's phones lock forever. They never turn them on again. The prosecutor is using this, we've heard this in the trial as the time of death, the estimated time of death, because obviously you can't turn your phone back on. Now, the defense is going to argue strongly against that because they were busy down there, they were working with the dogs and the chickens and everything. So just because they're not using their phones doesn't mean that's when they were murdered. But now there's something else with this timeline. We know because of the OnStar data that at 9:07, Alex Murdaugh was in his car going down the driveway to go visit his mother. So you look at that very small timeline, 8:49, when the phone stopped, let's say that's when he murdered them. You've got a short duration of time before 9:07, right? That's 13 minutes, give or take, right? You're going to be covered in blood. Those were close range shots. They were, according to testimony, 3 feet basically away from he was from the victims or whoever shot them. You'd be covered in blood. You'd get back, you'd have blood everywhere. You'd have blood on your shoes. You would have to really clean up, shower. You'd have to make sure blood isn't in the house anywhere. Your feet aren't, you know, don't have blood on them. You'd have to bag up the clothes. You'd have to get the murder weapons. You'd have to get everything in the vehicle so that you weren't leaving any DNA or blood in the car also. You'd have to get Maggie's phone, make sure you got that in there. Jury question will be, was there enough time for him to do all of that? Because it is a short window, but jurors will debate that. They will deliberate on that.",

Do you believe the witness or the evidence is put before you? If you're a juror, you know, do you trust that this is the fingerprint that was at the scene of the crime? Do you trust the words that come out of this person's mouth? And let's be perfectly blunt, this is not a credible witness.Number one, he's admitted to lying to the police. Number two, there are discrepancies in his story. Number three, this whole question of, and I think it was a brilliant question were the dogs alarmed? Was there somebody else there that you, you know, you know your dogs pretty well would -- were they behaving in a manner that suggested that there might have been somebody else there? So he's got some big credibility issues. But walking through some of the things that Jean talked about a moment ago, you just don't have evidence linking him specifically to the scene of the crime, or at least it's challenging evidence. So, for instance, number one, you got no murder weapon. Number two, you don't have blood on his clothing. Number three, the number of minutes that passed. So it's just, there are some problems here on all sides. But the big thing is you have evidence linking him to the crime and it's a little tenuous at this point.",

The fact that we're now hearing the chief prosecutor almost with every questions talk about this new story that you're now crafting, the way that they kind of went into that and even the moment when we saw the, his defense attorney stand up and object when it came to, he said on Fifth Amendment grounds, when they were talking about that, Murdaugh was saying he'd made multiple requests to even tell his story to the prosecutors.

Well, you have a right to remain silent right, when you're a defendant. And so that's when the Fifth Amendment argue.But the judge ruled for the prosecution. And so it just kept going.
