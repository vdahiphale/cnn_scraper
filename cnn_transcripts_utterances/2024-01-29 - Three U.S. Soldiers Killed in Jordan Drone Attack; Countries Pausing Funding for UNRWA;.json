Just ahead, Biden vows to retaliate after a deadly strike against American troops in Jordan.One of China's largest real estate developers is being forced to liquidate. What property giant Evergrande's collapse could mean for China's economy. And the lineup is set for Super Bowl 58. The Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers head to Las Vegas with everything on the line. U.S. President Joe Biden is vowing to respond after three American soldiers were killed and more than 30 injured in a drone attack in Jordan. The attack on the outpost known as Tower 22 marked the first time U.S. troops have been killed by enemy fire in the Middle East since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas. That small military base seen in this satellite image is located near the border with Syria. Mr. Biden is blaming Iran-backed militant groups for the attack. While in Iran, state media reports Iran's permanent mission to the U.N. denies the country had any involvement. The U.S. president is vowing to hold those responsible to account. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, Rosemary, that denial from Iran was fairly swift, saying that they had no involvement in this attack. It did come from the permanent mission in the U.N. reported by state media. But what we've heard from the U.S. side is that they believe that this was an attack that was carried out by Iranian-backed groups, by the Iranian proxies in the region. They believed that the drone originated from Syria and it's not clear at this point why there were no air defense systems that actually kicked into place to try and intercept this drone.Now we have heard from the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, which is an umbrella group for many of these Iranian-backed and funded and equipped groups in Iraq. They have said that they were carrying out a number of attacks along the Jordanian-Syrian border, including on Al- Rukban camp, which is in close proximity to Tower 22 where this U.S. outpost is. Now, the U.S. personnel we understand from Central Command were there in order to do an assist mission with Jordan. They say that they're there in the region as well including in Iraq and Syria to help fight against ISIS. There were some 350 service members at this particular outpost, but of course the question is what is the reaction from the U.S. side? They have made it clear that they believe that it was an Iranian- backed group. Whether or not Iran had operational control over this particular attack is not really what the U.S. is focusing on at this point. They have come under attack on an almost daily basis at their bases in Iraq and in Syria. Almost 160 rocket and drone and missile attacks against U.S. troops since October 17th of last year. Now, there have been a number of injuries, but as you say, this is the first time that there has been a U.S. soldier personnel loss of life since the war in Gaza began. Rosemary?",

      "sentences": "It's a question that everybody's asking at this point, Rosemary. I mean, the U.S. was already directly involved in targeting some of these groups. They had carried out retaliatory attacks against Iranian-backed groups in both Iraq and in Syria because of the constant attack that they were coming under from these groups.We've seen also that the U.S. has directly engaged in Yemen. They have been trying to take out Houthi rebel bases and some missile launch sites from the Houthis who are launching missiles into the Red Sea against commercial shipping. So, the U.S. has already been involved directly in attacks against certain elements, but it's always been against Iranian-backed elements, the Iranian proxies. There has not been a direct impact between the U.S. and Iran at this point. And up until this point, it has appeared as though Iran was reticent to become directly involved, that they had enough proxies in the region that were carrying out these attacks, that Tehran itself did not need to become involved and of course they have denied involvements in this particular attack. The question is though, now there has been loss of life of U.S. military personnel, the U.S. President will come under increasing pressure, and we have seen it back in Washington, to do more, to carry out more retaliatory strikes and potentially to carry out strikes in Iran itself. Now, of course, that would certainly escalate events. We don't know exactly what the response will be from President Biden at this point, but he has said that there will be a response. Rosemary?",

He has to respond and he has to respond in a much more robust way than what the U.S. has been doing in the past few months really to respond to these attacks by these Iranian sponsored proxies. So, he can't essentially do more of the same what people are calling pinprick strikes.At the same time, he can't respond in a way or will try to avoid responding in a way that would then justify Iran in retaliating further and you end up in this tit for tat escalation cycle that leads to a major regional war. So, he's got to walk a fine line in this regard. I think that there are probably various options that he can do, not only in terms of attacking the Iranian-sponsored militia groups in Iraq and Syria that carried out the attack, but also potentially attacking the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps units that may have supported it. And that could include something similar to Operation Praying Mantis back in 1988 when the Reagan administration struck out Iranian naval vessels in the Persian Gulf. Well, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps has its own known navy. And so, one option the Americans could have would be to strike out the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps naval capabilities to prevent them from interfering with shipping in the Persian Gulf, particularly to stop them from laying mines in the Persian Gulf. That would be a next step along the spectrum to prevent Iran from going further in future attacks. CHURCH:  Now, this attack on U.S. troops in and of itself escalates the precarious Middle East situation, doesn't it? So, how might Iran react to any U.S. retaliatory action given Iran is denying any role in this deadly attack?",

Now, the two, there is a connection there, and I think the Iranians continue to push this connection.But in fact, when you look at what the Houthis are doing in the Red Sea, what the Iranians are doing in Iraq and Syria, there's no real definitive response there by Iran to Israeli actions against Hamas. And even if the U.S. could influence Israel to wind back its operation and cease all military operations against Hamas, that doesn't guarantee that either Hamas wouldn't continue to strike at Israel or that Iran wouldn't continue to strike at U.S. forces in the region. So, these are sort of two separate conflicts going on, co-located with the potential to emerge into one larger war.",

Monday, this is what we heard from a judge here in Hong Kong, she ruled to liquidate Evergrande after years of failed attempts to restructure this company. And when she announced a ruling, it took place earlier this morning, the Hong Kong judge, his name is Linda Chen, she said, quoteNow, before the hearing, Evergrande shares were trading down as much as 20 percent and trading was halted in both China Evergrande, as well as its list of subsidiaries across China. Now, for years now, this company, Evergrande, has been the poster child of China's property debt crisis. It was back in 2021 when it triggered a market panic when it defaulted on its offshore debt. Evergrande is the world's most indebted property developer. It has more than $328 billion worth of liabilities, as well as $240 billion in assets. And last year, in September, its founder and chair Xu Jiayin was suspected of, quote, crimes and detained by the police in China. Analysts have been weighing in on this ruling to liquidate the company and they say the decision is good news long-term for the Chinese economy but it is going to be a very, very painful process. Now, according to Andrew Collier of Orient Capital Research, he's managing director there, he says this, quote: Evergrande's liquidation is a sign that China is willing to go to extreme ends to quell the property bubble. This is good for the economy in the long run, but very difficult in the short term. We also heard from Gary Ng of Natixis. He's a senior economist there. And he said: It is not an end but the beginning of a prolong process of liquidation which will make Evergrande's daily operations even harder. And he goes on to say that investors will be concerned about whether there will be snowball effect on other developers as the queue of liquidation is long. Gary Ng there making reference to perhaps Country Garden, another heavily indebted Chinese developer. Now, this process of liquidation for Evergrande, it could be long, arduous, and complicated, given the many authorities and players involved. There had been questions about jurisdiction about whether authorities inside China would uphold a ruling from a court in Hong Kong. But ahead of the decision, we learn that China's Supreme Court and Department of Justice here in Hong Kong signed an agreement to jointly enforce this judgment -- Rosemary.",

They are accusing Mayorkas of repeatedly violating immigration laws, saying he has committed high crimes and misdemeanors. The House committee is expected to vote on the articles of impeachment later this week.But the DHS is blasting House Republicans over the articles calling the upcoming vote a, quote, farce and distraction from other vital national security priorities.

      "sentences": "We're watching the West Coast closely this week as an atmospheric river event unfolds looking at impact from Washington, Oregon, even into northern California as we go into the week, a level 4 out of 5 atmospheric river event is possible on parts of the coast, meaning that some of the heavy rain could be hazardous, could even some cause landslides.Now, Washington has already gotten some hefty rain totals already this weekend from one to three inches and breaking some daily records, here's that moisture plume that we'd be dealing with whole weekend, starts to shift south as we go into the middle of the week. By Wednesday in Thursday, heavy rain starts to stretch into California. So you could see the series of storms that does this. You'll find some rain arriving from Washington and Oregon on Tuesday, but in that front really starts to drip south by Wednesday, bringing some of the heavy rain from northern California to the state line and down into southern California, Los Angeles getting some of that rain by Thursday. So, we've got multiple days here of flooding risk in California. You have that slight risk on Wednesday level 2 out of 4 from Sacramento, down into San Francisco, and then that threat spreads to southern California by Thursday, that marginal level 1 risk, includes Los Angeles and San Diego as we go into the week. So you can see where this hefty rain totals slide south through the five days, we are looking at some four to five inch rain totals possible from the San Francisco Bay Area and North. But we're looking at two or three inches of that coming in just one day, so something we have to watch and then you see two-inch totals could spread far south as Los Angeles and San Diego. Plus, where you got that colder air and the higher elevation. We're looking at a foot of snow possible in the Sierra Nevada. All of this also comes with some gusty winds as the storm kind of hits the West Coast, we could find wind gusts up to 40 miles per hour, maybe 50 mile-an-hour gusts in northern California, as we go into Wednesday. So when we're talking about impact, we're talking about impacts from heavy rain and from gusty winds. Stream and urban flooding will be possible, when you get those heavy downpours, numerous showers landslides also possible at downed trees and power lines could be a problem as we go into the week.
