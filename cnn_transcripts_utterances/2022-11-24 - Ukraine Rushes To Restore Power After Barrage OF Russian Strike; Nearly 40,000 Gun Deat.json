According to the Ukrainian government, Erica, the Russians have done at least seven of these mass attacks using cruise missiles. These are the most expensive and sophisticated missiles in the Russian army, arguably many of them fired from aircraft many miles away. They're capable of cruising at very, very low fast levels of altitude, and also very, very high, very difficult to shoot down. Most of them were shot down.The Ukrainians asking for more and more air defenses to pride -- to try to prevent more of these attacks because, with every attack that happens, they do recover, but recovery becomes that much harder. And it's already affecting the neighboring state of Moldova that suffered disastrous 50 percent blackout yesterday as a consequence of this, there are cities there's a little bit more light here in Zaporizhzhia. But of course, the danger is also to the nuclear power stations. If they lose incoming nuclear -- incoming power, then their cooling systems which are dependent on external electricity need to fall back on diesel generators just to stop them from melting down. For the first time in 40 years, essentially ever, all of the nuclear power stations that normally provide 50 percent of the power in this country were shut down for over the last 24 hours, Erica.",

Good to see you this morning. When we look at you know, as Sam pointed out there, as the Ukrainians have said, this is clearly a campaign we've seen going on now for some time continuing as we head into the winter, really targeting the infrastructure in Ukraine. But it's not just about the power and potentially the heat that this could provide in the winter. This also powers critical civilian and military communications. When it comes to those repairs and the rebuilding, do you have a sense that Western nations are really doing all they can because it's going to continue?",

There is a move afoot to get more generators into the areas to try and get that power back up to support the infrastructure within Ukraine. But it's exceedingly difficult to do that when you're talking about the kinds of cities that have populations of half a million, 300,000, in some cases, a million people, that's just is almost an impossible task to generate power outside of the normal systems that are involved.But this is what's facing President Zelenskyy right now. He not only is attempting to continue the military campaign in the east and the south, but he's also now very concerned about this damage to the civilian infrastructure as well as the horrific crimes that are being committed against the Ukrainian people.",

It takes a lot of training to put these into effect. And even with a very limited supply from the west of Patriot missiles that would not be able to cover the entire front edge of the Ukrainian battle fronts, and it would not be able to stop all of the mission -- missiles coming in.Ukraine is doing a relatively good job on -- of -- with what they have, popping three-quarters of the missiles that come in, but as the pictures you're showing, they're not getting all of them. These are missiles. As you look at these films that are targeting (AUDIO GAP) patients, it violates all four elements of the Geneva Convention.

Among those, the shooting at the University of Virginia, a Colorado LGBTQ-plus bar, the Walmart in Virginia. It's not just mass shootings, though in this country that are leading to this epidemic that's a crisis of gun violence. The gun violence archives reports nearly 40,000 gun deaths in America this year alone. Just to put that in perspective. That means 121 deaths a day, five lives taken every hour.Joining me now is Dr. Megan Ranney. She co-founded the American Foundation for Firearm Injury Reduction in Medicine, better known as AFFIRM Research. She is an emergency physician. And I know how deeply you care about this issue because you see it on a regular basis. In fact, you tweeted just a few hours ago after you wrapped up your latest shift in the ER. Gun violence is so much more than mass shootings. I saw the direct harm and the ripple effect of the trauma tonight. Our communities all deserve better. It doesn't have to be that -- this way. You know, it's that trauma, that lasting ripple effect, can you just put in perspective for us? How widespread is that in this country? DR. MEGAN RANNEY, EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN: Now, Erica, thank you for having me on, and happy Thanksgiving. Even -- my shift last night was just a microcosm of what happens every day across the United States. As you said, there are more than 120 people that die and over 200 who are injured every single day across this country. We see similar rates of gun violence in rural and urban areas. And every one of those whether they are injured or dies, these a ripple effect in their community. It causes trauma among those who survive, it causes fear. We see increased rates of substance use and depression in communities that are affected by gun violence. So, this is about the bullet wounds, but it's also about so much more. And those mass shootings, they are just the tip of the iceberg.",

Back in the 70s, our car crash death rates were almost 70 percent more than they are now. And we decrease the death rates not by banning cars but by using this public health approach. We gathered data. We put in place things like Drunk Driving Laws and better seatbelts, and we educated parents about car seats. Through a combination of different measures, we managed to make the road safer. And I don't often lose someone from a car crash death these days.Meanwhile, firearm deaths are increasing. We have more people dying of firearm deaths than car crashes in this country. And a big reason why is because we have not applied this public health approach, which includes policies, but also so much more. Policies are necessary but not sufficient.",

For the first time in 24 years, we have federal funding from the NIH and CDC to study and implement programs that work to reduce gun violence. We're seeing community violence intervention programs grow and succeed in breaking the cycle of violence. I'm part of one here in Providence that has a great partnership with local police with community members, and they make a real difference.And we're seeing programs with the military and with veterans.
