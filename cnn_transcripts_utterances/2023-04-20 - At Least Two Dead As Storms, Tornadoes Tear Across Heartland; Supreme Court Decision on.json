We're talking about winds and some of those thunderstorms and tornadoes, over 150 miles per hour.So when we get first light, we'll get true indication of how powerful they were. But nonetheless, we knew they occurred. Several reports of large hail as well. The immediate threat now is focusing in on Missouri into portions of Nebraska, as well as Kansas and southwestern Iowa. Let's zoom right in. Kansas City getting hit hard with a severe thunderstorm, not a tornado warned storm but nonetheless strong, gusty winds in excess of 50 miles per hour, perhaps some of that large hail. That I mentioned just a moment ago. Severe threats stretches from Chicago all the way to Houston. So we're talking about nearly 50 million Americans. Very large hail, that is a sincere threat or a significant threat, but also the potential of an isolated tornado as well. Storm Prediction Center kind of highlighting those areas you'll see in the next graphic, a 2 percent chance of a tornado. That means anywhere around a given point, there is a 2 percent probability of a tornado. Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas to Houston, so that covers a large area. But the most focus here right now is that significant hail possibility where you see those hashed regions across Dallas-Fort Worth, stretching southward throughout central and eastern Texas. By the way, there is a slight risk of flash flooding. So in it, in addition to the severe storms that we will see on going across the state of Texas, the potential for flash flooding across those areas. I want to go back in time. This is Wednesday night, the storm that produced the powerful tornado near Cole, Oklahoma. There's Oklahoma City. There's Norman. The national severe storms laboratory located within that area, and this is fascinating because this is a helicopter perspective of the actual tornado. But what I want you to see and what I believe is fascinating is that this tornado is likely rain wrapped. You can kind of see that almost like a shaft of rain, but embedded within that is what we call a wedge tornado. So the wedge tornado, I was watching all the live feeds, is a tornado that is often wider than it is tall, and you can imagine that destructive tornado, that's a mile or greater in diameter is going to cause some serious, serious damage on the ground.",

President Biden ramping up the political pressure on House Republicans on Speaker Kevin McCarthy, specifically. The speaker, laying out in detail his proposal that he says should launch negotiations with President Biden. Here's the issue really the central issue right now, President Biden has made very clear and his top advisers there will be no negotiations over raising the debt limit, that it should be done in a clean manner -- no spending cuts, nothing attached to it. They can have negotiations over long term fiscal priorities, but not attached to the debt ceiling itself. McCarthy, House Republicans, they hold the majority, they say that's an absolute nonstarter, and that leads to basically this split screen. Take a listen. JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Folks, here's this really dangerous, MAGA Republicans in Congress are threatening to default on the national debt, the debt that took 230 years to accumulate overall, overall, unless we do what they say. They say they're going to default unless I agree to all these wacko notions they have. REP.
