U.S. Special Envoy Amos Hochstein is in Beirut as Israel ramps up its attacks in Lebanon and vows to keep pounding Hezbollah until it collapses. The U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin makes an unannounced visit to Kyiv, unveiling a new aid package amid warnings, North Korea is planning to send thousands of troops to fight for Russia in Ukraine. And famed Turkish opposition figure and preacher Fethullah Gulen blamed by Turkey for an attempted coup against the president, dies at the age of 83. Israel branches of a financial institution with links to Hezbollah overnight. Until now, it had mostly been concentrating on the group's military targets. Meanwhile, an Israeli strike killing at least 87 people in northern Gaza over the weekend. That's according to the Gaza health ministry. It flattened apartment buildings while the Israeli military says it struck a Hamas terror target. We're also hearing that a U.S. anti- missile system is in place in Israel. CNN's Paula Hancocks is following all the threads of the day for us and joins us here in Abu Dhabi. Paula, good to see you. I want to talk about the strike on a financial institution that has links to Hezbollah. What does it tell us about the way this war is headed, specifically as they try -- as they say, to dismantle Hezbollah? So, Eleni, this is the Al Qard Al Hassan financial institution. And the fact that Israel is going after this shows that it will go after anything that it believes to be affiliated with Hezbollah. This shows us the direction it has been going and it will be going. Now, according to the IDF, this is a financial institution with a number of branches in Beirut. We have seen a number of those being targeted in southern Lebanon in the Beqaa Valley and they say that they hold funds that Hezbollah then uses for their military activities. It also does support a number of the Shia community as well. It provides interest free loans, for example, to ease some of the poverty within the community. And a senior Israeli intelligence official tells CNN that Israel is trying to drive a wedge between the Shia community and Hezbollah itself. Now whether that is going to be possible, we simply don't know, but this is showing us that Israel will go after anything that it believes affiliated with Hezbollah.",

We've heard from the U.S. Defense Secretary, Lloyd Austin that is not acceptable, that will be investigated. But it does suggest that we are looking at a shorter time frame to see what kind of response there will be. We don't have more details really about what the -- what the retaliation will look like, but the fact that this THAAD system, it's a significant missile defense system, is now in place. Apparently, it is -- it can be assembled very quickly and can be activated very quickly, shows that that there could be an anticipation of a larger Iranian retaliation to whatever Israel is preparing at this point.",

Israel is intensifying military operations in Lebanon and northern Gaza. Even further across Lebanon, the IDF says it's broadening its attacks to include financial institutions linked to Hezbollah. The Israeli military says the Iranian-backed group fired about 200 projectiles into Israel on Sunday. At the same time, the United Nations is warning that Israel may be destroying the Palestinian population in northern Gaza. And as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza deepens, some Palestinians are now describing airdrops of aid as both dangerous and humiliating. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): They dropped parachutes of aid, and the aid killed our children. We don't want this aid. A little boy who was running for safety in his tent a ton fell on him and killed him. Look at this little girl. Her mother was injured. What for? I don't want aid. My son is gone.

CNN'sMatthew Chance has more from Tel Aviv, and I must warn you that some of the images in his report are disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Israeli forces patrolling the labyrinth of narrow streets in the central Gaza Strip. These latest images from the Israeli military, what they say is their continued activity amid the devastation to dismantle Hamas. To the south in Rafah, where the Hamas leader was recently killed, drone footage of strikes and what Israel says are more Hamas fighters and infrastructure. While across Gaza, civilians are paying a heavy price. At this hospital in the north of the Gaza Strip an influx of casualties from a new Israeli strike at Beit Lahia where Palestinian health officials say dozens of people, including women and children were killed. Among the shrouded bodies of her family, this woman calls her father to grieve their loss. I swear, dad, nobody's left. She sobs. Israel says the casualty figures are exaggerated and that they operate against Hamas in a precise and targeted manner that eyewitnesses at the scene say the Israeli air strikes felt like an earthquake. It was just Wednesday when an Israeli drone captured the final moments of the Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar's life. His killing fuelling hopes of a hostage release, even a ceasefire in Gaza and beyond. In fact, the region seems to be plunging further into chaos, with Israel stepping up strikes and pressing deeper into neighboring Lebanon, hitting what it says are strongholds of Iranian-backed Hezbollah, like here, the town of Nabatieh in southern Lebanon. Back in Israel, Hezbollah rockets have been striking the country's north. One drone even hitting near the Israeli Prime Minister's private house in the coastal town of Caesarea. He called it an assassination attempt by agents of Iran, vowing to press ahead with military action. Iran denies involvement, and Hezbollah has not claimed responsibility.",

And so that is the hundreds of millions of dollars left. You see that coming forward. And it's much of the same ammunition that we've seen before, artillery ammunition, mortar rounds, rounds for the HIMARS rocket launcher. That's exactly what Ukraine needs as it's fighting back against the Russian force that has superior numbers and that is effectively grinding its way forward. Small steps at a time, but those steps are significant, and they continue to add up. For this, it's also a chance for Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy to make the case once again for the U.S. to allow it to use long-range U.S. weaponry on targets deeper inside Russia. The Biden administration has rebuffed those calls before, and is likely to do so once again, but it's still an in-person chance for Zelenskyy and for his defense minister, Rustem Umerov to make that case once again. It is a time of great uncertainty here so close to the election. The U.S. and that is -- the Biden administration and Lloyd Austin have made clear that they will -- they will provide aid for as long as they can and for as long as is needed, but at least from the statements coming from former President Donald Trump, it will be a very different relationship under a potential Trump administration. Trump himself questioned or rather declined to answer, refused to answer whether he wanted Ukraine to win the war. So, there are two vastly different looks and perspectives on what aid will be provided to Ukraine in just a matter of weeks here. So Zelenskyy will be trying to influence what he can but he also realizes that this may be something very different in the immediate future here. So, that is weighing on all of these. The U.S. has also made clear that it will shift the aid to Ukraine from a U.S. centric mechanism to one that is more multinational and is more NATO focused in that perhaps trying to sort of safeguard the aid to Ukraine from a potential Trump administration.",

That will decide the election. The Vice President spent much of her weekend in the swing states of Georgia as well as Michigan where she sharpened her attacks on Trump's fitness for Office. Trump, meantime, took more shots at Harris using profanity to do so. And he shot people on both sides of the aisle when he made vulgar remarks about the late honored Arnold Palmer during a speech to supporters in the battleground state of Pennsylvania. Listen as Trump talks about the legendary pro-golfers body to a crowd in Palmers hometown. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: But Arnold Palmer was all man.

Liz Cheney is probablythe most prominent Republican to have endorsed the Vice President at this point in the campaign. And it just shows how the Harris folks really do believe that there are some persuadable conservative voters who are turned off by some of the rhetoric that we've been hearing from Donald Trump on the campaign trail. And they really do want to try and explore where they can squeeze as many votes as they can passively get. Now, who she's campaigning with is interesting, but it's also where she's campaigning. These are suburban counties in all three of the Great Lake blue wall states. Each of them saw big swings away from Donald Trump between 2016 and 2020. But what you also saw in all three of these counties was thousands of votes cast for Nikki Haley. Remember, she was one of Donald Trump's competitors for the Republican nomination. This time around, she received a lot of votes in these places, even when she had dropped out of the race. And so, in the eyes of the Kamala Harris campaign, there are some people in these places, particularly conservative women who might just vote for Kamala Harris this time around, if they can speak directly to them. And that at this stage in the campaign is exactly what Harris is trying to do, really kind of putting an exerted effort on each of these key demographics to try and squeeze out as many votes as they possibly can in all of the critical battlegrounds, recognizing that this race is going to be won on the margins by a margin of thousands perhaps even hundreds of votes. And so that's what you see her doing in this final sprint towards Election Day. She is heading into this final sprint with a major cash advantage. We just learned overnight that she raised a billion dollars in the last quarter. That's far and away, a record for any presidential candidate. What it allows her to do is spend less time talking to donors and trying to convince them to donate more time on the battleground states, talking to these individual demographics, trying to win as many votes as she can.",

So, I think she is trying to sort of break any kind of historical precedent here. So that's one reason. The other reason I think she's saying that is she's trying to guard against any kind of overconfidence among her supporters. Certainly, she went into her convention over the summer with a swell of momentum. There's been a lot of enthusiasm for her candidacy, but at the end of the day, her team really sees a narrow race in all of these battleground states. There's no guarantee that she will prevail, and I think that's why she's using this language on the campaign trail.",

So, this is a really crucial moment, not just for her, but of course, for Moldova's future, whether it sort of moves more towards Europe or shifts back into Russia's orbit. And I think the interference that has been alleged by Russia, ranging from sort of more sophisticated propaganda and misinformation in the lead up to this to more crude allegations of vote buying, really shows just how much importance Russia puts on this. Take a listen to a spokesperson for the E.U. commission on that topic. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PETER STANO, E.U.

And it has a very wide network of social service organization, including this organization, Al Qard Al Hassan was targeted yesterday by Israel, which is a micro credit organization that was established in the late -- in the late '80s to service mostly the Shia of Lebanon who a lot of them are pretty much, you know, poor people that give small loans up to $2,500 per loan to serve -- to help people pay for sometimes hospital care, sometimes for tuition fees, sometimes for -- to start businesses, small businesses, particularly women.

It's really -- it really asking the Lebanese to abdicate their territorial sovereignty, which is going to be very hard, not only for Hezbollah, but any Lebanese prime minister or Lebanese speaker of parliament to accept. So, this is the beginning of a negotiation process. I expect both sides will continue the fight and try to see how the fighting will dictate further terms of the negotiation.

Many say this is the new frontline in geopolitical tensions, misinformation and election fraud, making the investment in cybersecurity just as important in investing in military defense. Last week in Dubai I attended the largest tech and A.I. event in the world, Gitex and spoke with the UAE's head of cyber security Mohammed Al Kuwaiti, and he explained the risk. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

In the United Kingdom, multi- trillion-dollar economy, lots of big businesses that you've all heard of, over 99 percent of all businesses in the United Kingdom are small and medium-sized enterprises. Every single one of those large businesses stands on the shoulder of thousands of SMEs in all of these countries, represented here today and throughout the whole of this hall. So we have to get cybersecurity pushed down into our supply chains. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
