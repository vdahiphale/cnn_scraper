The front page of China Daily, it's the state publication in English that people in Beijing woke up to about 12 hours ago. A big emphasis here is about the economic cooperation between these two nations. There's a big chart in the center. So, we're going to hear a lot of that discuss today.And this is a tricky relationship between the United States and China. First of all, analysts point out the United States has been really trying to restrict its, its reliance on Chinese manufacturing, we saw what happened during the pandemic was very hard to get products to and from, from Asia. So, expect for China to make a hard sell to the U.S. into companies to -- to make products here in China, especially because the cost of doing so is so low, and other obstacle which China is likely to bring up is restrictions on technology and access to chips. That's been a big concern in the U.S., especially about intellectual property and perhaps technological secrets. And should these be shared. Also, the business environment in China right now is very difficult for American companies. They have seen a lot of restrictions, they're actually have been raids and detentions and involving foreign companies. So, expect Xi Jinping to let President Biden know that China is going to be an open and welcoming place for these two economies. The trade between these two economies is tremendous. And that's why we've heard so much discussion by Janet Yellen in particular about de-risking, and not necessarily de-coupling. Also, Kasie, on non-military issues, expect to have discussion about the Fentanyl crisis, as we've been reporting, some kind of agreement as near as well as with the climate crisis, both nations are likely to pledge more production and more focused Kasie, on renewables.",

Now, it's also important, important to point out that there's been some reporting that suggests that no hostage hostages had been found in the Al-Shifa hospital or in the tunnel system that's underneath that hospital. While that's important, it does not mean that there's not information there, intelligence evidence that the Israelis can collect that they could find it might get some clarity, or some sense of where those hostage -- hostages are being held, or whether those hostages -- as hostages have been there.So, it's still important, and we know that the focus on Al-Shifa is really about Hamas. But I think that the key here is that this hospital is, is like a lot of other hospitals being used by Hamas, people in a war with no those hospitals are being used as human shields.
