      "sentences": "Well, listen, we heard President Biden, you know, he began by reaffirming Israel's right to go after Hamas, but then he went into the suffering of the people in Gaza, talking about the enormous humanitarian toll that this war has had on civilians. In fact, he noted that of the more than 30,000 Palestinians who have been killed, he noted correctly that most of those are not members of Hamas. Most of those appear to be civilians. And he talked about the humanitarian aid situation in Gaza, saying that Israel must do more. And he also urged Israeli leaders not to use humanitarian assistance as a secondary consideration or as a bargaining chip. And, of course, he spoke also about what the United States was doingto try and alleviate this humanitarian crisis that is unfolding in Gaza, where more than half a million people are now on the brink of famine. He announced, of course, these plans to open a port, a temporary port off the coast of Gaza in the Mediterranean Sea. That, of course, will take weeks to actually get into place before it can allow for what will likely be hundreds of truckloads of aid per day. And so it's not an immediate solution. It's not a short-term solution to what is unfolding in Gaza, particularly in northern Gaza. Instead, what we are seeing there is this continued effort to drop aid via the air from the United States, Jordan, Egypt, multiple countries. But today we're getting a picture of why that method is so inefficient and also why it is so dangerous. We're getting reports today of multiple people having been killed or injured as a result of some of these airdrops in northern Gaza. And that just gives you a sense of how perilous this can be. And it also gives you a sense of the importance of opening up more of these land crossings into Gaza. We heard the president talk about that last night. And reportedly Israeli officials are set to open this week another crossing into northern Gaza, although they haven't yet confirmed the details of exactly where that will be or how much aid can get in that way.

I think that's one of the things that the Ukrainians will certainly have taken note of is the fact that it only took I think it was about one minute for President Biden to start speaking about Ukraine and start speaking very broadly and very strongly about Ukraine, but also for the need, as he put it, to not bow down to Russian President Vladimir Putin and, in fact, stand up to Vladimir Putin. Of course, one of the things where he tried to sort of make a difference between himself and former President Donald Trump was that he said that he is going to remain tough on Russia and never bow down.And I think for the Ukrainians, it will have been extremely important to hear very high up in that speech President Biden really try to make a case to Republicans also in that venue to say, look, let's work together to try and make more military aid for Ukraine happen and let's do it quickly because that's one of the things that the Ukrainians have been saying for a very long time. Obviously, they're suffering a great deal of shortages as far as ammunition is concerned, but also now, in the meantime, a lot of other gear as well. One of the things that doesn't get focused on very much but that's also extremely important is for surface to air missiles and replenishing the ones that the Ukrainians are using because, of course, they're having to shoot down a lot of Russian missiles and are now also shooting down Russian planes near the front line. A lot of that needs to get replenished. So, the Ukrainians obviously saying, this is something that's extremely pressing for them. And they've also been saying that if more military aid from the United States doesn't come, that that will be measured in Ukrainian lives. That more Ukrainians are -- will be wounded and more Ukrainians will be killed. Now, of course, Sara, the Ukrainians are under no illusion that all this could possibly be easy. They understand that, of course, Republicans in Congress, specifically, the Republican speaker, Mike Johnson, have a big say in if there's even going to be a vote, but I think yesterday from that speech that they heard from President Biden, they'll have been very pleased to hear that.",

You know, the lawmakers that have put it forward have cited years of fears that TikTok could be forced by its parent company, ByteDance, which is linked to China, to hand over the personal information of U.S. citizens to the Chinese government. Of course, TikTok says that's absolutely false and that it poses no threat to U.S. citizens. But nevertheless, that objection hasn't resolved some of the concerns around TikTok. And this bill would force ByteDance to sell off TikTok within five or six months, or else TikTok could be banned from U.S. app stores. And, you know, TikTok and other civil society groups say there's some issues with this bill and it could lead to First Amendment violations of TikTok and Americans who use TikTok. But, you know, it seems like lawmakers are determined to push this forward. TikTok has engaged in a large call to action among its users, trying to drive users to call members of Congress. We heard from numerous congressional offices yesterday that they were being flooded with calls from users of the app, some of whom were confused about what was going on.

The Democratic share of the electorate, this is all adults, that's according to a prior poll, CNN poll, versus speech watchers. This year the audience was slightly less Democratic than it normally is, less than the 41 percent in 2020 and 41 percent in 2022. But the jump, that is, how much more Democratic are the speech viewers than the general electorate? That generally stayed the same. That seven point jump that we saw. Last year we saw an eight point jump. Back in 2022, we saw an 11 point jump.So, the fact that they viewed it a little less positively, Biden's speech, than normal isn't that much of a big surprise because the audience was less Democratic.",

Will this speech have a larger effect than normal? We'll just have to wait and see.Again, Biden's floor is so low. So, you know, if there's a lot of positive spin coming out of the speech, which generally there seems to be, or as you point out to me the speech clips well, maybe the approval ratings will rise.",
