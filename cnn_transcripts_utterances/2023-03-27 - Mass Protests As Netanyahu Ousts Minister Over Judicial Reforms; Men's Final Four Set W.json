      "sentences": "All right, protests erupt in Tel Aviv and takeoffs halted at its airport due to a strike after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired a cabinet minister who opposed the controversial plans for a judicial overhaul. Crowds poured into the streets and lit fires Sunday night while security forces fired water cannons on demonstrators.Let's bring in former U.S. ambassador to Israel, Dan Shapiro. So nice to see you, Mr. Ambassador. Let's start with the latest news from there. What will a general strike called by both labor and major employers mean for that country? DANIEL SHAPIRO, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO ISRAEL (via Skype):  Well, the country is in some degree of chaos at the moment. Prime Minister Netanyahu miscalculated very badly when he said he'd fire this defense minister who had warned that pushing forward with this judicial overhaul legislation would cause a major danger to Israel's national security. He -- the defense minister, Yoav Gallant, actually favors the legislation but he based his warning on the fact that massive numbers of IDF reservists, including air force pilots, who were refusing to serve under a government they believe was abandoning democratic principles. And he also cited intelligence that Israel's enemies were planning to take advantage of the chaos. So there were already strong protests against the judicial overhaul but last night when he fired the defense minister there was a spontaneous eruption. Thousands of -- hundreds of thousands, or at least, pouring into the streets. And numerous members of his own coalition were sufficiently spooked by that that they called on him to suspend the legislation. Now the general strike has been called. There are no planes leaving the airport. Malls are shutting down and schools are shutting down while the country waits for Netanyahu to announce the suspension.",

It's clear that the legislation cannot advance now under these circumstances. At best he can try to -- try to come back with a watered-down version. But some members of his own government and of his political base now feel abandoned and they may protest a decision to suspend it. All of this represents a kind of historic political mismanagement. When he came into office with this government about three months ago he said his agenda was to expand Israel's relations with Arab states to deal with the threat caused by Iran and to provide relief to citizens from the rising cost of living. And for three months the government hasn't done anything on any of those issues. Instead, the country has been engulfed in chaos around this one issue about overhauling the judicial system and weakening the Supreme Court. It's a real extreme overreach by him and his coalition partners that -- who he is very dependent on and that's led them to this crisis.",

So I think when the consul general announced his resignation he was joining a very large and very distinguished group of officials and former officials -- many of them appointed by Benjamin Netanyahu -- saying this really cannot go forward. ROMANS:  Yes. You mentioned that about what the president said -- President Biden. His National Security Council said and issued a statement saying, \"We continue to strongly urge Israeli leaders to find a compromise\" and that \"U.S. support for Israel's security and democracy remains ironclad.\" I guess if you were ambassador today what would your first order of business be? I mean, we haven't seen protests like this in the streets of Israel -- I mean, in modern memory.",

That's bad for Israel's interest and its security but it's also bad for the U.S. interests and our common security interests in this region. So it's, I think, important that be expressed by President Biden and by Secretary of State Blinken and others in the administration. They've done so. I hope it will help encourage the government in Israel to move on the path toward a -- if they have to do this legislation at all, a more consensual, more --",

But Creighton's Baylor Scheierman steals the inbound pass and ties the game for the Bluejays. Six seconds to go now, Aztec's Darrion Trammell looking for the win but Creighton is called for a foul. Look at the hand on the hip there. There was just 1.2 seconds left. Trammell, though, misses his first shot. The pressure is on, baby. But the senior locks in and nails the game-winner. Creighton's last chance goes flying out of reach. Game over. Trammell played in front of fewer than 1,000 fans at Seattle University last year.

That's near the pre-pandemic level of 77 percent. This is according to the Labor Department. A sign that work-from-home may be all but over.Looking at markets around the world right now, the Hang Seng down nearly two percent. Asian markets reacting to banking troubles in the U.S. and in Europe. Asia now closed. But optimism on that front in Europe this morning as Deutsch Bank shares rebounded and deposits and loans at Silicon Valley Bank found a buyer. On Wall Street, stock index futures right now leaning a little bit higher here. All three major averages rose last week despite the Fed's latest interest rate hike. The Nasdaq leading the gains. The Dow and the S&amp;P finishing up more than one percent for the week. On inflation watch, gas prices holding steady at $3.44 a gallon. This week we'll see the latest in consumer confidence, jobless claims, a reading on GDP, and the Fed's favorite inflation gauge, the PCE price index. All right, I want to bring in partner and co-founder of Flynn Zito Capital Management, Doug Flynn. Doug, we need you this morning here. Nine rate hikes in the past year. People are worried about how to manage their money in this higher interest rate environment in the midst of bank failures. What is your overall advice to people nervous about their money right now? DOUG FLYNN, PARTNER AND CO-FOUNDER, FLYNN ZITO CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, LLC (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, we all know that we need to keep less than $250,000 in the bank. And I wish more people had the problem that they had to spread their money around to more than one bank but unfortunately, not as many people as we'd like to have that issue. But the real thing is if you're in a big safe bank you're probably getting some of the lowest yields you can get. And so the first thing you need to do if you need to keep it all liquid is you can look to some of those online banks. You just have to make sure they're FDIC- insured, of course. And you also want to look to your local credit union. Credit unions typically will pay a little bit more, they're more local, and they're also backed by the NCUA just like FDIC. It's an insurance that insures up to $250,000. So that's for your liquid money. Those are the things you need to do.",

You could look to some federal or Treasury money market mutual funds, and those are backed by securities that are issued by the government. And those yields now are between four to five percent and some CDs are paying a little more than five percent if you stay on the short-term.So that's the first place you need to go. If you have a concern about your money in the bank you can look to some federal or Treasury money market mutual funds. It keeps it liquid and yields are much higher than you're ever going to get in the bank, so it combines. That's a good first place to go. If you have a little bit longer term we could talk about some bonds and some bond mutual funds.",

And if that happens you actually can get a positive move with some of your money in those bond funds. So looking in the two- to three-year timeframe, stay away from the stock market.
