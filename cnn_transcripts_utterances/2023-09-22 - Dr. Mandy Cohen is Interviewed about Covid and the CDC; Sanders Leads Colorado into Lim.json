Ninety-two-year-old Rupert Murdoch, who built and oversaw a powerful right-wing news empire, announced that he will step down as chairman of Fox and News Corps, passing the torch to his eldest son Locklan, who will become the sole chairman of both companies.But is Fox's grip on the Republican Party as powerful as it once was? Joining us now, CNN's senior data reporter Harry Enten. Harry, give me the number. HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA REPORTER: All right, this morning's number is two because Donald Trump has skipped or will skip two Republican debates on either Fox News or Fox Business. He don't care about Fox News and Fox Business. Why is that? Well, take a look here. News source GOP voters turn to most. And 74 percent say not Fox News. Now, the plurality leader is Fox News at 26 percent, but the fact is, most Republicans are, in fact, not tuning to Fox News as its main news source. Other follow-ups, social media, 12 percent, broadcast networks at 11 percent. But I think that this is a key number to keep in mind going forward 74 percent of Republican likely voters say the news source they turn to most is not Fox News.",

His favorable rating amongst them, 85 percent. Look at the primary vote share he's getting with them nationally. The vast majority, 60 percent, are going for him, which, of course, is very different from what we saw on the other slide, which was the vast majority of GOP voters are not, in fact, tuning into Fox News as their main news source.But I will note this.
