The idea that Trump is using Eric Adams' legal problems to validate his own false claims about political - being targeted politically, it worked well for him during the campaign. Whether or not it's going to result in something as sweeping as a pardon or some other kind of relief remains to be seen. The reality is, the case has gone pretty far. They just had hearings the other day and a trial date has already been set for Eric Adams. So, it would take a very substantial intervention. I mean the grand jury issued the indictment. The prosecutors have exchanged a lot of information with the defense team. They've gone before the judge a couple of times. And again, a trial date has been set.

He feels that there has been a weaponization and, in some cases, that has borne out where you've seen that there has been targeting of conservatives. So, he definitely sees this as a tool in the toolbox for him.

And for some shoppers, the change is basically a letdown from yearspast. One retired Black Friday shopping fan tells \"The New York Times,\" quote, \"shopping has really changed, said Max Frazier, pointing out that most sales today occur online.\" And I guess we're a little nostalgic for the fun - the fun we used to have on Black Friday because that doesn't exist anymore. Joining me now to talk about how Black Friday is changing, but still critical to retailers, is Harley Finkelstein, president of Shopify, the global e-commerce company.

Australia is now banning children under the age of 16 from using social media. The new law requires tech companies to take, quote, \"reasonable steps\" to prevent young children from accessing their services. Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Reddit, Snapchat and X all are expected to be affected and could face millions in fines if they do not comply. And it's a change that Australians seem to be well on board with. A recent YouGov poll found that 77 percent of Australians support banning children under 16 from using social media. Even higher numbers support stronger penalties on companies that do not comply with the law. Now, this historic change coming after a number of tragic incidents in which Australian parents said their children were driven to suicide by bullying, exacerbated by social media.
