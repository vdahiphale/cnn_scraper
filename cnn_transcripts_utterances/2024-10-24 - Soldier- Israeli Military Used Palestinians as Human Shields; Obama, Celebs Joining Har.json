We know from state data that a third of active voters have already cast their ballot. This is a state where early voting is well underway. So the campaign is trying to capitalize on that over the next several days by again encouraging their supporters to go out and vote.Now, they're bringing in all the stops to do exactly that, with former President Barack Obama joining the Vice President today here. It's their first time on the campaign trail together. And of course, Bruce Springsteen will be headlining. He, of course, has made frequent appearances in the waning days of the election for democratic candidates before. But even as all of this is ongoing, we are also getting a glimpse into the Vice President's closing argument. For example, tomorrow, she heads to Houston, Texas. Not a battleground, but it is where the campaign says it is the epicenter of what they call the Trump abortion ban. So giving them an opportunity to amplify their messaging on this issue with none other than Beyonce, who we're told is going to be joining the Vice President. There has been work behind the scenes between the campaign and -- or the celebrities team, the singers team, to try to get something on the books. This is going to be one of those moments where the two talk together about reproductive freedom. Now, moving forward, the Vice President will continue to warn about a potential second Trump term. We saw that bring CNN's town hall last night. We expect to hear more of that, particularly her messaging that the former President is out to get revenge of his -- of who he says are his enemies, while the Vice President is focused on what she calls the American to-do list. So anticipate hearing more of that messaging in the closing days of this election as well. One of the places she'll be making or delivering that message is going to be in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday at the National Mall at the Ellipse where former President Donald Trump delivered his fiery speech on January 6th that set in motion the attack on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters. So certainly, again, the Vice President pulling together all these different issues to make her case to the American people.",

So they're not on a persuasion mission in that part of Georgia, around Atlanta to so much persuade, although there's some of that as to motivate and tell people to get out and vote.I think there was some concern about early vote in Georgia and some of the numbers that were coming out of rural Georgia and some of the Republican efforts there. So I think that this is a well-timed rally to try and get people out engaged and voting. And so, you know, you bring your biggest attractions to do that. And that's an all-star cast. As for Houston, I think it's a little bit different. I think they're going to use them not because they believe they're going to win the state of Texas, but because they want to highlight this issue of abortion rights and reproductive rights, Texas being ground zero in terms of restrictive abortion laws that have had really grave impacts on some women there. So I think they're trying to give people a peek into what could happen if there were a national abortion ban. And I think Beyonce will certainly bring more attention to that event.

But that in some ways is priced into the stock of Donald Trump, whereas people are really trying to get to know Kamala Harris. So her answers are being scrutinized more closely because people are looking for clues to who she is and where she's going. And that puts additional pressure on her. I know that that particular piece of my analysis was quoted widely. I also talked about some of the strengths of her presentation, including when she said, the difference between us is that he's going to come to the office with an enemies list and I'm going to come with a to-do list about how we work on those things, those concerns that we've discussed here tonight. I thought that was powerful and compelling, and really a fundamental argument in the final 10 days of this campaign.And every time Donald Trump goes out with his grievance list and talks about who he's going to fire to protect himself and who he's going to go after using the tools of the Justice Department and the presidency, I think he underscores the fact that that's his fundamental concern.
