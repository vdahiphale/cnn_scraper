Palestinian health officials say more than 2,200 people have been killed in Gaza. While 1,300 people on the Israeli side are dead after that Hamas attack last weekend.In the past hour, we heard from the IDF's international spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus. He told me Israel is doing what it can to make sure civilians are not in the fining line. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. JONATHAN CONRICUS, IDF INTERNATIONAL SPOKESPERSON: And I would say that, you know, we have been in very difficult situations. Israel has been in difficult situations. We have fought many wars. And even though, you know, we have many critics calling us vengeful and, you know, having soldiers cross the line to barbarism, that's not usually -- that's not a criticism that has been fielded towards us. And I think that our soldiers, as emotional as the situation is, I trust on them to keep a cool and professional mindset and to focus on the job. And we have already shown that we are not targeting the civilians. Currently, it's airstrikes. We're not targeting the civilians. We're targeting Hamas operatives, their infrastructure, their leaders, their logistics, et cetera. Unfortunately, there are civilians in the battlefield. We are doing everything we can not to have them injured or hurt or killed. But unfortunately, they're there. Then they are at risk. By the way, we have called on these civilians to evacuate the northern part of the Gaza Strip to be out of the area, which is going to be where we are going to conduct more intense combat operations. I'm happy to say that hundreds of thousands have heeded our warnings, despite the efforts of Hamas to stop them from leaving, which I think is taking cynicism and brutality to a whole different level. Hamas governs the Gaza Strip and they're telling people don't evacuate, they want them to stay put because they want them to be killed. I'll tell you that on the reverse, on the mirror image in Israel, we have evacuated all of the communities around the Gaza Strip. And we did that within two days after the monstrous terror attack on -- a week ago on Saturday. Why did we evacuate? Because civilians should be as far as possible from combat zones. Now, not everyone had the perfect way of traveling by themselves. But civil society organized itself, got together and people found solutions, whether it's hotels or living with relatives or finding temporary housing. In war, horrible things happen, but those who want to live, find solutions. And what we are offering the Palestinians is a better chance of survival. And if they take it, they are -- they're doing the right and responsible thing, getting out of the combat zone. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

A warning, her report contains graphic and also disturbing images.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): This is what running for your life looks like in Gaza. An ambulance with a young girl and wounded woman inside rocked by explosions as they attempt to flee. It is unclear what happened to the pair, but they're among the tens of thousands of people on the move after Israel's military called on nearly half of Gaza's population, some 1.1 million people to get south in a matter of hours. But along the safe passages specified by the IDF, utter horror. You're looking at the carnage and chaos on Salahuddin Street, one of the designated evacuation routes. In the aftermath of explosions, families killed amid their belongings. CNN has geolocated this video and four other clips from the horrifying scene. The U.N. calls Israel's evacuation advisory impossible and a violation of the rules of war. And Palestinian officials accuse the IDF of bombing civilians even as they fled. Dozens of evacuees were killed or wounded by Israeli airstrikes according to Hamas. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment. The victims are flooding into Gaza's overwhelmed hospitals. And again, it's the youngest caught in the crossfire. Nearly half of Gaza's population is children. What did the children do to deserve this? This woman says. Did they fight you? Did they fire rockets? My niece and her whole family are dead. The only survivor is a two-year-old girl. The health care system is on the brink. A complete siege, making it impossible to get aid into the enclave. And already, there's a shortage of everything, even space in the morgue. We're keeping the dead in ice cream trucks so the bodies don't rot, this doctor says. Gaza is in crisis. Gaza needs help. For those still able to move south, this is one of the neighborhoods families are expected to flee towards, Khan Yunis, where Israeli airstrikes have wreaked havoc. This is a genocide, not a war. It's genocide, this man says. And it's an attempt to force all Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip. Finding refuge is proving dangerous and deadly. And for the many families desperate for shelter, the fear is there may be no safe places left. Salma Abdelaziz, CNN, London. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You know, every one of these members, the, the two operations that I personally went on, whether it was out in the high foot Nazareth and the Tiberius area the second on the West Bank and Jerusalem area, we're all structurally grateful. You know, many of these had been stuck for four or five and six days, flights canceled, no way out. no thoughts on how they were going to be able to maneuver. Had called the State Department, really received very little if no effort whatsoever from them. And so, that was the whole reason when I -- you know, I was over in Afghanistan 2021 and conducted the very first successful overland rescue of Americans for a woman and her three Children out of Texas. And I had a bit of an inkling on how this would turn out and which is why I had quickly mobilized, went over there and started to conduct the ground evacuations. I've got a charter tomorrow that's going to go out with 218 Americans. We're now at 96 Americans through ground evacuations, of which I had done 77 of those.

We know Iran's influence in the destabilization of this. We know that people like General Secretary Hassan Nasrallah of Hezbollah in Lebanon are getting involved. We see Hamas's response as they continue to ramp up its efforts and funding. But we also need to start looking at the Golan Heights and we also need to start looking at other Iranian proxy militias, such as the one even in Iraq, which is being pledged by Hadi al-Amiri for the Hashd Al-Sha'bi, the Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq, and many others. So, this could turn into a much bigger thing than just the Gaza Strip. This could turn into a whole of region destabilization. And I think that this is where international attention and support needs to come in to start looking at how do we truly get certain things like ceasefires in place? How do we actually ensure the safety and the minimization of collateral damage of civilians on all sides?

We should be a little easy on it when it comes to humanitarian law. No, that's not what the law requires. Now, one thing, you know, with respect to these warnings that I worry about, the last time we saw warnings like this was in 2006 when Israel fought. Hezbollah in Southern Lebanon. It issued these broad warnings, evacuate Southern Lebanon, and it then targeted and killed anybody who was left, just assuming there were Hezbollah when, in fact, many civilians couldn't flee, they were afraid to flee, and I'm afraid we may see something like that here in Gaza again. These warnings come out. Many people won't go. They're afraid to go. They're unable to move.

You know, who cares about all these civilian dead?And so, yes, I think it's important for the Israeli government, not simply as a legal matter, it's bound not to target, not to fire indiscriminately on civilians, but also just as a strategic matter. You know, does it -- what's it going to do with the people of Gaza? It may be occupying Gaza. Does it want the people, you know, hating the Israeli government for having slaughtered so many civilians from the air, or does it recognize that ultimately Israelis have to live with Palestinians? They're in this one small area. The two-state solution as a practical matter is dead because of all the settlements. So, the Israeli government really faces a choice.

The Egyptian foreign minister says the Rafah Crossing with Gaza is open, but roads on the Gaza side cannot be used because of the aerial bombardment. And sources tell CNN that U.S. intelligence warned of a possible attack from Gaza in the days before the violence began. An update on September 28th cautioned that Hamas was ready to step up launch rocket attacks across the border. On October 5th, the CIA sent a wire warning of violence from Hamas. None of those warnings, though, indicated the type of overwhelming attack that Hamas did to carry out the events of October 7th. Intelligent sources say these types of warnings are typical for the region. However, other sources say they tried to warn the Biden administration and Israel of the Hamas build up, but we're ignored.

And basically, you need about a three to one ratio when it comes to -- personnel when it comes to attacking a particular location.But as far as the Israeli forces are concerned, they will move in a way that synchronizes the ground movements with air movements and also, probably with naval movement, because the comments by Israeli officials have been pretty clear that they're going to use as many different elements of their military power to bring their force to bear against Hamas. Their basic idea is to destroy -- their objective is to destroy Hamas as a political entity, as a viable political entity. And the effort that they'll make to do that will basically be to move in, capture as much territory probably temporarily as they can, and then, in essence, take out as many of the Hamas fighters as they possibly can. So, it's going to be a brutal, I think, next few days if everything holds in terms of normal patterns. And what they're trying to do is they're trying to move forward in a way that would allow for maximum use of firepower and maximum use of time. And of course, in all of this intelligence is key because they need to know exactly where the Hamas fighters are, they need to minimize the element of surprise and tactical engagements, which is very hard to do in a situation like this. And as they move forward, that's going to create, I think, a situation where there will be pockets of resistance within Gaza City, perhaps, and also in some of the other locations within Gaza.

      "sentences": "You get at a few of the challenges here. Part of the issue is that these warnings about a potential escalation in the Israeli Palestinian conflict were not atypical at all. It's very common for there to be on essentially a list of daily hotspots, a risk coming across from intel centers that there could be some sort of conflict or some sort of tension in the Israeli Palestinian conflict.So, even as there were reports that something might happen, it didn't stand out from the -- essentially the white noise of issues with the Israeli Palestinian conflict. It is always essentially on the back burner. And that's where those warnings stayed. In fact, if you can remember when we got a look at the Discord leaks of highly classified documents, that showed us bullet point after bullet point, and that's how some of these reports are handed over. And one of those bullet points, perhaps, was simply the Israeli Palestinian conflict. But none of those reports warned of what we saw on Saturday morning, a large-scale, multi-pronged terrorist attack on Israeli civilians and on military bases. And that's part of the issue here. The other issue, as you point out, is that Israel collects its own intel on Gaza and shares that with the U.S. The U.S. doesn't really do any intel collection when it comes to Gaza, instead of relying on the Israelis own information. So, all of that went into this issue of there not being either enough surveillance or enough of a warning of what was coming. In the wake of the attack, we've had a chance to look at some of the weapons that were used. Take a look at this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LIEBERMANN (voiceover): An entire arsenal on display. Weapons fashioned in Hamas' homegrown facilities, but no less deadly. CNN analyzed dozens of photos and videos of Hamas militants during the surprise assault to identify the weapons used to kill at least 1,200 people in Israel. MAJ. MIKE LYONS, U.S. ARMY (RET.): The most important characteristic of the military equipment they have is that it's easily interchangeable, it's reliable, dependable, and you can get parts for it. LIEBERMANN (voiceover): Many, like this Soviet Bill 50 caliber machine gun, appear to be Russian or Chinese firearms, relics from previous wars, that made their way into the hands of Hamas. Ubiquitous among many of the photos and videos, the Avtomat Kalashnikova, the AK-47, the preferred weapon for militant groups, capable of spewing automatic fire with horrific results. The assault rifles, along with the grenades carried by Hamas militants made them deadly when they reached Israeli towns and villages near Gaza.",

An Israeli settler shooting a Palestinian point blank in the South Hebron Hills. While the man who was shot in this video did survive, many others confronted with settler violence across the occupied West Bank recently have not. CNN has reached out to Israel's police for comment on this shooting, but has not received a response. Nearly a week into the war between Hamas and Israel, at least 47 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank by settlers and Israeli forces, with hundreds of others injured. Fears that the violence would spill over into this area are beginning to feel very real. At the heart of the conflict, this place, Al-Aqsa Mosque, usually filled with tens of thousands of worshippers gathered for Friday prayers. Today, almost empty. The Israeli police restricting access to the compound, only letting in the elderly. 57-year-old Um Tamer says seeing the compound so empty is upsetting. The atmosphere was so tense, it was difficult getting in, she says. We are just going there to pray. We're not going to fight. We're not going to war. What is a worshipper expected to do? Meantime, piles of prayer mats as younger Palestinians were forced to worship on the streets. Abbas was one of them. He says, this feels like an inflection point in this decades-long conflict. It's very different this time around, he says. This time feels more difficult. May God grant us relief. Fridays can be fraught here. Over the years, all too often these streets have witnessed clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police. And today, stun grenades, tear gas, and skunk water used to disperse local residents and worshippers. Munir Hamal (ph) was reportedly one of them. His nephew, Qassem, said that his uncle was attacked by Israeli police as he tried to pray close to his home after being barred from Al-Aqsa. Like many civilians here, Qassem fears for his family's safety. What's happening is very ugly. I can't explain it to my kids. I'm trying to distract them so they don't get scared, Qassem says. So many people here scared about what happens next. They robbed us of our homeland and now they punish us here in Al-Aqsa, and they punish the people of Gaza. They annihilated this small tight space. Why? Why do they deserve that? She says. Becky Anderson, CNN, East Jerusalem. (END VIDEO TAPE)",

Melissa, good to have you with us. Let's talk about what's happening in France. First and foremost, 65 arrests since the conflict began.

A frenzied knife attack by a man who was of Chechen origin, only later linked actually to those events in the Middle East. The rest of the day of jihad remained relatively calm here in France, but today, we've seen the evacuation of both the Louvre and Versailles as a result of bomb threats. Julia.",

One week since the conflict began, fake videos claiming to show the fighting have been going viral with worrying results. As CNN's Donie O'Sullivan reports. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): One video shows a rocket purportedly fired by Hamas. Another video claims to show Israeli jets bombing Gaza. But neither is real. This video is actually footage from a video game called Arma 3. And this is actually video of soccer celebrations in Algeria. It's all part of a tidal wave of viral mis and disinformation circulating around the Israel Hamas conflict. Adi Cohen works with Memetica, an online threat intelligence service. He's been monitoring misinformation like this, a fake BBC News report that falsely claimed Ukraine had provided weapons to Hamas. O'SULLIVAN: This is relatively sophisticated stuff.
