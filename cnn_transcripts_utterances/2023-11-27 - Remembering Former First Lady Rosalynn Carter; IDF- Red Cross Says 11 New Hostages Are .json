Because caregiving had always been a very important part of her life. She had had to step up when she was 12 years old to take care of her own family. And so, for much of her life. She understood the difficulties that caregivers have. So that was a very important stop for her. A wreath was laid at the site of the Institute. And then, of course, she comes to the Carter Center. When they came back from Washington after that defeat, which by the way, Mrs. Carter said she knew was going to happen. Her husband thought they could win reelection, but Mrs. Carter said. I always knew that it was not in the cards for Jimmy to be reelected. But they come. They come now to Atlanta, to the Carter Center, and it was there that they began this extraordinary post presidential life, doing so many things that are in the service of not just the country but the world. Monitoring elections, combating severe diseases around the world, among many other things at the Carter Center, is taking on. So tonight, the public will have a chance to pay their respects to her before what should be a remarkable service tomorrow in Atlanta, at a church on the campus of Emory University.",

As you point out, he's been in home Hospice actually since last February and he's 99 years old. But nothing President Carter does should surprise us anymore. Remember, he survived what many people thought was a fatal brain cancer several years ago. He has continued to thrive as best as possible in-home Hospice, down in Plains. And I think it's the relationship that Rosalyn and Jimmy Carter had while they were together in Plains in this last year that says so much about their relationship.Mrs. Carter's dementia was advancing. He, of course, was certainly frail and quite ill. But Brianna, every day we're told by family they sat together in the house they've owned for -- since 1961. They held hands. They talked and every night they -- each ate a dish of peanut butter ice cream. They have been partners their entire relationship. True, genuine partners. She helped get him elected governor. She helped him with his campaign for president. She read all of the speeches that he gave from the White House and made edits when she thought it was important. So, she was truly a partner to him. And he always looked up to her as someone who could completely relate to the work that he was trying to do and add to what he hoped to do as president and then in the post presidency.",

One of those Americans, Keith Siegel, who is the father and brother of my next two guests. Joining us now, Ilan Teve (ph) and Lee Siegel. Ilan let's talk a little bit about your mother. First of all, she has been released. Show us a picture of her.ILAN TEVE (PH), MOTHER RELEASED BY HAMAS: Yes. So, my mother has been released last night. We are so happy to have her. And I truly believe that it's not a miracle. It's a hard job of the U.S. government and Qatar and Egypt and the Israeli government. And I'm sure that if she is back home after 51 days of hell, as she says, we have to bring all of them home.

She's currently over at the Children's Hospital outside Tel Aviv in Ramat Gan. The uncle and I had a very emotional discussion and I want to play a little clip from our special interview. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) YAIR ROTEM, UNCLE OF 13-YEAR-OLD RELEASED BY HAMAS: She told me, yeah, mother is here and they came and they took us and they didn't give us a lot of time to prepare. But I had time to give her a hug. And Raya, my sister, her mother was crying when the girls, the children left. And yes, that's how it ended. And Raya is still there. She had to just say goodbye to her mother. She don't know what is going to happen with her mother. The mother is now going is -- the mother doesn't know what happens with Hila. I'm sure my sister, Hila's mother, don't know what's going to be next. Are they going to set her free? Are they going to jail her again? Are they going to murder her?

At the time the students were speaking a mix of Arabic and English and two were wearing traditional Palestinian scarves.
