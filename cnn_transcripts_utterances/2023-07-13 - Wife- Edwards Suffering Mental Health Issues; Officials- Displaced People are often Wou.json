He and the Finnish President just wrapped up a press conference in Helsinki, Finland, of course is the latest country to join the NATO Alliance. We will continue to bring you the latest as we get it, now to some other news today. The wife of BBC anchor Huw Edwards has confirmed that it was is the BBC present to who was suspended earlier this week following allegations of payments for sexually explicit images. Her statement made on behalf of Edwards was released just moments after the London metropolitan police said on Wednesday that there was no information to indicate that a criminal offense has been committed. These developments are the latest in a week of British media frenzy. Our CNN's Scott McLean reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The British Broadcasting Corporation has been covering the news for more than a century. But lately, it is the news. On Friday, the Sun Newspaper printed anonymous allegations accusing an unnamed, but well known male BBC presenter of paying a young person for explicit images. The BBC reported that they had suspended the presenter and the UK known for its sensational tabloid culture was thrown into a frenzy of speculation over his identity. Several well-known BBC faces were quick to distance themselves online, and even on air.",

State Mediareporting, Leader Kim Jong Un personally guided the launch of the Hwasong-18 intercontinental ballistic missile on Wednesday, which flew for 74 minutes before crashing down in the waters near Japan. The solid fuel ICBM has been called the notes most powerful nuclear weapon, but it's unclear if it could actually deliver a nuclear payload. This launch also follows threats from Kim Jong-Un's younger sister, as CNN's Will Ripley reports; she's being called the most powerful woman in North Korea. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Amazing milestone for North Korea's missile program, Pyongyang's latest ICBM launch, breaking its own record for the longest ever missile flight. A staggering 74 minutes hurtling high above the earth at supersonic speed, hitting 6000 kilometers before splashing down in the sea, the massive missiles potential striking range, the entire U.S. mainland and most of the world. Pyongyang's most provocative launch in months is coinciding with this NATO Summit in Lithuania, quickly condemned by Japan as an unacceptable threat to regional stability. South Korea's military ready to overwhelmingly respond. The ICBM a crown jewel in leader Kim Jong Un's nuclear arsenal, protecting the power fortune and future of the ruling Kim family. His young daughter Kim Ju Ae, often appearing alongside her dad, barely 10 years old, the rising star of a state propaganda campaign, carefully crafted by Kim's younger sister, the mastermind of the Kim family brand. Leader's loyal confidant trusted advisor and perhaps the most powerful woman in North Korea. CHUN SU-JIN, AUTHOR, \"NORTH KOREAN WOMEN IN POWER: DAUGHTERS OF THE SUN\": She is the number two. Well that is for sure. But actually she is very smart lady and she actually knows that her position is secure only when her brother is secure. RIPLEY (voice over): Just five years ago, very few people knew of Kim Yo Jong, she stepped down to South Korean soil, the first member of North Korea's ruling family to cross the DMZ. She carried a message of peace from Pyongyang. North Korean athletes and cheer squads got a warm welcome to the 2018 Winter Olympics. She rose to fame as a fixture at her brother's side. Standing silently behind Kim as he met with former President Trump that brief period of diplomacy feels like a distant memory. The silent sister now a loud voice of defiance issuing fiery statements on state media often laced with crude language. This week, she threatened to shoot down U.S. spy planes, accusing them without evidence of entering North Korean territory warning in case of repeated illegal intrusions, the U.S. forces will experience a very critical flight. Past actions prove he's not all talk. In 2020 a dispute with South Korea ended with a bang, Kim ordered the demolition of a joint Liaison Office at the border turning diplomatic dreams into a pile of rubble. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

A mass grave with the bodies of at least 87 people, includingethnic Masalits have been discovered in Sudan's West Darfur. The UN believes they were killed by paramilitary rapid support forces and their allied militia and is calling for an investigation. The RSF denies they were behind the deaths. The conflict in Sudan has become a humanitarian catastrophe, displacing more than 3 million people many fleeing across borders. The UN says Sudan is on the brink of a full scale civil war today, Egypt meantime launching a fresh attempt to mediate this crisis at a summit of regional leaders. It is the latest in a series of international efforts to prevent a prolonged conflict and deepening humanitarian crisis. Countries in the region are in Cairo right now trying to find ways to end the fighting. Joining me now is Egypt's Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, Minister, great to have you with a thank you so much for taking the time. Look, Egypt spearheading the summit of Sudan's neighbors. President Sisi presented an initiative to the group based on a ceasefire opening of safe passage for aid, comprehensive dialogue and a mechanism to communicate with the warring parties.

So we are shouldering a very large burden. But we do so in recognition of the relationship and the humanitarian conditions. And we continue to allow on a daily basis almost 1000 Sudanese to enter but after receiving visas, because of the security and volatility of the situation, where infiltration can easily be a manner for an desirable person to enter whether terrorism or organized crime. So at this level and scale, any country must apply some form of measure to that and to maintain the security. But I think the level of entry into Egypt of those who need protection or willingness to maintain our borders open and to fulfill our legal obligations under the international conventions, is not in doubt, and will never be in doubt because we consider Sudanese as brothers and sisters that are certainly very much welcome and have been so for decades.",
