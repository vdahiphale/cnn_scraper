I speak to Norwegian Refugee Council head,Jan Egeland, who helped launch the Oslo Peace Accords. And after a week of riots across France, the far-right seizes the political moment. French transportation minister, Clement Beaune, weighs in on government efforts to regain control. Then, as Ukraine warns of a potential Russian threat to the Zaporizhzhia power plant, Correspondent Ben Wedeman reports from Eastern Ukraine. Welcome back to the program, everyone. I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Israel's military operation in the West Bank City of Jenin is over, defense forces say. At least 12 Palestinians and one Israeli soldier are dead. Thousands were forced to flee their homes. It was the most intense incursion on the West Bank since the Second Intifada 20 years ago. And still, the violence continues. Earlier today, Israel conducted strikes in Gaza in response to the rocket launches there. And a mosque claims a car rammed attack in Tel Aviv injuring eight pedestrians was carried out by one of their fighters. Correspondent Salma Abdelaziz live on the ground, and she joins me now. Salma, what are you seeing around you?",

The Israeli military had just withdrawn, and thousands of people who had been fleeing that violence we're returning to see a city that was damaged, deeply destroyed, deeply devastated. A place without running water, without electricity, without basic services. But what was really astounding, and we have images to show you of that, is that one of the first things that took place was a massive funeral. People wanted to bury the dead, the dozens -- one dozen rather, 12 people who were killed in the Israeli military raid, Israel says they are all combatants and Palestinian factions, were claimed among some of those dead as their own, but those Palestinian factions were out in full force, as you could see in that material, we have for you there. They were waving their flags, shooting celebratory gunfire in the air, sending a clear message that they were unbroken, unbowed by Israel's military incursion, and that they would continue to fight. And despite the widespread devastation we saw, there seemed to be an atmosphere of defiance, of resistance. There seemed no doubt among those in the Jenin Camp that Israel's military would return, it would return again soon. But what you heard from those Palestinian factions and their supporters is that they were ready and willing for that fight. For the residents caught in the cross fires, of course, there was a traumatizing and massive impact. There were still drones flying overhead. We went to one woman's home. She was the mother of three daughters. She says they were pin downed in the fighting for hours. She came back. Was able to flee at some point. Came back to find her home completely devastated. Her daughter's little room, she has three little daughters. Her daughter's little room, the wall had just been blown out with explosives. And what she said to me that really stood out, she said, we can rebuild. We can rebuild our homes. We can return material possessions. But how do I rebuild the psyche of my little girls? How do I ever make them feel safe again? And in one of the most impoverished and marginalized corners of the West Bank, an area already deeply deprive. You can imagine that for those little girls. There's little hope, little promise in a future other than another cycle of violence.",

But you stopped short of addressing and suggesting that perhaps this could be a symptom of a larger issue that is underlying the police force as a whole, and the training of the police force in the country and the system. In the past, week there have been more than 5,000 vehicles burned, more than 1,000 buildings damaged or looted, 250 police stations attacked, more than 700 officers injured. A shocking attack on mayors' homes as well. Some 3,400 people have been arrested.

And then, there were some violence which were not about expressing some issues about discrimination, about difficulties in some deprived areas, which were much different and much broader, which are about just stealing and destroying, including public services in these areas. And when you look at the actual violence that we have seen these last days, it is extremely difficult to give a simple explanation because it has also taken place in some cities, in some areas which are much more quiet usually. There was violence against some elected people, the mayor for instance, which I think has no link with what happened the week before. So, we have to be simple and clear. This young person losing its life is not acceptable and justice is being done according to our rule of law. And then, there were violence, we had to remain order. And then, of course, we have to work even harder in areas in which we are already investing a lot to improve public services, to improve conditions of living, of young people in particular.

Around 1:00 a.m., the U.S. Navy says a vessel from Iran's navy approached a commercial oil tanker, drawing fairly close. The U.S. Navy saw this, and even before that tanker issued any sort of distress or looked for a call for help, a U.S. Navy destroyer intervened, sailing closer to the two vessels. And according to the navy, at that point, the Iranian vessel sailed away, changed course and headed away from this incident. But it wasn't over yet. Only three hours later, also in international waters in the Gulf of Oman, another Iranian navy vessel approached another commercial oil tank. This time, drawing even closer. But this time, that oil tanker called for help, hailing a distress signal, which was received by the U.S. Navy destroyer which sailed at full speed toward the incident. In that time, the U.S. Navy says personnel on the Iranian vessel opened fire. You can see video of this incident provided by the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet, which operates in the region. According to the U.S. Navy, it was small arms fire, and crew served weapons that were used by the Iranian personnel to fire upon that oil tanker. And the U.S. Navy says nobody on board that tanker was injured. But you can see some of the ricochets, according the Navy, in that video and there were hits on the oil tanker near the crew living quarters of the crew of that tanker. As the U.S. destroyer approached, once again, the Iranian navy vessel sailed away from the incident. It's not the first time we have seen Iran try to interfere or try to seize oil tankers and commercial vessels, especially in that region. The Gulf of Oman and the Strait of Hormoz, an absolutely a critical waterway for international maritime traffic. In fact, in April and May, Iran seized two vessels within just a couple days of each other. And in response to that, the U.S. Navy and the U.S. military bolstered its presence in the region, sending in more warships and sending in more aircraft, including patrol aircraft, specifically for incidents like this. And yet, Bianna, again, we see this play out, the Iranian attempted seizure, according to the Navy, and the Navy stepping in there to intercede and make sure that the commercial traffic was free and able to continue on its way toward the Arabian Sea.",

The whole area has been under Israeli military occupation since 1967, with the sort of semiautonomous control by the Palestinian authority. From your work, as you mention, with the Oslo Accords, 30 years ago cities like, this cities like Jenin were meant to only be a temporary facility on the process to a two-state solution. How had they turned into what appears to be an ongoing permanent living hell?",

There were more illegal settlements now in the West Bank than at any time the ministers sitting in Netanyahu's extremist government come from these illegal settlements under international law. 441 times so far this year there has been brutal attacks by these settlers. The settler attacks, these are mafia style organizations and they beat women, children, the elderly. They take all of -- they destroy hope forever, et cetera. It's something you can't believe when you travel (INAUDIBLE) many times across the West Bank, Israel and Gaza, to see the humiliation that is now institutionalized by this occupation, which has to end, it is in the interest of Israel and the interest of Palestinians.",

And there's an argument by some analysts that Bibi was pressured for this incursion of such a scale as opposed to what his government that proceeded him, the Lapid and Bennett government had which were nightly sort of more targeted raids. Do you think that this scale of an incursion came about because there had been pressure from within Bibi Netanyahu's own coalition to do such a thing?",

First, I just want to let you know, I am not sure if you are aware that the connection, our internetconnection with you seems to be a bit weak at times. You're cutting in and out. Hopefully, in our remaining minutes it can remain stable. I do want to ask, as you talk about the Israeli leadership the lack of leadership and when it comes to the Palestinian authority. And you talk about the new generation of Palestinians who have no hope and no optimism in terms of what their futures can hold. And also, see no leadership as far as the Palestinian authority and those representing them. They are accused of corruption. They are accused of basically allowing for this vacuum to exist. So, how can either side come together when, one as you noted, is extremists in some of its fringes and then, the other seems to be nonexistent at this point?",

There has to be U.S. leadership in getting out of the current cycle of eyes that is getting worse and worse. We're there on the ground, we're trying to do as much as we can for the Palestinian, women, children, civilians, disabled, but it's getting worse and worse by the day.

We just saw a report about the Taliban banning women's beauty parlors in the country, barred women from public spaces like parks and gyms, a crackdown on media freedoms, obviously not allowing many women to attend schools and work. This is coming despite what may now be viewed as naive promises by the Taliban that they would be in favor of granting women more rights. What is the appropriate response?

And now, they also threaten our right to work. Engagement is the solution. We have been able now to get 80 percent of our female colleagues back to work by agreements locally across Afghanistan. So, it is possible to engage.
