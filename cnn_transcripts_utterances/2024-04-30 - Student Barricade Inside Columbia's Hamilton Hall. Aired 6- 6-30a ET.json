If you look closely, you can see masked people inside the building, attempting to open windows on the upper floors.Hamilton Hall was named for Alexander Hamilton, the treasury secretary. And it's famous, in part, because it was occupied by students back in 1968, amid protests against the Vietnam War. It was taken over again in 1972, also about the war. And then again in 1985 to protest Apartheid. It is also the home of the office of the dean of Columbia College. Our Polo Sandoval has been reporting us -- for us live from the scene, and he is trying to get closer to the building thing as we speak. He'll join us as soon as he finds a place where he can safely go live. In the meantime, let's talk about it with our panel. Evan Osnos is staff writer for \"The New Yorker.\" Republican strategist David Urban is with us and Karen Finney, former senior adviser and senior spokesperson for Hillary 2016. Good morning to all of you. Some pretty stunning images coming to us overnight, Evan. We also are just learning at this hour that banners have been hung from the hall. They read -- they read, \"Hinds Hall\" and \"Intifada.\" Hind is a reference to a woman who was killed in Gaza. Intifada, of course, a reference to uprising, violent struggles the Palestinians have had over the years against Israel.

You'll see it over my shoulder here on the Hamilton building as soon as this truck clears out of the way. This particular banner here reading \"Free Palestine,\" with some Arabic on it, as well. What's interesting here, Kasie, is this is clearly public facing. Some of the other banners that you guys were discussing a short while ago, those actually face toward the interior of the campus, mainly towards the encampment in question that's been in place for nearly two weeks now. This one, however, is actually plainly visible by those folks who are walking along the sidewalk just off the Columbia campus, which might speak to some level of, at least, coordination in terms of what we saw overnight. We did see this group of dozens of people. Still unclear whether or not they have direct affiliation with the university, though at this point, the university's still under restricted access. You need a student I.D. to make your way on campus. But that will be a really important thing to actually learn throughout the day here from the university, potentially from other officials that may possibly be asked to respond, is exactly who the members of that group were. And also very important here, was this in any way, shape, or form connected to that encampment that is just 50 yards away? And I say this, because in the last nearly two weeks of actually being here and ending up on campus and speaking to members of that encampment, who have remained relatively peaceful, they have actually been contained and kept that presence to that lawn. And it wasn't until yesterday, of course, after the -- the escalation that took place, when that deadline was imposed by the university, that we did see that presence significantly grow. And that would lead, hours later, to this certainly would be described as an escalation when you saw these dozens of students take objects to barricade the entrance of Hamilton Hall. That does have a legacy of demonstrations and protests and calls for divestment. And then made their way onto -- into that building itself by force. And then placed those banners around the building, Kasie.",
