Their decision to hold a parade wrapped in royal linen and riding in a -- in the same Land Rover that the queen used during a 1962 visit was viewed as tone- deaf. The Guardian published archived photos -- or archived papers in June of 2021, which reveal that minority immigrants and foreigners were banned from holding certain positions at Buckingham Palace until at least the late 1960s.

Remember, the Justice Department still has hundreds of outstanding January 6 cases, many of which are headed to sentencing, where some defendants have tried to express remorse.For example, in this letter, George Tenney -- he's scheduled to be sentenced next week for his admitted role in the Capitol attack. And like many defendants before him, he is trying to shift blame onto former President Trump. Now, prosecutors allege that Tenney played a key role in exacerbating violence at the Capitol. He was the one who forced open the doors of the Rotunda for the first time, allowing approximately 48 rioters to enter. Those rioters, of course, then fanned out throughout the Capitol, destroying property, assaulting police, threatening members of Congress. Well, Tenney has penned this letter to the judge hoping for leniency. And in it, he takes responsibility for his actions, but he also places blame on Trump, writing, \"I let one man's rhetoric and lies bring me to a place that couldn't be more far from reality.\" He goes on to say, \"I did get caught up in the lies and made-up news going around from politicians and celebrities in child sex rings, corruption allegations, supposed communism, to election fraud.\"",
