So right now, Pope Francis is seated at the altar, presiding over the start of Easter Mass at the Vatican. Even as the 87-year-old pontiff canceled engagements over the past months and years while recovering from what has been variously described as colds, bronchitis and the flu. And later today he's expected to deliver the traditional Urbi et Orbi blessing from the main balcony at the Vatican.Now, King Charles, head of the Church of England, is also battling health issues. The 75-year-old British monarch was recently diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer. Buckingham Palace said he would attend the traditional Easter Sunday church service at Windsor Castle with his wife, Queen Camilla. So, in a moment, we'll hear from Max Foster, who's on his way to Windsor, England. But first, we're joined by CNN Vatican Correspondent Christopher Lamb. So, Christopher, obviously plenty of concern about the Pope's health. Take us through what we know about how he's doing and his message that he's delivering today.",

As you can see, the pope has been and is celebrating the Easter Sunday mass in St. Peter's Square, attended by thousands of pilgrims from Rome and across the world. As you said, there have been concerns about his health. He's battled bouts of ill health over the winter months, cold, bronchitis, et cetera.But the Pope has shown a determination to be part of all the liturgies so far, apart from on Good Friday evening where he pulled out at the last minute from the Good Friday stations of the cross event at Rome's coliseum and that was due to what the Vatican said, a desire to preserve his health. Now, the Easter Sunday Mass, the Pope is presiding at the moment is, in fact, the fifth liturgy that he will have presided at since Thursday. So, it does underline that this is a very intense schedule, of services for any Pope, let alone an 87-year-old who has had health difficulties. Now, Francis's messages over these days have been ones of service, of humility, of a church that goes out to the world. He's underlined that repeatedly. He's also mentioned the cruelty and madness of war. And we expect when he gives his Urbi et Orbi blessing, his traditional Easter Sunday message, that he will address conflicts around the globe. But I think on Easter Sunday, what Francis will be trying to underline is that the message of Easter of hope, of new life, that that is something that can be applied to a world where there are increasing conflicts and instability and wars. And so, he'll try and apply that message of Easter to the contemporary context. Kim.",

In this video that Trump posted to Truth Social on Friday, it shows two trucks driving on Long Island, decked out in pro-Trump decals and flags, and this image of President Joe Biden hog- tied on the back of a truck. Trump posted that video to his social media site Truth Social on Friday. On Saturday, his campaign defended it, telling CNN in a statement, \"That picture was on the back of a pickup truck that was traveling down the highway. Democrats and crazed lunatics have not only called for despicable violence against President Trump and his family, they are actually weaponizing the justice system against him.\"The Biden campaign, meanwhile, wasted little time responding to this. They told CNN in a statement, \"This image from Donald Trump is the type of crap you post when you're calling for a bloodbath or when you tell the proud boys to stand back and stand by. Trump is regularly inciting political violence and it's time people take him seriously, just ask the Capitol Police officers who were attacked protecting our democracy on January 6th.\" These kinds of violent images are commonplace among some Trump supporters, and you can find them often at his rallies, certainly online, and yes, even on the back of vehicles. But it is still striking to see them coming from a former president and someone who is seeking the White House once again. Of course, this has become commonplace for Trump going all the way back to his 2016 campaign for president and through this week when he has repeatedly attacked one of the judges who is overseeing his case in New York.

They say they have seen more cases in the past three months than in all of 2023. More than half of this year's cases have occurred in children younger than five years old, and 54 measles patients have been hospitalized.The CDC says, the surge in measles cases comes from people bringing measles into the U.S. from abroad and from failing vaccination -- falling vaccination rates inside the U.S. Health officials warn that children are at serious risk of complications from measles, including pneumonia, encephalitis and deadly respiratory and neurological symptoms. Dr. Scott Miscovich is the founder and president of Premier Medical Group Hawaii and he joins me now from Oahu. Thanks so much for being here with us, Doctor.
