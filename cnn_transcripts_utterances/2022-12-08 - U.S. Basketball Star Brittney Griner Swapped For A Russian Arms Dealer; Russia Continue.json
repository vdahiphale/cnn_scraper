And tonight, U.S.basketball star Brittney Griner is finally free from Russian jail after being exchanged in a prisoner swap for a Russian arms dealer. How both sides are responding coming up just ahead. And then I will speak to Ukraine's Minister of Infrastructure as Russia continues to harm the country's power supply. Plus, Buckingham Palace says they won't be commenting on Netflix's new Harry and Meghan docu-series. We'll explore what the reaction has been so far. No more days, she's coming home. That joyful celebration from Brittney Griner's teammates. The U.S. basketball star is finally free after serving almost ten months in a Russian jail on drug offenses. Her shock release comes after months of painstaking negotiation with the U.S. agreeing to free infamous Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout in exchange. Speaking earlier, U.S. President Joe Biden said it   took hard calls to get the deal across the line. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Officials in Kyiv are not commenting right now.

Two young men, the focus of these over-practiced neurosurgeons. Kramatorsk is often bombed, the windows, even in here are taped to slow- flying glass. The effort is intense to repair brains, to save lives, memories, loves and future dreams. They would have little idea where to start their delicate work if they didn't have use of this CT scanner. It can pinpoint damage, find what it's done, and it gives surgeons a plan of action. He says, \"yes and unfortunately, there is no left eye. There is a suspicion of damage to the right eye as well. But definitely no left eye.\" (on camera):  This is the fourth patient we've seen in the space of about an hour coming for a CT scan. It's supposed to be doing 15 or 20 a day. They're actually doing 70 or 80. In short, it's wearing out. (voice-over):  This equipment is vital. The hospital can't afford a new one. But a used one is for sale in the west of Ukraine, cost about 120,000 bucks, price of losing this one, incalculable. He says he shows signs of severe cranial cerebral injury, with acute subdermal hematoma and severe brain contusion. He needs urgent surgery. The administrators here have raised about $60,000. They need help with the rest. This is the only CT scanner in a vast region. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  Critical, this machine is critical.

Does that mean that Russia is, in some way, trying to leverage the situation by holding on to Paul Whelan, knowing the release of Brittney Griner would create many questions around why Paul Whelan wasn't included?",

Nowwhether the Biden administration could do more is a question. It appears they did pretty much as much as they could. But allowing him, I think, it is interesting, that he was allowed to talk to the Western media, namely CNN. And what he said was, I need more help. So in all of the excitement about Brittney Griner, there is another negative side, which is Paul Whelan is not free. That puts a little bit more pressure, I think PR pressure on this day, on the Biden administration. It puts a little cloud on the news that Brittney Griner is being released. But we don't know. Obviously the Russians treat Paul Whelan in a very different way. We're talking about allegations of spying. That's another category. So how they will deal with it is, as you and others have pointed out, they wait for the United States to nab a spy. But it's very hard at this point to say how that will move forward.",

A CNN investigationinto the incidents at Lekki toll gate two years ago found the Nigerian army had fired live rounds into protesters who were protesting, demonstrating against police brutality. This is not only an issue for Nigeria and a condemnation that they are receiving from the Nigerian public. For these allegations of human rights violations, it's also an issue for the United States of America. Over the last two decades, Nigeria has been the recipient of hundreds of millions of dollars of U.S. military assistance and U.S. training, also, they have been approved for U.S. arms sales. Any allegations of human rights violations causes great concern to the United States, because it would place the U.S. administration itself in violation of U.S. law. The Leahy Act, which prohibits the United States to give military assistance to foreign governments accused of human rights violations. A year ago, when the judicial panel investigating what happened a Lekki toll gate found that CNN's investigation had actually been true, that the Nigerian authorities, the Nigerian army, was guilty of firing live fire into demonstrators protesting police brutality, we asked the U.S. State Department. And they said that, if this was true, that they would want the perpetrators held to account. And it would call into question U.S. military support. Two years later, nothing's happened. The question remains whether these latest allegations of wrongdoing on the part of the Nigerian military will have an impact on the U.S.' support -- Nima Elbagir, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
