So, it has taken - is expected to take quite a toll on her.I have just spoken, Kate, to a source who tells me and wants to emphasize that it's non-cancerous. And there is, obviously, a huge amount of interest in this and they're trying to manage that. They're not going to give us any big updates unless there is something significant to announce. They want to respect their privacy. But I can tell you that, you know, the media is already gathering outside the hospital down the road here in London and there is a huge amount of interest of course. The only times I can really think she's been in hospital before that we've been told of is when she had her three children. She's a very fit and healthy person. Very keen on sports. So, it has come as a bit of a surprise. But when I've seen her out and about recently, over Christmas, she's looked well. So, we'll have to wait to see what other updates we get.",

That includes House Speaker Mike Johnson, as well as the chairs of national security committees. And they -- the president will be making the case to these lawmakers that inaction in not passing additional aid for Ukraine would severely hamper the war- torn country on the battlefield. It comes as the administration has been warning for months now that they are running out of fund, running out of aid that they could provide to Ukraine with that last batch provided on December 27th. [09:35:07] And it's coming as the war between Russia and Ukraine is approaching the two year mark. Now, just yesterday, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. And after that meeting he expressed confidence that the U.S. would be able to get additional aid for Ukraine passed, saying that after all the twists and turns he is confident they will finally reach there. But the reality is that it's entirely unclear whether this Ukraine aid will be passed as it is currently bogged down in the talks over border policy negotiations. Those Senate negotiations have been ongoing, but Republicans in the House, conservatives in the House specifically, have really been stressing that they want to see much stricter changes made than what is being discussed in the Senate. So, the president's task and mission today will be in trying to stress the urgency of getting that additional aid for Ukraine, especially as Russia is continuing their assault in the country.",

The expectation is that the House could take that up once the Senate passes it and also pass it very quickly through the House of Representatives.The bigger task ahead, though, is how Mike Johnson navigates the next month. If the CR gets them to March, then they have to come up with an agreement on those full year spending bills. And while an agreement has been struck with Majority Leader Chuck Schumer over the top line spending number, the reality is there's a lot of details that you still have to iron out. And Johnson is going to be under immense pressure from the hardliners within his conference to try and get some policy wins in those discussions. You have some hardliners who are pressing him to once again inject border security into these spending talks. And you've seen already how that has gone in talks with the supplemental. It's really bogged down that process. It's really added to a sense that perhaps more aid for Ukraine will not be coming from Congress. So, that is part of the battle ahead for Mike Johnson. So, while the expectation is they can move fairly quickly this week to try and pass that short-term spending bill, the bigger fight happening in March. John.",

We've seen strikes in northern Iraq, in the Kurdish region, and now a missile strike in Pakistan as well. Again, this is all from Iran. Pakistani officials say two children were killed, several people injured when Iran fired missiles and drones into Pakistani territory yesterday. Iran has insisted it was targeting terrorists there. But Pakistan has now recalled its ambassador and suspended all high-level visits from Iran.With me now, CNN military analyst, retired U.S. Lieutenant General Mark Hertling. General, thanks so much for being with us. Again, what's interesting about this is, this is not through proxies. This is not Hezbollah or the Houthis. This is Iran conducting airstrikes now on a range of targets. What do you see happening here? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, certainly, John, I would suggest that Iran is getting much bolder. To have them actually conduct the attacks as opposed to their proxies I think is certainly a reaction to what has happened in the Houthis, the conflict between the Houthis and the west, especially the United States, the massive attack that was conducted against Yemen by the United States last week, as well as what they see as Sunni attacks inside of Iran. Remember the explosion that happened just a little over a week ago inside of Iran, which is directly attributed to ISIS. So, they are striking out, reaching out and hitting what they believe are Sunni terrorist targets in both - in Damascus, in Syria, in Iraq and as well as now in Pakistan, which is fascinating to me.",

We're trying to remain a little subtle. 911 DISPATCHER: Yes, I understand. Yes, usually when they turn into a residential neighborhood they'll turn them off.
