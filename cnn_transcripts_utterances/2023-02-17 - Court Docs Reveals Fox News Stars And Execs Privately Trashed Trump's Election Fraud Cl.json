Because around a lawsuit is a legal standard, and that is the legal standard upon which this is going to be evaluated.

The idea that in 2023, that father, 47-year-old father, is doing tampon jokes with a colleague in the workplace, of course, visible for all to see, obviously also the best-known golfer probably ever, certainly one of the top two with Jack Nicklaus, a role model for many.

And Tiger has done damage to that because you could foresee a situation where there's a young woman who's got so many sports options and, wait a minute, do I want to hang in and run a sport where a dude is giving a guy a tampon in 2023? So, Tiger is responsible for the growth of the game, the joy he has shown to so many. I've covered all these majors. He is an incredible player. He has gotten to be, I think, more centered and grounded and nicer, frankly, with all the issues that have come along in his life, the difficult times. He's playing on a leg that has been rebuilt. He's giving it a go again at 47. As we said, it's not the biggest deal in the world, but for those who are wondering what the real Tiger is, that's the real Tiger.
