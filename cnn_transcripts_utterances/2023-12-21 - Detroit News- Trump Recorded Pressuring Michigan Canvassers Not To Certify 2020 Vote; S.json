This is November 2020. Trump lost in Michigan. He lost by more than 100,000 votes. It's time for the election canvassers in Detroit to do their job and certify the results so that the election can be finalized. On the day or around the time of the certification, Trump calls these local officials, Republicans, trying to twist their arms to convince them not to certify. And according to the Detroit News, here is some of what he said, quote, \"We can't let these people take our country away from us.\" Quote, \"Everyone knows Detroit is crooked as hell.\" That's where he started. There was also Ronna McDaniel. She was on the phone. She is the chairwoman of the RNC. She told them, \"Do not sign it. We will get you attorneys.\" Do not sign the certification. Trump says, \"We'll take care of that.\" Incredible revelations. Trump also went on to say, how could anybody sign something when so many -- there's so many more voters than people. That's a false claim that dead voters cast ballots in Detroit. So he was pedaling false claims, trying to twist their arm, trying to convince them not to certify. It worked. They tried to take back their votes to decertify, but it was too late. They had already set the certification process into motion. And, of course, Trump couldn't undo it once he lost.",

I mean, he -- there is no factual basis given for the claiming that there was fraud and there was intimidation involved. And according to the Detroit News article, it's suggested by a former elections official there that, in essence, what was happening here, he suggests, is that they were being induced by the promise of legal protection, by the promise of getting attorneys for them to violate their official duties, which potentially could be an additional crime under Michigan law. I think is -- I think an interesting question would be whether the Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has this tape or has been aware of this tape. Certainly, the call was known, although the substance of the call -- details of the call were not known publicly. She -- Dana Nessel, the attorney general of Michigan, has charged the fake electors there, as we know. And now, the question is whether -- you know, whether there -- I think it's not necessary for Jack Smith to add this to his case, but it's certainly consistent with his case.

So what is the special counsel asking for in his latest filing? EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, he's pushing back on the former president's effort to basically delay this. Trump has basically said, you know, you should let the appeals court first hear this and then take this up after that, right? That's a play to the delay, delay, which is part of his overall strategy. Here, Jack Smith is saying -- I'll read you just a part of the filing, \"The public interest in a prompt resolution of this case favors an immediate, definitive decision by this court. The charges here are of the utmost gravity.\" Of course, no president -- no former president has ever been put on trial for -- on criminal charges before. So Jack Smith points out that this case is like nothing we've ever had in our history.

Sixteen days after they had oral argument, they had a decision. So that's what Smith is asking here. He's asking for similar treatment. He's pointing out that, look, this is a trial that's scheduled for March, right? And Donald Trump, when he was asked for a trial date, actually asked for 2026.

They have -- they've scheduled a -- oral arguments for the case -- the same case on January 9th. So all the courts seem to be getting the message that there's a criticism, right, that the courts take too long. You and I have heard this over the years, right, that the court takes way too long to hear these things. So the court seem to be on this page saying we can do this and we can do this quickly.

And he views the Colorado ruling just as many of these others. And unfortunately, for him and these other candidates, this is getting so much attention by the media, and this is what's dominating the coverage. But he also said it's encouraging. When he goes out to Iowa, New Hampshire, and speaking with voters, they're not concerned about legal woes of Donald Trump, they're looking at legal woes and financial woes for themselves -- how they're going to put food on the table, and how are they going to keep their kids safe and keep their kids educated. So they're really focusing on the campaign trail about issues important to the American people and the heartland. And they're -- it is unfortunate that Donald Trump is getting a lot of the earned media and the media attention based on these legal woes because as we're seeing, Pam, it's not hurting his base, they're supporting him, and it certainly is helping him in fundraising. So he's using these legal issues as a way to boost his support and bump fundraising. BROWN: Yes.

They believe that he was responsible for that. They also say that they found evidence that he was possibly linked to to a double homicide committed last week just on the outskirts of Prague. It involved the killing, the murder of a man and a young child described as a baby. And that had had -- that was a case that had no leads in it. They now believe that this young man may have been involved. But apart from that, and again, that was as a result of a search of his home after this terrible tragedy this afternoon at Charles University in central Prague, there was nothing to suggest this young man would go on the rampage. His firearms were owned legally, he had permits for them, he was an enrolled philosophy student, and he had no criminal record. So nothing to suggest that he should have been keeping, kept an eye on, and yet scenes of such tremendous violence, again, in a continent where we don't tend to see mass shootings very often.
