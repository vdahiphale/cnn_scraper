So, this airplane did not necessarily have a door there, although some have described it as a window, some have described it as a door, it is essentially a piece of the fuselage that came off. I think that's the biggest thing here. This is something that was clearly not supposed to come off of the airplane.

Joining us now is CNN Safety Analyst and former FAA Safety Inspector, David Soucie. First of all, I'm never going to take off my seat belt anymore on an airplane, even for a few seconds, especially if I'm sitting near the window. There are so many questions about you know, how in the world does this happen? Does it come down to maintenance or manufacturing? I mean, what's your take on this?",

      "sentences": "Well, there's a couple of things that need to be answered before we answer that question. As Pete was saying, it is a door plug, if you call it that. It can be used for maintenance. It can be reconfigured. The aircraft can be reconfigured, as he said, with a higher pitch seating to utilize that door later.So, the structure is there. It's important to point out that this failure was not a structural failure of the fuselage. If you remember, you may not remember, but the Aloha Airlines accident was a 737 that was many, many years ago and several generations of aircraft ago. Now, that was a structural failure of the fuselage itself. This fuselage is a composite structure and I don't see any evidence of the fuselage itself being structurally damaged. This is a failure of the, either the installation or the mechanical build of the that door itself. So, that's where I would start looking right away is those fastening points. You can see in the photos if you look very closely there's four little attachment points. Those attachment points that stick out are where the door is fastened to the fuselage and you can see that those are intact. So, the first place I would look is how is it secured? Was it actually secured properly? The other thing I would look at is was there some maintenance where the seats had just installed, where that was the configuration recently changed? Because when they change the configuration of the seating, that door does come out for maintenance access so that they can get all that done and then the door is replaced on to the fuselage. So, that's the first place I would look is where, when was that door last accessed? Did it come from the factor that way? It's unlikely, because if it did, then that door would have come off a long time before now in its initial flights. It's been flying for about 10 weeks now, and it would be strange that it suddenly failed like this. It looks to me like the mounts are intact.",

So, and in the error of caution, yes, you ground all the aircraft and you look at them. But you do need to know as well, in perspective, I've been involved as well with a lot of the investigations of the Boeing aircraft, the MAX-8.I went up and flew the simulator after the fact, after they replaced the software. So, you have to take individual things on their own merit and see what happens. The fleet grounding is a cautionary measure and it's good, it needs to be done, but it's important that we don't, you know, broadly say, well, this airplane's bad or that airplane's bad. Every airplane has its issues, whether it's Boeing, whether it's Airbus, whatever it might be, they have their own issues to be dealt with and they have to be dealt with one at a time to categorically say this airplane's bad or that airplane's bad. I don't think I would go there, although I would say that Boeing has had its deal of troubles and will continue to for a while, I think, unfortunately. But they have improved their safety systems and how they look at things and how they do it. But is it enough?

      "sentences": "Good morning Victor and Amara. This is the biggest election-related case that the court will hear since Bush v. Gore. They have granted this petition from former President Trump's lawyers to review whether the Colorado Supreme Court made a mistake when it decided to remove Trump from the ballot based on Section 3 of the 14th amendment of the U.S. Constitution. That is a so-called insurrectionist ban that bars anyone who engages in an insurrection from holding future office.Now, it's unclear exactly which questions and issues the court will consider and rule on but the overarching issue here is whether that Section 3 of the 14th Amendment applies to presidents. This is an issue that has actually divided judges even within the state of Colorado. Trump's lawyers are framing their case as a request to return choice to the voters. They insist that if they rule against Trump, then the court will, for the first time, be taking away the choice that voters should have to vote for a party's primary candidate. They said this would be the first time in the history of the country that the judiciary would make that decision. But the challengers insist that Trump engaged in an insurrection and that he should be barred from holding future office under this post-Civil War part of the constitution. Now, here's how this is all going to play out. They're giving it what one source calls The Full Monty. There will be briefings. There's a briefing schedule that's pretty expedited for the high court. There'll be oral arguments on February 8th, and then the justices will have to make a decision. This is probably the biggest test of Chief Justice John Roberts' career. He's going to be under enormous pressure to build consensus behind the scenes so that this decision, whatever the balance is, the vote, does not appear in any way partisan. So, this is an enormous test for a court that has been battled by scandals and controversial decisions like overturning Roe v. Wade. And I think it's going to be the mantra for 2024, all eyes on the Supreme Court in the first of what could be many decisions related to the 2024 election. Amara, Victor.",

The southern -- the southern portion of this, it's really going to be all rain. Heavy at times, and some thunderstorms mixing in. But once you start creeping into the southern Appalachians, now, we're starting to see a little bit of that mixing taking place. In fact, right now, you've got some of that freezing rain, from Asheville all the way up to Roanoke. You've got some snow coming down now across Cincinnati and Columbus. But this system, as a whole, it's going to continue to shift to the north and east. And that low pressure system will really kind of be over the focus of the mid-Atlantic by late afternoon and early evening tonight. Once we head into the overnight hours and especially by Sunday morning, the focus becomes the North East. And even by late Sunday, that system well out over the water still going to have a lot of those snow showers still coming down, especially across portions of interior New England, as we go through the rest of the day Sunday. That means some of these areas are likely to get significant amounts of snow. Some of them could surpass eight, 10, even 12 inches total. But right there along the coast, it's going to be a different story. Say like New York, for example, in the city may only get a one inch, but just nearby in Poughkeepsie, they may end up getting way more than that, several inches on top of that. So, again, that line, that delineation point of how much it's going to get is going to be very narrow in some of these places. We're just a few miles away, you end up getting four to six inches more than your neighbor's off to the east. As we zoom in a little bit closer, Boston still looking at some significant snowfall, same thing for Springfield down into Hartford, Connecticut, and also upstate New York, and the higher elevations of the green and white mountains. Also looking at some heavy wet snowfall that combined with those wind gusts, that is also going to lead to some power outages across many of these areas. Victor and Amara.",

In fact, Claudine Gay, echoed this perspective in her New York Times opinion piece this week, and she said, in part, \"The campaign against me was more -- was about more than one university and one leader. This was merely a single skirmish in a broader war to unravel public faith and pillars of American society. College campuses in our country must remain places where students can learn, share, and grow together, not spaces where proxy battles and political grandstanding take root.\"You know, there has -- there been a lot of critics who've sounded the alarm, Ryan over the politicization, as you say, of higher education, and also this concerted attack they say they are seeing on higher education.

Maine Secretary of State was swatted the day after removing Donald Trump from the ballot there. CNN national security analyst Juliette Kayyem joins us now. Juliette, let me just read a longer list, a broader scope of some of the attacks, and some of the threats that are being made. To secretaries of state, they were e-mailed this week across the country. 23 states listed it -- as recipients in an e-mail. Courthouses were locked down and evacuated this week.

One is, of course, the specific intimidation against that individual. Right? It is that, that justice, you know, that Congress person or whatever, but then, it's also, I think, a larger effort to delegitimize democracy. It is -- it is just simply to say that democracy is no longer a -- the only means to express our displeasure with each other through the elections. And therefore, violence or the threat of violence is going to continue. While both sides of the aisle are impacted on this, it is clearly being driven by the top, and then, another words by Trump and his embracement. And there is no question about it, of the threats of violence and violence towards those he opposes. But what happens in these situations, then is everybody hears it, and therefore everyone becomes a target. This is what is happening now. And so, now it's just become a pervasive part. I often say that Donald Trump's greatest legacy, and his first term is the extension of violence or threat of violence, as a -- as a norm of our democracy. It is a -- it's not a good thing.
