Hamas says its top political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, was killed inside of Iran. He was there as a guest of Iran's presidential inauguration and had met earlier in the day with Iran's president.We're also watching Washington, where any moment now, we expect to hear reaction from both the State Department and the White House. Hamas and Iran are both blaming Israel for killing Haniyeh and both are vowing revenge. Iranian state media says a strike targeted Haniyeh at the location where he was staying in Tehran and he was a key player in Gaza. Ceasefire and hostage negotiations and his death could certainly complicate those talks.",

We will bring you those remarks live. But right now, we want to take you live to Tel Aviv with CNN Chief International Correspondent Clarissa Ward. Clarissa, obviously, a lot of anxiety in the region and around the world. Let's take a step back and give us the context of these two incidents coming within 24 hours of each other.",

      "sentences": "Well, I was just speaking, Boris, to a reservist, Brigadier General Assaf Orion, who said that there's a broad understanding here now that there will be consequences. There will be some kind of an attack in retaliation for these two major assassinations of very senior figures within Hezbollah and Hamas on Lebanese and Iranian soil. He was also pointing out that you could be looking at something quite different in terms of the types of weapons that would be used, particularly with a retaliation from Hezbollah.They have much more precise weaponry. They have further-range weaponry. So really a number of different options on the table. That is in stark contrast to what you see kind of on the streets here in Israel, where the government has not told people to change their posture. People are continuing to go about their normal lives, and yet there is a very real understanding that normal life, such as it is, may not continue for that much longer. We do expect to hear from Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. He will not be talking live to journalists. He is just providing some kind of a statement, we believe, that should be coming out in the next seven or eight minutes or so. But certainly fair to say that the entire region now, Brianna, and Boris really on a knife edge. This is a moment where it feels that the brink is so very close and not clear right now what potential off ramps could be given the significance of these two assassinations.",

Those talks, which despite all the setbacks, had been kind of soldiering on, are now very much in jeopardy. We have seen Secretary of State Antony Blinken furiously reaching out to all the different parties who are part of that. But we've also seen the cutaways who really are kind of a linchpin here, saying that they're outraged by this heinous act. And so now the question is, how can you keep the momentum going for those talks? Important for our viewers to understand that Ismael Haniyeh, the leader of the political faction of Hamas, whatever your feelings about him, he was the central interlocutor. And within the context of Hamas, he is seen as something of a moderate.So the question becomes, who replaces him? Could it potentially be someone like Khaled Mashal? Will he have the same kind of leverage on the table? Will he have the same kind of power as Haniyeh did? Will we see Sinwar take more control over these negotiations? A lot of open questions, and the most sort of pressing of those is do these talks even still continue at this stage, or does everything just stop until there is more clarity around what happened, why it happened, and most pressingly, what the response will be.",

So the way that they struck both in the lair, the very lair of Hezbollah, and in Iran in Tehran, this is aimed, the Iranian strike against Hamas was aimed as much or more against Iran. And if you look back at Netanyahu's speech before the special, the joint session, this is what he said. I mean, he said Iran, Iran, Hezbollah, Hamas. And then he hardly talked about hostages at all.So this really shows the prioritization and the boldness of this also, you know, is designed to really deter that retaliatory response and limit it because they've shown they can go with precision strikes backed by exquisite intelligence, and they can blow up things in the middle of the heartland of these countries.",

      "sentences": "Yes. You can see that from how he is reacting to this and just demurring from commenting on so much of what we've seen happening here. He doesn't want to weigh in. Cedric, give us your military analysis of the types of strikes that we have seen here. And also just to note that we are being told by state-run media that in the case of the Tehran strike on Haniyeh, it was an airborne guided projectile on his residence where he was staying in the capital city.COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, U.S. AIR FORCE (RET.):  Yeah. So what this sounds like, Brianna, is in essence a very precise, as Beth was mentioning, very precise intelligence-based strike using probably drones that came either locally launched, which is possible, or all the way from Israel. Now, that takes a little bit of engineering to do and a lot of connectivity that has to be done in exactly the right way. But it is technically possible for the Israelis to do something like that. So what they've done in the Iran case with Haniyeh, they have been able to go in and they found out exactly where he was living. They knew what his schedule was. They knew all of those precise details. And the fact that they knew that was, I think, critical in allowing them to execute this plan the way they did. Then in the case of Beirut, you have a situation with the Hezbollah target. You have a situation where there was clearly retribution. But also, as you mentioned, this goes into that escalatory piece where you have that escalatory ladder that could go one way or the other. And in this particular case, the military options are such that they are warning. We have these capabilities, the Israelis are warning this, but they're waiting for the response from the other side.",

We will extract a high price also, notably asking the Israeli population for patience. There have been many calls for a deal to bring hostages home, but he's essentially saying that the fight will continue.Also sending a tacit message to the United States, saying that their strategy on the war in Gaza will not bend to any pressure.",

But I actually, the signals coming out suggest that maybe they don't want to do that. I mean, you have to think about how weak they look, how weak they were perceived by some of their own internal people about how that didn't go as planned. And, you know, so I think that this and this strike inside of Tehran means that there could be more punishment just like that.So, yes, we're in a new normal where we are now seeing strikes between these states that we never saw before directly on territory. But the UN mission from Iran, the Iranian mission at the UN, did put out a statement saying that they would respond with special operations. And so one of the things I would want our viewers to really know and think about is that the risk of assassination, blowing up an embassy, that kind of terrorism as a response, is ratcheting up, and especially in Europe, where they have much more range of activity.",

And I think this is what Prime Minister Netanyahu is very clearly signaling here, that the decisions he has made have been tough. They've not been easy, but he's been right. Look at me. This is what I've done. We've got it right. Trust me. Follow me. As everyone waits to see how in which ways Iran will respond.And if Beth's assessment is correct that the response won't come raining onto Israel, then that will be a success. But let's also think about the domestic environment. It was just two days ago, I think, that were seeing right-wing politicians and supporters in Israel storming an IDF base because soldiers there were being questioned about the detention of Palestinians and their treatment there. And then they went on to storm a court building, which, by the impression created for Israeli reporters on the ground, the police, to a degree, stood back and stood by. You're looking at creating the right-wing here, pressuring and creating tensions and divisions already existing in society, but also in the IDF and also in the police service. So Netanyahu's the feat. You know, we think of this as the international stage, but the feet that he stands on at home are also on shaky ground. So, again, this was, you sort of forget what you're seeing at home or if you think about what you're seeing at home, we're still getting this right. The decisions are right. We're going ahead with this way. And that's what we should understand from this. It's his way.",
