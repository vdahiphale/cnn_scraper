      "sentences": "Welcome to CNN NEWS CENTRAL.Right now, Donald Trump is preparing to face a federal judge in Washington, D.C., as the nation and American democracy face a critical test. The former president is scheduled to be in court tomorrow. Last night, federal prosecutors charged him with four separate counts in a sweeping indictment. The special counsel is alleging that Trump was central in the plot to overturn the 2020 election, and has charged him with conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of and attempting to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights. This historic indictment says that Trump -- quote -- \"enlisted co- conspirators\" to assist him in his criminal efforts. It repeatedly references six unindicted co-conspirators. CNN has been able to identify five of those six, and we will be breaking down what roles they allegedly played in the effort to overturn Joe Biden's win coming up here in just a moment. First, though, CNN's Paula Reid is with us now Paula, what more do we know about these new charges that Trump is facing?",

      "sentences": "Brianna, this was very much expected, because these were approximately the charges that the former president said were in the target letter that he received in recent weeks.So, there are not a lot of new details and a lot of new charges or surprises here. And let's go through these. I mean, you have conspiracy to defraud the United States. That's sort of a catch-all charge there. You just have two people who are working together to defraud the government. You don't even have to be successful. You can even be charged if you join the conspiracy at anytime. Then you have conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding. There, of course, they're talking about the congressional certification of the electoral results. You have obstructing or attempting to obstruct official proceedings. These are both pretty straightforward. The one charge that was a bit of a surprise when we learned about it from the target letter was the conspiracy against rights. I mean, this is a civil rights charge, arguing that he allegedly tried to interfere with people's ability to exercise their right to vote. Now, that is a little-used statute. So that could be one of the more challenging ones for prosecutors. But they put together a very dense, detailed indictment supporting these charges. Now, I also want to read one quote from the indictment. They allege that -- quote -- \"For more than two months following Election Day, the defendant spread lies that there had been outcome- determinative fraud in the election and that he had actually won.\" And they sort of preempted his defense in the court of public opinion, which right now is that he has a First Amendment right and they're infringing on his First Amendment right. In the first few pages in the indictment, they say that, look, you have every right to claim fraud, to claim that the election was stolen, but you can't then go and attempt to steal it. And these are the charges that they're using right now to pursue that. And, Brianna, there could potentially be additional charges added going forward.",

And, first of all, here are the six of them, as we know them, John Eastman, Sidney Powell, Jeffrey Clark, Kenneth Chesebro, Rudy Giuliani, and a six unnamed political consultant, to be clear, none of them charged at this point. Let's begin with Rudy Giuliani, perhaps the most well-known, personal attorney to Trump, pushed baseless fraud with the Arizona House speaker, without evidence, we should note, also left a voice-mail for Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville asking him to -- quote -- \"slow it down,\" it being the certification of the election.

Co-Conspirator No. 5, Kenneth Chesebro, he sent Rudy Giuliani an e- mail memo about this fake electors plot, central to the plan, again, to overturn the election. Final co-conspirator, as yet unnamed, this one a political consultant who helped implement a plan to submit fraudulent slates of electors to obstruct the certification proceeding. The indictment also alleges that this person sent Giuliani an e-mail identifying lawyers in the six swing states who could assist in the fake elector plot.

I think the challenge they face is twofold. One, they don't go -- they come right all the way up to the line of thinking about an insurrection charge. They don't charge it, right? That seems to be a defect, right? Jack Smith talked about it yesterday at his press conference. He starts out talking about the heroism of the Capitol Police, but doesn't directly charge that offense in the indictment. On top of that, these questions of free speech, the indictment itself says the president can say these things, tell these lies if he wants to. But, apparently, it says he can't go further and then conspire to obstruct an official proceeding or defraud the United States with his lies.

So you got to ask yourself, well, if it's OK to bring up the First Amendment concerns with defrauding the United States, why not raise the insurrection point? What's going on here?

And they're also arguing that these latest charges, in addition to the past two indictments that were handed down earlier this year, arguing that they're part of a broader scheme to interfere in the 2024 presidential election. And I can tell you, from my conversations with Donald Trump's team and his advisers, that they're very competent in that line of defense. They are pointing to the fact that, despite the unprecedented nature of his legal troubles, he is still the leading contender for the Republican nomination. His polling puts him ahead of his 2024 rivals, and his base and his supporters are very much still behind him. Now, also, just pointing back to that election interference argument, a key thing that they will be focusing on as well is trying to delay any potential trial until after the 2024 election.

I'm also told that he sent talking points to Capitol Hill to help shape the messaging piece of this.

But you will notice most of these Republicans are not actually addressing the substance of the charges, even though they were firsthand witnesses to the January 6 attack on the Capitol.
