      "sentences": "And I allude to the intelligence question because there is a disparity between the U.S. officials saying that Iranian leaders, for example, were surprised that Hamas carried out these attacks.While Israeli intelligence says that Iran gave the green light to Hamas to carry this out. JOSH ROGIN, COLUMNIST, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": Right, well, the first thing I think we should note here we don't know what all the intelligence says yet. They're thinking clearly things are amiss. We have to wait to see what we -- who knew what and when. I think there is a great possibility that certain Iranian figures were surprised, certain other Iranians were not surprised. And that could have played the disparity there. When it comes to the escalation ladder, I think that's -- it is a game of deterrence. And when Iran and Hezbollah say, if you raze Gaza, we're going to open up the second front or when Iran's foreign minister said was the rest of the axis is going to open up a war on Israel. That is a threat. And when the United States moves an aircraft carrier into the eastern Med, that is to deter that threat. The truth is that these things have a pattern of escalating when you engage in brinksmanship, a tendency to push the limits. That's a wider war that everyone is trying to avoid. But nobody knows how to avoid it. And it seems clear Israel is going to do some pretty extensive operations in Gaza. And of course, they're worried about Israeli security. But Secretary Blinken, the Biden administration, they worry about a much bigger map. And that's kind of where you see the divide. Of course, the administration doesn't want to tell Israel in public, hey, you better think about this. But you can be sure, in private, they're saying help us manage this thing from getting out of control. And I don't think they're there yet.",

There is a difference between being told, hey, something is cooking, and then being told something very specific. And 2020 is always hindsight. But what are you thinking? And what kind of soul searching is this going to bring about? HAGAR CHEMALI, FORMER SPOKESPERSON, U.S. MISSION TO THE U.N.: Well, just as here after 9/11, I expect a massive intelligence review in Israel. And of -- to identify all the mistakes and vulnerabilities and how they rectify that in the future. But with this had -- in particular, it sounds more that they were talking about tensions increasing in general. And tensions have been increasing significantly. Particularly, since Netanyahu took office last December. And that's because of a series of policies his government took, that were provocative things. Like expanding settlements in the West Bank, killing a number of Palestinian militants and civilians. Also the raid on the Al Aqsa Mosque, things of that kind. And so tensions have been growing generally. But the intelligence, the Israeli intelligence apparently identified that the major threats currently were coming from the West Bank and the northern border with Lebanon. And the problem with that -- and by the way, all intelligence agencies do that. When you have certain threats every year or every few months, you identify where the major threats are. You allocate resources based on that. You move people around. You focus your efforts or money on certain regions or individuals or groups or whatever. And it is very clear that the border with Gaza, they had come to rely on the security system they set up in the south. And that a number of things fell apart that kind of caused this crash of dominos that led to this horrific terrorist attack.",
