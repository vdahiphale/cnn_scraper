Israel has already vowed to \"exact a price\" from Iran for its barrage of drone and missile strikes. Two Israeli officials say the War Cabinet is debating the timing and scope of that response. The United States, Britain, and France, all cautioning Israel against escalation. US President Joe Biden told Netanyahu that the US won't participate in an offensive action against Iran.

They had been facing months of blistering criticism for their handling of the war in Gaza, the hostage ceasefire talks, all but at a dead end and this really gives Israel a chance to kind of reframe the narrative and reframe the conversation around this conflict.

The question is will they respond militarily, and if so, how soon? It would be prudent for Israeli leadership to keep in mind the guidance that Abraham Lincoln gave his Cabinet in the midst of the Civil War, one war at a time, and at the moment, the Israelis are deeply engaged in this war against Hamas. In Gaza, they need to finish that work. They enjoy the support of the United States. Of course. They also need to address the mounting humanitarian crisis in Gaza. But nevertheless, probably the best way to undercut Iran and the work of its proxies in the region is to neutralize Hamas. It has other tools at its disposal, you and your journalists in Jerusalem mentioned there is cyber, there is also intelligence, and it really calls for, I think at this point a concerted diplomatic effort particularly given the support that Israel apparently enjoyed in responding to this missile barrage last Saturday from Iran.",

Where do you get your news? But also about their feelings about former President Trump while he is sitting right there.I mean, Jim, this is of course a historic case. This is how it would happen with any defendant, but you just think of these potential jurors. The pressure to answer questions about former President Trump while he is sitting right there. I want to go back to that first cut, the fact that over half of the potential jurors said they could not be impartial here. That statistic, that is something that the Trump team fought and won to have separated out. They didn't want all the jurors who were dismissed for cost to be lumped in to one big group. They wanted that number about how many specifically were leaving because they couldn't be impartial. Why did they want that number? Because they want to preserve this issue for an eventual appeal. They want to be able to, if there is a conviction appeal this case, and bring up as many issues as possible. And here, they would say, look we were losing half the potential jury pool because folks said they couldn't be impartial. That is why they would argue they wanted a change of venue, but that number was even higher than folks close to this case expected. So now, we are watching closely to see these answers to the questionnaire and see if maybe they could get a juror or two seated because so far, we don't have a single person seated and they will repeat this process with a hundred, whittle it down until they get 12 jurors and six alternates.

I am certainly not saying and asking that, that this is not an unusual case. Of course, the first time we've seen a former president and quite a polarizing one sit in the dock, in effect.

But here, I mean, this is so extraordinary because we are talking about the most famous man in the world and a case where most people or at least somewhat familiar with the facts.

      "sentences": "Yes, Jim, that's a critical question, and so the answer is obviously, it is a challenge. The issue then becomes, is it one that can be overcome? I say yes.I think what we are seeing is the system at work and that system being very effective in doing so, what do I mean? When you have a judge who gives the indication of hey, can you be fair? Is there any good faith basis or reason as to believe that you wouldn't be a juror for this case, right? And people raise their hand and the judge says, okay, you're dismissed that's our process. That is the judge taking members of a jury pool for their word. They can't be fair. And so then you exclude those jurors, so you go to another round. Keep in mind, Jim, that there are what are called challenges for cause. That means that you're not only going to have people raise their hand and say they can't be fair, but in further questioning by counsel, you're going to have lawyers come to the determination that they're not for this jury. You can then go to the judge and you can make an application that they be excused for cause in an unlimited way, meaning based upon certain things they said, Jim, they are not for this jury in the event they have a prejudice or bias, they are removed. Then of course, you get to the peremptory challenges, which are limited to ten, in which the attorneys can excuse people for discretionary reasons. So I think built into the process is the reality that you are going to have juries that will say they're not fair and jurors who it will be discovered can't be fair. So yes, it will be a challenge. I think it is a challenge that Manhattan does regularly that I did when I was a prosecutor there and as a defense attorney there, and I think ultimately the president will get a jury of his peers and we will get the show on and it will be heard on the merits.",

And when you run out of the challenges, you can no longer disqualify people for discretionary reasons, but to be clear, you always have the right to exclude people for cause, meaning they are biased, they are unfair. Those who can continue if you develop enough information as to their bias to use, even though you've run out of the discretionary 10 challenges and then you have two more challenges for the alternate pool and there will be six alternates that are chosen for this jury.  Quickly, Jim, the reasons for the alternates, of course, if a jury gets sick, a juror doesn't show up, a juror gets off the case. You have an alternate and don't have to do the case all over again.",

I have a very high degree of confidence in that.I will say that the one element of this that is a little unusual is the judge's decision to let people excuse themselves if they say that they are fair, they cannot be fair and impartial without any type of follow-up interview. Usually, when people say that, maybe you experienced this in your own jury -- in your own jury duty when people say that, the judge will call them up and he will usually talk them out of it, right? Using that to persuade them like, yes, you really actually probably can be fair and impartial. Can you listen to me? Can you follow the evidence? Can you set aside any personal biases? People usually can be brought around, 90 percent of the time. The judge is skipping that, and I think I understand why it will make the process more efficient.

That was it. They left the courthouse. And so, now with about a third of that initial 100 left in the room, the judge is working through getting into the details here, asking them the questions on a set questionnaire that was established with the prosecutors and defense teams before this started. And so, so far, nine jurors have been questioned and not taken off the jury for some reason of cause. They have answered that they can be fair and impartial toward Donald Trump as a criminal defendant.

And I think the comments you heard at the end will capture exactly the narrative that the former president wants to emphasize, persecuted.That could be the campaign mantra. But I think what will be very important is that prosecutors kind of bring back that this is actually about election interference, but his interference in terms of violating campaign finance laws.",

That they're, in fact, for some of them, it only hardens their support for the former president. But there is some polling that questions that. And I spoke to a Republican, a former Republican congressman last week who made the point that when voters are reminded of the circumstances of this case, namely an extramural affair, money paid to keep that extramural affair quiet during the 2016 election, that that does have a political effect.And I wonder, I mean, we're not going to know for sure until November when voters go to the polls. But what is your view?",

I don't think it's going to have an overwhelming effect, to be honest, on Republican voters should have done fold that way. But again, this is an election where we're not talking about overwhelming number of voters.We're talking about slivers of voters in swing states. And so potentially, I think those arguments, that conventional wisdom, might be on target. But we really don't know. And thus far, at least politically, he has withstood something that I don't think many other candidates in American history would have been able to withstand and end up where they are, namely the nomination to run again.",

And as the Israeli war cabinet begins to mull a potential response. So, this ground offensive into Rafah certainly delayed for now, although Israeli officials tell me that they are still committed to carrying out that ground offensive, a ground defensive, which American officials have sought to dissuade Israel from carrying out both privately as well as publicly through very significant pressure. Now, amid all of this, Israel's war cabinet today convened once again to discuss not that planned ground offensive into Rafah, but instead how Israel will respond to this unprecedented strike that Iran carried out over the weekend directed at Israeli soil, the first in history. I'm told that the Israeli war cabinet over the course of the last several days has been engaged in heated debate over exactly the scope of such an Israeli response as well as the timing with Benny Gantz, a key member of the war cabinet advocating for a much swifter response, whereas the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at least until today certainly pumping the brakes on making a decision. But emerging from the war cabinet today, a meeting that lasted nearly three hours, Israeli officials refused to say whether or not a decision had been made. And I was told by one Israeli official that the sentiment was that a swifter response was likely in the offing. So, we don't know the timing of that response, but certainly the war cabinet is convinced that it must respond to this attack by Iran, how and when remains the question.",
