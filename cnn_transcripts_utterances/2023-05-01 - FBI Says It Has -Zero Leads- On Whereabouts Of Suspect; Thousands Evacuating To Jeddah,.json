CNN Ed Lavandera with the latest.ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: While the hunt continues for 38-year-old Francisco Oropeza, the man who was accused of shooting five neighbors on Friday night here in the town of Cleveland, Texas. The husband and father of two of the five victims is detailing to us exactly how the night unfolded. Wilson Garcia says he was at home with a group of friends when they asked he and two other men walked over to the home, their neighbor's home, Oropeza had asked him to stop shooting his weapon so close to their property because their baby was trying to sleep. He says they asked him just to shoot the weapons on the other side of their property. It was a very tense exchange. Garcia said they had already called authorities in 911 five times prior to that. And then 10 to 20 minutes later that's when Wilson Garcia says that Francisco Oropeza came back to their house, didn't say anything else and started shooting people. One of the first die, he said was his wife. He says that the man then started going through the house shooting people in other rooms. Oropeza says one of the women told him to get out of the house as quickly as possible because his wife and son were already dead, and that they didn't want to lose him because his two other children didn't should lose both parents, horrific details that Wilson Garcia is detailing of that night. In the meantime, investigators continue this manhunt, this -- they have been searching for Francisco Oropeza since Friday night when he was able to flee the scene. But at this point, investigators say they have no idea where he might be. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Most Democrats are even refusing to consider this bill as a jumping off point for a future deal.But it is worth noting that we are beginning to see some cracks in that position. Emmer mentioned Senator Joe Manchin. He's one of a growing number of Democrats pressuring Joe Biden to start negotiations. And really the bottom line here is that Congress is running out of time. Current estimates for the deadline for when a deal must be reached at some point in July. And the House isn't even in this week. They are on recess. So it is unlikely we will see them move the ball forward in the coming days. And with the deadline right around the corner, every week counts. Alayna Treene, CNN -- Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)\\",

It was the government's decision to force the reforms through parliament bypassing a second vote that sparked fury in the streets. With hundreds of police officers injured and hundreds of protesters detained in one single bloody day and night. Amid accusations the government was ignoring the will of the people, weekly clashes between police and pockets of protesters became the norm.

Jyotika Virmani is the executive director of the Schmidt Ocean Institute and key partner of the Ocean Census, she joins me now from Los Angeles. Doctor, good to see you. First of all, briefly, what is the aim of the census? What do you hope to achieve with this? DR. JYOTIKA VIRMANI, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, SCHMIDT OCEAN INSTITUTE: As you said, the aim is to find 100,000 new marine species in the next decade. And it's really to help to transform our knowledge of life on earth and to work out where and what needs protection. [01:45:02] HOLMES: The Ocean Census Web site is fascinating. It's got a really telling headline on the landing page. It says we've only discovered 10 percent of ocean life. We can't protect what we don't know exists. I'm sure most people wouldn't have a clue about those numbers. What could those undiscovered species potentially tell us?",

And this is really challenging.The Species identification -- this is right now on average, it takes 21 years to identify a new species. We really need to speed that up. So in order to find these creatures we need sophisticated technologies and tools such as Schmidt Ocean Institute's new research vessel Falkor (too), which has on board an underwater robot R/V Sebastian, and that can go down to 4,500 meters below the sea surface.
