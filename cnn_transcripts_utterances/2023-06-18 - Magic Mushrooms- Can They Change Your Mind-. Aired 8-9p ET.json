You've probably heard of Magic Mushrooms, mushrooms which contains psilocybin, a natural substance that can cause hallucinations when ingested.Magic Mushrooms became popular in the United States in the 1960s. But in the last decade, there's been an increasing amount of research into psilocybin to see if it can help treat depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. Magic Mushrooms are still illegal on the federal level, but a few states have decriminalized them, and this year, Oregon became the first state to legalize the use of psilocybin in licensed therapy centers. There's still a lot we don't know about psilocybins affecting the brain long-term, and many are asking if it's too soon to offer these treatments. Over the next hour, CNN's David Culver takes us into this fascinating new world and takes us on a mind-altering journey of his own. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Being away from family, the guilt of missing out on loved one's funerals. So I'm hoping maybe psilocybin will just be a journey in of itself that allows me to process some of that.
