What we do know is that on Friday, which was exactly 10 years after Michael Brown was killed by a Ferguson police officer, a police officer who's no longer with the department, I might add, there were protests that were demonstrating peacefully throughout the day, according to the police department. But at the end, there were some people who started shaking the fence and then they came back and shaking the fence more and more.At some point, they started to break off parts of the fence and break through it. And that's when the chief there said that he sent out some officers to go make arrests. And one man, they said, charged Officer Travis Brown with his shoulder, knocking him back and he hit his head, leading to that brain injury. What we know about Officer Brown is that he used to be with the St. Louis County Police Department, but joined the Ferguson Police Department in January. And in fact, when you listen to the chief, Troy Doyle, talk about Officer Brown, he had some strong words for people as he remembered just how dedicated this man has been to being a police officer. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So he's saying there's maybe four police officers that are still here that were there then. He's like, we've done the changes. We are -- we have changed. They even changed their uniforms, he said, so that it would be better policing being done in the community.Still, when you look at the suspect, I can tell you the latest that we know about him. His name is Elijah Gant. He's 28 years old. He's being held on a $500,000 cash only bond. And he has five charges that he is facing, including assault on Officer Brown -- Brianna.",

Entire towns have been ordered to evacuate including the city of Marathon, which of course is the namesake of the Olympic sport. Its mayor calls the fire a quote biblical catastrophe. Also, this is all that is left of a home outside Baltimore after it exploded on Sunday due to a suspected gas leak. Officials say the homeowner and an electric and gas company employee were killed in the blast. A neighbor who was inside her own home at the time was also injured. Authorities tell us it's unclear right now whether the explosion at the home, which was listed for sale, was intentional or accidental. And a tropical storm warning has just been issued for Puerto Rico. The National Hurricane Center says that a group of thunderstorms in the northeast Caribbean will turn into Tropical Storm Ernesto by tomorrow morning and then just hours later it's expected to hit Puerto Rico and test its already vulnerable power grid. Ernesto is forecast to strengthen in the Atlantic, eventually turning into a hurricane -- Jessica.",

And this one, neffy, we just learned this morning, is going to have a similar what's known as list price.That's the price before insurance or any discounts or coupons kick in. $710 for a two-pack. There are generic auto-injectors of epinephrine which have lower list prices, $300 to $500, for example. Insurance coverage can be difficult. The company that makes neffy is pledging to make this accessible to folks. If they have commercial insurance that covers it, they're pledging a $25 copay. They say they're offering a cash price of $199 for a two-pack for certain people. And for people who still can't access it, they say they will have patient assistance programs that will provide it for free. But this is something that I hear about from doctors and patients a lot. It's hard to afford these. You have to keep them up to date. The other ones, epinephrine auto-injectors, have 18-month about-shelf lives. This new one, neffy, has a 30-month shelf life, so that's better. But you still do need to replace them. And folks who are at risk of food allergies, medication allergies, bee sting allergies, they need to carry these with them all the time.",

But let's go back 100 years when Paris had the Olympics before.It is now 5.5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than it was on average. So you take the high and the low, divide by two, add them together. And then all of a sudden, you're getting to places that are warmer than this. Let's say Beijing, Rio, Athens, maybe even toward Atlanta, that may in the future not be able to get below the threshold other than maybe holding some of the outdoor sports in the very early morning. There are so many places now across the globe that get to this what we call wet bulb temperature. When you walk outside in Atlanta in the summertime, you just begin to sweat. There's not much you can do. The water hits you in the face, just like Miami. It's always hot in the morning. And that's where a lot of this threshold begins to kind of take shapes like, OK, if we can't even do it at seven o'clock in the morning, can we do it at all? Look at India. I mean, these are the lines here. This is the line right here that says that's the threshold. We're not doing it any hotter than that. Well, for most of India's summer, it's above that. And even when it's the monsoon season and it's very, very wet, they're still not getting those average temperatures down. The orange line is in the sun. The green line is in the shade. So even these events like in Qatar, you're not going to get them in the shade or in the sun. This is just how this is going to run for the next couple of days, next couple of years. It's already where we are at this point in Paris. If it takes another 50 or 60 years for them to get it again, that line is just not going to keep going up. It's just going to continue to rise over and over and over until we get this carbon dioxide, methane, greenhouse gas emissions problem under control -- Brianna.",
