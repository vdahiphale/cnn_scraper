Zoo staff, call this a hiatus in their five decade wildly popular panda program. Chinese officials have yet to say, if it will continue. You might wonder, why this even matters? There are, of course, far more pressing issues between the U.S. and China. But as we look deeper, tracking where Pandas are leaving and where they`re going, you get a better sense of the new world order. China`s hoping to craft these cuddly creatures used for China`s major political and diplomatic needs, especially in places where it hopes to gain. But China says its focus is on conservation and research.",

      "sentences": "Seen their popularity rise amongst Americans, China sent more pandas to other zoos across the U.S., eventually loaning instead of giftingthem. The 2011 agreement between China and the National Zoo stipulates ownership of the Pandas and any offspring belonged to China. The contract also requires payment to China of $500,000 each year for the conservation of giant Pandas in China. At its height, there were 15 pandas in the United States, but in the last decade, the numbers have dropped coinciding with worsening U.S.-China relations with the three Pandas now departing the national zoo that only leaves zoo Atlanta with Pandas in the U.S. For now, the contracts for Atlanta`s final four expire next year, no word on any extension. (On camera): And that could mean that by the end of 2024, the only Panda in zoos in all of the Americas would be Xin Xin right here in Mexico City. (Voice-over): China`s also loaned out new giant pandas to other countries, including E.U. nations, like Denmark, Finland, and Germany, and in the Middle East, Qatar getting their first Panda last year. Regions where China is looking to bolster its relations and increase its influence. Staff at the National Zoo, hopeful China might one day send over more giant Pandas. They`re even planning renovations for the soon to be vacant Panda exhibit. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Aurora borealis also known as Northern lights. It`s an atmospheric phenomenon that creates enchanting dancing waves of light associated with countries surrounding the Arctic like Canada, Russia, and Norway. But last weekend, you didn`t have to head for the North Pole to catch these mesmerizing shining skies. The borealis were spotted in parts of the U.K., Ukraine, and Slovakia. And according to experts, southern sightings could become more common with increased solar activity. So how does the sun summon this nighttime spectacle? We`ve got your answer right here.

      "sentences": "Described as one of Earth`s greatest light shows, and aurora is one of the most fascinating and beautifulnaturally occurring phenomena. You might know it as in Northern lights, but it`s technically called the Aurora Borealis in the Northern hemisphere, in the Aurora Australia`s or Southern lights in the Southern hemisphere. This phenomenon occurs above the magnetic poles in the Northern and Southern hemisphere. They form when gas is particles in the Earth`s atmosphere, collide with charged particles released from the sun, electrons and protons from the sun are blown toward the earth by the solar wind. As these are carried towards earth, most of them are deflected by Earth`s magnetic field. However, the magnetic field is weaker at the poles, allowing some of the particles to funnel into the Earth`s atmosphere. The vibrant colors produced are determined by the type of gases that are colliding. The result is a brilliant display of the common green in yellow, less common blue and violet, even rare reds painting the night sky and ribbons arcs or shooting rays. Oxygen produces green in red light while nitrogen gives off blue and purple. The best time of year to view the light show is during the winter months, when the nights are longer. Under a cloud free sky away from light pollution. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
