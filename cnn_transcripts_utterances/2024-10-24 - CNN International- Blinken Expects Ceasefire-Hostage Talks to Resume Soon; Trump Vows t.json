It is 05:00 p.m. here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Eleni Giokos. This is \"Connect the World\". Also happening over the next two hours, a dire crisis in Northern Gaza, as health officials warn the region is at breaking point, with food and other supplies running perilously low. Meanwhile, leaders from the global south meet for the final day of the BRICS Summit. And Kamala Harris in a CNN Town Hall painting Donald Trump as a threat to the United States. Welcome to the show, and I want to check in on how the U.S. markets will be opening in about 30 minutes from now. I want to check in on those DOW futures, as you can see, pointing to a negative start with driving the DOW Jones down right now is IBM earnings, and that pre market stock is putting a bit of a strain on that. And S&amp;P 500 is in positive territory after three days of losses. Tesla driving that stock market up. And of course, it's all about those earnings which are going to be driving U.S. equities over the next few days. Right now, we start with the U.S. Secretary of State making a new push for a cease fire and hostage deal in Gaza. Speaking just hours ago in Doha, Antony Blinken announcing he expects negotiators will meet again in the coming days. This diplomacy happening as Israel inflicts what Lebanese state media are calling the most violent attacks on Beirut suburbs since the war began. Overnight air strikes destroying at least six buildings. And in Northern Gaza, health officials warning people in the area are reaching a breaking point with food, fuel and medicine running out. Israel says a large number of people have left the area, and many of them forced to flee yet again. We've got Matthew Chance in Jerusalem, and Jennifer Hansler is at the U.S. State Department covering all angles for us today. Of course, the Lebanese Government calling the strikes, Matthew, the most violence since the war began. What is the latest on the ground?",

In the hours before the strikes took place, the Israeli Defense Forces, the Israeli military, issued warnings for people in the area to leave, saying they were going to be targeting Hezbollah infrastructure and Hezbollah personnel in that area of Southern Beirut, and advising people to leave as soon as possible, which obviously many people did. It's all part of a much broader campaign that's been taking place and intensifying, especially over the course of the past several weeks, as Israel attempts to degrade as much as possible Hezbollah infrastructure and Hezbollah personnel. But you know, the militia, which is backed by Iran and very close to the Islamic Republic, continues to fire rockets across the border into Northern Israel. And that's caused chaos and panic in that part of the country as well, and a number of injuries over the course of the past 12, sorry, 24 hours. And so yes, that aspect of the conflict continues to heat up with no sign of either side backing down.",

Israeli force has really been stepping up their military activity. Hundreds of people have been killed, according to the Hamas health authorities. As the Israeli Defense Forces say they're striking at resurgent Hamas elements inside that area, which they already said they've cleared twice before, but now, kind of more, thousands of people are being ordered to evacuate for these strikes to take place. And of course, many people are being caught up in the cross fire. And it all calls into question, the extent to which the Israeli government is listening to what the United States Administration, the Biden Administration, Secretary of State Antony Blinken have to say. It seems that Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister, is increasingly immune to the warnings and to the appeals of the Biden Administration in these last few weeks of the presidential campaign. And is stepping up its campaign in Lebanon in Gaza. And of course, preparing itself, as we've been discussing, for a potential strike against Iran as well, which carried out a missile strike on Israel at the beginning of October, after Israel killed the Leader of Hezbollah, and also the one of the Hamas main leaders in Iran as well. And so, you know, look it -- there is no sign at the moment, despite the idea that there's a window of opportunity that may have opened after the death of Hamas Leader, there's no sign that that is has, in fact, happened in fact, the situation seems to be deteriorating.",

He had many high-profile Republicans and allies speaking there,people including Tulsi Gabbard, RFK Jr., Charlie Kirk, the Head of Turning Point Action, which actually was putting on that rally. But you also heard from people like Tucker Carlson. And before Donald Trump took the stage, Carlson actually told this anecdote that I had not heard yet on the campaign trail, which was essentially that if Donald Trump were to win in November, it would be like dad is coming home. Those are his words. And he was saying that essentially, when dad comes home and his children are misbehaving, the dad, he was referring to, Donald Trump like a dad. Donald Trump loves all his children. At that point, he was talking about the media and Democrats, and said that he would be, quote, pissed at them and would have to give them a vigorous spanking. Odd language, very odd rhetoric, but essentially, what he was trying to argue, I think, was that Donald Trump will come in and talk to all voters, whether they are Democrats or not, and he'll still, quote, unquote, love them, but he will be angry with them, and they will -- he will need to take action to, you know, counteract their misbehaving. All in all, it was a weird moment, Eleni, but I will say that it did seem to stick with the crowd in the room. They kind of went wild at Tucker Carlson's anecdote there. And then, when Trump took the stage, they began chanting, daddy's home and daddy dawn. And again, this is something I hadn't heard yet.

We have seen vicious war crimes taking place that are really heightening fears that you could see the worst being realized once again in Darfur.

It's a very powerful economy, and it could, in a worst-case scenario. Trump's proposals of these across-the-board tariffs spark worldwide trade wars. So, the International Monetary Fund says that in such a scenario, such an extreme scenario, of kind of trade tariffs across the board, we could see global GDP cut by 7 percent and of course, you know, other countries are not just going to retaliate against the U.S.'s duties and impose duties of their own on American imports. But they'll also impose their own tariffs on the goods that America is putting duties on because they don't want the goods that would have gone to the United States to now flood their own markets. We've seen that with electric vehicles in Europe. We saw it in 2018 when Trump put tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The European Union not only taxed American exports like Harley Davidsons and denim jeans, but they also put tariffs on steel because they were worried about this influx of imports.

So where are we right now? Let's just tap down in here. We're in Delaware County. Joe Biden won 63 percent of the vote here. Right that these suburbs, when I started doing this, used to be Republican or Republican leaning. They are safe blue territory now. But watch this number on election night, right in the first election in the suburbs, post the Dobbs decision, does Donald Trump improve his standing in the suburbs? Let's say Donald Trump doesn't have to improve his standing in the suburbs a lot. Look at 2016, 37.2 you say, oh, John, that's just a point. That's just a point, yeah, but a point here and a point or two there makes a difference. Donald Trump needs to improve his standing in the suburbs to have a chance to win the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Vice President Harris, the flip side, if you're going to lose a little bit in urban areas, maybe black man goes down a little bit. Maybe Latino man goes down a little bit. Can you boost it in the suburbs in the first post row election? This place and this race are a defining challenge. So where does that matter? When you come out to this map, it all matters. Because as we know, as we come to the race for 270 and we can get into this more throughout the night and the next 12 days, here's where they are right now. 226 safe we believe for Harris, 219, safe for Trump. Well, of all the yellow states, the battle grounds, this Pennsylvania is the biggest prize, 19 electoral votes. If Harris can do that, and that Michigan and that Wisconsin just hold the blue wall. She is most likely the next President of United States. So, this is the biggest prize. If Donald Trump gets this, it makes her math a lot more complicated, his math a lot easier. So, Pennsylvania is the biggest prize, which is why she agreed to do the town hall here, which is why both campaigns are spending more money here than any other state. There are other ways to get there, but if you're trying to get to 270 getting that 19 is huge. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
