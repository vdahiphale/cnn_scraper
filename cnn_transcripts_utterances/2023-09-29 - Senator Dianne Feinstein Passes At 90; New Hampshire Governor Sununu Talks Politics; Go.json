We just got breaking news just afew hours ago that Senator Dianne Feinstein dead at the age of 90. In fact, we are just hearing from former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi paying tribute to her colleague and long-time friend. Let's play it for you. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NANCY PELOSI, U.S. HOUSE DEMOCRAT:  All of us do so with great pride as the great senator she has been to our state. The longest-serving woman-senator from California. She came here with Barbara Boxer. She stayed on and she left on her own terms. The first woman-mayor of San Francisco coming into office under sad circumstances but leading us with great dignity, with great effectiveness and great leadership. Much more will be said about it. We'll have so much time to talk and brag about Dianne Feinstein. Her legacy will be a long one that we have all -- we will all be inspired by. But today, at this time, just hours since her passing, rather than talk about her, let's just pray that she rests in peace. In that regard, Mr. Speaker, I ask for unanimous consent that all present in the chamber as well as members and staff throughout the Capitol to please rise for a moment of silence in remembrance of the late Honorable Senator Dianne Feinstein. Mr. Speaker, thank you.",

A quarter of the Senate today is women, at least was until the death of Dianne Feinstein last night. A quarter. And that there have only been 59 women in the U.S. Senate. Dianne Feinstein was the longest serving woman senator. And so, her passing marks a moment, I think a moment to reflect on the glass ceilings that have been broken only recently for women in the United States. There's also -- this is also a time. I think, to reflect on her professionalism, her poise, her wisdom as a leader in the Senate. I was very impressed, obviously watching from the outside by her tenacity and leadership in pushing a very difficult investigation of the CIA because of its detention and interrogation program of Al-Qaeda following 9-11. She totally, fully understood the threats to the United States posed by Islamist extremism, but she also understood that the United States has rules and has sense of values. And she and her team and her colleagues on the intelligence community concluded that the intelligence community had overstepped the lines of American values. And she herself in the forward to the summary of the report, the report's very long and still remains classified, but the executive summary, so I think comprise of 600 pages, was declassified. She said that she had personally concluded that the CIA had engaged in torture by any commonly understood meaning of the word. And to be able to achieve that kind of oversight, she exhibited tremendous strength and faced actually opposition from not only the intelligence community, but then President Barack Obama, who had his concerns about the extent of their -- look at this way, by the conclusions that they had reached. Nevertheless, she pushed forward and her colleagues pushed forward. And we have, as Americans, access to information about when our government has done the wrong thing. And for those who are concerned about an unelected, unaccountable deep state, the existence and success of that oversight process led by Dianne Feinstein between 2009 and 2014 is proof that there are guardrails and there are guardians. People will talk about other achievements. She had many in the Senate, but for this observer, her ability and willingness to reign in the secret world was one of her greatest achievements, and it's not simply her achievement. It was the achievement of the Senate, and it is something that will live forever.",

Her poise, her sense of empathy, and her strength not only carried the city over the difficult days to come, but was a source of comfort to those watching, not simply in the United States, but around the world. That was the beginning of her national prominence, although she would spend the next 10 years as mayor, the first woman mayor of San Francisco. But that tenacity, that strength, that wisdom, would define her entire time on the national stage. And indeed, she was one of the great advocates and it was personal for her, of the assault weapons ban that was passed in the 1990s. Although I believe she wasn't that happy that as one of the compromises that had to be made, there was a sunset clause, which meant that within 10 years, unless the Senate reauthorized the ban, the ban would disappear. And as we know, sadly, the ban disappeared in the George W. Bush era in the early 2000s.",

But when you think about all of her titles, Senator, Chairman, Mayor, wife, grandmother, you know, she had talked about this idea that, yes, she is aware of the fact that she's a woman, what that means in terms of breaking down barriers, but she also wanted the fact that she was a woman to be incidental to her legacy.

The fact that she was a woman, I think is remarkable in terms of the enlargement of women's rights and the power of 50 percent of the American population.

It can impact a lot of lives, especially in states that haven't planned for it and can't manage on the cash flow side when all this federal money just kind of disappears, the grant programs all dry up. That has to be first and foremost. And again, the Republicans have the responsibility of leadership in the House to put a plan forth. If I were them, I'd look at what the Senate did, right? The Senate put forth a bipartisan plan. If I were Speaker McCarthy, I'd put that on the floor and get it done. I know he thinks it puts his speakership at risk. I kind of disagree. I think when you get stuff done, you're politically rewarded. There's no doubt about that. So, there's a path there. You're going to have about a dozen or two dozen extreme Republicans joining with 200 Democrats voting against whatever measures that they put forward. The Republicans, they get blamed for it, of course. But really, they're all at fault. They really are. And where's the President?

So, it's kind of faux outrage a little bit on the fiscal side of things when it comes to Congress and overspending. This country has been massively overspending for years. We do need to bring it to a halt, but you don't hold the entire government hostage to do it. It's good management. You've got to get back to good management practices, better sense of customer service, better sense of how these programs are really impacting the individual. Governor, just quickly, I read an op-ed you wrote in \"The New York Times\" where you said -- this is back to the debate that we had two days ago -- where you said, \"Narrowing the fields of candidates is the single best chance that we have to stop Donald Trump. Too much is at stake for us to have wishful candidacies.\" A lot of you out there in your party who are not for Trump would agree with you. Governor, tell me now, who should drop out of this race?",

And for me, I'mvery lucky that I get to travel and I get to meet people and hear their personal stories and those stories stay with me, you know, forever. I remember all of the very first refugees that I met and sometimes I get to go back and see them and sometimes they've been resettled in America and I can go see them here, which is really amazing. But I think the way that we all connect is through hearing details of personal stories, because it's one thing to look at statistics or to read the paper or to hear you guys talk about it. But unless you're hearing the personal stories, I think it still can remain a little bit aloof. I also think sometimes, it's just overwhelming because there's so many problems. You know, so, how do you find the way to connect? And I think sometimes you have to just accept that not everyone's going to connect, but that there are a lot of really, really good people out there and well-meaning people. Like for instance, in Ukraine, you know, the Ukrainian refugees have found this tremendous welcome in the countries that surround Ukraine. And I was just there and it was just such a joy. I was in Moldova to see the warmth and the true -- true welcoming that the Moldovan government and the people themselves just drove to the border to pick people up who were fleeing Ukraine. So, sometimes you have a story where you're really like, oh my gosh, my heart is filled. I'm so honored to see the goodness in humanity.

It was just so beautiful. And Madam President herself is just so impressive. And the things that they're dealing with now are so interesting, because of course, the Ukrainian people want to go home when it's safe. And they've left their husbands, their brothers, their fathers home to fight. And they're really, of course, traumatized and worried about them. And they want to go home, but yet on the other hand, they can't. So, they're having to kind of accept the fact that they need to stay in Moldova where it's safe and obviously very friendly. So, Madam President is trying to get all of the Ukrainian children into school which is just so wonderful and something that you don't always see in refugee crisis is obviously and she's really into the details of why they don't want to go to school, what are the issues at school, how can it be more welcoming, like her level of detail and involvement and her warmth towards, we had a round table of female refugees telling us all of their stories and their issues and she was so in it. I was really, really impressed by her and her team. They were quite amazing. And the whole country is just so beautiful and warm and welcoming and even though it's tiny and doesn't have a lot of resources, they don't seem to mind.
