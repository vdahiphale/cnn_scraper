And some 74 percent, according to the latest polls, of Europeans support the E.U. backing Ukraine. So -- I mean, there are several questions here. But one is, by gathering so many -- so much storage of gas and all the rest of it to get you through the winter, do you think you have maybe setback the goal of climate mitigation?

And we have gotten rid of it. We have completely gotten rid of Russian coal. We are weaning down the oil. Russia cut 80 percent of the pipeline gas. And this made us completely diversify away from Russia towards reliable suppliers like, for example, our friends in the United States or Norway. Second point, we have been saving energy, minus 20 percent, this is extraordinary and very good. Hard work of the European people. We filled our storages with gas. But the most important part is we really accelerated the green and renewable energy supply. We doubled the deployment of additional renewable energy because this energy is homegrown and it makes us independent and it is clean. So, now the warm weather in the winter helps a bit. But this is not all. We have really been through joint action being able to reduce the gas price from -- if you look at August last year to today, by more than 80 percent. All of that is a success. As you rightly said, we have to be very careful. This is a crossroads for us now. Not to change the dependency on Russian fossil fuel into a lock-in in fossil fuels but leap frock (ph) forward into the renewable, the clean energy's which are good for the independents and good for the climate.

First question, I guess, is that, you know, there have been so many books written about Bernie Madoff and what happened. There've been, you know, investigations done. Why choose this person and what he did as a topic for a four-part series? JOE BERLINGER, DIRECTOR, \"MADOFF: THE MONSTER OF WALL STREET\":  Yes, great question. Well, you know, I think Bernie, over the years, and particularly in the initial reporting, has and was been mythologized as this incredible evil genius who did something so complex and pulled the wool over Wall Street's eyes for decades. And the truth is, what he did wasn't so complex. It was so easy to spot. Lots of people spotted it along the way and simple greed caused people to not ask the right questions. And we see, you know, there's a big fraud every five to eight years on Wall Street. And the same ingredients come into play, very simple. You have regulators asleep at the wheel. You know, the failure of the SEC here was mind-boggling. And you have people who know better. Now, I'm not talking about the Mom and Pop victims of Madoff. But I'm talking about the sophisticated middlemen who took other people's money and gave it to Bernie. They all should have known better. I mean, the red flags were abundant. And we see this whether NRAN (ph), whether it's the mortgage crisis, whether it's Bernie Madoff or FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried. You see the similar seeds of fraud, which is people so greedy, again, not the victims, but the middlemen, who just don't want to inquire because they're making too much money. And you see regulators not doing their job. I mean, the regulators are great at coming in to clean up the mess, but we want them to spot it before it becomes a mess, you know?",

There was a big market crash in 1962 and he was wiped out. And it was $30, 000 which were a kid in his twenties in the early '60s, that's a lot of money. And so, instead of telling his clients, like, hey, just like everybody else on the market, we've lost your money. He borrowed $30,000 from his father-in-law, gave that money to his clients. He told his clients that he had gotten out just in time. Of course, he looked like a genius, and that started his reputation. And he made that fundamental decision he wasn't going to be a failure like his father. The fascinating thing is he actually was a financial innovator.

Literal serial killers, you know, John Wayne Gacy, Jeffrey Dahmer, Ted Bundy. And I liken Bernie to a financial serial killer because he has the exact same qualities. You know, lack of empathy. I mean, you can't look a widow in the eye, take all their money, tell them you are going to take care of them, and wipe them out. So, there's a lack of empathy. There is a delusion that somehow it's all going to work out because I don't think Bernie ever thought there -- this -- it would all blow up, you know. In fact, one of the great ironies of the story, one of the scariest parts of the story is the fact that I don't think he would have been caught had there not been a once in a century black swan event called the financial crisis that where everyone was calling in their chips wherever they could and that made the Ponzi scheme impossible to sustain. Because a Ponzi scheme depends on more coming -- more money coming in than going out. But he has all of these qualities of a serial killer. Lack of empathy. Blaming of the victims.

The problem is, a lot of the money went from individual investors, because they had taken out more than they had put in. And that money was -- a lot of it was transferred to institutions that had lost money. So, it was kind of like almost a reverse Ponzi scheme. Money from one group of investors was transferred to another. So, some people, you know, got their money back, but they had been relying on these funds for decades thinking -- and paid taxes on it.

And his job was to create new products. And he looked at the brochure for Bernie, and within four minutes knew something was wrong and told his colleagues, this could be a Ponzi scheme. And because -- as he said, they wanted to throw the, you know, the dirty player off the field. You can't compete with somebody who's cheating. And so, he wrote a voluminous correspondence to the SEC laying out 29 or 30 red flags about why this should be looked into. For example, you know, his -- Bernie's returns, you know, were a straight line up every year making money. That is impossible at finance. His strategy. He used a certain options strategy that would have, if you believed that he was using that strategy, it would have required more option contracts to execute those returns and that strategy.
