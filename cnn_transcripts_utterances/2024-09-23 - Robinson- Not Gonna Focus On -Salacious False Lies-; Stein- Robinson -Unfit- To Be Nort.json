      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, Sun Belt strength. Brand new polls show Donald Trump leading Kamala Harris in the crucial state of Arizona, while the race is deadlocked in Georgia and North Carolina with no signs there of a post-debate bump for Kamala Harris.Plus, a chilling letter from the suspect in the second Trump assassination attempt, making his plans to try to kill the former president clear and urging others to finish the job. We're going to bring you the breaking developments from the court hearing this morning. And get ready to wait. We have new reporting on how and when votes will be counted in critical battleground states. The bottom line, it won't be quick, which means, we may not know the White House winner until days after Election Day. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We start in North Carolina, a state Kamala Harris is trying to turn blue for the first time in 16 years. A new poll out this morning shows, it is a dead heat in the Tar Heel State, Trump holds a statistically insignificant two-point lead. But that poll was conducted mostly before CNN uncovered disturbing, racist, antisemitic and X rated posts from Donald Trump's pick for governor in North Carolina. Republicans feared the bombshell report could cost Trump the state. This morning, Mark Robinson held his first campaign event since most of his campaign team quit yesterday afternoon. CNN's Dianne Gallagher has been following Robinson for us this morning and this whole race for governor in North Carolina. Dianne?",

Eight of his senior campaign staff members, including his top senior adviser, two political directors, his finance director, as well as the campaign manager and deputy campaign manager, all left the campaign this weekend, saying they did so on their own accord.Robinson addressing that today when asked by members of the media, saying that they were working on trying to find new members for their campaign right now to help, still quote, take them to victory. But Robinson has been fighting off concerns from Republicans all over North Carolina after that KFile investigation that came out on Thursday. Robinson has denied that and tried to keep the focus on what his campaign says, he plans to do for North Carolinians and his supporters. About 45 to 50 of them showed up at this event, along with the smattering of protesters as well. But Robinson says that he's going to try and stay focused on what his campaign position is when speaking to those supporters. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARK ROBINSON (R) NORTH CAROLINA GOV. CANDIDATE: We're here for small business people. We're here for all those parents out there that are losing their children to fentanyl. We're here for all those people out there that are struggling to keep the small businesses open. We're here for the people who are -- we're here for the people who are struggling to get their children a decent education. We're not here to talk about 15- or 20-year-old, salacious, false lives. They don't want to talk about what's going on right now. They want to talk about what possibly happened 15 years ago. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Look, you talked about how close it is here in North Carolina, at the top of the ticket between Trump and Harris. There are people in North Carolina, Republicans who are concerned about what the scandal surrounding Robinson could mean for the top of the Republican ticket.But even more so, what it means down ballot here. and we have seen many of these Republicans who are running for statewide office or legislative districts, their opponents Democrats are doing anything they can to try and link them with Mark Robinson right now, finding pictures, endorsements, any kind of nice thing they may have ever said about him and putting it out there. At the moment, one person who isn't talking about Mark Robinson, Donald Trump. He held an event here in North Carolina over the weekend, didn't mention Mark Robinson's name. Didn't have him with him, of course, in the past. Mark Robinson had been at these events, even speaking at the RNC, Dana, doesn't have a whole lot of friends, it appears like, at least publicly right now in his own party.",

We know that historically, North Carolina is one of those states where voters are more apt to ticket split than in other states. But this is such a huge story in North Carolina, what -- you know, all of the tumult around Mark Robinson. Any sense from your sources about how that is going to affect the top of the ticket?",

Listen, in reality, talking to the presidential campaigns about this, nobody has yet seen any real movement on the presidential campaign because of this story. The story just broke at the end of last week. Give it some time to be absorbed into the firmament of North Carolina politics.But as you noted, ticket splitting is not terribly uncommon in the Tar Heel State, even in this world where ticket splitting is becoming more and more uncommon in American politics. You could imagine this story, obviously, Robinson was in a world of hurt in this race before the story ever broke, and it's hard to imagine how he comes back from this. But think about the races beneath the governor's race on the ballot, all the down ballot races. If you have a depressed Republican turnout, sort of generic Republican turnout that could have a negative impact there. Trump doesn't always have sort of generic Republican turnout. It could be a different coalition of voters that he brings to the polls for Donald Trump. And so, it's just an unknown right now. If this is going to have an effect on top of the gubernatorial race, go up ballot to the presidential. But I'll tell you something. If I look at J. D. Vance and Donald Trump's campaign schedule this week, they're both in North Carolina this week. The money is being spent at very high levels there from both sides. Harris has been there a ton. This is a totally engaged state. I don't know that I would have said that about the Biden Trump matchup.",

And really also shows you why Donald Trump does not want to have another debate, because he believes he can win this race -- win this race across the airwaves, just given how voters want to see a change in office and want to change from the Biden years. And that if he can take it to the airwaves, spend a ton of money, as they both are right now to find Kamala Harris in a negative way, perhaps he can grind it out.So that is the question here. It is still a wide-open race. But just getting back on the North Carolina point, the down ticket aspect could it help -- if there's a strong down ticket candidate, let's say a gubernatorial candidate in North Korea, perhaps it could lift Donald Trump. If it's a weak down ticket candidate, then they could bring him down. I think a lot about how the governor's race in Pennsylvania in 2022 brought down Mehmet Oz, the Senate candidate, because they had a weak governor's ticket at the top of the candidate. Could that have an impact, either down ticket or Donald Trump? That's a question --",

In fact, you could argue that they're not positive for him. In the least, if you are thinking about a traditional persuadable voter campaign trying to get people who aren't sure to come to his side, I mean everything from falsely accusing. We know what happened with cats and dogs in Ohio to Laura Loomer to saying he hates Taylor Swift, and it goes on and on and on. And yet, David Chalian, you hear time and time again the question from focus groups, from undecided voters. But what about her policies? What is that about? Because he -- yes, he was president, but he hasn't really super articulated his economic policies for a second term besides tax cuts.",

I think what it is she's newer to the scene for voters. I mean, it's just -- she's a newer character playing on the main stage in American politics for voters, and so they are wanting to learn more about her.I don't even know that they necessarily are demanding specific policy proposals, but you said, yes, he's been president. I mean, I think that is part of it though. He was president. Americans observed him as president for four years. I think they have fewer questions in their mind about what does a Trump presidency look like. And so, that is why I think there are questions still for -- as you decide -- undecided, persuadable voters who are still yearning for a bit more on her. But I will say, you said, put all this polling in context. What we do see since the debate is that in national polls, there is this slight upward movement for Harris.",

Have they seen that before --and he was not an active candidate for president at the time. For an active candidate for president in the history of NBC polling, they've never seen that kind of turnaround in favorability. So that is -- that is the benefit of the debate.Now, that's not how we elect presidents, right? It is this path to 270 electoral votes. That seems unchanged so far. That seems to be still a real coin flip, but she -- the debate clearly in a national perspective, is helping her.",

Reading between the lines is, if you can explain to me why this isn't just about Donald Trump, maybe I'll think about it. CHALIAN: Yeah. And we should note, there are a few more holdouts as well, but it seems if he were to come along, he probably could bring a few of the holdouts along with him and could potentially change the law. The governor has said, waiting for legislative action, willing to do it. And it looks like this could happen right up until Election Day, I mean that they can try and make this change. It is brazen. Also, let's say, it's brazen, particularly for a party that four years ago, was complaining about changing the rules in the middle of the game.
