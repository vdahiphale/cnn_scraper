Now the markets in New York will open in about 30 minutes from now, currently the futures indicating a higher slightly higher opening, more than that at the bottom of the hour. Well, a sliver of land bursting at the seams with more people cramming into it every single day. That is the situation in Rafah as the Israel Hamas war pushes more and more Palestinians south to the very tip of Gaza. Here is what Rafah's tent city look like in October and what it looks like now. A staggering 1.3 million people living here now facing shortages of just about everything that it takes to survivors fighting and Israel raids are reported up and down the territory. Top U.S. Diplomat Antony Blinken taker is in region right now. He has a narrative about how to pause the fighting. He is taking that to Egypt and to Doha. I'm joined by Paula Hancocks and Jeremy Diamond in Tel Aviv. Jeremy, let's start on the ground. What do we understand to be the latest?",

In Western Gaza City heavy bombardment is reported by journalists working for CNN on the ground there. And in in Southern Gaza there have been multiple videos now of clashes between the Israeli military and Palestinian militants. Heavy gunfire can be heard in numerous videos posted to social media. And it's clear that this activity is still being focused on areas very close to Al-Nasr Hospital where there are not only hundreds of patients and medical staff, but also thousands of internally displaced Palestinians who have been sheltering there. And it appears that despite the fact that the Israeli military has been urging the evacuation of that area evacuating is very, very difficult and dangerous. Videos posted to social media show gunfire on the streets right around that hospital. In fact, one video at the northern gate of that hospital complex, a man in that video says that the roads are empty because snipers are shooting at anybody who crosses the road. The Gaza Health Ministry, which is run by Hamas, also accused the Israeli military of preventing the entry of key medical supplies to that hospital and also the movement of ambulances around that hospital complex. The Israeli military for its part says that they have killed dozens of militants in the last 24 hours or so and apprehended 80 individuals that they say are suspected of terrorist activity. But the major question now, Becky is where will Israeli forces move next? We know that in Rafah that is one of the areas where the Israeli military has yet to operate on the ground. They believe that there are significant Hamas forces embedded in that city. But critically, there are also more than 1.2 million people, more than half of Gaza's population that have now been displaced to that city, which has been viewed as kind of a safer area in Gaza than anywhere else, where a lot of the humanitarian aid has been focused as well. And so, now the major question, as Israeli government officials have indicated that they will indeed move to Rafah. What will happen to those more than 1 million people who are sheltering their major, major humanitarian questions looming, Becky?",

Now, at this point, he's meeting with all the leadership of all the key countries. He was in Saudi Arabia today, he met with the Egyptian leader, he's on his way to Qatar, he's going to meet in Israel. These are the elements that are needed to be on the same page in order to try and get some kind of deal. Now, the U.S. has said that the balls in Hamas is caught at this point, because they've come up with a broad framework of what this deal would look like in order to release these hostages. But then at the same time, you have the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, for example, saying that he does want to kill Hamas leadership before a ceasefire. So it's difficult to see with all these elements, how a deal will be hammered out at this point, the details and what each side once appear to be quite different.",

They have to hope that at some point, there will be enough compromise on each side, that there will be this ceasefire, especially if the Israelis are then going to start pushing into Rafah, where you've got half the population of Gaza that is displaced. Where you've got potentially a lot of Hamas leadership that Israelis say have been hiding there at this point. So when it comes to the day after we heard from Secretary Blinken last time he was in the region as well, saying to Israel, there are countries that will be willing to talk to you that will be willing potentially to normalize relations with you. But you have to set the groundwork for a Palestinian state that that is non-negotiable. And that has to happen in order for other normalization, rebuilding of Gaza, the restoration of the Palestinian authority can happen.

I'm not sure how many updates we're really going to get about that. Because there's this careful balance isn't there between what the public has a right to know about the family that represents the head of state, but also about the privacy angle here. The palace has always believed that members of the royal family have a right to medical privacy like anyone else, and they're trying to balance the two constantly, I'm being told we're not going to get a running commentary. We have been told -- we haven't been given the actual form of cancer that the king has. But I have had indications that he may reconsider, may decide to put that out there at some point off the back of his extensive charity work with cancer charities and also with the success that he had, in revealing details about the procedure he had for an enlarged prostate. And that, you know, had a huge impact on inquiries to the National Health Service. And he, he got a lot of satisfaction from that. So I think, you know, there is a possibility, he may tell us at some point, what form of cancer he's got, which would go against the tradition, which is not sharing this sort of information. But he's been treated currently at Clarence House as an outpatient, which is just down the road from here. And until he's in good spirits and actually quite frustrated that he's not able to go out on his public duties. He feels well enough to be able to do that.

Sea drones attacking and the Ukrainian saved sinking a Russian warship inside occupied Crimea. And he was one of those involved. His call-sign is 13 from the elite sea drone unit named Group 13. So secretive we had to hide his face and change his voice. We use 10 drones on the operation, he says, six of them hit the corvette Ivanovets. CNN cannot independently verify that the Ivanovets was sunk. But video provided by the intelligence agency seems to show the mini sea drones evading machine gunfire from the warship and then massive explosions.
