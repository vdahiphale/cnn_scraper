So this is all sort of under discussion, and the question coming out of this is how does it stay or sort of how is it maintained in the near term as well as in the long term in this administration and for administrations to come?

After some of those, we have seen trilateral U.S., South Korea, Japan exercises meant to show that the three stand in unity there and that they will act when necessary together.But this isn't so much intended to be sort of an ad hoc, responsive effort. This goes a step, or more than one step beyond that to make this a proactive, regular scheduled exercise. And this is part of what Priscilla mentioned there, annual military exercises, ballistic missile drills. This requires a level of coordination and certainly a level of diplomatic engagement between the countries that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. As you rightly pointed out, these are countries with decades of mistrust and suspicion going back quite a ways now. So they've come quite a ways beyond that to be able to say, look, these are our shared concerns. We're putting some of that behind us at least, so we can cooperate here and we're going to move forward to work together diplomatically and militarily.
