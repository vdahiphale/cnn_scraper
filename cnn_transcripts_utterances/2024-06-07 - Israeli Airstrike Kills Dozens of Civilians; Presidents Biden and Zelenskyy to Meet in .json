Two senior Hamas militants were targeted and killed in that strike, along with 45 civilians, many of them women and children. Israel says between 20 and 30 Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters were hiding inside the UN school building on Thursday. So far, at least nine have been identified. Last month, the White House warned that shipments of offensive weapons to Israel could be suspended over concerns for the high number of civilian casualties.

CNN's Jeremy Diamond following the latest developments from Jerusalem. First, a warning, though: his report contains some graphic content. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Mohammad Farajallah (ph) is still picking through the rubble of the airstrike that killed his brother. And alongside the blood-spattered walls, he's still finding pieces of flesh. He believes they are his brother's. \"May his soul rest in peace,\" he says. \"I wish I died instead. There is no hope in this life at all.\" Mahmoud (ph) is the second brother Mohammad (ph) has lost during the war. His third brother is in the hospital in critical condition, his skull fractured in the blast. Mohammad (ph) is not the only ones sifting through the rubble. The Gaza Health Ministry says at least 40 people were killed when the Israeli military struck this building overnight. But this is no ordinary building. It's a UN school, converted like so many others, into a shelter for thousands of Palestinians displaced from their homes. Blood-stained mattresses now filling the space where dozens were sleeping at the moment of impact. Fragments of an American-made GBU-39 bomb identified in the wreckage, according to munitions experts who reviewed this footage, the same type of munition used in the deadly strike in Rafah last month that killed 45 people. The Israeli military says it carried out a precision and intelligence- based strike, targeting 20 to 30 Palestinian militants who it says were sheltering in the school and preparing attacks on Israeli troops. An Israeli military spokesman said the IDF was unaware of any civilian casualties. Hospital records tell a different story. Nine women and 14 children as young as 4 years old are among the dead delivered to al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. Those who survived also accuse Israel of targeting civilians. \"Netanyahu is killing the civilians. He's not killing militants,\" Jaber Abu Daher says. \"It's innocent people asleep in an UNRWA facility. What did children and the elderly do? What did they do to him?\" The school is one of at least 180 UNRWA buildings to be hit since the beginning of the war, according to that UN agency. \"Attacking, targeting or using UN buildings for military purposes are a blatant disregard of international humanitarian law,\" wrote UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini. But the devastation goes beyond UN facilities. Scenes like this have been playing out all week in central Gaza, in the clear uptick in Israeli airstrikes. Bloodied and covered in soot, survivors and victims alike have been arriving at al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital at a rising clip. As one wounded child cries for her mother, another arrives at the morgue to say goodbye to his. \"Mama is going to visit Grandpa,\" his father tells his son. \"Don't cry. You're a man,\" he says. But he is the one who breaks down. Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Jerusalem. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

But the lessons that we learned from that is that these types of armaments are really not that effective when it comes to these kinds of insurgencies. You need small-unit tactics. You need to be able to go in and make contact, in essence, with these guerrilla forces and take care of them on the battlefield in these very close quarters. A very difficult thing to do, very hard to do from a tactical and a strategic perspective. But that's the kind of thing that should be happening in a case like this. So yes, the 2,000-pound bombs, great from a strategic standpoint, but in this particular case, they are not the weapon to be used in a low- level insurgency or even a high-level insurgency.
