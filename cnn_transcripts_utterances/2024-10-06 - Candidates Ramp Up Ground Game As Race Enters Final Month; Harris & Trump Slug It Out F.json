So where does this unprecedented race stand and how will the candidates shore up their vulnerabilities? And is there anything that could give either Donald Trump or kamala Harris an edge since there is still no clear leader? There are no more debates. The conventions are long over, and now it gets down to tactics and the extensive ground operations the parties have spent years building to target those small number of persuadable voters in the seven key swing states. So how are the candidates spending these critical final days? Last night, Donald Trump return to the site where he was nearly killed this summer, Butler, Pennsylvania, for a rally with the man -- of man who died at the scene, as well as the world's richest person, Elon Musk. And Vice President Harris spent yesterday in hurricane-battered North Carolina. Of course, a pivotal state both candidates are desperately trying to win. And today, Trump continues his efforts to undercut Harris's blue wall, stumping in Wisconsin, and that's where we find CNN's Steve Contorno.

They'd love to get them, but they're not trying to win the Nikki Haley voters in the Philadelphia suburbs. They are trying to gin up turnout of their base. That's the calculation that they have made. And if you talk to Democratic pollsters or state Democratic chairman, including in those blue states and Congress -- Democratic congressman from those blue wall states, they're a little nervous about this. Democratic pollsters will tell you if you look at the likely electorate now compared to just several weeks ago, it's tweaked up just a little bit in Trumps favor. Now, those polls, they can fluctuate. We have 30 days to go. But in Washington, a lot of people say, why is he saying these things? Why does he keep lying? Why is he demeaning immigrants?

MICHEL MARTIN, NPR \"MORNING EDITION\" HOST:  Well, this is -- it's exactly as John said, this isn't really about persuading people who, on policy. This is about, you know, sort of Trump's deep hold on the culture. You know, anecdotes are always dangerous, but I'll just tell you one. One of the reasons we went to Western PA is that one of the counties there is that the swingingest of the swinging, you know, counties, and by that, I mean that they've correctly predicted every presidential outcome except for one since World War II. So we are working through a park. We're on our way to an event at a university and there's a guy in the park with a sign -- handwritten sign saying they're eating your pets. It has absolutely nothing to do with this community. I see very few people there who seem to not have been born there. But the fact that somebody who is so sort of seem to be un-housed, didn't really -- clearly didn't have a job. He's out here sort of in the middle of day, has handwritten a sign. He had to go to get the poster board. Go get this, go get the marker. It just shows you that the deep hold that Donald Trump has on the culture. It's not about policy. It's about who you are and what you believe or what you want to believe, and that is the part that's -- on the other hand, I tell you if you if you look at signs as a permission slip as of Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro would say, you know, your yard signs are up permission.

Donald Trump does not believe in the concept of the people in the middle and the undecided swing voter.He is a base politician. He's always appealing to his base when he was the president of the country, he believed there was blue America and red America, and that he was the president for red America. He actually said that out loud during the 2020 pandemic that we've all forgotten actually happened. And I think that it's really notable because every indication is that we are hurdling right down the road in 30 days towards another of these extremely close elections. And that's where I feel like all the alarms should be blinking red because if its going to be this close, what Trump is doing right now, in addition to focusing on immigration is focusing on telling his people any outcome in which I do not win is unacceptable.

They voted for Biden.They voted for Trump than they voted for Biden because they thought he was a centrist and I can do that. I don't I usually vote for Democrats, but I can do this. Trump is running these ads, including if you're watching foot cultural ball yesterday, the baseball playoffs yesterday, about her support for surgery for transgender Americans. Donald Trump is for you. She's for them. That's what Donald Trump is trying to do. He's trying to make her different. He's trying to disqualify -- is trying to make her way more liberal but then Joe Biden. Those voters, there are key. They don't want Donald Trump back, but they have this nostalgic memory to Susan's point of the pre-COVID Trump economy. They've been whacked in the face by inflation.

The \"Call Her Daddy\" is interesting because of the fact that that is interview that is going to be heavily focused on speaking to women directly.

She plans on voting in support of the abortion amendment to protect access there. And she says that she is gettable for Harris.

Harris has something to say, right? The Biden economy has created Biden-Harris economy created a lot of jobs. This is just the September jobs report. That was a surprisingly robust number, 254,000 jobs last month. That's a big number. An already low unemployment rate drops even more. So the vice president can hit the road and say, hey, you're doing okay. This is an indicator I look at all the time. It's an economic indicator. I look at it for politics. The university of Michigan consumer sentiment index. It's on the way up. This is August, 67.9 September. It's on the way up, so consumers are feeling better about the economy right now. But look at this number. It was at 80.4 in September 2020. What happened in November 2020? An incumbent president, Donald Trump, was defeated. So it's in the danger zone if you are an incumbent, that's the question for voters. Is Kamala Harris the incumbent president or can she separate herself from Joe Biden? But look at this, the numbers today she can make a case today. The numbers are better. They're getting better, but just look at this -- I want to bring up this chart. It's a little complicated. Do you see any green on this? This looks -- our new media team built this. It's fantastic. This looks at the cost of living over the last one five or six years. This is housing prices.

In Bucks County, from 2016 to 2024, the cost of living was 1.7 percent faster than wages. So people in these communities last week's unemployment rate, it was great, right? That's Bucks County, Pennsylvania. But what about the last six years of my life? Just come down here, where is it dark? In the Atlanta suburbs? That's where Kamala Harris has to run up the vote. So in key places across America, I'll bring it out in, just show you the map one more time, the darker it is, the heart of the punch, if you will. The harder your wages are behind, what you're paying for your house, for your energy, for your food. That's the climate she's running in. That's a really stiff headwind. RAJU:  Again, another indication, vivid example about it matters how you feel. It doesn't matter necessarily what the data says is how are you feeling right now? You also were in Michigan. You've interviewed younger voters in Michigan, some of them obviously were very concerned about the Biden administration's approach to Israel. Now that Harris is the nominee, they are more -- they're happy that she's the nominee, but it hasn't changed the calculus on the issue of Gaza, with those younger voters.",

Then you move right over here. Much bigger campus, Washtenaw County, that's home of Ann Arbor. That's the University of Michigan. We were just back here for a third time in the last year. The volume is down. Support for Harris is higher than it was for Joe Biden back in last year, a year ago. The question is, is it as high as it was for Joe Biden back in 2020 or Gretchen Whitmer in November of 2022. So that's one place you have to watch. This in another place I know near and dear to you. And you come over here. It's the same thing, Dane County, Wisconsin. There are all these key counties in the battleground states where the Democrats have to run it up, look at that number, look at that number. Joe Biden just barely won Wisconsin. Look at the number in Dane County. A lot of that is younger voters. So it's better now for Harris because she has brought a lot of energy. It wasn't just Gaza for younger voters and Biden, it was also his age in a disconnect and they saw Joe Biden and TikTok and they were like, what planet are we on?
