And once it does, the bill will go to President Biden's desk for his signature. Now, that would mark the end of a wild couple of days that after Donald Trump and Elon Musk killed a bipartisan agreement to fund the government. This new bill strips out many of the provisions that were in that initial deal. But it's also missing something that Trump wanted very important to him, a suspension of the debt ceiling. Now, he demanded Republicans include that in any deal, even threatening primaries for lawmakers who did not play ball. But most of the GOP went against him in this final bill. CNN's Lauren Fox is on Capitol Hill. Lauren, another late night vote. How close is the Senate to approving this deal, even post deadline?",

You have senators who are largely sitting in their desks waiting for their names to be called so that these votes can move as expeditiously as possible.Let me just set the stage for you. They are basically on vote five to get to vote seven, which is the one we are watching really closely. That spending bill we expect to pass in the next several minutes, perhaps in the next, within the next hour. But, you know, there are a lot of variables still. It depends on how long senators want to debate that bill. Obviously, we're watching very closely there. But this all really could have been avoided. This was something that lawmakers knew was coming for the last several months. In fact, the negotiations over that package that they unveiled on Tuesday night, that had taken months to get Republicans and Democrats on the same page. Obviously, that deal was nixed by Donald Trump and Elon Musk. That really threw the House of Representatives into chaos, especially Speaker Mike Johnson, who really felt like he needed to find a way forward that was different than that Tuesday night bill. But I'll tell you that a lot of relationships were damaged over the course of the last 24 hours, because suddenly a negotiation that everyone thought was the last negotiation of the Biden administration became clearly a negotiation that may represent the dynamics of the first negotiation in the next Trump administration. And I think that dynamic was something that maybe caught both Republicans and Democrats off guard. But that meant that Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader, felt that he needed to stick to that original agreement. And last night, Democrats were not cooperating on that bill that House Republicans put on the floor. They let it go down. They also let -- they also watched as more than 30 Republicans voted against that proposal. Now, we are in a position that has all been resolved. But it was a really rocky 36, 48 hours, Laura.",

But, you know, a lot of Republicans I talked to said they probably could have gotten that done if it had been communicated earlier to them, that had been a key priority. Instead, over the course of the last several hours and days, Donald Trump was convinced by lawmakers and close advisers that if a government shutdown happened, and what we saw last night was more than 30 Republicans not willing to go along with that debt ceiling gamble, that Donald Trump potentially could be blamed for it and that this would be really difficult to get out of because going into a shutdown is one thing. Getting out of a shutdown is another thing. And there was a scenario where you could be staring down Donald Trump's inauguration where lawmakers still had not found a way out of a government shutdown. And that obviously would set up a dynamic for Donald Trump in the first days of his presidency that would be extremely complicated and really historic.",

Joining me now, CNN political commentators, Republican strategist Kristen Soltis Anderson, Democratic strategist Maria Cardona, and former deputy assistant press secretary to President George W. Bush, Pete Seat. Glad to have all of you here.Let's begin with you, Pete, because I read this really interesting piece from the Washington -- the Wall Street Journal Editorial Board calling this budget fight a fiasco. What is the lesson here for Republicans? PETE SEAT, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT PRESS SECRETARY TO PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: The lesson is that Congress, the C in Congress, stands for chaos. We have literally watched this movie before nearly every holiday season. It is something you can guarantee, just like watching the Grinch or, you know, Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, we're going to watch the House and the Senate prolong spending bills, passing CRs on the floor. It's another chapter in the martyrdom of Congress where, you know, we stayed so late. We were there till 1:00 a.m. you knew when the funding deadline was boys and girls, and you created this deadline. You allowed it to go this long. No one has sympathy for Congress in this moment. But the lesson to your question directly, Laura, the lesson for Republicans, and I have been preaching this message since the election, you can call the mandate whatever you want. You can say it was sweeping, it was a landslide. It really wasn't. What this is, there are small margins in both the Senate and the House, and obviously we don't have those very small margins at this moment. But if they're struggling now, just wait until we get to January 3rd and then January 20th, when a couple of members leave the House to enter the Trump administration and a member of Congress from my home state of Indiana, Victoria Sparks, may not even vote at all. I think at that point, Republicans will be down to a one seat majority and getting things through is going to be very difficult.",

I'll always continue to support the president's agenda. I want it to succeed. But we can make things successful in a very physically responsible way. I think that Johnson should be concerned.

You know, I didn't know there was going to be math. And that's the reality is the numbers are the margins, and Mike Johnson has to be worried about those.But he is living. There's the art of ambition and there's the despair of reality. And the reality is when you have those tight margins, you're going to have to work across the aisle. So one of the questions that Mike Johnson has probably asked himself and wondered what the answer is why is it when 12 appropriations bills passed committee in the House, five passed the floor, why is it that the Democrat controlled United States Senate didn't pass any of them? They sat on them five appropriations bills. Now, I wish it was all 12. It wasn't, but that's a decent batting average for Congress. But the Democrat Senate did nothing. They sat on their hands. So if folks want to work together, Maria was talking about, you know, a bipartisan deal being hatched. There's some bipartisanship that could have happened along the way. I do want to make one more point to what Maria said. There was a lot to unpack there, but I'll just make one more point. Is this whole idea of Elon Musk being the puppeteer. It wasn't that long ago that Donald Trump was a fascist dictator, and now he's Kermit the Frog being controlled by Jim Henson. Which one is it? Democrats lost for a lot of reasons, but one of them is because messaging for them is squirrel. It's -- whatever it is, they can grab ahold of that day. They grab ahold of today. It's puppetry. Come January 21st, I'm sure they'll be back to dictator.",

And so many of them were really confident about the fact that January 3rd was not really going to be that eventful, that this was going to be a really easy road for Speaker Johnson. You know, behind closed doors, there had been a vote where he had broad support of his Republican conference because there was this feeling that Donald Trump was really behind Mike Johnson.Obviously, the last 48 hours have really led some Republicans to question some of the decisions he made, question whether or not he's up for this job, question what his relationship with Donald Trump is. Obviously, Donald Trump did not come out against this bill that the House voted on, but we know from our reporting that he wasn't happy that the debt ceiling wasn't included in this package. So that leaves a lot of question marks, because Mike Johnson does not have room for air when it comes to this speaker's race. He can only afford to lose just a few number of votes. And obviously, Laura, that makes this a really complicated negotiation for him to get that speaker's gavel on January 3rd. It really does. As one lawmaker I was talking to earlier said to me, it really does empower any one House member to be king for a day when it comes to Capitol Hill, because anybody can really make this a very difficult process for Johnson, make this a very difficult process for Donald Trump. I do think that if you're Donald Trump, you probably don't want to go into Inauguration Day still contending with a speaker's race. We saw last time Republicans ousted a House Speaker, it took them three weeks to find another one.

We see evidence that elements of the media may not be as aggressive in covering him as did the first time.The one thing that is tighter, the shoe that is tighter is that he had 241 House Republicans in 2017, and he has 219 to 217, depending on exactly when people are leaving this time. What was revealing here was that the criticism and the defection came from the right. And I think that is likely to be the only source of restraint on him out of this Republican Congress. The conservatives in the House who don't think he's going far enough in upending the federal government. To Lauren's point, really important, the debt ceiling suspension ends on January 1st.

I saw on CNN earlier this week David Axelrod offering commentary about Rahm Emanuel saying nothing gets people's attention more than the smell of jet fumes on the runway. Meaning all of these senators went out of Washington right now. They want to go home for the holidays.The winners right now are the people of this very hard year that had to deal with hurricanes and flooding and wildfires and they need billions of dollars. And you know, people that are our veterans or armed forces, people that need cancer funding or, you know, sickle cell anemia funding, whatever the case may be, if somebody was going to get blamed for this. And Biden, President Biden, I think very shrewdly stepped back and let the Republicans have their own war this week. And now the story is, as you rightly pointing out, can Speaker Johnson weather this? Can he hang on there? And now suddenly you're seeing Republicans for, I really think for the first time since the election, stumbling very badly. And Elon Musk is the one who did the tripwire.",

I'm Zain Asher for you in New York.I want to start in Washington where just after the deadline, 40 minutes or so after the deadline, in fact, after days and days of a lot of chaos, lawmakers have indeed averted a crisis. U.S. federal government is now avoiding a shutdown after a stopgap funding bill was just passed in the Senate by a vote of 85 to 11. The House of Representative passed it earlier. We know that the president Biden does have to sign it before it formally goes into law. Now, the called Plan C extends government funding into March. It's only for a few months. It includes disaster relief and farming provisions, but it does not include a debt limit suspension. That was a key Donald Trump demand. That piece was stripped after a bipartisan revolt on Thursday. Apparently frustrated yet resigned, Donald Trump told one lawmaker that he was disappointed the deal couldn't include a debt ceiling hike. And a source is saying that Trump now realizes that there are some issues that conservatives will not budge on, even for him. Let's bring in Ron Brownstein. He's a CNN senior political analyst and a senior editor at the Atlantic. Ron, always good to see you, my friend. So just talk to our international viewers about what happens next. I mean, obviously, President Biden does have to sign it into law. And even though it was after the deadline and technically funding has lapsed it's such a short period of time that it doesn't actually matter because nobody is going to feel the effects of the shutdown. Just take us through that.",

You know, it's not unusual, especially in the last 20 years, for Congress to kind of revert back to the least possible thing they can do to avert full scale disaster and then find the will to pass that sort of like what Churchill said, you know, the U.S. always does the right thing after it's exhausted all the other options.And this was an example. I mean, I think the lesson has really taken in both parties that you don't win by government shutdowns. You can't really advance policy goals and not a lever that you can use to try to force concessions from the other side. And ultimately, despite all the chaos that Trump and Musk introduced into the process, that was still the controlling dynamic that led to this agreement.",

Officials are working to learn a little bit more about the deadly attack on a crowded Christmas market in Magdeburg, Germany. You know that two people were killed, 68 injured when a car drove through a crowd.Officials say the driver was a 50-year-old man who was from Saudi Arabia and he has apparently been a permanent resident of Germany for about 20 years. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TAMARA ZIESCHANG, INTERIOR MINISTER, SAXOMY-ANHALT STATE (through translator): As far as we know now there have been two fatalities and a large number of injuries. The perpetrator has been arrested. He is a 50-year-old man from Saudi Arabia who entered the Federal Republic of Germany for the first time in 2006. He had a settlement permit and thus a permanent residence and has been working as a doctor in Bernberg. According to our current knowledge, he acted as a lone offender.
