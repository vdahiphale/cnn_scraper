In an exclusive interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, President Zelenskyy warned the Russian would have an open road if they seize that city.

So an independent group that acted in its name but without its support or knowledge. That has been pretty well pushed back on on a number of people. Not just the head of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, but German authorities who are in charge of this investigation. Remember they have now found the boat that they believe may have taken the six people on it, who were believed to be behind that sabotage of the Nord Stream pipeline. It is an ongoing investigation. We still don't know exactly who was behind it. I think one of the most extraordinary things to come out since \"The New York Times\" reporting is the fact that both Moscow and Kyiv have pushed back on it.

Now here's the catch. Many feel that this is essentially a Kremlin style bill. It's taken straight out of Russia's playbook for dissent.

He said the Middle East tour is meant to reaffirm the U.S. commitment to regional stability. Austin was originally scheduled to go to Israel today but is instead spending the night in Jordan. Well, that news coming as the U.N. envoy for Middle East peace says he is alarmed by another deadly Israeli military raid in the West Bank. Israeli forces entered a refugee camp in Jenin and killed a Hamas militant, suspected of killing two Jewish settler brothers. Five other Palestinians were killed.

That's what we've seen in multiple incursions into the West Bank, including, as you say, this daytime raid into Jenin. There was another one in Nablus on Tuesday as well, in order both to target the person, the Hamas member -- Hamas has since claimed him responsible for killing those two Israeli settler brothers in the village of Huwara on February the 25th. And in Nablus, to arrest his sons, who they say or they suspect of being involved in helping to plan that attack. So (INAUDIBLE) any sense that there's going to be any de-escalation in violence, despite the Palestinians and Israelis meeting in the Jordanian Red Sea port of Aqaba just the other week, in a bid to try to de-escalate. You mentioned the U.N.'s special coordinator for peace in the Middle East. He also condemned both Israeli settler violence against Palestinians and Palestinian violence against Israelis as well.

We are at one of the most trafficked borders here in the U.S. This is part of the San Diego field office. To give you some perspective, the San Diego field office deals with more than 50 percent, more than half of all fentanyl that is seized. So they are very busy. And this one here, in San Ysidro, in particular, is the most trafficked for that division. It is what they feel to be a very, very difficult and seemingly endless cycle -- David Culver, CNN, San Ysidro, California. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

This latest controversy is a series of insulting tweets directed at a disabled Twitter employee. He was confused about whether he had been laid off or not. When people rushed to the employee's defense, Musk eventually apologized and said he was trying to retain the employee. CNN's Anna Stewart is following this story for us. Let's recap on this. There's a lot of back and forth between Elon Musk and this former Twitter employee. It wasn't like -- you know, Elon Musk was quick to take back what he said. Just remind us of what happened.",

      "sentences": "Well, yes, this was just a couple of days, a series of fairly explosive tweets between, as it turns out, aformer employee of Twitter. He wasn't quite sure if he still worked there; he had been locked out of accounts. This has happened to many former employees of Twitter. Yet, he asked, the head of HR, who didn't even know if he was employed. He took to Twitter to ask Elon Musk, hey, am I employed by Twitter? Do I still have a job? What followed was a series of pretty shocking tweets. Elon Musk asking what exactly he did for a job, essentially ridiculing that job, sending laughing emojis, telling him, yes, he was fired and ridiculing him, frankly, in front of millions of people on Twitter. But also saying this, this was the tweet that really caught the attention and caused quite the Twitter storm. He says, the reality is, this guy, who is independently wealthy, did no actual work, claimed as his excuse that he had a disability that prevented him from typing, yet was simultaneously tweeting up a storm. Can't say I have a lot of respect for that. Whereupon Halli actually went into great lengths on Twitter about his disability, explaining it again incredibly publicly, explaining he has muscular dystrophy, he has been using a wheelchair for 20 years. And increasingly, he is struggling to type for prolonged periods of time. Now, based on that, we did get an apology from Elon Musk, which in itself is perhaps breaking news. But was it remorse? Was it the threat of a lawsuit? Who knows. But an interesting part of the apology, Becky, is when he says it's better to talk to people than communicate via tweet. Hallelujah.",
