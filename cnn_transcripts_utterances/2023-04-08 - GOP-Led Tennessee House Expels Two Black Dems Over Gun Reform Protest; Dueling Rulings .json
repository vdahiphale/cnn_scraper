So, looking ahead on Monday, that is a major day in Nashville because Metropolitan Council, they will vote to reappoint Jones. And there's sort of two votes going on here. They want to nominate Jones, but al so suspend the rules that prohibit them from nominating and appointing on the same day. If they get enough of those votes, it is a possibility.

So, on one hand, I'm super excited and I'm super hopeful because the vice president, the White House, so many celebrity activists, everybody is paying attention to Tennessee. But this isn't the first-time people have paid attention to Tennessee. This isn't the first-time people pay attention to the south. You look at Georgia, you look at other states and other cities where black and brown, people have put their lives, their livelihood and their bodies on the line for this notion of democracy. They've been met with extremism and resistance from the Republican Party. And the Democrats parachute in with, you know, all of this hope. But then, once the cameras turned off, no one is there. And I've been on the ground here, our organizations have been on the ground here. And 2018, we registered 91,000 people to vote. And our state turned around and wanted to pass a bill that would criminalize voter registration. And once the cameras went off, everybody packed up. So, while I'm inspired that so many people are coming to Tennessee to give speeches and preachers and all these things, I can tell you several things. One is as a staff, we don't have a shortage of preachers, we don't have a shortage of hope. What we have a shortage of? Our people investing in our state and our organizations that have been here that are going to be here for the long time. What we have a shortage of? is people who are willing to lace up their shoes and get on the ground with us to help not just mobilizing and ignite people, but organize them into action.

But he was clear. He thought he was going to a sort of summer retreat in Crimea, which is occupied by Russia for a couple of weeks but was held there really for six months. And in fact, his mother talked about how her hands still shook as she was desperately trying to get a phone signal through to bog down to check he was OK to check out where he was both and acted like he never had any doubt, he'd eventually get home. But it was clear certainly for months there that he was held against his desires. But the scenes were jubilant, as you can see there some others not wishing to talk bogged down and Arena (ph) his mother from Kherson, one of the first areas to be majorly occupied by Russia. And this is part of a broader scheme it seems by this Ukrainian NGO, to take parents 13 in this most recent trip through Belarus, via Russia into occupied parts of Ukraine. Now, some of these parents weren't actually collecting their own children, they were in fact given power of attorney to bring back the children of others with their consent. 31 today an age range of 8 to 17 so these small stories show exactly the scale of the 20,000 that Ukraine says have been forcibly removed from occupied areas and parts of Ukraine and held now in occupied parts that Russia controls.
