I'm Eleni Giokos, live in Abu Dhabi.Mexico makes history electing its first female president, a landmark achievement in a country known for its patriarchal culture. U.S. President Joe Biden, says there's a deal on the table for Israel and Hamas to achieve a ceasefire and the return of hostages. And he said it's high-time, the war and the suffering ends. But Israel's prime minister says he has not agreed to the proposal. Dr. Anthony Fauci the face of America's COVID-19 response is testifying at a hearing this hour about the policies he enacted, setting up a showdown with Republicans who have long villainized him for his handling of the pandemic. Welcome to the show, and we begin right here in the Middle East, to where there are new tensions of the U.S. President Joe Biden's push for a quick end to the war in Gaza. The Israeli prime minister says claims made by the United States that Israel has agreed to propose ceasefire are, \"not true\". On Friday, U.S. President Joe Biden outlined a three-phase Israeli proposal that would combine the release of hostages with a full ceasefire. But a spokesperson for Benjamin Netanyahu says he only presented a partial version, and that there will be no ceasefire until all of Israel's demands have been met. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is in Jerusalem for us. We've got Arlette Saenz, standing by at the White House. Jeremy, I'd like to start off with you. I mean, big question here is, Israeli prime minister coming out and saying that they have not accepted the deal that -- the news that they have responded to the U.S.'s proposal are just not true. I want you to give me a sense of where Benjamin Netanyahu and his government stand right now, because we know there were very carefully worded statements over the weekend, and we really didn't know what to expect on where to from here.",

But as President Biden unveiled it, as White House spokespeople were speaking about this over the weekend, they stressed that this was an Israeli proposal that was put forward to Hamas Now, one thing that the White House has said they are still waiting for Hamas to answer -- respond to this proposal. And just yesterday, the White House spokesperson -- National Security Council spokesperson, John Kirby, said that it is the expectation that if Hamas agrees that Israel would also agree as it was a proposal that they had also put forward. But in his remarks on Friday, as he called for this war between Israel and Hamas to end, President Biden also acknowledged the possibility that a potential deal could be derailed. He said that he is aware that there could be divisions within Israel -- divisions within the governing coalition about this potential proposal. And that is something that we saw a play out within Netanyahu's coalition, just over the weekend. Now, the White House and President Biden have been trying to argue that so far, that Hamas's abilities in -- to conduct another large-scale attack like the one that occurred on October 7th had been degraded. And so, that is part of the reason that they believe that Israel should move forward with this proposal to bring the hostages home, to eventually get to a ceasefire. But the White House, of course, acknowledges that there are still negotiations that need to continue. But all of this comes as there has been international pressure, but also domestic pressure here at home on President Biden, as many have expressed frustration with his own handling and approach to this conflict between Israel and Hamas. And so, the president on Friday are really trying to take the steps to show that he wants this war to end as soon as possible. The question is, whether the U.S. will be able to get Israel on board whether negotiators will be able to get Hamas on board to agree to elements of this proposal to bring the hostages home and put an end to the fighting.",

For more on these issues, let's bring in Gema Kloppe-Santamaria, associate professor of history and international affairs for Latin America at George Washington University. Really good to see you on this historic day. You know, we were just listening to Gustavo there and she was -- he was he saying that Mexico is ready to be led by a woman. If you dig in deeper, you see very high femicide rates in Mexico, you know, major issues on the security funds as well. She's got a lot of challenges. But there's something about her campaign that clearly got her to get this landslide victory. I want you to take me through why she is just this figure that clearly is so revered to take on this mega role. GEMA KLOPPE-SANTAMARIA, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF HISTORY AND INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS FOR LATIN AMERICA: Yes, of course. I mean, I will begin by saying that is -- that today is a great day for Mexican democracy. In many ways, I mean, first of all, like having a woman president, like a woman in power really reflects decades of cultural, political, and social transformations in Mexico, led by the women's movement by feminists that have been pushing for the participation of women in power. And secondly, it's a -- it's a -- it's a huge success, because all the opposition parties immediately recognize her victory. Now, also, I think we should all celebrate that Mexican democracy is looking so well. I mean, it's looking so healthy. Then, I would say that, I mean, the fact that she won a -- with close to 60 percent of the popular vote, I mean, really reflects the strength of the political project that she represents. We must not forget that Lopez Obrador has one of the highest approval rates across the Americas as a -- as a president. His political project has been supported by around 70 percent of people that continue to believe in that political project, and Claudia Sheinbaum, you know, without a -- without denying that she is her own persona, that she has her own agenda. And undoubtedly, the great support that she has also reflects the popularity of the fourth transformation, no, the (INAUDIBLE) -- this political project that Lopez Obrador has represented.

So, that that context is really important. I'm just curious in terms of, you know, the relationship in foreign policy with the United States, they share many issues on the security front, we know the us wanting to secure their border. Give me a sense of what will happen on that front. Because this relationship regarding -- you know, depending on what happens in the US election cycle, will be one of the most important for her. KLOPPE-SANTAMARIA: Yes, for sure. I mean, I would say that -- I mean, we will have the fuller picture, once we know the results a on behalf of the United States and in the U.S. election. But we might expect, again, a lot of continuity in regards to U.S. Mexico security cooperation to what we saw in this term. So, on the one hand, there's a lot of frustration in the United States, especially the DEA felt that Mexico wasn't sharing information, there wasn't so much intelligence sharing, and again, this kind of like mixed messaging of hawks and no bullet didn't really help. On the other hand, we saw a lot of cooperation in the migration agenda, which has been securitized, of course, with the participation of the National Guard in securing the border. I mean, stopping undocumented migration. We will see still a lot of tension, especially because fentanyl and Fentanyl crisis is such a huge concern for the United States government. And the US government has failed that Mexico hasn't done enough to curb the activities of cartels. And Mexico, on the other hand, will continue to push a -- for the issue of arms trafficking, where it feels that the United States hasn't done enough in terms of stopping the flow of arms to Mexico. So, I would say that it's an agenda that will come with a lot of challenges on the security agenda. But I think on trade on the economy, I think we see there a very healthy relation that won't be shaped even if a -- regardless of who comes to power in the United States. I think that the bilateral relation is very healthy. In terms of the economy. I would say that even in migration, so, I think security is perhaps the greatest challenge.",

She says I don't see any relation between the politics and said the judge is -- that she told the judge that she could be fair. Again, that's a part of the standard proceeding her for these trials. As you pointed out, Jill Biden, the first lady is sitting inside the courtroom with Hunter Biden, trying to show some support for him. This is a case that we expect -- that we expect jury selection to take perhaps through the day, but move very, very quickly, and a trial could take a week or a little bit more than that. And of course, the politics of all of this loom very large. This is a case that part of an investigation that has been going on since 2018. And Republicans have tried to argue that what Hunter Biden was involved in, including especially his business dealings have an implication on President Biden. Of course, we are a few months away from the presidential election. A lot of this is also very, very personal. We're going to hear a lot about Hunter Biden's struggles with drug addiction, something that he has written about in his memoir, Prosecutors are going to use that memoir, and his admissions of using drugs around this time that he bought up this gun against him. They are going to use witnesses -- three women that he was involved with. They are going to use witness statements from them, up again about him using drugs. They are going to use text messages from the now infamous Hunter Biden laptop again, against him. The odds are very, very much against Hunter Biden. We expect his defense to center on the idea that when he bought the gun in 2018, that he wasn't using drugs that particular day. He owned this gun for only about 11 days.

So, they just released those transcripts ahead of the hearing today. And their own memo about it really focused in on a couple topics. The first and probably the thing that's going to dominate today are the origins of COVID. The debate over whether this was a natural spillover event from an animal, which many scientists believe or if this was a potential leak from a lab or something even more nefarious, as many others are contending. There is a debate going on over that, and we are expecting that to be a majority of what is question for Dr. Fauci today. We also have seen from that memo that Republicans are focused on COVID-era policies. Mask mandates, social distancing, vaccine mandates, travel restrictions and things like that. Now, Dr. Fauci said in that testimony to the Republican staffers that he believed that there is important work to be done to look back at the impacts of those things. Specifically, things like vaccine mandates, to see what the impacts of those have been on vaccine hesitancy and acceptance, and things like that. However, a lot of people I've talked with, about the expectations for this hearing today are not expecting a lot of scientific revelations and real good faith examinations of the beginning of the pandemic. Instead, they are expecting a lot of political posturing. We heard from Democrats ahead of this hearing this morning, focused on one of the main issues we're going to hear about today, which is Dr. Fauci's oversight of a group called, EcoHealth Alliance, which was involved in some controversial research, including in Wuhan, China. Here's what Democrats said leading into this hearing this morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): This investigation of Dr. Fauci shows that he is an honorable public servant, committed to public health, and he is not a comic book supervillain. He did not fund research to create the COVID-19 pandemic. He did not lie to Congress about gain-of-function research in Wuhan, and he did not organize a lab leak suppression campaign to cover his tracks. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Well, just in the last few hours, the Israeli government seems to haveadded to the confusion over the peace proposal laid out by U.S. President Joe Biden last Friday. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told members of the Knesset it was not true that Israel had accepted the deal. And his spokesperson told journalists, the outline presented was only a partial version. The Prime Minister's Office underscored it would not agree to any plan. And so, Gaza no longer posed a threat to Israel and Hamas' military capabilities have been eradicated. Now this war has been going on for eight months now. But the goal looks increasingly less achievable. So how will this end and how will the Israeli Prime Minister move ahead with his latest ceasefire proposal? My next guest wrote on X recently, and I quote. \"With the end of the Sabbath, Ben Gvir and Smotrich come out with clear cut threat to leave government if ceasefire deal goes through. But that threat can only be taken as seriously as the likelihood of Netanyahu actually going ahead with the deal. Mairav Zonszein is a senior Israel analyst at the International Crisis Group and she joins me now live from Tel Aviv. Mairav, great to have you with us. Thanks so much for joining me.

He has been clear that he's not going to go for a permanent ceasefire. He's not going to say it explicitly. So now he's trying to kind of argue that in order to, you know, appease both is some Israeli public opinion, and Biden, you know, and pretty much everybody at this point and say, we're going to enter -- if we enter a phase, it will still meet our goals of removing Hamas from power. Nobody really understands what that means. But, you know, potentially, that means that he would then try and negotiate for a removal of Hamas from power during the first phase of the negotiation or he would achieve it, you know, when he thinks or tries to, you know, claim through military force, that he could always go back to the fight.

But as the war goes on, maybe some people -- maybe the U.S. which is effectively still given Israel all the backing it needs, maybe hoped that there would have been some progress. Israel hasn't been able to achieve progress. And I think Biden was coming out and saying, look, you're not going to get to a better place through military force. And his time is up as far as his election campaign. So, he wants to put a stop to this now. And the thing is that there are elements within the Netanyahu War Cabinet who are also very much I think, at a point where they realize that they need to prioritize the hostages, that they just don't have something better at this point. There's all kinds of factors that go into it, including, you know, the military being over -- overwhelmed, overstretched. There's, you know, a war going on in the north with Hezbollah in Lebanon. This is another reason why for many people, a ceasefire is necessary now to get a break. But at the same time, it's important to stress that Israelis and the defense establishment as a whole are still committed to removing Hamas from power and they want to continue with that threat.

And that's the crux of the issue. But there's also the political domestic issue that Netanyahu is interested in continuing to remain in power. And he can, you know -- and everybody knows that the war as far as the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians is not going to be solved tomorrow and that Israel is going to continue to use military force when it feels like it needs to.

So, unfortunately, it could go on like this for quite a long time. But there are inflection points where, you know, some members of the war cabinet will leave the coalition. The public in Israel is losing its patience. It's in quite despair, you know, you have a multi front war happening. So, at some point, something has to give. I don't know what that will be.

CNN's Larry Madowo shows us the aftermath of those floods in two Nairobi neighborhoods, one rich and one poor. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is not a river. This is a family's courtyard in Ronda. One of Nairobi's wealthiest suburbs. More than a month after record rains and floods hit Kenya, their home is still submerged. Jonathan Das (ph) says they haven't even started quantifying how much his family is lost, nothing is left untouched. After two meters of floodwaters moved in.

The latest polling reveals a majority ofAmericans agree with hush money trial verdicts. 57 percent say the jury in New York City reached the right decision finding Trump guilty. But so far, the verdict has made little impact on Americans views of Trump as a presidential candidate. A new ABC/Ipsos poll suggests 31 percent regard Trump favorably with around 32 percent saying the same for President Biden. The two candidates will face off for the first time in a CNN debate on June 27th, two weeks before Trump's sentencing. And three weeks before the Republican National Convention. I want to bring in CNN's Senior Data Reporter Harry Enten who always keep - - is keeping a close watch on the polling and the numbers. He joins us from New York to break everything down. Harry, great to see you. Could you break it down for us? What do Americans think of the verdict? Number one, and then whether that affects them in terms of how they will vote?",

      "sentences": "Yes. You know, we take a look at that horse race. And I think it, you know, gives you a pretty goodunderstanding that at this particular point, not a lot of minds were changed by the verdict that came down last Thursday. We did not see massive movement in the polling. And what essentially what we were looking at prior to the verdict coming down, we saw, you know, a race that was very tight between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. You can see it there tie in the Reuters/Ipsos poll. There was no clear leader, look at where we are post-conviction. It's Joe Biden by two. But that is movement within the margin. Or the one thing I will note, though, is this race is so close that if we can see that two-point movement, sort of seen across a number of polls and not just one that could be significant. This is still early days yet. This is just one poll. We'll have to wait and see what happens. But if you were expecting Joe Biden to jump out to a 10-point lead, or Donald Trump to jump out to a 10- point lead after this verdict, that simply put not happening. And I think the reason for that is, you know, this was an America -- a lot of Americans minds, basically sort of what they expected, right? So, you know, you mentioned that, you know, did the jury come to the right verdict? And the majority of Americans said, in fact that they felt that the jury did come to the right verdict. But here's the thing. Beforehand, 56 percent of Americans thought that Donald Trump was guilty. And then 57 percent thought that the jury made the right verdict. So there really wasn't much changing of minds. A lot of voters are already taking into account what they thought would be the right decision. The jury came to what Americans thought would be the right decision. And there really wasn't much that changed in terms of the voters' thoughts on it. Of course, Donald Trump has been going after the jury verdict has been going after the D.A. here in New York County and Alvin Bragg saying, you know, the whole thing was a sham, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. The question is that, that really breakthrough with the American people. And what we see, in fact, was that it did not really break through with the American people, because essentially we had a nice poll that came out from Ipsos that essentially as OK, you know, do you think that the case that was brought about was mainly about enforcing laws fairly to uphold the rule of law and we see that got the majority answer 52 percent. 40 -- only 46 percent of Americans believe that the case was mainly politically motivated to hurt Donald Trump. So, his messaging, it may be breaking through with Republicans to vote majority of which 87 percent thought that this case was mainly about being politically motivated to hurt Donald Trump. But when it came to Americans overall, the fact is, this was mainly in line with what they thought was going to happen, mainly in line with what they thought was going to happen. And there really wasn't a lot of movement either way, which of course, basically lines up with what we've seen throughout this presidential race which is steady as she goes. Nobody really likes either major party candidates. And as we go forward to June, July, August, September, October, November, a lot of Americans are not going to be very happy with what's going on. But guess what? They're going to have to deal with it.",

Most of the people who are undecidedin this race are not paying close attention to these trials. The people who are -- the base of the Democratic Party and the base of the Republican Party. And that's part of the reason why Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee raised upwards of $70 million in the 48 hours post the conviction in New York City. But the fact is, both major party candidates are going to have enough money to compete in this election. Compete going down the line and the real question is going to be those, you know, five, 10 percent of undecided voters. What's ultimately going to sway them? When are they going to ultimately tune into this campaign? You mentioned that debate coming up here on CNN at the end of the month. I think that could be one potential thing that could shift things. Of course, we're just going to have to wait and see because at this point, nothing seems to shift anything.",
