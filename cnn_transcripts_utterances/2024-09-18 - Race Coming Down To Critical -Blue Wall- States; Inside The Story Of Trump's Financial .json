      "sentences": "All right, joining me now, New York Times reporter Ross Buettner (sic). He is the author of a new book digging into exactly how Trump got rich over his decadeslong business career. It's called \"Lucky LoserSo you write in this book that, \"We calculated by the end of 1992, Fred Trump had provided\" -- this was Donald Trump's father -- \"his favorite son more than $34 million. But Donald Trump's biggest paydays from this father's fortune were still to come. By late 1992, the remnants of the empire that Donald had built, the pieces he fought to keep from lenders and investors, were still teetering.\" You also talk about luck. Can you explain how Donald Trump got his money, how he -- what he did with it once he had it, and how that all ties in to what we see today? RUSS BUETTNER, INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER, THE NEW YORK TIMES, CO-AUTHOR, \"LUCKY LOSER: HOW DONALD TRUMP SQUANDERED HIS FATHER'S FORTUNE AND CREATED THE ILLUSION OF SUCCESS\" (via Webex by Cisco):  Sure. When we talk about luck, we're talking about three sort of big tranches. One is what you just described -- the money he received from his father. That total over the course of his lifetime about -- more than $400 million in today's money. And then he received this huge second traunch when this producer, Mark Burnett, the creator of \"THE APPRENTICE,\" walked into his office and gave him a deal to be on a show, but also half of all the product integration money from the show. And that led to a real wellspring of cash. And that also led to a wave of licensing deals where Donald Trump was able to just let people use his name. That was more than another $400 million. All adjusted for inflation, that's easily over a billion dollars. And then there was investment he was pushed into against his will that's yielded hundreds of millions of dollars more. So that's well over a billion dollars for things that are extra outside of his business acumen. He used that through the course of his life to create businesses, many of which lost money or failed, especially in the latter half of his life. That's what we're talking about when we talk about the luck and loss cycles.",

We'll never know because that's what happened in the real world.We do know the kind of state of his affairs when Mark Burnett, his producer, walked in to his office and offered him this gig. His businesses were -- his casinos were teetering on bankruptcy again. He was going to have to come up with $50 million to do that. He was pushing his family to sell the remainder of his father's assets -- a sale that would value the remnants of that estate at well -- about a billion dollars in today's money. So he clearly needed money. And this -- when Mark Burnett walked in, Gallup had done a survey of him not long before -- a survey of his favorability rating, and less than half of Americans viewed Donald Trump favorably. Almost everyone knew him, they just didn't think highly of him. The show created this three-minute amazing video that made Donald Trump look like the king of New York, the kind of business. They created a new studio that looked like a board room. It wasn't his actual office. And every week they were sort of reinforcing this notion that he was a really amazing businessman. And then after they did a survey -- Gallup did another survey about 18 months later, and for the first time, more than half of Americans viewed Donald Trump favorably. And that was the highest rating he would ever have, in fact, in that Gallup survey. And clearly, they had reinvented his image. They had reinvented his finances and that really does seem to have led straight on to him having the credibility to run for president.",

And as of now, we know the earliest we could see Tua back under center for the Dolphins would be October 27. The team putting Tua on injured reserve. That means he's out at least four games. Tua suffered his third diagnosed concussion last Thursday against the Bills. Third-year quarterback Skylar Thompson is going to start for the Dolphins on Sunday against the Seahawks. All right. Elsewhere, A'ja Wilson setting another record last night. The Aces star grabbed seven boards, passing Angel Reese for the WNBA single season rebounding record. Last week, Wilson also became the first player ever to score 1,000 points in a season. The Aces beat the Storm last night 85-72. The Liberty, meanwhile, clinching the top seed for the playoffs with an 87-71 win over the Mystics. New York is 32-7 on the season. Now, who they play in the playoffs, that's still unknown as Atlanta, Washington, and Chicago are all still battling for the eighth and final spot. The regular season concludes on Thursday with all 12 teams in action. All right, to baseball where Shohei Ohtani keeps inching closer to the first-ever 50-50 season. The Dodgers' star slugging his 48th home run of the season last night against the Marlins. Ohtani now has 48 home runs and 48 steals. He's got 11 games left to get the 50-50. The Dodgers actually lost that game to the Marlins 11-9. Juan Soto, meanwhile, also going yard (PH) last night for his 40th home run of the season. It was also the 200th of his career. He's the seventh youngest to reach the mark. And so, Soto and Aaron Judge are the first Yankees teammates to hit 40 home runs in a season since Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris back in 1961. The Yankees beat the Mariners 11-2. And finally, the Astros playing in San Diego. Jose Altuve hits this one and he doesn't run because he hit it off his foot, which is a foul ball. Well, the ump said it didn't hit his foot. Manager Joe Espada immediately runs out to argue. Altuve -- they remove his cleat and sock to show his foot is red from getting hit. He got ejected for doing that, as did his Espada. Grae Kessinger -- he replaced Altuve at second. And in the 10th inning, the Padres had the bases loaded, but Kessinger made the sliding stop to get the out. He's all pumped up. He hadn't played since mid-July. The Astros won that one 4-3. But Kasie, this is actually the second time this season Jose Altuve has hit a ball off his foot and didn't run. And he got called out and he got ejected for it. So it's weird. It hadn't happened in his entire career and twice this season.",
