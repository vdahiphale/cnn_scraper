Prosecutors have asked that Enrique Tarrio be sentenced to 33 years behind bars for seditious conspiracy.Let's get over to CNN's Sara Murray. She's watching this one for us and she has more details.

If you look at, again, some of the Proud Boys who have already been sentenced, people like Dominic Pezzola, he faced 10 years behind bars, Joseph Biggs, Ethan Nordean, Zachary Rehl, all of these folks have faced upwards of 15 years behind bars for their conviction.Again, prosecutors have asked for 33 years in this case. So far the judge has been hesitant to go that far. But Enrique Tarrio is someone who served as the long-time chairman of the Proud Boys. He actually wasn't in Washington, D.C., on January 6th. He had already been arrested on a different issue and told to leave the city. But prosecutors in the indictment and in the trial against him painted a picture of how the Proud Boys sort of played an organizational role behind the attack on January 6th. They pointed out these messages where Tarrio suggests he's preparing for a revolution in the run-up to January 6th. So, we will see what the judge has to say about his sentence today, Kate.",

We talk about the possibility of a shutdown. And I know the Senate's not actually one of the primary actors here. It's more of a House thing. But what are the ingredients that could lead the government to shut down? ELANA SCHOR, DEPUTY MANAGING EDITOR FOR CONGRESS, \"POLITICO\": Well, actually, John, the Senate is an increasingly big player here because Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is preparing to bring up his own spending bills to try to essentially get a leg up on the House in this fight to position. Essentially, both chambers are wanting to project the image of having the spending process under control. But conservatives are all the way to the right. The Senate is more where the debt deal was struck in the spring with President Joe Biden. And it really remains to be seen who will have that proverbial leg up as we head towards September 30th.",

Essentially specific restrictions on government agencies that are baked into these spending bills, cutting back diversity programs at the Pentagon, other kind of social, more culture war focused issues they also want to stick in these bills.

Investigators say they've identified a female depicted in drawings made by the convicted BTK killer. BTK, that was the name that Dennis Rader gave himself. It means, bind, torture and kill. Rader pleaded guilty to ten murders that took place from the 1970s to the 1990s in Wichita, Kansas. He is serving ten consecutive life sentences in a state prison. But authorities believe Rader may be linked to cold cases in Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri. CNN's Jean Casarez exclusively obtained a journal and drawings kept byRader. And now one of those drawings might have led to this breakthrough. And Jean joins us now. This was your exclusive reporting. And now there might be a major development based on that.",

They did (ph) the research but they didn't find anything.An Oklahoma sheriff in Osage County decided in January, I've got unsolved females that went missing during the time Rader was murdering. And I'm going to look into these. And he gave us these drawings exclusively to CNN of females in barns. And I think we have them to show people. These are drawings that were from Rader's journal that we have received. And what the sheriff is saying, and his Osage County Sheriff's Department, is that the detail with the females in their faces, what they are wearing, the detail in the barns, and in a digital piece on CNN, we explain the aspects of this barn that could give people clues of barns that are currently standing or not standing because they believe that victims are in barns. Now, listen to this, John. Over the weekend, they got so many tips and so many calls, and they do believe that the female that is in the green, they believe they have identified her. They are not saying anymore than that. They are conducting a lot of interviews. But there is more to come on this. And so that would mean, if they do identify her, as they think they have, these are real victims that are unaccounted for. That would be part of the killing spree of Dennis Rader. Dennis Rader's public defender has no comment at this point. But Kerri Rawson, who is the daughter of Dennis Rader, has gone to prison a couple of times, working with law enforcement, trying to get him to talk. I have been speaking with her. I interviewed her. I want you to listen to what Kerri Rawson told me. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KERRI RAWSON, DENNIS RADER'S DAUGHTER: He's in a wheelchair. He has no teeth left. And he went from this like vivacious man that was hiking with me right before he was arrested, to like an elderly man. If he's innocent on these, I will defend him. If he is guilty, I will nail him to the wall. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The other five were treated at released at the scene.Attorneys for former South Carolina lawyer Alec Murdaugh say they are filing a motion for a new trial based on what they're calling discovered evidence. Murdaugh was convicted for murdering his wife, Maggie, and son, Paul, back in March. He is currently serving two life sentences for those crimes. Murdaugh's team says they plan to appeal his conviction shortly after the sentencing and now they will hold a press conference later today. So, an incredible season opener for the Duke Blue Devils. They beat the number nine ranked Clemson Tigers 28-7. Duke dominated in front of a roaring home crowd at Wallace Wade Stadium. In the game, Duke was down 7-6 at half time. But in the third quarter, quarterback Riley Leonard broke out for an amazing 44-yard touchdown run. It was all the momentum the Blue Devils needed to take down Clemson and seal the huge week one upset. I'm not exactly clear what made this upset worthy of our news this morning, Kate. The number nine going down. I feel like maybe Duke paid for that reader right there, or we have someone from Duke in the control run. But congratulations to the Blue Devils nevertheless.

If you've made a - if you made a rental before today, and that rental is before December 1st, you're good. You can still stay in that rental in New York City. If that rental, however, is scheduled to be after December 2nd, you're going to get a refund and you have to start all over again and look again. If you're a host who did not receive that city ID number, you can only rent for 30 days or more. That's going to be an automatic on Airbnb.
