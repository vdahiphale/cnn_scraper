If you want someone to push innovation, to cut through red tape, he has proven with his businesses, SpaceX and Tesla, that he can do that. Having said that, this appointment raises all sorts of questions about conflicts of interest given the fact that Musk has billions of dollars of U.S. government contracts for his businesses. He's deeply involved in national security and ostensibly, now he is the person who's going to be deciding which bureaucrats get fired, which regulations get swept away.So, there are all sorts of questions about this appointment, and I think it's fair to ask as well, whether this is a real government department, whether it will be funded, and how effective it will be because the White House doesn't set spending, it is Congress. And if there are massive politically painful cuts that Musk recommends, I think there are questions even though Republicans will control both House of Congress, how much appetite there is for that sort of re- invention of government in the coming years.",

He served honorably in Iraq and Afghanistan, but this is one of the most critical jobs in the United States government, if not the world, controlling the U.S. military, the most powerful military in the world. Hegseth doesn't have any strategic or international experience.His main qualifications from Trump's point of view, appear to be that he is pledging to sweep out wokeness in the military, which translated means diversity and the U.S. military has traditionally been one of the most diverse organs of the United States government going back many, many years. In fact, it was pioneering in terms of racial diversity. So, this is raising quite a lot of questions. There will be an issue potentially about whether he can get sufficient votes in a Republican Senate to get confirmed given the concerns about his experience. But I think to a great extent, complaints about Hegseth, people saying in Washington that he's not qualified, that this is an erratic pick, that is exactly the point. This is what Trump's voters want. They wanted disruption of government. They don't want the usual people running it. And Trump made no secret of exactly what he was going to do and who he would pick, the kinds of people, when he was running for office. He won a democratic mandate in last week's election. And I think we're going to see much more of this as he unveils the rest of his national security and government picks.",

So how this is going to run this morning is, at 9:30, each of the candidates are going to be nominated. There will be up to two nominating speeches for each one and a couple of really interesting folks are going to be nominating each of these candidates. I want to highlight Marco Rubio, who was just picked by Donald Trump to be his Secretary of State. He is going to be nominating fellow Floridian, Senator Rick Scott. Then that speech will be seconded by Bill Haggerty, another conservative from the state of Tennessee. We also expect for John Thune that Senator Mike Rounds is going to nominate him. Then Senator Steve Daines, who was responsible for helping Republicans clinch the majority as the Chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, he is also expected to give a nominating speech for Thune. Cornyn's office not releasing who will be giving those speeches for the Senator behind closed doors. Then they are going to have a vote. Essentially it will be a secret ballot. The votes will be counted by Senator John Barrasso's team. He is the conference chair. At that point, they'll see if anyone has 27 votes. That's the magic number. That is the majority that you would need to clinch this race on the first ballot. If no one gets 27 votes, then the lowest vote getting candidate will drop off and Senators will vote again. Now, many Republicans I talked to yesterday, they expect that this could go a couple of rounds and it may take several hours to get an answer. But it's just really important to highlight how monumental this moment is. Because Mitch McConnell has been leading the Republican Senators so long, this is really the first big open three- way race that they have had. And it's just going to be really essential to see who is going to be taking the helm because, obviously, that person is going to have to work really closely with the incoming president, Donald Trump.",

And that is certainly what we're seeing once again, the Biden Administration saying that they believe there is no cause -- for any sort of violation of U.S. laws which govern foreign military assistance, that they have seen an improvement in the humanitarian situation. That as things stand at this stage, there will be no change in policy when it comes to Gaza and Israel.But as you mentioned, this stands in stark contrast to the statements and messaging we are hearing from the humanitarian organizations directly engaged in operating the humanitarian response in the Gaza Strip on the ground. As you mentioned, at least eight aid organizations joining together to release essentially what is a score board of what is actually taking place on the ground and where Israel stands in terms of meeting those requirements. They have said, A, that they believe Israel has failed to meet the requirements outlined by the U.S. in its letter to the Israeli government back in mid-October with that 30-day deadline. And also, they have gone so far as to say that they believe Israel has taken steps to worsen the situation, the humanitarian situation within this 30-day period, particularly when it comes to the situation in Northern Gaza which of course, for weeks was laid siege two with many civilians trapped. Now, we're seeing the forced evacuation of civilians with many being told that they will not be allowed to return to their homes in Northern Gaza, essentially separating Northern Gaza from the rest of the Strip. And what we continue to hear from these humanitarian organizations, including U.N. agencies, is that there is now the real risk of famine on the cards in Northern Gaza, that we are seeing severe malnutrition spreading across the Strip, dwindling medical supplies, of course, and already overrun, frankly collapsed healthcare system now, in the Gaza Strip. And while the Israeli government maintains that it is allowing aid to get in, this again has been disputed by humanitarian organizations who have accused the Israeli government of enforcing a blockade which has prevented aid trucks from getting into the Strip. Just in October, we saw around 57 trucks getting in a day into the Gaza Strip. That is well below the 600 trucks a day that aid groups say need to get in just to meet Gaza's basic needs. And of course, this deteriorating humanitarian situation is all happening along the backdrop of continued airstrikes and a continued ground operation by the Israeli military.",

And this breaking news into CNN, a Justice Department official says, Special Counsel Jack Smith is looking at stepping down before Donald Trump takes office. Trump, of course, has threatened to fire Smith. The source says, Smith is talking to the Justice Department about the mechanics of winding down the federal criminal cases against Trump and other legal issues.CNN's Senior U.S. Justice Correspondent, Evan Perez is live in Washington. Evan, this obviously doesn't come as a surprise, but what more do we know? EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR U.S. JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Amara. The surprise here, or I guess the news here would be the details of how this winds down and how exactly Jack Smith makes his exit. Now, part of the discussion here is producing a report. He's required to produce a report of his investigation and that would be done after he closes these cases. And if it goes as planned, he's not going to be -- he's not going to wait for Trump to fire him. He will quit before that. Part of the discussion centers on the idea of whether this report that he prepares has to be submitted to the intelligence community. That's part of the routine process for producing special counsel reports. But a lot of what Smith found in his investigation, part of his -- what would be in this report is already in court filings. They've already gotten clearance from the intelligence community because he was -- they were going to use it in trials, in cases that of course are now likely to be done and over with. Another part of the complication here, Amara, is you'll remember that in the classified documents case that was filed in Florida, there were two other defendants, two people who he is accused of cooperating with to obstruct the investigation, his employees, and those people obviously are not protected by immunity that the Supreme Court ruled over this summer. So, those are some of the details that are still being worked out. But if it goes as planned, we expect that Smith will be gone before Trump arrives in -- on January 20th. The other question here, of course, Amara, is even if he's done, doesn't mean that Republicans and Donald Trump are done with him because we anticipate that there will be an investigation. They've already said that they want to do that. And we might see Jack Smith be brought up to Congress to take questions from those Republicans who believe that this was an investigation that should never have been started. Amara?",
