It's wonderful to have you with us.We are exactly one year after the darkest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust. Israel finding itself at war on three fronts this morning. They're hitting Hezbollah targets in Beirut in the southern suburbs with more airstrikes overnight while also continuing to bombard Gaza.

This all happening while Israel vows retaliation against Iran for last week's deadly missile strike.

The whole world is astounded at the blows you inflict on our enemies. And I salute you and tell you, you are the generation of victory. Together we will fight and together we will win with God's help. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

David, welcome.This, of course, an incredibly somber day as we mark one year since 1,200 Israelis were killed. Obviously, hundreds were taken hostage. Over 100 still remain in Gaza. But the region is aflame today. What are your, sort of, reflections and reporting about what we expected in the wake of this as we mark the anniversary and where we are today? DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL AND NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES, AUTHOR, \"NEW COLD WARS\":  Well, first, I think just the sadness of this day sort of sweeps over all of us. You know, you have the images in your mind which we'll never lose of the wonderful young people -- Israelis, Americans, and many others who were killed that morning and the kibbutzes that were obviously invaded. And it makes you wonder, you know, sort of toward what end. Did Hamas think that they were going to destroy the state of Israel doing this? I mean, that was as crazy a thought as the thought that al Quada had, 23 years ago, taking down the World Trade Center would somehow destroy the core of the United States. So the futility of it all is the first. The second is that I just remember on that morning how the world came together around Israel -- not completely universally but pretty solidly -- and how much of that now has been squandered away by the nature of the response. Just the overall brutality of a response that is based on the theory that you can wipe out an entire organization, Hamas or Hezbollah, and the thoughts behind them. And, you know, the Israelis at this point are running into the same problem the United States did, Kasie, after 9/11, which was that you can create as many terrorists of a new generation as you have wiped out of the old one if the techniques you use along the way end up killing so many civilians and seem to take in so many civilian casualties on your way to trying to get the terrorists. And so we're wondering a year out what is the strategic objective here.",

We have no doubt that Vice President Harris, along with the Biden administration, is completely committed to the security of Israel and its right to exist, and its right to exist free of violence.If the Israelis strike Iran and if they hit the nuclear sites or something and that then leads to a countervailing attack in which the U.S. is going to have to get involved, you're going to see Vice President Harris in a bit of a bind. Because on the one hand she doesn't want to do anything that would suggest that she isn't 100 percent behind Israel. And yet, on the other hand, if she thinks that they way they have gone about this is not strategically wise -- if they start at the maximum position hitting the nuclear sites or energy and so forth -- then the question is how do you pull the Israelis back some from that? How do you try to urge them back, which President Biden hasn't been very successful at so far, and still insulate yourself from the inevitable critique from former President Trump that she is weak on defending Israel, weak on Iran?

It used to be the sort of go-to for a lot of communities and a lot of emergency managers to hear what's happening.You add onto that technology challenge AI. The misinformation, the pictures that aren't real. People putting stuff up saying help my family, they're hurt, and seeking fundraising. So you have the technology problem. You then have the infrastructure problem, which is communications are down. Local reporters, to the extent that there are any or as impacted as the people that they're covering. It is difficult to communicate in some of these areas. And then the third piece, of course, is the purposeful politicalization of the narrative led by Trump. I think the good news is you're getting pushback by many Republicans -- the governors and local officials. But that narrative that nothing is getting done -- that is actually harmful. It creates anger, it's noise in the system, and emergency managers and first responders are sort spending all of their time trying to figure out where is truth and where is -- where is this disreality being pushed by Trump and the conspiracy theorists.",

And the question is what more or different can be done. And I think that the administration needs to look at its basic assumptions how to get U.S. citizens out of harm's way each day and challenge those assumptions. And just an example, a couple of weeks ago we met Sec. Yellen, Treasury secretary, and from the background that I've been doing I know for a fact that last month Hamas was able to pay tens of thousands of militants and operatives inside of Gaza tens of millions of dollars. That's totally unacceptable. And where is that money coming from? So, yeah, a lot of money was stashed in Gaza beforehand. And they take the humanitarian aid, and they confiscate it and then sell it on the black market, and they skim from the top. But a lot of money is coming still from the outside from U.S. allies, NATO allies, allies in the Gulf -- in the Persian Gulf that are moving money into Gaza. And I challenged the secretary and her team. That is the oxygen that is allowing Hamas to keep on fighting, and we need to close out. We need to suck that oxygen out. And more sanctions can happen not only on Hamas but also on Iran. That its proxies, Hamas and Hezbollah, have been funded by them.
