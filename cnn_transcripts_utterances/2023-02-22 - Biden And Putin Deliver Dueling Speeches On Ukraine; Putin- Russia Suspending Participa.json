The two leaders held talks before they each address a cheering crowd of thousands at the rural castle in Warsaw Tuesday. You just heard Kevin talk about that. Now, in an exclusive interview, the Polish president told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that Biden's surprise visit to the Ukrainian capital on Monday was a powerful show of support. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANDRZEJ DUDA, PRESIDENT OF POLAND (through translator): So, the very thing that the President traveled to Kyiv, he was there, it sends an incredibly powerful signal. A political and strategic signal. It is a demonstration of strength of the United States indeed. It is like saying that the American leader who as a matter of fact is the leader of the free world is able to travel even when war is raging, even to a place where there is a potential danger. He is not afraid, because the United States is strong enough to protect him. That is number one. And number two, he was there. And today he is in Warsaw. He gives his pitch to the whole world. And he sends a signal of the defense of the free world, of the defense of NATO, of the defense of every inch of the territory as the President said today. So, to ask the polls, this American signal, this allied signal, not only within NATO, but first of all, a signal sent by the greatest superpower in the world. A signal sent by our friend and ally today is so significant. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He also argued the West is to blame for escalating the situation in Ukraine, claiming it wants to make the conflict even wider. CNN's Clare Sebastian joins us now live from London with more.

This is about NATO expansion that Russia has tried to prevent. It's about denazifying Ukraine. It's about protecting Ukrainian civilians.All of these things we've heard before. He did what we call in this industry bury the headline. He announced the very end of the very long speech that Russia would be suspending its participation in the New START treaty. That nuclear arms control treaty. That doesn't really change things. Russia was not allowing inspections to go ahead. Anyway, they had been suspended for COVID and had not allowed them to resume. But take a listen to how he talked about this in the speech. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA (through translator): They want to inflict a strategic defeat on us and climb all over our nuclear facilities.

It is something by the way, the idea that the U.S. and the West is trying to destroy Russia that Biden denied in that speech on Tuesday that Macron has said that it's not part of the plan in the West. So Western leaders are trying to deny it, but it is interesting in the context, Russia's nuclear doctrine allows for a first strike if Russia feels that its very existence is threatened in a conventional war.And we are hearing more and more pronouncements from Russian officials. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin's spokesman say that it's impossible to speak about destroying Russia without launching a world ending nuclear war. So, this is fueling what appears to be a palpable uptick in that nuclear saber rattling that we've become used to hearing from Russia over the past year.",

And this happened this time again. And apart from the suspension of new START, and a few little things, Putin didn't say anything new that he wouldn't have said last year.And if you look at the speech, I think the key message of this speech is that Putin has no plans to change anything about Ukraine and the West. Russia will stay the course. Policy will be the same. Putin has no plans to make any compromises. And he's ready to negotiate only on his own terms. And I think he genuinely believes that Ukraine is only part of this conflict. He believes that this is a proxy war with the West. And even if the war in Ukraine is put on hold, at some point, the conflict between Russia and the West will continue. And that -- that's what he wanted to explain the Russian citizens and to the western audience. So, I think -- yes.",

And of course, in this situation, when Russia's conventional capabilities has been decreasing, he wants to make this argument, he wants to make this leverage even stronger. And I think in the future, of course, he will use this leverage more and more.And secondly, I think he wants to show that if the United States or other Western countries are interested in any formats and treaties with Russia, we should -- they should change the way they treat Russia and Ukraine. That is -- that was his message. So, this means, for example, that if the United States needs a new start, and if the United States needs a new system of arms control, yes, from the Cold War era, Putin believes that Washington must change its policy towards Ukraine. So not Russia. But if it doesn't happen, Russia could launch a new nuclear arms race. And I think that's a very real risk.",

And MOFA has said that this visit is an opportunity for both sides to exchange views about the relationship and also to talk about international hotspot issues which would include the war in Ukraine. On Tuesday, you had that earlier meeting between Wang Yi and the head of the Security Council in Russia. They discuss their opposition to the Cold War mentality as well as a desire to enhance cooperation. They also discussed the situation in Ukraine, but details were not provided. This entire visit and the China-Russia relationship is under immense international scrutiny. Last weekend we heard from the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who warned Wang Yi of consequences if China were to provide material support to Russia for this conflict in Ukraine. China has fired back repeatedly and now China is accusing the U.S. of sabotage. I'm going to show you this op-ed that was published in The Global Times. It's a state-run tabloid from China. Let's bring it up for you. In it, it says this \"the U.S. has been wearing thick tinted glasses to view China-Russia friendly ties from the very beginning. This suspicions of provocation and sabotage from Washington toward China- Russia ties have never stopped and now they have reached a peak because of the conflict.\" I should point out that since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, China and Russia have been edging closer together on multiple fronts. Politically, economically, China continues to buy energy from Russia. Also, militarily as well. Both sides have helped join drills. In fact, Russian Chinese drills are taking place this week. And finally, Paula I want to point out reporting from the Wall Street Journal saying that the Chinese leader Xi Jinping is planning to visit Moscow for a summit with the Russian president.

(voiceover) Several other buildings in the city owned by the same developer also came crumbling down.

But many say it's not just the contractors who are to blame. This is a systematic problem says Kurai (PH) to me from the Chamber of Architects. This is a complex problem of the system, not an individual one. The country's chamber of architects says a construction boom lacks inspections by authorities and government amnesties for developers, who didn't abide by building codes introduced after previous disasters, all contributed to this catastrophe. In the city of Iskenderun, residents picking up what's left of their shattered lives are still in shock. But anger is now setting in. To dry for earning more profits led to this destruction. Nothing else this woman tells us. This local mayor says he's lost 700 people in his district alone. Choking back tears, he tells us how he held the hand of a relative under the rubble for two days, waiting for help that never came.
