An epic ceremony -- opening ceremony for the Paris Summer Olympics, including a performance from none other than Lady Gaga. We will take you live to the French capital. And an investigation is underway into an attack on France's rail network, which disrupted travel plans for many travelers there. Plus, a meeting between former U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago. We'll have a live report, all that and more, coming up. But first, pageantry in Paris. The 2024 Olympic Games have now officially kicked off with a star-studded parade on the River Seine. You see the brilliant colors there. It is the first time the opening ceremony has been held outside of a stadium and it overcame strikes, gray skies, and even rail sabotage. More on all of that in just a moment. Now, the ceremony featured a host of celebrities, including performances by Lady Gaga and Celine Dion, and a cameo from French football legend Zinedine Zidane. Of course, the athletes brought their own star power, Andy Murray, Simone Biles, LeBron James, you see him there, Rafael Nadal, just a few of the megawatt talents you can expect to see in the coming days. Well, France putting on what is an absolutely stunning opening ceremony that spanned the entire city. And that was despite some major issues right across the country earlier in the day, rail lines right across France hit in a spate of attacks, including arson. Now, luckily no one -- sorry, pardon me. Luckily, no one was injured in any of these attacks. So, far, though, no one has claimed responsibility for them either. And given the scale and precision, it is believed they are part of a coordinated effort. A source telling CNN that French Intelligence Services are now, in their words, fully mobilized to find those responsible. Melissa Bell joins us now with Paris -- from Paris with the details. Quite an extraordinary day from start to finish here, Melissa. And obviously, starting with some concerns.",

What emerged over the day was the news that this had likely been coordinated and the investigation is now underway. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BELL (voice-over): The organizers of Paris 2024 believed they were ready for anything. But it was at 4:00 a.m., hours from the opening ceremony, that coordinated sabotage and arson caused chaos with three of the nation's high speed rail lines. PATRICE VERGRIETE, MINISTER DELEGATE FOR TRANSPORT OF FRANCE (through translator): Today, all the information we have clearly shows that it was deliberate, the simultaneous nature, everything happened at the same time. Everything now points to the fact that these were arson attacks, particularly the timing, which is more than suspicious. BELL (voice-over): Security in Paris is tight, with authorities keen to make sure that things go smoothly. But this was one attack carried out simultaneously across the country that was impossible to imagine. Intelligence Services say this tactic's been used before by far-left groups.

There are huge amounts of security forces on the street, whether they are policemen and women or soldiers. But now, you're likely to see heightened security outside of the city. Certainly, the rail operators are saying that they're putting about 1,000 workers specifically on the lines to make sure that nothing happens. But again, when you consider how this sabotage -- coordinated sabotage took place, it was at parts of the country fairly isolated, outside of towns, taking on signal points that very strategically then hampered the lines' ability to function. So, we look now to authorities to tell us who might have been responsible. Clearly, they were people who knew the rail lines and clearly, they were people out to cause as much disruption ahead of the games, even as the world's eyes were on Paris. Paula.",

KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: They did meet for a long time, but we're actually not sure how long they met because they were supposed to meet at 11:00 a.m. We saw the motorcade enter. We never saw Benjamin Netanyahu's motorcade leave, but we are told that he is no longer there. Now, that is not that surprising, given the high security alert that both of these men are currently under. So, that is unclear how long the actual length of this is meeting was. But I will tell you, we got a readout from the campaign. They said exactly what you would expect from the Trump campaign, that Benjamin Netanyahu praised Donald Trump and thanked him for everything he did when he was in office. And Donald Trump told Benjamin Netanyahu that he stands with Israel completely after those October 7th attacks. What's interesting, we ended up getting to go into the room, just briefly, to ask a few questions. We talked about those were the questions, some of them you just played there, about Kamala Harris's remarks. Donald Trump used that opportunity to attack Harris to say that she was a California liberal, to go after her stance on Israel. Benjamin Netanyahu said, when it came to those comments, that he hoped it didn't impact the ceasefire talks that were currently underway. The other part of their conversation that was notable was just their interaction overall. The two men were very close when Donald Trump was in office, and then that relationship soured after Trump left and after Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated President Joe Biden on winning the 2020 election, something that Trump just thought was disloyal. Obviously, loyalty is something that matters a lot to him. But today, you wouldn't have been able to tell that there was any tension between the two men. They seemed to get along fine. And I asked what their relationship would look like, would it be a good working relationship if he was to be elected back in November and Trump said, yes, there was never any issues with their relationship",

Companies like Indonesian manufacturing and infrastructure firm Bakrie &amp; Brothers are working behind the scenes to support their country's talented athletes. Indonesia has sent 29 athletes to Paris this summer. Here they are right there at Friday night's opening ceremony on the Seine. Do they look like they're having a good time? That's fantastic. In front of the Eiffel Tower. They will be competing in such categories as gymnastics, archery, swimming, and weightlifting. Indonesia, by the way, has won the most overall medals of any Southeast Asian country at the Summer Games, and it is set to make a bid to actually host the Games for 2036. Anindya Bakrie, the CEO of Bakrie &amp; Brothers joins me now. He is the main sponsor of the Indonesian Olympic team, as well as a leading figure in the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. I want to thank you for joining us. In fact, you join us from Paris. I'm not sure how much of all of this you've been able to take in. But despite the rain, it looked impressive. Certainly, the Indonesian team there with a lot of enthusiasm. I mean, some people would shy away from this kind of investment, right?

It is indeed an honor to be here with our delegation, along with the other 206 countries. So, we just had this nice opening at Seine River, and everybody had a good time. And I think it is a message of peace and unity at a timely moment right now, with the complexities in geopolitics, geoeconomies, you know, having Paris Olympic is just a nice thing to have. And for Indonesia to be able to send 29 athletes, it is the largest in two decades, joining 10,500 athletes, it is indeed an exciting thing. The biggest gold accumulation we had was in 1992. We hope we can surpass that with a lot of sports such as badminton, speed climbing, as well as weightlifting, among other things that we also compete in nine other sports. But yes, it's nice to be here and I think this type of person-to-person diplomacy is the thing that we need nowadays.",

And in all of those respects, Indonesia really want to be a value added economy. Industrialization is really the name of the game for Indonesia, along with the trade that we want to increase over time. And Indonesia is a balanced country that would like to do a trade and investment with the east and the west. So, in the process that the west really look into Indo-Pacific partner, we believe Indonesia can be a good partner and can grow together because the world really, as I mentioned quickly in the beginning, needs growth.

So, we're not even seeing the showers around the middle anymore. And that's kind of what happened here when it did approach Taiwan. It made a left-hand turn and it made an entire loop.

There's not a place in the world that's not going to flood at least a little bit from that.

Many of their uniforms were covered with a bunch of plastic ponchos, but they were still dancing and celebrating in the rain. This was the first ever opening ceremony outside of a stadium.

There's been too many unprecedented things happening too quickly of an amount of time for me to say for sure. I will tell you this, that I know that Vice President Harris wants to debate Donald Trump. I know the American people would like to see that. God, I'd like to see that. Can you imagine, an articulate, well educated, well-spoken woman going up against Donald Trump? Sure, I think everybody will try to make the comparison to when him and Hillary Clinton had a debate. I do not think it's the same, but I do think it would be very, very good. I think it would be very entertaining, and I think she would get the most of him, and I think that he knows that too.

Right now, I'm actually looking at Mark Kelly as probably the smartest pick. He's very well respected by Republicans in Arizona. He's very well versed on border issues, and immigration is a major issue. So, you need to have somebody who can talk about immigration, and do so in a way that can - - voters can understand and say, OK, yes, this makes sense, as opposed to Kamala Harris as the borders are and look at the disaster on the border.",

In 1988, they again lost the Soviet Union, and that would be the last time the U.S. used amateur players, because in 1992, we had the Dream Team with Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, and Larry Bird. It was one of the most iconic and dominant teams in sports history. And the U.S. dominance continued until 2004, but that team, despite having a young LeBron James and Dwyane Wade and Hall of Famers Allen Iverson and Tim Duncan, just didn't mesh. They lost three games in Athens, the most ever by a men's Olympic squad. The U.S. finishing a disappointing third place, watching Manny Ginobili in Argentina capture the gold. After that loss, the U.S. reevaluated how they built the Olympic roster, stressing team chemistry as they vowed to not have another poor performance at the Games. And in 2008, Kobe Bryant led the redeemed team to an undefeated run to reclaim U.S. dominance. And ever since, it's been nothing but gold for Team USA at the Games. But could this be the year the streak of four straight golds comes to an end? This team has LeBron and Steph Curry playing together for the first time ever.",
