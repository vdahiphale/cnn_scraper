The latest live on the pro-Palestinian demonstrations, the police response, elements of anti-Semitism, and the impact this all could have on presidential politics.Also tonight, a look ahead at what to expect when the Trump hush money criminal trial resumes tomorrow morning here in New York. And a report from Haiti, a CNN exclusive for the country torn apart by gangs. Our David Culver tracks down and interviews one gang leader who's now on the FBI's 10 most wanted fugitives list. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. We begin with pro-Palestinian campus demonstrations entering their second week and growing, it seems, not going away. With spring commencement fast approaching, university officials nationwide are now taking action to confront them. That said, in different ways, with different degrees of success, they're juggling a lot. Freedom of expression, student safety, alumni pressure and, of course, all of it driven by one of the world's truly intractable conflicts. I want to go first to CNN's Ed Lavandera at the University of Texas in Austin, where police just apparently used some pepper spray on some in the crowd within the last hour. Ed, what's the latest where you are? Just explain what's happening around you.",

And once those people were moved off campus, law enforcement officers have now moved away from the scene. And this is what has left of the massive protest scene.There are still a few people here gathered in the exact same spot where much of this protest started earlier in the day. And it was incredibly tense for some time. We saw state troopers once again return here to the campus and circle this area that had been taken over with tents and dozens of students, which they described, Anderson, as a liberated encampment zone in solidarity with what other campuses have been doing as well. And when that happened, with the tents come up, university officials say that they were not going to have any tolerance for any kind of occupation or tents that would signify that this was going to grow into a larger protest, a permanent larger protest here on the on the ground and that's when we saw the state troopers and law enforcement come in and over the course of several hours, systematically just pull protesters one by one, taking them away from the scene here this afternoon. And then there were protesters essentially following law enforcement officers and state troopers trying to force them, chanting at them to get off of campus, pushing them away. And that led to the altercation that you talked about, the pepper spray, as the officers were trying to get those that were arrested onto buses and off of the campus as well as state troopers that - in riot gear that had been brought onto the campus, so another tense day. But I must say it was very different from what we saw last week in the tension and the violence that - violent altercations that we saw take place between protesters and law enforcement. Last week, there were nearly 60 people arrested. All of those criminal charges were dismissed. So it'll be interesting to see what happens with the protesters that were taken into custody here today in Austin. Anderson?",

In fact, they said it was a group that started sending threats to university officials over the weekend, and they're the ones that organized. It was really interesting how this developed.There had been what had been billed as an educational event. There was poetry reading. There was, like, artwork on making protest signs, that sort of thing. And then over here on the steps of the main tower building, there was a silent vigil by professors. And as that happened, all of this kind of quickly developed into an encampment zone. So it almost seemed like a very deliberate kind of strategy and a plan to create this particular moment that we saw on campus today. And that's what university officials say they were not going to put up with. And they also believe that much of this was caused by people who are not students here at the university.",

Those protesters in that encampment area, some of them have already been suspended, as you said. The school, after that 2 PM deadline, started the proceedings to suspend the students. It sounds like they are trying to identify everybody in that encampment, suspend them so they are no longer students. And then at some point - the university clearly does not want to call NYPD in again. When they did that two weeks ago, it kicked off this backlash across the country, so they're trying to avoid that. But once they are no longer students of Columbia, push is going to come to shove at some point, and the question is when, Anderson?",

She refused, apparently, and that's when they took her away and put her in the van.It's not clear if she was arrested. They just took her away. Maybe they let her go a short time later. It's not clear what she was - if she was facing any charges at all, but she wasn't following the police orders, and that's why they let her away. It's not clear how much bigger this protest is going to be. I've walked around the university to see on the other side if there's any protest, but it's very quiet over there. So it looks like we're in this stalemate between protesters and the university. And at some point, push is going to come to shove, they're into finals now. Commencement's in two weeks.

And, of course, notably, we see dozens of students still in the encampment. And Anderson, as your viewers would like to know, today, university president, Minouche Shafik, put out a statement to the protesters in the encampment saying they had until 2 PM to disband. And like I said, there are dozens of students defying the university president's orders and still out on the lawns. And what's interesting to know is that this morning, Minouche Shafik sent an email to the Columbia community at about 8 AM, notifying people that negotiations between the students and the administrators had indeed ended. However, what was not said in the email was that at about 10 AM, the university administration began to drop pamphlets in the encampment notifying students of this 2 PM deadline.

And you are seeing that in the acts that are taking place towards Jewish and Zionist students.

And our administration did nothing about that. And now they're surprised that protests have grown and mushroomed.So I think there's a real question about accountability for everyone. I think it is integral, even though it's sometimes painful and problematic for faculty to have the right to express opinions in a very free way. That's academic freedom.

There are people here trespassing on our property in a way that we don't support and we need your help to remove those people.So that's basically what law enforcement can do, particularly in these private spaces, private universities, things like that. So they're going to come in and try to help disperse the people who are no longer welcome in that space. And they're going to do it by announcing that you have to leave and setting a deadline.

So number one, you need to make sure all the students are safe. I've talked to enough Jewish students to know they feel intimidated and menaced, and there haven't been consequences. So that's number two. If you violate the rules, the administration shouldn't make concessions to you, as we saw happen at Columbia and Northwestern. There needs to be consequences. Again, if you violate the rules, you should be suspended like anyone else. And then number three, no full face masking. I mean, again, I just don't think it's appropriate. And it doesn't impinge upon your freedom of speech, that you shouldn't dress up like an ISIS fighter, right? Like, there's no rule that says the school needs to tolerate students or, again, outside activists dressing like they're in Al Qaeda. A.
