We'll break down the fallout for the president and the political world's reaction. But first, a major showdown in Washington. Any moment now, leaders in the Senate are expected to release the final text of a long-awaited bipartisan deal to address the crisis of the southern border, all part of a massive national security package that has been months in the making, with a key test vote in the Senate by Wednesday. Now, no one has actually laid their eyes on the actual bill yet, but it's already exposed massive fractures in the Republican Party on an issue that Donald Trump wants to campaign on. And President Biden has endorsed the bipartisan Senate deal, but Trump has tried to tank it before seeing it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It was interesting just over the weekend, the Speaker tried to preempt the Senators by saying they're going to move on a standalone Israel bill. Of course, Israel aid, Ukraine aid. It's going to be tied to this massive border package, the Republicans have said for months. The border must be dealt with first. Then we can deal with these other issues.

The House Republicans are throwing cold water on it. What is your reporting telling you about the likelihood that at least 11 Republicans will vote to get to 60 votes?

But the White House is making a calculation that immigration is such an important issue in the election that they're not going to actually lose progressives over this, even if they get angry.

And what I found when I went and talked to many, many voters is just extreme visceral anger at the way Biden has handled this war, not just the refusal to call for a ceasefire, but even his rhetoric, the way he talks about it, what they say is sort of insufficient empathy for Palestinians and Palestinian suffering and what's happening there. But Michigan is a tricky state because you also have strong Jewish neighborhoods as well. But I think it's important to note that his drop in support about how he's handled this war is not just among the Arab and Muslim community where I think it's probably felt most viscerally, most personally. I talk to people who have lost dozens of family members in a single airstrike. One of the interesting things that I also came across was that there are a lot of people of Yemeni and Lebanese descent and the way the conflict is spreading now. Their families are directly impacted because airstrikes are happening in both of those countries.",

He later backed an opponent to Jeff Landry, the man who eventually won. At the same time, a federal judge ordered Louisiana to redraw its congressional districts and add another majority-minority district.The result, the governor has thrown his support behind a plan to carve up Graves' district, turning that into the majority-minority district, and likely dooming Graves' chances there.
