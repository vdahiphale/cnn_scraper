President Biden rolling out sweeping new actions at the U.S.-Mexico border as the president attempts to address one of the biggest challenges facing the United States and his reelection campaign. Biden's new executive actions on immigration allow the government to ban migrants who crossed the border illegally from being able to seek asylum. That's a change to a policy that's been in place for decades. The new rules are expected to go into effect at midnight tonight in the year 2024. During Biden's announcement, President Biden announced -- acknowledged rather that more needs to be done to fully address the border crisis. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, this would allow for authorities to turn migrants back to Mexico or to their origin country with some exceptions for unaccompanied children, among others who may have medical conditions or are victims of severe human trafficking. But look, this is a page from Donald Trumps playbook. He tried to do this exact same thing in 2018, and he was challenged in the courts. And that's exactly what the Biden administration is going to face according to the ACLU. Senior administration officials acknowledged that, but also acknowledged that they need cooperation from Mexico, and we're learning that moments ago, President Biden spoke with Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador about this latest action.

It's part of San Diego County is still and its that hotspot, as you mentioned, especially compared with the rest of the U.S. southern border.And at first, it seemed eerily quiet. And then we started to see folks. We can show you some the images crossing in the early morning hours as the sun was coming up, it was getting increasingly hot in that desert climate. And then they were all coming together to go to Border Patrol, who then process them and put them into vans and take them on into detention centers. But what was really interesting and talking to some of these migrants is, you get a sense I can solve this back last year when Title 42 ended, they cannot base their movements around U.S. policy. For many of them, U.S. policy is just too unpredictable. They don't know what's going to happen with the president, with Congress, with the courts. And so, they're planning day by day on their own terms. And that's really important to keep in mind because you thought perhaps there'd be a surge today. They got word the executive order is coming down and they move along. Not necessarily the case. It could come later on. But even folks, let me show you where we are here, you got folks who are still coming in. Now this is one of the few portions of the border wall when you've got two barriers, essentially, the U.S. territory is in-between between these two walls. And so these folks right here are already in the U.S. about 25 of them came in from India.

A state has three main conditions, defined territory which the Palestinians don't have, government that effectively controls the people, which does not exist, and sovereignty which does not exist.

Summers is now warning that under a second possible Trump presidency, Trump's economic plans, including extending the tax cuts, increasing tariffs, deporting migrants, he says now that that would make inflation even worse than it is.He told \"The Atlantic,\" quote, there has never been a presidential platform, so self-evidently inflationary as the one put forward by President Trump. What do you make of that? O'LEARY: Well, its very interesting large brush comment. But I like to get into policy because that's what matters. Let's take one that's been floated in the last few days, which I find very interesting. ANWR has been discussed. ANWR is one of the largest resources of oil in the world, hasn't been touched just yet. We have massive debt. We've got a lot of government printing money. You just detail that. How do we stop that? Well, let's take a lesson from Norway or from Canada. What they did back in the '70s when they found similar oil, in Norway's case, offshore, they said let's put a royalty on every barrel, and use it specifically to reduce the country's debt and then build a giant endowment fund that assures the wealth and the ongoing wellness of people in Norway. They did that by putting law in place. The Canadians didn't. They squandered their wealth. They discovered the same amount of oil almost down to the last hundred thousand barrels. And they let the government just freighter it away over 30, 40, 50 years. Now, if we did the same thing in ANWR and that policy is on the table and we said the only use of that royalty, off those barrels, the only use as written by Congress is to pay off national debt. It would take a huge chunk of the national debt away and we would be the largest self-sufficient, energy secured nation on Earth, supplying all the Asian coast from Alaska energy. This would be a great policy. Now, I don't know which president is going to put it in place, but it is a gift to the American people. That ANWR has not been touched yet. It could solve a massive amount of problems. I would argue to you whether you're Democrat or whether you're a Republican or an independent, this is a good idea. Let's borrow it from Norway and do it their way, not the way the Canadians did it and solve a massive amount of our debt problem. I bet you that sells as an idea. Which candidate wants to do it.
