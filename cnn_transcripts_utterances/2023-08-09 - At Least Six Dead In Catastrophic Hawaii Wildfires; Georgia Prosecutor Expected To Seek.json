So what it's doing is it's putting the squeeze right on the Hawaiian Islands and allowing those winds out of the east to gust. Well, we just checked, over 40 miles per hour in some of those locations. That's going to obviously complicate fire efforts.But look at the aerial video that you're seeing on your screens right now. This is imperative because the -- the fire that impacted the west side of Maui, the -- the location, the economic hub of Miami where all the resorts and businesses are generally located, where people go as tourists to visit. Well, the fire ran out of room to burn, literally moving into the ocean as it literally had nothing else to char. But it was just incredibly harrowing moments. There were adjectives used like dire and apocalyptic and you can see exactly why with some of these first aerial visuals that we are getting. Now, everyone in Hawaii knows how to handle a hurricane, everyone knows how to handle a volcano as well, as difficult as it can be. But this caught people off guard. As a meteorologist, we were watching Hurricane Dora slide well south of the island chain. It wasn't a concern for us. We thought it was fish food, literally not impacting land. But the fact is that it created a phenomenon with the winds that no one could have foreseen and it caught people off guard in the middle of the night when people were sleeping. So you can imagine just how terrifying those moments were overnight when we started to see those little flashpoints, the little hotspots on satellite imagery that meteorologists look at, we started to see those flare up and that was a concern and we immediately started to recognize that there was a problem. Social media videos start pouring in and then we start to learn about the communications going down, 911 not becoming available for residents over the western side of the island of Maui. Think how concerning and how terrifying those moments must have been for people not being able to reach out for help. Well, that's what people had to endure. Jake, it's terrifying.",

So on Maui County, we have about 39 personnel assisting the Maui Police Department with traffic control and roving security. But right now, the number one goal for both counties and the Hawaii National Guard is to protect lives. And by setting up these roadblocks, that's right now one of the best ways we can do it. So the National Guard is assisting both police departments who have been working 24 hours and are running out of personnel to do it. So the Hawaii National Guard is assisting them, and I think they're even requesting more personnel for the very near future. The Hawaii National Guard is also sending two Chinook CH47 helicopters to Maui. They're on the ground right now getting their assignment to head to their upcountry area of Maui on the slopes of Haleakala to assist with the fire suppression up there. They'll be carrying 4,000 gallon water buckets and be able to do drops about four to five an hour.

So you could see why they would want to keep that quiet.In terms of what's coming next for the fourth indictment and what could be different, I'll say on the media front, one of the things we've been tracking a lot is the public's attention to all of these different legal challenges and indictments. And one of the things we found is that it just continues to wane. And that's also reflected in Donald Trump's finances.

Out of Georgia, we are expecting Donald Trump to face his fourth indictment next week. He is expecting that as well. And yet in most 2024 polls, he's tied with Joe Biden. Or it's at least within the margin of error. Why? SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA): Well, look, I'm not a great political pundit here, but Donald Trump is going to do what Donald Trump does. And there are people who know that they're going to cheer him on over the indictments and everything else. But at the end of the day, Joe Biden is the leader our nation needs, and he's delivering. He's delivering on the economy. He's delivering internationally, and he makes America a stronger, safer place. And I think come November 2024, there were 7 million more people who believed that Joe Biden would be the right leader. And I think it's going to be even back in 2020, I think it's going to be even bigger than that in 2024.",

President has been out there fighting to get rid of junk fees, and there are a lot of them that have fallen away.

There are going to be child care centers across this country that just closed. And that's going to have a terrible economic consequence because that's a lot of mamas and daddies who can't go to work, who can't work a full shift because they can't get adequate child care.So we are urging Tina Smith and I and others to say, as the President is talking about emergency funding for Ukraine, emergency funding for the various problems that we've seen so far, the key one that we should also be focused on in our economy is child care. We need to make sure that care doesn't just fall over a cliff, and we need to put in the kind of federal resources to support that. That's what we need to do in the short term. But I just want to say, Jake, long term, America needs to make an investment in child care. This is early childhood education. This is investing in our children. You know where America stands among the 37 richest nations in the world, we're number 33. Think about that. Mexico spends more per child on their children than we do in the United States. Romania spends more on their children than we do in the United States. We want to build a strong future. We need to invest in child care. We want parents to work. We need to invest in child care.",

Honestly, I know Democrats are more in favor of social program spending than Republicans in general, but this problem doesn't go away when Democrats control all three branches.It consistently goes on.

And yet investing in our children is how we build a future. You know, we understood this once as a nation. We started investing in public schools and we started at kindergarten because we believed back then that kids zero to five weren't learning anything.But we made that investment in public schools because we believe that's how America will build a future. We'll have a better educated workforce. We'll have more people who will be more creative, who will invent more things. What we've now learned is those babies zero to five, they are learning. And they need to be in places with lots of well trained teachers and bright colors and big words and playing with each other so they're ready for school. We have learned that every dollar we spend on a child in those preschool years saves us $7 later on that we don't have to spend because children are struggling in school or having trouble when they're out of school. Those are investments we need to make long term. Investing in our children is investing in our future. And by golly, it's time for us to stand up and say so.",

One of the things, as you know, I've spent a lot of my time in Congress working on is how we bring just more ethics and more oversight in general to everything that we do in government.Look at, we've got a United States Supreme Court where people take gifts and don't even report them, even though the law requires them to report, and that they somehow think that is all right. It is not all right. But we don't have a set of ethics that apply to the Supreme Court. We have a problem with the revolving door. People who come into government from industry and then they write regulations for the people they used to work with, and then they leave government and go back to working for that same industry and cashing in on their time in government service, selling off their access to our elected officials. I understand that it is hard for Republicans and Democrats and Independents to say, we've got to have a set of ethics that apply to everyone. And that means we've got to be willing to say to our friends and people who are not our friends the same rules apply across the board. And we got to shut down the revolving door. We got to have ethics rules that apply to everyone. That's what we got to do, both to make government function better, but also so the American people can have confidence in their government.

I'll read you part of a disturbing post the suspect allegedly wrote. He wrote, I hear Biden is coming to Utah digging out my old Ghille suit, That's a reference to a tire, a camouflaged attire worn by snipers, and cleaning the dust off the M24 sniper rifle.Now, Biden is indeed expected to be in Utah this afternoon. Of course, that type of post very concerning for federal law enforcement. This investigation actually began back in March when a social media company saw a concerning post online regarding Alvin Bragg, the district attorney in New York. They contacted the FBI. That's when this investigation got started. One of those posts the suspect allegedly wrote, heading to New York to fulfill my dream of eradicating another George Soros two-but political hach DA. I'll be waiting in the courthouse parking garage with my suppressed Smith and Wesson 9 millimeter to smoke a radical fool prosecutor that should never have been elected. Now he goes on in graphic detail to talk about killing Bragg. We're not going to bring you those wild details. It's interesting, Jake. The FBI at one point had approached this suspect. He was under surveillance. They described him as wearing a dark suit. He had a Donald Trump hat on. He had a lapel pin of an AR-15. They confronted him about these concerning posts, and the suspect allegedly told them that, look, this was all a dream. He told FBI agents, you come back when you have a warrant. That they did this morning, showing up at 6:15 a.m. The shooting occurred. That suspect now dead. The circumstances of that FBI shooting very much under investigation at this hour, Jake.",
