Yes.In every one of these counties, even the ones that are red, Andy Beshear, at the moment, 56 percent of the vote in.

But if you're Andy Beshear at the moment, you're looking at this map. You're winning those two counties out there I told you about you know, Trump won. Andy Beshear won. Can he hold them? He's holding them. He's adding to his wins out here. More blue counties than he had last time at the moment, he should do it.

How are things going in the country today? Badly say nearly three- quarters of respondents in this poll, 72 percent, things are going badly in the country today. Only 28 percent say they're going well. Again, that astonishing number on whether or not Biden has the stamina and sharpness to serve effectively as president, only 25 percent of poll respondents say that he does have the stamina, 74 percent say no. And I know you're a history buff like I am, and so look here on this chart of where Biden's modern day predecessors were in their approval rating at this point in their presidency.

And so this is the entire state. And you see the green is yes. All right, these are more rural areas. But so again, let's bring up the same comparison. Take a look at it. You bring up the -- the suburban counties. That's a lot of green, right? This is the American suburbs, just like in Kansas. The Kansas City suburbs in Kansas, the Topeka suburbs, that was the first vote after the Dobbs decision.In a very red state, suburban voters in Kansas who vote Republican for President, who vote Republican for a lot of things said no, on this issue. Suburban voters in Ohio who vote Republican on a lot of things, right, let's -- let's just circled some of these counties. Let's do this. That one's democratic. But watch this. Now, you're going to see -- you're going to see some blue in here. Let's come up here. You're going to see some blue in here for Joe Biden in 2020. But you're also going to see something else.",

Right, here's the question. I mean, I'm not going to your state, not your Commonwealth, not tonight. This is Commonwealth night, though.So as you come back to Ohio, you come back to issue one. And you see this in the suburbs, we see it in Kentucky. We see it in Ohio. Does it happen in Virginia? That is the question. If we can slide over here, then we just look, we're waiting for these results to come in, right? Here's the current balance of power, right? You have, you know, Republicans up narrowly in the House of Delegates, you have Democrats up narrowly in the State Senate. And so then you come -- let's just use the Senate map, this is what we're looking at now. Redrawn districts, this is the state of play. We don't have a live data feed from Virginia because of legislative races. But where are the key races? The key races are up here in the Washington suburbs and down here in the Richmond suburbs. So if the pattern continues, that's what we're looking for, or has Governor Youngkin with the 15-week proposal, found a middle ground that stops the momentum of the abortion right forces. It seems to be working Kentucky tonight. It looks like it's working in Ohio tonight. Here's test number three. Still to be answered.",

Right now, we have 82% of the vote in, in Kentucky. So right now Governor Beshear is maintaining that. So obviously extremely solidly that he has right now, 82% of the vote in and we're getting the Biden campaign's reaction to tonight's results so far.I want to go straight to our Senior White House Correspondent MJ Lee. MJ, obviously, these are in several crucial states, very specific races, but ones that could be hugely significant. So how closely is the President watching them?",

And here is why, a central part of their argument for the last several months at all the debates, including the one here tomorrow night has been that Trump can't win, that Trump cannot beat Joe Biden.Well, the poll numbers and just the overall sense of the sour mood of the country now are essentially have a race that argument or certainly watered down that argument for Republican candidates. So in a nutshell, Erin, the weakness of President Biden has helped President Trump. I talked to a senior adviser to a Republican candidate tonight and said that Biden's pain has been Trump's gain. And this advisor was not being glib. They said this simply has been a fact of life of this campaign that Biden's weakness has built up President Trump. So this is something that we'll see tomorrow night at the debate here tomorrow, Erin. BURNETT: Right. Thank you, and I'm sorry to interrupt you, but I do want to get to Jake. Because I know, Jake, we've got to keep projection in a crucial race tonight.",

CNN is projecting that Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, a Democrat has been reelected, it says a very significant win for Democrats. Beshear, who ran as a defender of abortion rights in a largely Republican Commonwealth, Kentucky, is defeating Republican Attorney General Daniel Cameron. Again, incumbent Democrat, Andy Beshear, has won a second term as governor in ruby red, Kentucky.Let's go to Eva McKend now who is in Louisville at Beshear headquarters. Eva McKend, I have to say, not only are we calling it for Beshear, it's not even 9 p.m. yet. Big, big win for the incumbent Democratic governor in red Kentucky.",

But they did not think that it would be called this early. They say that it's really a testament to the strategy that the governor employed. He's well known, well liked in this state. But he often emphasized an inclusive strategy of reaching out in the final weeks of this campaign to voters that are often described as forgotten voters. And he was at the helm during several natural disasters in this state as well as the pandemic.I spoke to a woman today and she told me, you know, during the pandemic, he took care of us.

I mean, I think when you talk to Democrats who are running on issues and in campaigns across the country, every single one of these races is different in a certain way. And each one of these candidates has to be, as both parties will say the right fit for their state, their district, their, you know -- their geography, and also navigate these issues. I think that's what Andy Beshear did very well.He identified abortion as an issue that he was being attacked on, but that he could also go on offense on. He had some -- some significant issues in his state in terms of a mass shooting that he performed, I think, very well in terms of dealing with it on a national platform. And those things helped him. He's also well liked. He happens to also have a very well-known family. All of those things, help him playing those things to your advantage help. But you didn't see him here, hugging Joe Biden, hugging national Democrats, even hugging just a national narrative in his state. I don't think you're going to see a lot of that, frankly, from either party in this coming cycle. Because the poll -- what the polls have really show us is that both parties at a national level are particularly toxic in this country.",
