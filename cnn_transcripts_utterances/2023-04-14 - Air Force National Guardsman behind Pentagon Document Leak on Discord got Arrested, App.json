The FBI has arrested 21-year old Massachusetts Air National Guardsman Jack Teixeira, who will appear in a Boston courtroom in the coming hours.The Air Force says his job was to help make sure the military's vast global communications network was working properly. A government source tells CNN, Teixeira had been under surveillance for several days before his arrest, and multiple U.S. officials say he is believed to be the leader of the online check group where the classified documents were posted. Now, the damaging leaks and Teixeira's arrest have prompted the Pentagon to tighten access to classified intelligence. CNN's Kylie Atwood reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Dramatic overhead video of a 21-year old airman in the Massachusetts National Guard, being arrested outside of his relative's home. Suspect, Jack Teixeira, taken into U.S. custody in connection with leaked classified documents that have recently appeared on social media sites. MERRICK GARLAND, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: FBI agents took Teixeira into custody earlier this afternoon, without incident. He will have an initial appearance at the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. ATWOOD (voice-over): The arrest comes exactly a week after President Biden and other senior U.S. leaders, including the Secretary of Defense were briefed on the leak, unleashing a fast moving search by the US government to identify the culprit. He was under surveillance for at least a couple of days before his arrest, according to the U.S. government source. JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: There is a full-blown investigation going on. ATWOOD (voice-over): The documents were leaked on Discord, a chat and messaging platform often used by gamers. \"The Washington Post\" spoke with a member of the group who met the leaker online about four years ago and had seen the posted classified documents on Discord.",

He talked abouthow Ireland has helped provide refuge for people who have fled Ukraine, but certainly there have -- this is not a trip that is, has a main policy objective. This is really a personal trip for President Biden, a homecoming of sorts, and you saw that over the course of the day yesterday as he walked in to the Irish Parliament. He said in the Irish language that he felt like he was at home and he felt so comfortable speaking to those lawmakers. In fact, he received such a warm welcome, and it is such a difference than he sometimes receives in the American Congress back in Washington. The president really kind of letting his guard down at certain moments, talking about things that he isn't necessarily talking about when he's back home. And the most interesting one to me was when he referenced his age. He said he was at the end of his career, and he said his age lent him some perspective and some wisdom. So, certainly, President Biden receiving a very warm welcome here in Ireland. And as you mentioned, he will be heading out later today to explore another side of his family ancestry, his paternal side. He'll be out in County Mayo hill. He's expected to speak in front of quite a -- quite a large crowd in the town of Ballina, in front of a cathedral that actually does have a family connection. His Great-great-great grandfather sold the bricks to that cathedral in order to pay for his passage to the United States.
