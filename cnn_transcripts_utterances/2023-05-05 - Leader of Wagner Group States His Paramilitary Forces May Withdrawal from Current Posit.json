      "sentences": "The fact that they are saying they will leave in five days. They have never said that before. They have threatened that they might compromise their position. For about almost a week now, we have been seeing these messages from Yevgeny Prigozhin, and it's comes after people had thought perhaps his long-term rift as the head of the Wagner mercenary group with the Russian defense ministry establishment, the ministry, the top brass, might have begun to be healing.He has long been complaining they haven't got the artillery shells they need to keep their positions, but this is utterly stark. That expletive-laden video, he's done that before in front of corpses to try and ask for more ammunition, but quite a different tone. But this would be, frankly, a staggering gift to the Ukrainian forces if, indeed, Wagner was able to pull its forces back. Withdrawing from a city like this under fire is exceptionally difficult in the best of times, particularly in this case it might appear if the Russian defense establishment didn't want you to pull your forces back. So how and when this happens mid next week will be particularly complex and interesting to see play out. But it is, as I say, a gift to the Ukrainian forces, informationally alone ahead of that counteroffensive. For Russia to be saying it's going to pull what may be about half of its forces back from this key symbolic city that has been slogged over brutally over the entire winter, it's extraordinary. What is that going to do to Russian morale, even the suggestion that it needs to happen. This information float out across Russia's front lines, Russian troops will hear it, and they will begin to wonder quite what's happening at the heart of the Kremlin. I should hold out, point out here, Yevgeny Prigozhin has made false statements in the past and tried to play sides off each other, but this is remarkable. And it's a second sign of extraordinary weakness at the heart of the Kremlin after they had to admit, or chose to admit that drones had attacked the Kremlin just 48 hours ago. Now their military is seen as having an extraordinary rift. And you have to wonder quite what is going through Vladimir Putin's mind ahead of Wednesday's important Victory Day celebrations, next week's important Victory Day celebrations.

Judicial activist Leonard Leo advises a network of conservative non-profits, including the Judicial Education Project. So he wanted Kellyanne Conway to give Ginni Thomas, quote, \"another 25k\" with, quote, no mention of Ginni, of course. On that day Conway's company billed the Judicial Education Project for $25,000. That money was for Ginni Thomas. It's unclear exactly what she did for Conway's polling company or for the Judicial Education Project, but that non-profit did file a brief in Shelby versus Holder in 2012 where the court invalidated key parts of the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965.

I always have to state, had I done this with documents when I was in the federal government, I would likely be in prison. It is a breach beyond what anybody in senior government should be doing.

They discovered 21-year-old Carlos Dominguez at a local park where that second homicide took place. The first homicide happened last Thursday, where a man was stabbed at a park near U.C. Davis. The second one happened on Saturday where U.C. Davis student was killed at a different park and then on Monday, a third stabbing took place that woman is in critical condition, and this happened in New York Campus. Now, when police were asked, if when he was discovered, if he was potentially searching for his next victim. They said they don't know but they did find a large knife on him. Another interesting and very disturbing note to add is that he is a former U.C. Davis student as of last week, he was apparently a junior who separated in their terms from the university due to academic reasons. And that happened two days before the first murder took place.

What if it was the black homeless man who had choked to death, a white Marine, because he was scared, we probably having this conversation with him with charter sitting on Rikers Island. And so, we want to make sure that the laws are being applied properly. We also want to make sure that we are continuing to respect the humanity of homeless people who have mental health issues, like Jordan Neely.We have a situation where that is not what is what is happening. We're spending more time feeding the fear, as you mentioned, the statistics bear something else out. But you want people to be safe and feel safe. And if you're not feeling safe, that is the real thing that we have to address. But we have to say you cannot choke people to death on the train. And that doesn't seem to be coming from our top executive leaders. And that's very concerning to me.",
