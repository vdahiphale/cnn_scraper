So we can see countries around the world showing their frustration with Israel not allowing enough humanitarian aid trucks into Gaza and also the safe distribution. And they are looking for other ways in which to get the aid in. Now, there is a ship you can see there. This is just off the coast of Larnaca in Cyprus.And this is a ship that was supposed to set sail yesterday. It has about three, sorry, 200 tons of food on board to be able to take to Gaza. Now, the Cypriot government officials said that it was put on hold for some time. There were practical issues that had to be resolved. They have now been resolved. And you can see that ship moving very slowly towards Gaza. Now, this is another area where countries are going to try and get their food in. We've heard from government officials in Cyprus that even before this particular ship set sail, there were many countries inquiring as to whether or not there would be more, whether this maritime corridor would be able to be used consistently. We also know that the U.S. is in the process of bringing equipment to the area so that they can actually build a temporary floating pier. Now, the U.S. has been at pains to say they will not have U.S. boots on the ground in Gaza, so they will not have personnel actually on the ground, but they will have some kind of structure to be able to take the goods from the ship to those who need it on the beach because, of course, the ports themselves, there is a Gaza port. It has been damaged in the airstrikes over recent months. So this is another way that countries are trying to prevent famine. Something that the World Food Programme head has warned is imminent if the amount of aid does not increase exponentially. Now, she did say, Cindy McCain also, that there needs to be at least 300 trucks a day getting in via the land crossing to parts of Gaza to try and stave off this famine. Bear in mind, before October 7th, there were some 500 trucks a day that were getting into the Gaza Strip, and that was before there was a humanitarian catastrophe. Rosemary.",

He says he doesn't believe the criminal case against Trump is a witch-hunt, as the former president has claimed. But Butler says he believes Americans should know the truth about his ex-boss. CNN's Katelyn Polantz has details from West Palm Beach, Florida. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SR. CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER: Brian Butler is Trump Employee 5 in the criminal indictment of the former president brought by the special counsel's office. That indictment accuses Donald Trump of maintaining classified records, mishandling them at his Mar-a-Lago estate. And the reason that Brian Butler is so pivotal in that indictment is that he heard things and he saw things. One of the things that he saw, he's now saying publicly to CNN, he previously told investigators about, that is June 3rd, 2022. That's the day that the FBI and the Justice Department visited Mar-a-Lago to get a hold of all of the classified records that Trump wasn't turning back over to the federal government, putting them back into the federal government's possession after he left the presidency. On that day, when the FBI and Justice Department visited Mar-a-Lago to pick up everything, that was a day that boxes of classified documents essentially went out the back door. Brian Butler spoke about Walt Nauta, the body man to Donald Trump, spoke about him to Kaitlan Collins, about how Nauta asked him oddly to borrow an Escalade, a car that later was used to move boxes, and that Brian Butler used that car at the airport here in Palm Beach to take boxes and put them on the plane. Here's a little more from that. BRIAN BUTLER, FORMER MAR-A-LAGO EMPLOYEE: And then what happened is Walt left before me and he never goes directly to the plane. He's either in the motorcade when he goes there with the boss, the former president. And I remember telling him he left the club with, I didn't know what he had in his vehicle, but he waited for me at a nearby business. And I told him I would tell him when I was leaving Mar-a-Lago. So I left Mar-a-Lago. I texted him, hey, I'm on my way. He followed me. He pulled out and got behind me. We got to the airport. I ended up loading all the luggage I had, and he had a bunch of boxes.",

Two times he had suspicious conversations with Carlos de Oliveira that are now part of the Trump indictment, that piece of paper that the Justice Department has taken through a grand jury and will try to get a conviction from whenever they take this case to trial.

Potentially they are accused of wanting to delete them, those surveillance tapes of them moving boxes.

And it's also been confirmed in the last couple of hours that authorities in Chile will open an investigation into exactly what occurred on that airplane. They will be supported by authorities here in New Zealand. As we know, it's been a difficult start to the year for Boeing. Of course, they had issues with a flight, an Alaska Airlines flight on the west coast of the United States when part of the aircraft appeared to come off or detach during mid-flight. We've spoken to local experts here in New Zealand today. They say what could have happened in this case was an issue with the autopilot. That has happened to other flights in this part of the world. In 2008, there was a malfunction with a Qantas flight in Australia. That was back in 2008. And 70 people were injured. Speaking to people today, there is a real sense of fear over what's occurred. That sort of still feels surreal to them. They weren't sure whether they were going to make it through this incident. Obviously, they have. They were very glad to make it here back onto safe ground in Auckland. But of course, they, along with the rest of us here in this part of the world, now search for answers as to exactly what has happened. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Gunmen on motorcycles stormed their school in the country's northwest on Thursday and forced them into a nearby forest.Police say a few students were rescued, but at least 287 are still being held. The government says it's doing everything it can to bring the students home safely and making progress. Ever since the mass kidnapping of the Chibok schoolgirls by Boko Haram nearly a decade ago, Nigeria has been grappling with bandits using the same tactic and demanding ransoms. Former CNN anchor Isha Sesay joins me now from New York. She's also the author of \"Beneath the Tamarind Tree, a story of courage, family and the lost schoolgirls of Boko Haram\".

And you broke the story when it happened and have written a book about it. Now here we are again with nearly 300 students abducted from their school in northwest Nigeria.

We know in quite eerily familiar fashion, having read some of the accounts of some of the kids who were able to escape, that suddenly they were surrounded by men on motorbikes who started shooting, herding them into groups and forcing them out of the school compound.The understanding is that they were marched into the surrounding forest, which is eerily similar to what happened to the Chibok girls back in 2014, where the same thing. But in this case, clearly identified as Islamic militants stormed their school in the middle of the night, herded them off, set fire to their school and marched them into the forest. And as of yet, no accounts of these almost 300 children aged between eight and 15, by all accounts having been rescued or having been returned to their loved ones. So just a lot of heartbreak, a lot of heartbreak from a devastated community.",

And I actually spoke to one today.And we were talking about it and the fact that we're approaching the 10-year anniversary. And I asked how she felt. And she expressed great sadness that her sisters, and they all refer to themselves as part of a sisterhood, are still in captivity. But I will tell you something which shouldn't surprise many. It is that of some of the young women who have escaped in recent years, and now the count is roughly 98 are unaccounted for. We don't know whether all of them are alive, but we know 98 remain unaccounted for. Of some of the ones who escaped most recently, the conversation that is emerging and what I was told today, and only by one individual, is that of some of the women who remain with their captors, they don't want to come back. And then there are those who this young woman also told me, who felt that even if they could escape, they are in such remote places, they wouldn't even know where to go. They're sort of lost in the wilderness. So it has taken on an even more heartbreaking context, this entire story, which I continue to follow, and continues to devastate me and their families, really, when you hear those details, such as I did today.",

You can see that the buildings are made out of bamboo, covered in mud and people's handprints they put on the wall as decoration.But it's also, of course, incredibly poor, and everyone here is essentially in debt to a local landowner. And they have to work night and day, seven days a week, just to pay off that loan and to survive. KOSHILA SADAY, BONDED LABORER (through translator): We are bonded to work for our landlord. The whole family is working for the landlord. We work for him and our children also work for him. We also want for our children to get proper education and for them to be able to earn and take care of themselves. CHANCE (voice-over): A London-based NGO called the Freedom Fund has been working with the Harawa Charawa for more than a decade. They've helped the community organize and advocate for their rights. In 2022, the Haro-Wacharoa received a major victory, Nepal's prime minister announcing the liberation of the Haro-Wacharoa people. It marked the first time the government formally acknowledged the issue of bonded labor affecting them. Still, despite the declarations, progress has been slow. LEGENDRA SADAY, GENERAL SECRETARY, NATIONAL HARAWA CHARAWA RIGHTS FORUM (through translator): From the day the government announced our freedom, we have been facing more serious problems. People like us now have nowhere to go to look for work and we are compelled to go back to the landlord to ask for work. When we go there asking for work, the landlord now chases away with sticks.",

What do you say to those who accuse you and people like you, landowners in this area, of basically being slave owners, of using and exploiting these people for your benefit? You don't agree? Why? That's what you're doing? KRISHNA DEV YADAV, LANDOWNER (through translator): I tell them to go back home and stay there. I encourage them to go home and their children will provide them medicine and that they will take good care of you. But they don't go. They say they'll die if they go home. So what can I do? They are staying here on their own will. They have no pressure whatsoever to continue to stay with me and work for me. CHANCE (voice-over): But for Phuletiys and Koshila, it's a dilemma. Their concern, like that of so many parents around the world, has less to do with their own future than their children's. Their hope is that with education and organization, the death that should have been worked off generations ago won't be shouldered by the next. Matthew Chance, CNN, Nepal. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
