These are the stories we are following: Millions of people sweltering across the world in record breaking temperatures. Just look at that heat map. The police unleashed teargas and water cannons on anti-tax protesters in Kenya. And a New York law is now restricting social media companies using addictive algorithms on teenagers. It is unclear how the state can or indeed will enforce it. Live from New York, it is Thursday, it is June 20th. I'm Richard Quest and in New York, as elsewhere, I mean business. Good evening. It is the longest day of the year in the northern hemisphere. The official start of summer, if you will. Authorities around the world are facing a long season of climate-related disruptions. Look at that graph. The height, the heat, and the records that are being broken. In Italy, firefighters are battling flames near Naples, as the country is facing the peak of a heatwave. Serbia is warning people not to venture outside as winds from North Africa are pushing a hot front over the region. And in the United States, there were fires and floods. The governor of the state of New Mexico is asking for a major disaster declaration from the federal government as they fight deadly fires, and Tropical Storm Alberto is bringing flooding to Texas and Mexico. Let's show you two versions and visions of this. Ed Lavandera is in New Mexico. Rosa Flores is in Texas. Rosa, you're up to your knees in water. What is going on?",

It is eating streets. It is running under this building. Now, buildings here on the coast are built this way for this reason. They are on pilings sometimes because whenever there are storms, there is usually surge, plus high tide, and it equals scenes like the ones that you're looking at here behind me. Now, I'm in Corpus Christi in an area called North Beach. Here to my right, there is a residential area about a mile away. The streets look like the street that you're looking at right now, and we have video of the Texas A&amp;M Task Force, one team, heading into this neighborhood going door-to-door, asking people if they wanted to evacuated, if they needed to leave their homes because the streets around here, Richard, look like what you are seeing around me.

We are a business program. You and I talk business every night. So let's put it into that context. Nowhere are we seeing this more than with orange juice. The frozen concentrate as it is known as. Its prices have nearly doubled in the last few years due to supply constraints. Severe heat and drought have decimated production in Brazil, which interestingly is the world's largest orange exporter. So the orange juice itself is becoming more and more expensive, or the concentrate is. And now, of course, we've got -- if your oranges are expensive, what you now want to maybe put a bit of mango in there or maybe a bit a grapefruit. You could add some apple. In other words, throw in some pears -- all of these could either be substitutes or potential additions to the orange juice to help keep the prices under control. But what happened to the farmers? Well, Tony Marquez is the owner of the Pearson Ranch in California. He grows oranges, pomelos and other citrus fruits. Tony, you are feeling the effect, don't you, of this higher price for concentrate? But are you also feeling the downside which is the drought, the disease that is pushing up the price of orange juice in places like Brazil?",

So that is a huge number of loss in oranges, and a lot of that due to the Asian citrus psyllid and the HLB, or citrus greening disease.",

These people on the streets here are young people who some of -- many of whom voted for President William Ruto. They feel that government has betrayed his stated mission as a hustler-in-chief. He came into power as somebody who understood the plight to the common man. You've talked to him. You know how much he is passionate about these issues, but he is also faced with something that you will understand. Kenya has a massive debt hole, and he is going to generate internal revenue, and the only way to generate that revenue is by raising taxes. His proposed finance bill was deeply unpopular, it is so unpopular that he was forced to make a big about turn and drop some key parts of that law. But these people are not impressed. They don't want piecemeal changes. They don't want small changes to the finance bill. They don't want small amendments. They want the entire bill rejected. And they have been out here on the streets of Nairobi throughout the day trying to occupy Parliament. Police have held them back. They have been largely peaceful. They survived teargas, they survived water cannon, and now, as the night has worn on, they have because a bit more rowdy, at least in this section, pulling away streetlights, lighting a fire, becoming more agitated because the finance bill went through a procedural motion. It goes to a committee of the full House on Tuesday where it is likely to advance. Part of the reason here is because President Ruto's government has a majority in the National Assembly and the Senate, so he can push this through despite the public opposition to this law, and that is the anger you see on the streets here -- Richard.",

We'll look to the future. And we bid farewell to one of Hollywood's great leading men, Donald Sutherland. Only after the news headlines. This is CNN, and on this network, the news always comes first. A senior White House official says Ukraine has jumped to the top of the list for U.S. air defense deliveries. The official described the policy adjustment as extraordinary. It's unclear which countries were given lesser priority. Ukraine's civilian infrastructure has come under relentless attack from Russian airstrikes. Mark Rutte, the outgoing Dutch Prime Minister, appears set to become NATO's next secretary general. NATO officials are telling CNN that the Romanian president will no longer seek the job. He was the only other candidate running. The current leader of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, plans to step down when his term ends in October. The U.S. Supreme Court issued opinions today, but not on some of the most closely watched cases before it. With the court's summer recess rapidly approaching, justices have yet to rule on whether Former President Trump can claim immunity from prosecution. That's a decision that could prove to have major impact on the election later this year. The Bank of England's held interest rates steady, even though U.K. inflation eased last month to 2 percent. The bank's benchmark rate remains at 5.25, where it's been for the last ten months. So, why didn't it cut? The main culprit is services inflation, which was nearly 6 percent last month. And some economists think the bank will wait for that number to come down before further cuts are announced. James Smith is the developed markets economist at ING. I'm guessing you weren't surprised at the announcement, most people that were expecting. But here's -- they seem to be doing a fad. They seem to be doing -- saying, look, it's good, it's the right direction, but we're not confident yet.",
