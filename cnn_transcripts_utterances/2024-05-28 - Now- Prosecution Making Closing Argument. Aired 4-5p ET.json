      "sentences": "And welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper.Donald Trump's hush money trial is in its final phase as the prosecution is in the midst of giving its closing arguments. Court will be back from break at any moment. The prosecution has been arguing that President Trump, quote, corrupted those around him, and he got them to lie and covered up, unquote. Trump picked Michael Cohen as his fixer, the prosecution says, quote, because he was willing to lie and cheat for Donald Trump. This follows nearly three hours of closing arguments from Trump's defense attorney Todd Blanche, who attacked Michael Cohen using Trump like nicknames, calling him the GLOAT, not the GOAT, the GLOAT, the greatest liar of all time. He also said that Michael Cohen is, quote, literally like an MVP of liars and added, quote, I don't know how many lies is enough lies to reject Mr. Cohen's testimony, unquote. But one of the last things that jury heard from Todd Blanche, the defense attorney, was Blanche bringing up the prospect of Trump going to prison. You're not allowed to do that. And that did not fly with the prosecution or Judge Juan Merchan who called it outrageous and suggested that the mentioned a prison time was part of an effort to elicit sympathy for the defendant. CNN's Paula Reid is outside the Manhattan courthouse. Paula, let's discuss the defense in one sec, but first, what are we hearing so far from the prosecution? I guess Mr. Steinglass is about an hour 40 in. He thinks he's about a third of the way done. But what is his message been so far? PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. And that timing is likely something done of the jurors wanted to hear means it could be a late night for them, but they started off their closing by assuring the jury that they just need to tune out the noise and that prosecutors have receipts to support the charges that they have brought in this case. But before they get the documents at the heart of this case, they had to deal with some of the \"it\" that has been brought up during the course of this trial, starting with the testimony of Stormy Daniels. They acknowledged that she does not like the defendant and there were parts of her testimony that likely made the jurors uncomfortable. Then they moved on to their key witness, Michael Cohen and look as many commentators have said, no prosecutor, their right mind would call Michael Cohen voluntarily, and the prosecutors told the jury, they said, look, we didn't pick him at the witness store. This is our witness. But they suggested that the defenses argument that this case relies on the testimony of Michael Cohen they said that is deflection and instead they characterized him as being a tour guide who just merely should walk the jury through all of the evidence. After they were done with that, they began chronologically. Prosecutors went back way, back to 2015, and so far Jake, they've been focused on the conspiracy, where they charged the falsifying business records as a felony because they've argued that this was all part of a conspiracy to suppress negative stories about Trump to help him win the White House in 2016. So, the past hour has really we focus on that, talking about this catch and kill effort and how catching and killing some of these stories that these were the biggest contributions that a campaign ever received. But as Steinglass said, he still has served more hours to go.",

It's a great firm. You have my business, So let me -- let me just start with you, Tim, because the prosecution has called out Trump's attorney for what they say is an inconsistency. They said this, quote, Blanche said Michael Cohen stole $60,000 because it was grossed up. So that means that defendant is trying to have it both ways, right? Donald Trump is trying to have it both ways they're saying. They're denying the 420,000 was a reimbursement at all, claiming payment for legal services rendered in 2016. But if that's true then there was no theft. He's getting paid for legal services in 2017. They can call him a thief and claim this wasn't really reimbursement, but not both. So first of all, this -- you really need to know a lot about this case that you have any idea what the hell they're talking about. The jurors do but there's this one moment where Michael Cohen basically admitted that 60,000 of the 420,000 he was supposed to pay to somebody else and he didn't he just pocketed it. Does it make sense for the prosecution to get in the weeds? Is this a cleanup they need to do?",

But for the defense to go in and say, oh, yes, this was all legal fees I think it impacts their own credibility and that's where Steinglass I think trying to go with this of, you know, the defense is trying to have it both ways and I think it gets very much into the weeds and I don't know what the jury is going to going to think about it either way.

The defendant, Donald Trump, and that's what Steinglass is calling him, is the defendant because that's what he is here. He picked David Pecker, he picked Stormy Daniels, he picked Michael Cohen.

You can't have it both ways. The prosecution wants you to believe Michael Cohen lies about everything, and they brought up in the defense closing -- I'm sorry, I meant the defense, the defense wants you to believe that Michael Cohen lies about everything, and the defense brought up in its closing statement that Michael Cohen even lied before Congress.But the prosecution pointed out that the reason he -- the subject that he lied to Congress about was work he was doing for the defendant, Donald Trump in Russia. So, it's a consistent theme of Michael Cohen's loyalty to Donald Trump to be the fixer, to be the person who cleans up allegedly Donald Trump's messes. And ironically, Michael Cohen's book, which was also introduced to the jury, is called \"Disloyal\" because there became a point where Michael Cohen distance himself pled guilty in federal court to the very same scheme that Donald Trump is now on trial for in part the election interference, and the prosecution is arguing the defense can't have it both ways. We know Michael Cohen's a liar. You can make up these acronyms, the GLOAT or whatever you said, Jake. I don't know if all the kids are saying that now. It's the first time I've heard that one, but it doesn't matter that he's a liar. There's enough corroborating evidence to show from all of the other witnesses, in particular, even Hope Hicks, who came on the stand, who had does not have an ax to grind in the world against Donald Trump. And actually gave a crucial piece of evidence which I imagine that the prosecution will bring out as this opening statement continues for the next several hours. She had said that Donald Trump admitted to her that he knew about the Stormy Daniels payment and that was crucial. And even though he said Michael Cohen did it for me out of his loyalty and the goodness of his tart and Hope Hicks had testified, I don't believe that for a minute. Michael Cohen does everything for credit. He would do something out of the goodness of his heart. But there's a lot of \"there\" there that Donald Trump knew about this alleged scheme without just Michael Cohen backing it up. So it's going to be a play on who the jury beliefs.",

There was testimony from multiple witnesses that he was a micromanager, including his friend David Pecker from the national enquirer who said, oh, yeah, Trump micromanagers, everything. There was testimony from his employees at everything gets run by the boss. It's run by a small mom and pop show.So I think it really stretches belief for the jury to buy the defenses argument that this really wasn't that big a deal to Donald Trump. It's just another fire to put out and no big deal hit. And I know him from the show, his hand is in everything. I even can tell you, we were shooting a scene from \"The Apprentice\" and Donald Trump stopped in the middle of the scene and told the producer, leave that line in or cut that line out. And I thought what an odd moment, he's even directing, you know, a top American TV producer and how to do the show.

Steinglass shows the jury a record for the wire transfer from Cohen to Keith Davidson calling the $130,000 payment or retainer. The prosecutor says this wasn't a retainer. It was a payoff.

It's a case that most normal prosecutors, nonpolitically motivated prosecutors would have never brought because of how heavily it depends on the credibility of Michael Cohen, who frankly has no credibility. The only guy who can the testified that President Trump was aware ofwhat was going on, that he had anything to do with this is Michael Cohen. And I think that's a fatal flaw in this case. I think the most persuasive testimony throughout this trial in terms of the actual elements of the offenses charged were Deb Tarasoff and Jeff McConney, two Trump Organization officials who tests five persuasively that the reason these records were made, the way that they were was just because that's how the Trump Organization always booked payments made to lawyers. That in and of itself is fatal to the prosecution's case. It's fatal to their theory of business records fraud here.
