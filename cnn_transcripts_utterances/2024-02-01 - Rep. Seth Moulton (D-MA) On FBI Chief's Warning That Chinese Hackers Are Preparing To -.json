      "sentences": "That was FBI Director Christopher Wray sounding the alarm yesterday about China's extensive hacking efforts inside the U.S., warning lawmakers of apocalyptic scenarios as hackers backed by Beijing test our nation's power grid, oil pipelines, and clean water systems. China has denied previous hacking allegations but dire warnings from the nation's top cybersecurity experts prove just how concerned they are.Wray's testimony coming just hours after the FBI and DOJ announced they effectively eliminated a Chinese malware attack on American small businesses. Joining us now to discuss all of this, Congressman Seth Moulton, a Democrat from Massachusetts. He sits on the House Select Committee on China. Congressman, I appreciate your time this morning. I think for people that are watching this and hearing the -- kind of the language that is very jarring when you look at what's happening here, can you explain to them what they should be most concerned about? What are the people seeing that's raising these alarms? REP. SETH MOULTON (D-MA):  Well, look, we've seen evidence of this work by China in our intelligence briefings for a long time. But for a lot of Americans, it's just hard to understand how this can really hit home. That all of these Chinese actions could literally result in you losing your water and having your electricity suddenly shut off. China is positioning itself to have the power to do this on our basic infrastructure. And it's one of the ways that the threat from China can really come home to everyday Americans. MATTINGLY:  Do we have a sense -- and this was touched on somewhat yesterday, but when they would utilize this power if they have it? If they have infiltrated to the degree that people are concerned about. What would cause them to kind of flip the switch here?",

To discourage us from doing anything to defend Taiwan's democracy.And, of course, if China can just roll over and take Taiwan, they're going to control the entire chip market in the world. So they're going to have a say over whether you can buy your next iPhone or computer, or whatever else. That would be economically disastrous for the United States. But the point is, of course, that China could do this whenever they want. So that's the theory for when they might use this capability, but they could do it tomorrow if they decide to do so.",

What we're saying is we're going to get bogged down in a war in the Middle East that will take our eye off the ball. That will prevent us from dealing with the much more significant threats from China and Russia. That's the concern here.And we don't want to lose a lot more U.S. troops to a war in the Middle East than we're doing -- than we lost -- the tragic loss of these three soldiers this past weekend. But let's also remember that some of these conservative Republicans who point to Donald Trump's attack on Soleimani, one of the Quds Force commanders from Iran -- that attack did not happen in Iran. He was targeted when he was in Iraq. That's where they took him out. So even the Trump administration was very careful to calibrate its response in these situations and not start a war with Iran.",

This call from Black clergy echoes some of the messages the Biden administration is hearing from protesters at many public campaign events. People chanting \"Ceasefire Now.\" You see all those different events on your screen. The New York Times spoke with several pastors who signed this petition and found, quote, \"Many of their parishioners are so dismayed by the president's posture toward the war that their support for his re- election bid could be imperiled.\" [07:55:00] I'm happy to be joined this morning by Cynthia Hale, pastor of Ray of Hope Christian Church -- reverend.

We are oppressed people.\" I wonder if the Biden administration's refusal, so far, to call for a ceasefire has cost the president your vote, potentially. REV. CYNTHIA HALE, PASTOR, RAY OF HOPE CHRISTIAN CHURCH (via Webex by Cisco):  Thank you so much, Poppy, for having me on this morning. So far, I'm holding out hope that the president will change his position and be stronger in his call for a ceasefire, and that's what we are hoping. He's not lost my vote yet but I am teetering on the edge as is true of many of my parishioners. As a matter of fact, I had a conversation on Sunday with some of my young adults and they were very strong about the fact that they are not going to vote for Biden because of this tragedy. We do see the Palestinian people as connected to us. As a matter of fact, we believe in the humanity of all. And so we are as concerned about the people of Israel as well as the Palestinians.
