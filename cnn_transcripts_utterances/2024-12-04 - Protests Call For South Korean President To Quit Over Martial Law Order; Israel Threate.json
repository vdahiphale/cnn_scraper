Security is tight around the parliament building after protests broke out over the president's declaration of martial law, declaration that hours later he reversed due to South Korean law.Here is what went down. Late on Tuesday night about 10:30 p.m. local time, that was when the South Korean president Yoon Suk-yeol declared martial law. In this prize address, he accused the main opposition party of anti-state activities and sympathizing with North Korea. And the backlash was fast and furious. His move sparked demonstrations. Thousands of people turned out to protest outside the National Assembly and lawmakers voted to block the martial law decree. And in the early hours of this day on Wednesday, the president backtracked he withdrew the order along with the troops deployed to carry it out. Now, resignations have been submitted by the President's chief of staff and as well as more than 10 senior secretaries and lawmakers. They are calling for more. In a statement to reporters on Wednesday, we heard from the leader of the ruling party, the People's Power Party, who apologized to the public and called for the Defense Minister to be fired. Let's bring up the statement for you. This is what we heard from Han Dong-hoon, saying this. Quote, the President must directly and thoroughly explain this tragic situation. The Minister of Defense who recommended this martial law should be immediately dismissed, and all those responsible must be held strictly accountable, unquote. The main opposition party is calling for the president, President Yoon, to step down or face impeachment. We heard from a senior Democratic Party member of Parliament who said this. Let's bring up the statement. Quote, even if martial law is lifted, he cannot avoid treason charges. It was clearly revealed to the entire nation that President Yoon could no longer run the country normally. He should step down. Now, workers from South Korea's largest union, they are, and they have been protesting in downtown Seoul, and they say that they will continue to do so until the President steps down. Look, this is South Korea's biggest political crisis in decades. This was a move by the President that stunned allies. It stunned observers around the world. It plunged. The South Korean won against the U.S. dollar. President Yoon may have lifted martial law, but questions are swirling about him, about his political fate, about what will happen next in South Korea, one of the world's most important economies.

KIMI mean, it is largely tied to a deep political polarization in South Korea after the -- this opposition party won the majority seats in the national assembly in the general election in April this year. There has been a month of political standoff with the president and the opposition party over several political scandals involving the first lady and some political leaders. But last week the tension escalated with the opposition party deciding to cut the government budget and stated that they are going to start impeachment proceedings for some of the key officials. And President Yoon saw this strongly, condemned this as a legislative dictatorship, and saw this as a threat to his own government. So President Yoon may have felt that he didn't have a choice but to act to break this paralysis by caused by this opposition party holding a majority in the National Assembly. But Yoon's declaration martial law is reminiscent of the old days when the military government ruled the country. And Yoon has been a strong advocate of freedom and democracy. But all the things that he -- all the measures that he chose to implement yesterday with the declaration of martial law actually go against that.

That's because over the course of the last week, we have seen near daily accusations of violations of the ceasefire on both sides of the equation. And the past 48 hours have seen an uptick in violence between Israel and Hezbollah.On Monday night, after Hezbollah fired two rockets towards Israeli occupied territory, Israel responded with a series of airstrikes that resulted in the deadliest stay in Lebanon since the beginning of the ceasefire. Nine people were killed in Israeli strikes in southern Lebanon. But they are not the only airstrikes that we've seen from Israel. Every single day of the ceasefire, Israel has actually carried out some kind of airstrike. They say that they are doing so in order to enforce this ceasefire, claiming that those strikes were targeting Hezbollah operatives who were violating this cease fire agreement. But we do know that not only has the Lebanese government accused Israel of violating the cease fire, but also U.S. and French officials who are part of this monitoring mechanism, have raised serious questions with Israel about these potential violations. There have also been concerns about the fact that Israel appears to be flying drones very low over Beirut, which could also be a violation of this ceasefire. A source with UNIFIL says that there have been more than 100 Israeli violations of this ceasefire over the course of the last week. And now there is a new warning from the Israeli Defense Minister, Israel Katz, who is saying that should this ceasefire break down, should Israel return to a state of war with Hezbollah, then this time will be different. Israel will not only strike deeper into Lebanese territory, he says, but will also go after the Lebanese government itself, meaning not just going after Hezbollah targets, but also going after the Lebanese government, the Lebanese military, which would be a dramatic escalation of this conflict. Now, that's not something that we're foreseeing right now at this stage. It seems like the political will is still there to maintain this ceasefire, but the question is, for how long as we watch this very fragile moment of this truce. Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Tel Aviv.

This is sort of a situation where you might expect to see Kim Jong-un try to take advantage of this and carry out a ballistic missile launch or a drone launch or a military exercise that would sort of flex his muscle especially because the South Korean president blamed what he called North Korean communists for the situation that led him to declare martial law. But at least as of now, the Pentagon says they haven't seen any indication of any major change from North Korea.

A Chinese national now under arrest reportedly said the items were to be used in a surprise attack against South Korea.CNN's Josh Campbell has the details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOSH CAMPBELL, CNN SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: The FBI has arrested a man they say was part of a scheme to illegally obtain weapons and military grade technology for shipment to the North Korean regime. Shenghua Wen, an undocumented Chinese national living unlawfully in Ontario, California first came to the U.S. in 2012 as a student, but before arriving authorities allege he met with North Korean officials and was later provided $2 million to help Pyongyang obtain prohibited items. Wen is charged with conspiracy to violate U.S. export control laws. His alleged co-conspirators were not named in the criminal complaint against him. Now, CNN is attempting to locate Wen's attorney for comment. During interviews with the FBI, Wen allegedly said, quote, \"He believed the North Korean government wanted the weapons, ammunition and other military related equipment to prepare for an attack against South Korea, as well as military uniforms, which subsequently would be used by the North Korean military to disguise their soldiers to conduct a surprise attack on South Korea.\" Prosecutors allege Wen established an export company in Texas, where firearms and ammunition were procured and transported to the Los Angeles area, and then ultimately packed in cargo containers bearing fake inventory manifest for shipment to the North Koreans as recently as 2023. The criminal complaint alleges Wen and his co-conspirator sent at least two shipments of firearms and ammunition from Long Beach, California to North Korea via Hong Kong and China. While executing a search warrant at Wen's home in September, authorities say they seized 50,000 rounds of ammunition, sophisticated chemical detection equipment, and a tool used for detecting listening devices, which Wen allegedly said he intended to also ship to North Korea. AKIL DAVIS, HEAD OF FBI'S LOS ANGELES DIVISION: Not only did the investigative team prevented additional restricted items from going to the North Korean regime, but they gathered valuable intelligence for the United States and all of our allies. This case is a success for the United States and no doubt dealt a significant blow to the North Korean government.",
