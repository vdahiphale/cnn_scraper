CNN learning tonight Trump's legal team is right now preparing to attack Michael Cohen when they present their closing arguments tomorrow. So, what more can we expect? Plus, Trump now locked in a vicious and personal battle with RFK Jr., as we hear from two Nikki Haley supporters about who they plan to vote for come November. And another terrifying flight with severe turbulence. This as we're hearing directly from the passenger who's on board that deadly flight under similar circumstances just last week. Tonight, he joins us from the hospital where his wife is also still there after suffering a severe spinal injury. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. Welcome to a special edition of OUTFRONT. I'm Erica Hill, in for Erin Burnett. Tonight, breaking news, trashing Cohen's character. Our Kara Scannell reporting tonight that Trump's legal team is expected to go after the credibility of Trump's former fixer, Michael Cohen, during their closing arguments tomorrow. Cohen, of course, is the prosecution's star witness here. Their case really hinges on his testimony, which lasted days. This as prosecutors will be trying to piece together five weeks of testimony in order to convince since the jury that Donald Trump is guilty of falsifying business records in order to conceal $130,000 hush money payment to Stormy Daniels. The major question for both sides, will this jury of seven men and five women who have now been off out of court for an entire week, will they be swayed one way or the other based on what they here tomorrow? Donald Trump isn't taking any chances already laying the groundwork to claim the case was rigged from the start, should he be convicted, today alone firing off a number of posts targeting Judge Juan Merchan, calling him radical, conflicted, suggesting they were shot actually fixed the entire jury process in order to ensure a guilty verdict, an allegation Trump's attorney is repeating.

They're also going to highlight some of the witnesses that the jury did not hear from in this case, witnesses the prosecution didn't call, including Allen Weisselberg, the former chief financial officer of the Trump organization, who was in a key meeting with Michael Cohen and Donald Trump when Cohen said Trump approved this repayment scheme. Also that they didn't hear from Dylan Howard, a top editor at the \"National Enquirer\", who was involved in all of the catch and kill deals discussed during the trial, and that they didn't hear from Keith Schiller, Trump's onetime bodyguard who traveled with Trump during the campaign, all in an effort to try to reasonable doubt with the story in arguing that they should not convict Donald Trump.",

So, Ryan, perhaps not surprising that Michael Cohen is going to figure prominently for the defense tomorrow. Is that enough to get at least one juror to their side? RYAN GOODMAN, JUST SECURITY CO-EDITOR-IN-CHIEF: I think so. I think the defense is going to make the obvious arguments that the case hinges on Michael Cohen's testimony. And without it, the prosecution doesn't have a case. And then they just need a level Michael Cohen's credibility before the jurors, then just try to get that one. And they can say, look, everything depends on Michael Cohen without him, you do not know that Donald Trump is even aware of the hush money payment at the time. You do not know the Donald Trump has any awareness of the structure of the deal that is Michael Cohen. And without him, there's nothing. And I think that's their argument and then they we just tear into all the lies that he's responsible for and the lack of credibility in their side.",

All right, so we made payments. Nothing wrong with making payments. This is done all the time.What AMI did is something that is normal, even if Cohen made the payment to Stormy Daniels. That's nothing wrong because it was for the reason of protecting the family. That's it. You have no evidence that it was for the reason of influencing an election or tax fraud or any kind of federal campaign finance fraud. So, I think that's what they have to do, whether or not they're going to actually do it is something else. I think the prosecution has a much better case.

We heard from Allen Weisselberg in the form of others testifying about him and his notes, the probably the smoking gun of smoking guns in. This case, laying out the so-called grossed up scheme.So the problem for the defense, his they have not really put forward an alternative theory. Their one witness, Robert Costello, on the defense case was a disaster. There's nobody in that courtroom who thinks that this payment was made and then doubled to $130,000, doubled or that this false alleged paper trail was created without Donald Trump's permission. Now, there may be one or two jurors, again, it speaks that toughness of the defense's job. They're not really he trying for an acquittal. Nobody is saying, oh, Donald Trump's got a great shot at an acquittal here. What they're trying for is a hung jury and a mistrial, one or two jurors.

She'd never moved again. It was -- it was absolutely terrifying. I can remember. I came over -- I leaned over and just the silly things that are in your mind. I checked, she was breathing. She could speak to me very weakly. I could hear her voice and I realized I was dripping blood onto her dress, and my minds going oh, no, I'm dripping blood into her dress. You think, I hope this isn't going to stain, just silly things. When we were launched, it was as though were in this sort of suspended animation.
