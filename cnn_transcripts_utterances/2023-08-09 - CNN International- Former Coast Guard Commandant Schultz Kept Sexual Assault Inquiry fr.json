Damaging winds, tornadoes and large hail are expected. Now to a CNN exclusive. In late June, our Pamela Brown was first to report on a secret investigation at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy that went unreleased for years. Detailing decades of alleged rapes and sexual assaults. Until CNN began looking into it, Congress never saw the report. Now a former Coast Guard commander is speaking exclusively to CNN about the failure to reveal those findings. More now from Pamela Brown. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Instead, a CNN investigation found Schultz, the leader of the Coast Guard at the time, helped cover up the whole thing for years. Schultz would not speak to CNN. The report dubbed Operation Fouled Anchor, found dozens of cases of sexual abuse and rape at the academy from the late 80s to 2006 that leaders ignored or mishandled. It was kept hidden until CNN reported it in June. By keeping the report secret, the Coast Guard avoided the type of intense scrutiny that could have forced more change in the handling of sexual assaults.",

Even though Smotrich writes on his Facebook page yesterday, and subsequently said that it is a done deal. And it's possible the government could overturn this and those could even be, you know, appeals to the Supreme Court to try to stop this from happening as well.But in essence, what he's doing is two things. First of all, with regards to East Jerusalemites, there is money as part of a five-year program for East Jerusalemites, and it's an aspect of that program that Smotrich is saying that he's going to freeze funds for. And this aspect was designed to enable, to help citizens, people living in East Jerusalem, to boost or improve their Hebrew so that they could then be able to study at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. The other aspect, as you say, is worth some 200 million shekels, just over $50 million a year. And this is designed -- I suppose the best way to explain it is to level up poor municipalities with the wealthier ones. And after they did all of the sums, it worked out that Arab municipalities still had a shortfall and therefore additional funding was set aside for them by the previous government. Now as Smotrich is saying that that is also going to be frozen as well. He says for three reasons. First of all, it's not fair that the money goes to exclusively Arab municipalities and not poorer Jewish ones. He says that the money was set aside simply as a stop to Mansour Abbas of the Islamist Ram Party who was in the last government. A first time a party representing Israel's Arab citizens was in that government. And then finally he says that this money could whined its way or find its way into the hands of criminal organizations and terrorists. I suppose it doesn't hurt from Smotrich, from his perspective, that this is also a policy that would appeal to his base as well. As far as the response, Mansour Abbas of the Islamist Ram Party says the real reason that Smotrich is this is that he is a racist minister who is trying to take us back to point zero. These accusations have been strongly denied and rejected by Smotrich -- Bianca.",
