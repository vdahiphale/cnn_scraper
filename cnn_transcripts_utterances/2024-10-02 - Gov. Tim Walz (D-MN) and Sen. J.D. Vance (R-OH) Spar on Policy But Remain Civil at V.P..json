Both the Harris and Trump campaigns are declaring victory after last night's vice presidential debate. I'll speak to surrogates from both campaigns.Plus, we are following breaking news out of the Middle East. Israel is ramping up its ground war in Lebanon. We'll go live to the region as fears of a wider war intensify. And later today, President Biden will head to the storm ravaged Carolinas to get an aerial tour of the devastation left by Hurricane Helene. Good morning. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington. All right, let's get straight to reactions from last night's vice presidential debate. I'm joined now by Michael Tyler. He is the communications director for the Harris-Walz campaign. Hey, Michael, good morning, good to see you. I just want to jump right into it. There was some criticism from progressives last night that Governor Walz was not aggressive enough and going after Senator J.D. Vance. What was Vice President Harris' reaction to the debate? MICHAEL TYLER, COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, HARRIS-WALZ CAMPAIGN:  Yes, listen, good morning. Thank you for having me. I think Vice President Harris' reaction is the same as voters across the country, Independent voters in particular, and those undecideds who saw Governor Walls lay out a very clear vision for where he and the vice president want to take this country and saw that opposite the dangerous, chaotic, dark vision that J.D. Vance was propagating. Yes, he was a slick debater on the debate stage, but on all of the issues that came up, whether it be abortion and the guilt that Donald Trump has on that, whether it be taxes and Donald Trump's desire to provide a middle class tax increase versus the vice president's middle class tax cut, or the ultimate test that came up, whether or not Donald Trump and J.D. Vance would be willing to uphold the Constitution, J.D. Vance and Donald Trump failed on Independent voters, whereas Governor Walz clearly articulated the case in a plain spoken way, in a way that, as your flash polling and everybody else's, demonstrates, resonated with undecideds, the voters that are going to ultimately decide the pathway to 270 electoral votes. So, we're excited coming off of last night, but we're focused on the task at hand over the course of the final 34 days of this campaign.",

I think what you will see him and the vice president continue to do over the course of the final month of this stretch is use every tool that we have at our disposal to continue to reach the voters. Yes, that will be inclusive of more media appearances, more interviews.Governor Walz is, of course, headed on a bus tour in Central Pennsylvania, making sure that we're hitting all communities, not just the big cities, but getting into suburban and rural communities as well. And, hopefully, it will also be inclusive of a final presidential debate on CNN, on October 23rd. The vice president is, of course, ready to do that.

He was there during the summer of protest. He misspoke on this issue while on the other side of the stage, J.D. Vance continued to uphold the lie about the 2020 election, the fact that Donald Trump lost and then tried to overturn a free and fair election.I think that's what voters, particularly the undecided voters are going to be paying attention to coming off of last night, rather than anything that happened 35 years ago. They're far more concerned with the direction of our democracy, on what these candidates are going to do for them and their families moving forward here.",

You saw the harm that played out during his presidency, whether it was on abortion. As he laid out, we now live in a country where one in three women live under a Trump abortion ban.But we know moving forward that he would have banned abortion nationwide, with or without Congress, whether it's on healthcare, the fact that this is a guy who, when he was in office, tried to terminate the Affordable Care Act every chance that he got, ultimately was unsuccessful to do so because of Republicans like John McCain, whether it is the threat that he posed to democracy in 2020 following the election there. But, again, we know, November 2024, he's making it very clear that if he is elected, he will rule on a dictator as a dictator on day one, if he's able to, he will rule without any checks on his power. This is clear in his project 2025 agenda. We now have a Supreme Court that has basically given him carte blanche to enact his dangerous extreme agenda. And so that's what the governor was focused on presenting on the debates. And I think he did a very good job of articulating exactly what that threat is while simultaneously reminding the voters that it does not have to be that way in 2024. We can turn the page on the Trump years as the vice president, he talked about we can provide the Americans with a new way forward that is actually focused on them in solving the challenges that they face in their lives.",

It's just after 5:00 P.M. here in Tel Aviv, much of the world waiting and watching Israelis as well. Israel says that it will retaliate against Iran for what was the largest ever aerial assault by Iran on the Jewish state. This morning, Iran says it fired some 200 missiles over the course of just about an hour. Israel and the U.S. say they were able to intercept most, in fact, the vast majority of those missiles, yet at least one person was killed, several were injured. Iran says it was responding to Israel's recent attacks on its proxy force, Hezbollah, in Lebanon. I want to bring in now, CNN Global Affairs Analyst and former Defense Secretary Mark Esper.

I think the deterrence objective is one way to take a look at it. Another one is to look at what objectives you might achieve with this counterstrike that might aid you either in the near term or in the long-term.So, for example, a strategic target may be to take out their nuclear facilities and set them back quite some time from their pursuit of a nuclear weapon. Another option at the operational level would be to take out their air defense sites and basically strip them of the ability to see not just the current attack but any future attacks. Because as Israel gets into the longer campaign against Hezbollah, there may be at some point the interest of Iran coming after them. Another set of targets may be economic targets, so, for example, their oil refineries and such. That may be a way to knock off the flow of money that the regime brings in to supply the terrorists, the proxies and their own military, so just a different way to look at it in terms of how you might stack up those and prioritize those targets.",

What you can certainly do is set them back, but then it's only a matter of time before they use their various supply chains, their own knowledge to rebuild their facilities and to reestablish them.
