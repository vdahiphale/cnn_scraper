Trump winning the second Republican nominating contest of 2024 by a rather wide margin and a potentially crippling defeat for his last major Republican opponent, Nikki Haley.Let's take a look at the vote board right now with 76 percent of the estimated vote in. Donald Trump still with a significant lead, 54.3 percent of the vote, that's 135,836 votes. That is almost 27,000 votes more than Nikki Haley who has 43.6 percent of the vote. Haley acknowledged her loss and Trump marked his victory. And the gloves quickly came off. Trump seemingly fuming after Haley told supporters that he has not won the Republican nomination yet. And she is fighting on. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We won New Hampshire three times now, three. She didn't win. She lost. NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: New Hampshire is first in the nation. It is not the last in the nation. This race is far from over. Now, we're the last one standing next to Donald Trump.",

New Hampshire counted the votes tonight and Republican governors support another candidate, Trump won. The system works. I'm going to leave it there. It's not perfect, but it works when it comes to counting votes. So you asked me where are we still out? And that's the big question.Look, Trump is going to win New Hampshire tonight. He has won New Hampshire tonight. The question for Nikki Haley with a month to go to South Carolina is can she convince people that she's, you know, look, this is better than Iowa, right? If you go to Iowa, let's zoom out the map and go back to we were just a week ago. Look at that. That's one county, right? So you look at that map. You look, she's in third place. You can make a visual argument and you can make a math argument. She's a 43 percent here. That looks better. That looks better. Second is better than third. Second is still second, right? And so part of the challenge here is can she get that under 10 points, some people that's meaningless. To the voters in South Carolina future states, I'm not sure that matters. It matters to donors. It might matter to staff morale. Can you prove that you got into single digits against, you know, the far away front runner that is Donald Trump? Can it happen?",

If you look in the grey, meaning no vote towns that I circled inside here, especially those right in, it's about 20 percent of the state population when you add them all up. So again, that's not a ton of votes. It's not a ton of votes. This is not a huge state.Is it possible if she runs the board here, that she can get that below 10 percent? It's possible, but I just want to go through the math for you what we're talking about here. So one of the places she's going to look at here is Derry, 2.5 percent of the population. So a place that if you, you know, won by a decent margin, you close the margin. But look, Trump won here. Trump won here. Trump is around here. So Trump's out running. Let's just go to a place that we talked about earlier, stretch it out against other people at home can see it better. The Haley campaign said Hollis was one of their targets, right? So let's bring that back up here and coming to Hollis. That's national right along the state line, it gets interesting. So here's Hollis, this is one of their targets. That's great, right? Fifty-seven percent against the former president of the United States, 41. But look, it's only a little more than 400 votes, right? So you look at the percentage, you say that's great. But when you're trying to come back against the lead, number one, it's not going to happen. He's going to win. But number two, you're trying to shrink a percentage.

I'll show you another one down here. Just outside of Concord is Pembroke. I missed it again. Let me come back to Concord and stretch it out as we go on. Here we go. It's right here.Pembroke has been right for 70 plus years. It had Donald Trump. And then you come out more toward the coast. And you come up in here. And Rochester is somewhere in here. I think it's around here. There we go, right there. Rochester is to get one of these for 70 plus years. They've been right in the Republican nomination race. And they are right tonight.

This is -- this was John Kasich country, right along the Vermont border right here, an area you know well.So again, if you're looking for places for Nikki Haley to get more votes to shrink the margin, so they're there. Now again, some of these other small ones are going to fill in red and Trump will pick up there. But the main point is down here, right down in here and there's Salem, Derry, and a couple other small towns very close to the national border that are essentially suburbs. They're not big by if you live in the Pennsylvania suburbs, or you live in the Cleveland suburbs. They're not big by them. But by New Hampshire standards, you know, 2.5, 2 percent of the population, there's a chance. But, you know, Donald Trump's going to win. The question is what's the margin in the end?

Saying New Hampshire is the first primary, it's not the last. And committing to competing in our own state of South Carolina, where the primary is about a month from today. But there are obviously questions about how she's going to be able to effectively do that. She herself is headed to Charleston tomorrow. She's got a speech there tomorrow night. We know that her campaign has put resources on the ground in Charleston, and across the state already. They have about five offices that are open there. They have folks that they have sent staffers from Iowa, to South Carolina to begin working there. But there are questions about how well she'll do there, particularly given the fact that she has promised that South Carolina will be her best showing to date. And her campaign for that matter has not actually said that there are any specific states in the primary process that they believe she can win. Now they point out that the actual campaign hasn't started in most of these states. And they do think eventually she'd be able to win. But in order to actually see a path forward for her, there are questions about where she could win, if she's going to able -- going to be able to actually effectively challenge for President Trump going forward.",

So she reached that metric. But the reality is this race is moving along.So yes, she can stay and we will see. It often takes a couple of days for that. But she was making an electability argument tonight that really has fallen flat with this Republican base. Ron DeSantis made it she's been making it. It just hasn't worked. And really one of the stark things over the past year is the weakness of President Biden or perceived weakness has strengthened Donald Trump. And now that electability argument that was used against him by all of his rivals, it just does not ring as true. So if she goes into South Carolina, she said the people there know me, he can attack my record. A lot of new voters in South Carolina did not live there when she was governor that could cut both ways. So we will see what she does. Let's give her time she has a rally scheduled tomorrow.

Independent voters think Biden is weak, but they hate Trump. Dems, he said he motivates them to vote in the election. That's the view of this individual member who the Republicans frankly will need in order to keep the House. But it's not just this individual member. There are members who talk who on the record about their concerns, as well. This is Senator Todd Young in Indiana Republican today was asked by reporters about whether or not he is going to be part of this Trump establishment or the Trump people were rushing to Trump's side. He said, hell no, that was his response. And I asked Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell today, I asked him whether he has to repair his frayed relationships with Trump. Remember, McConnell has excoriated Trump in the aftermath of January 6th. He said, I'm not going to -- I don't have any news to make. I'm not going to comment about it. He refused to say if he will endorse him or not. So you're seeing the real divide within the party.

And I've been talking to sources in Trump world who have been speaking to him or around him in the last several hours. He's continuing to see about Nikki Haley. There was this moment after Iowa where everyone was kind of just on cloud nine and Trump world they were all celebrating, they were so happy that they didn't have to fear Ron DeSantis or whatever they thought it was going to be eight months ago. Tonight is not like that. Trump is going after Nikki Haley, claiming that she said she won when she congratulated Trump on his victory, criticizing her outfit, criticizing his White House press secretary for commenting on the race. And privately he seems baffled. People have told me that she is not dropping out of the race that she's staying in this race. He doesn't understand why she is not also bending the knee and letting him have the entire grip on the GOP nomination, which he may very well have in just a few days.

And Trump will push back on that all day long and say he did, but he barely built any of the new border wall. Certainly not what he was promising. And as Ron DeSantis would often say, he did not make Mexico pay for it, which was obviously a signature campaign promise. And I think when they tried to attack him on that, you know, GOP voters did not hold him accountable for that. They were not upset with that. It doesn't show up, even though immigration is one of their No. 1 concerns. And Nikki Haley has made the argument, you know, if he did build the wall when he was in office, then the immigration numbers would not be as high as they are now. They would not be dealing with the influx, because it would already be there. No president would have torn it down. So it is this interesting conundrum where you see where the voters are not punishing Trump for not having followed through on that promise. And yet he's promising to do it again in a second term.
