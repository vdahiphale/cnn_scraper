      "sentences": "Well, Kaitlan, in a broad sense, it's remarkable that they are still all together nearly a year into this war. Putin's calculus had been divide NATO. And, in fact, we're seeing NATO probably more unified on the general principle of pushing back on Russia than they've ever been. And you've seen Japan and Germany make really remarkable shifts in their foreign policy, some of the biggest shifts they've made in decades, to be far more aggressive in helping with actual fighting equipment.But when you dig a little bit beneath the surface, you do see differences. James Cleverly, the British foreign minister who you saw there with Secretary Tony Blinken, came to Washington yesterday, had lunch with a good number of us and basically made the case that we only have weeks in order to get more equipment into the hands of the Ukrainians, and that they're capable of winning a total victory. The American view is this is probably going to be a long slog of many years and we have to be prepared to support Ukraine for many years. And that's going to require a different kind of support. And the Germans are under pressure to ship tanks that they have. They have not agreed to go do that yet or agreed to allow countries that have tanks that are designed by Germany to send them, Poland and others. So, there's a lot to work out. LEMON: OK, so that's pretty interesting. We'll talk about the timeline later. But let me ask you, because you mentioned a number of different countries. Explain the difference in -- with each different country because they have to weigh their level of support, what they're going to send. And that's a lot of coordination in doing that.",

And I think Secretary Blinken, Defense Secretary Austin will tell you they spend most of their day just trying to keep all of this group of NATO allies together and synced up. And that's what that meeting in Ramstein, Germany, is all about in -- on Friday.But that said, Don, I think it's fair to say that there are somewhat different assessments here about what level of risk to go take. Now, when we saw the foreign minister of Britain, Mr. Cleverly, yesterday, he basically dismissed the threat that Vladimir Putin makes periodically to employ nuclear weapons or at least to move them around. He said, look, the more they're under pressure, you're going to hear that. Basically he was saying you kind of have to dismiss it. There are a lot of people I talk to in the Pentagon, Don, who think you could never dismiss Vladimir Putin talking about nuclear weapons. Now we haven't seen him move any. We haven't seen him do anything yet. But there's an expectation that he may well. And then the Germans are still concerned that Europe is not ready, even more than seven decades after World War II, to see German tanks rolling across Europe even in the defense of the Ukrainians because there was a time when German tanks went through Ukraine in a very different situation in 1940, '41.",

And they have quietly been raiding that some to move ammunition quickly into the hands of the Ukrainians. Now, the Israelis don't have any control over this. It's a U.S. stockpile. But the fact of the matter is that it's coming out of Israeli territory. And as you point out, the Israelis have not fully embraced Ukraine by any means in recent times.

According to \"The New York Times,\" one student objected to the image being shown and complained to school administrators. The university responded by calling the incident Islamophobic.Now in a statement the university says, in the interest of hearing from and supporting our Muslim students, language was used that does not reflect our statements on academic freedom. Based on all of that, we have learned, we have determined that our usage of the term Islamophobic was therefore, flawed. Interesting. John Avlon, our senior political analyst, is here.

One student complained, and she was dismissed. And the president of the university at the time wrote a letter saying that sensitivity to Muslim students, one of whom complained, should have superseded academic freedom. That's a fundamental problem. That's a fundamental problem. And now they're in the firestorm that resulted and now they're walking that back in the face of a lawsuit. But it seems to me these sort of skirmishes need to be resolved by schools, particularly liberal arts colleges. Doubling down on liberal values, which remind us that it's important to be sensitive to people of faith, but there's no right not to be offended, particularly if you're doing the right thing and warning people that what they see might be offensive.",

This is what Trump said in response to that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: That's a - that's a sign of disloyalty.

So, for him to basically lash out at the evangelical leaders who are pumping the brakes on a Trump 2024 and say they're being disloyal, what does he think they are, his pets, that they can be called to heel?

That's something that's dangerous for democratic republics to break down around partisan lines.
