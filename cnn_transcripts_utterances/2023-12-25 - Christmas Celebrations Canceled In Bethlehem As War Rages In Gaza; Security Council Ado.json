It comes as the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced intensifying operations inside the Strip. The IDF says its troops located Hamas weapons compound inside what it described as a civilian structure near schools, a mosque and a clinic. The IDF also disclosed new information on an underground tunnel network believed to be used by Hamas. The Israeli military claims that tunnels served as the northern headquarters for the group. At least 70 people meanwhile, were killed at the Al-Maghazi refugee camp in central Gaza, that's according to the Hamas run Ministry of Health. Several others was said to be wounded many more trapped under the rubble. CNN's Will Ripley with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: What we are seeing is just wounded people being piled in ambulances. And what is being alleged by the Palestinian Red Crescent on the ground in Gaza is that this residential Square was targeted. Now, what the Israel Defense Force has claimed is that Hamas will embed itself in these tunnels or in these areas where civilians are sheltering, undisturbed by the piling number of civilian deaths well over 20,000 now, according to that health ministry in Gaza. But in this case, CNN reached out wanting a comment about this accusation by the Palestinian Red Crescent, that they were targeting a residential square specifically, IDF saying that they are quote reviewing the incident and then saying that despite what they call the challenges posed by Hamas, they say they will continue to follow international law and try to take feasible steps to minimize the harm to civilians. Because again, they claim that Hamas is deliberately trying to operate and conceal itself within these civilian areas, putting innocent children innocent people at risk. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Over the weekend, dozens are said to have been killed, adding to a death toll already topping 20,000 according to the Hamas controlled health ministry in Gaza, whose figures U.N. officials say were found to be accurate in previous conflicts. Those injured including many children rushed to the Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah wounded parents seem here trying to comfort their young, but they have already seen. Parts of central and northern Gaza have been almost entirely emptied, if not flattened. This U.N. one school (INAUDIBLE) refugee camp has become a vital shelter to thousands but it is desperately overwhelmed. AMIRA ABDEL BASSET, GAZA RESIDENT (through translator): We have 20 families within this room, about 63 people, including children and pregnant women, elderly people. Why can't these people go? Where can we take them? We are staying here. BASHIR (voice-over): But for those who do choose to flee, there are no guarantees of survival, with regions deemed safe by the Israeli military, offering little in the way a security. JEHAD, GAZA RESIDENT (through translator): You say we're scared is an understatement. We're terrified. if I go to Deir al-Balah what will I do with baby if I don't find shelter there, do I keep on the streets? [01:05:07] BASHIR (voice-over): Israel says it remains committed to destroying weapons and underground infrastructure belonging to Hamas. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday, telling the Israeli people that war comes at a heavy price after 15 Israeli soldiers were killed in combat over the weekend. This as the Israeli military pushes ahead with plans to expand its military operation across both northern and southern Gaza. Despite the Biden administration, calling on the Israeli government to move towards a lower intensity phase of the war. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Israel is a sovereign state. Our decisions in the war are based on our operational considerations. And I will not expand further. BASHIR (voice-over): Indications that Israel may double down on its air and land operation has raised alarm bells. The U.N. warning that there are simply no safe spaces for civilians to turn to. 1.9 million Palestinians are now set to be displaced within Gaza, the vast majority taking shelter in the south. But even in Gaza southern cities, in areas designated as so called Safe Zones, Israel's airstrikes have already left a deep scar. In the city of Rafah, a vital gateway for aid being transported from Egypt. There is no peace for civilians. ISRAA ABOU AL-AWL, DISPLACED FROM KHAN YOUNIS TO RAFAH (through translator): We were told to head to Rafah that it was a safe area. Where is the safety? Look? Look at the people in every house there's at least one wounded, one dead. Where's the security in Rafah? BASHIR (voice-over): But it is not just the horror of military warfare, which is now threatening the lives of those in Gaza. On Sunday, a scene of utter desperation and chaos in Rafah. People grabbing whatever they can carry from aid trucks at the border crossing. Those who survived Israel's relentless bombing campaign must now also survive a worsening hunger crisis. Talk of famine. Now creeping into the vocabulary of the word sticking (INAUDIBLE) but still no word of a humanitarian ceasefire. Nada Bashir, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
