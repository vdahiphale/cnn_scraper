This is parliament's mother ship, the P. Funk. This exhibit showcases black music's role in popularizing calls for social change, the early jazz musicians breaking free of the racist tropes of vaudeville surrounding black music and the freedom singers of the 1960s. John Legend is a music superstar continuing that long tradition. He's a celebrated singer/songwriter. He's earned Emmys, Grammys, an Oscar, and a Tony. He's also an activist and a philanthropist, focusing on criminal justice reform. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

So, it was focused on that. It was focused on this story of justice and equality and equal voting rights. And they wanted a song to end the film. And Common said, I was the first person he thought of, and was like, you know, let's do something together. We had worked together many times over the years. And he suggested a few song titles for me, and one of them was Glory. And I was like, I like glory. And so I just started fooling around with the idea of glory. I was on the road in Europe. And I wrote the chorus for Glory, recorded it, and sent it back to Common. And he wrote the verses for the song. Ava loved it, put it at the end of the film, and it really became such a powerful song during that moment. Because not only was it connecting with Dr. King's work, but it was connecting with the Black Lives Matter protesters who were marching in the streets at that moment and have continued to use our song over the years as a rallying cry to help inspire their protest.",
