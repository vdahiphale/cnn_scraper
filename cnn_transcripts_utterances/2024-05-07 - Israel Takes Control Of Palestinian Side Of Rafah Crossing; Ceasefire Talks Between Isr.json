That forward movement by the Israeli military stopped aid trucks in their tracks. And as the troops moved through the streets, displacement as you can see there of Palestinians continued. One man in Rafah told CNN, death is more dignified than this. Well, the Israeli action may further increase an already bad situation for the people of Rafah. U.N.

Later in the day, Hamas made this surprise announcement that they had agreed to a proposal, but we then learned that, that proposal was not the same one that Israel had tacitly agreed to. And that it didn't feel like this latest proposal from Hamas met its core demands. And, so what we saw last night was a significant Israeli military assault on eastern Rafah, not only targeted airstrikes as the Israeli military described them, but also tanks and troops rolling into Rafah for the first time in the seven months of this war, taking over that critical Rafah crossing, which is the last remaining lifeline, essentially to the outside world that was under Palestinian control. The Israeli military now firmly in control of that Rafah border crossing. And at this hour, that crossing remains close with humanitarian aid officials warning that if it is not quickly reopen, this could spell major problems for this -- for the Gaza Strip, which is already suffering enormously from a humanitarian catastrophe that has been unfolding and worsening over the course of the last seven months. We did hear today from the Israeli Prime Minister who talked about the decision to go into Rafah and what he feels they've achieved. Listen.

So, in Kirby's telling of this, the gaps that remain are not all that significant. And that's why these working-level teams have gone to Cairo to try to close those gaps. You're not hearing the same optimism in Israel, Isa. We heard Benny Gantz; the former Israeli military chief who is now in the war cabinet, he said that significant gaps remain. And that what was heard from Hamas yesterday does not reflect the dialogue that they've been having with the mediators. And when you read the Hamas response, which I have, there are a number of things in there that you know Israel is going to take issue with. But we know that progress is being made. It is evidenced by the fact that you now have the CIA Director Bill Burns, he's in Cairo, he's been joined by teams from Israel, from Qatar. Hamas has also sent a delegation, so these are movements in the right direction. But at the same time, these are -- these are working-level teams. These are experts who work out the finer points. If we were on the cusp of something immediate, you'll probably see a more senior level delegation, but it does appear at least from Washington's perspective, that there is significant positive progress, Isa.",

Prosecutors have been taking her through a detailed history of her connection to Donald Trump, including the night she went into Trump's hotel room. It appears to be an effort to remove any doubt about Daniels' credibility and her relationship with Trump as recounted in the courtroom, a sexual relationship. Criminal defense attorney Joseph Tully joins me now. Good to have you on. I want to ask you because there were clearly some moments when the judge in this case believed prosecutors and Stormy Daniels, by the way, went too far in terms of sharing details, sometimes physical, uncomfortable physical details of their relationship.

On the other hand, if something is probative, but it's outweighed by its prejudicial value, then the judge has to keep that out. And the argument that Trump's team was making was that there is other things thrown in there that, you know, Stormy Daniels testified that she was threatened in a parking lot, and that she was afraid for her safety. And, you know, Trump's team was saying, look, that has nothing to do with any details of the trial. It shouldn't have come in. And now the jury is overly prejudiced.

And the judge, we should note, reserves the right to give instructions to the jury to, in effect, set aside some of that testimonyand stay focused on the testimony relevant to the case. You have made the point that testimony yesterday from accountants from Trump organization was key though, and that it provided, in your view, some separation between Trump and the accountant's decision to classify the payments to Stormy Daniels as legal fees.

So, they had to get the felony to bring charges, and to get to felony, they had to allege that the improper payments were done with the specific intent to break another law. So, just the fact that these hush money payments were made, whether or not they're legal isn't the issue. The issue is, was Trump thinking in his mind, I want to violate campaign law. You know, I want to keep this record off my campaign and violate campaign law. Let's structure this like this. And two key witnesses testified yesterday, Jeffrey McConney and Deborah Tarasoff, that Trump did not tell them how to classify it, that the decision to classify these checks as attorneys' fees versus, you know, settlement payments regarding, you know, protecting the campaign had nothing to do with Trump. And in my mind, that established a defense right then and there.",
