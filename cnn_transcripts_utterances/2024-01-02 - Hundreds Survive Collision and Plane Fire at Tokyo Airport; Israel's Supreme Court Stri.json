A Japan Airlines flight colliding with a Japanese Coast Guard plane. The commercial aircraft had just landed, carrying some 380 people and the fire spread quickly. Amazingly, those on that commercial flight got out safely in less than two minutes. Unfortunately, the same was not true for the Coast Guard plane. Five of the six on that aircraft reportedly killed.

Take a look at this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RIPLEY (voice-over):  This is at Haneda airport before 6:00 pm local time. A massive fireball erupted right down the runway in the middle of this busy airport when a crowded Japan Airlines jet, with 367 passengers, including eight children under the age of 2 and 12 crew members on board. Collided with a Coast Guard plane that was taking off to deliver relief supplies to parts of central Japan on the western side that are desperately in need of aid right now because of the massive earthquake that struck, just hours after the country rang in the new year and began 2024. After that tragedy and all of the hustle and bustle of the holiday weekend coming to a close, at this very busy airport, Haneda airport, the hub that serves the Japanese capital along with Narita airport. Two major airports in town and now only one is operational and because Haneda had to shut down after the collision. And all the questions that are being raised about how it happened. But the extraordinary part of this story is that, everybody who was on that plane, in a matter of seconds, was safely evacuated. Everybody on that passenger plane, including parents with their young children, even as the black smoke was filling in the cabin, even as passengers said they really thought they were going to die and they can see the fire spreading. Even as passengers claim that some of the exit doors were not operational, they had to go out through the exits near the front of the aircraft, they all made it out alive. And half a dozen people on that Coast Guard plane, only one of them survived in critical condition right now at the hospital - - Will Ripley, CNN, Tokyo. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Andnow I've seen later videos as part of that conflagration, where the whole aircraft was consumed by fire. Didn't happen immediately. In fact, looking at footage from the front and right hand side of the aircraft, it was pretty well intact, except the aircraft was down on its nose because its nose was a bit damaged or collapsed. You could see, in that footage, there is evidence of possible fire in the engine, of the area of the engine, on the right-hand wing. But of course, it was a violent impact at high speed. While I have no information on whether the aircraft had taxied off the runway, was moving or not, certainly the aircraft landing would have been going, in a ballpark, 150 miles an hour landing. That didn't cause the aircraft to go up in flames quickly and that is a testament based on the structure. And then the cabin crew traded to get on the phone after people in emotional space and time, to complete safety. But the fire then developed. Obviously fuel (INAUDIBLE) began to leak. It's a problem, all the fuel tanks would be ruptured by this accident. Fuel spreads, there's a lot of heat and ignition sources. And then the aircraft structure, it's a very modern, state-of-the-art aircraft, the (INAUDIBLE). It is made in significant measure out of carbon composite material. That's an advanced, durable, lightweight, plastic material. And, ultimately, while that doesn't easily ignite, once it is burning, my understanding is that it can burn quite vigorously.

And it is going to come out through documents.So whether it is deposition testimony someone has given or some emails or calendar entries or flight logs. So some of this information might be information that we already know. Because there's been so much about Jeffrey Epstein that has already come out through the criminal prosecution of his former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, to a number of alleged victims who have spoken out, who filed their own lawsuits against Epstein and his friends. So in this case, we do expect there to be some prominent names on the list that have already become public, because the accuser, in this case, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, has been outspoken about this. She has mentioned former senator George Mitchell, former Texas governor Bill Richardson. They have both denied ever meeting her or having any sexual encounter with her at all. And the most famous of the people that she has accused of Prince Andrew. She sued him and he agreed to a settlement. So those are some of the names. And we are also expected to see some other people that may have worked for Epstein. What's important to note, as you say, the judge in this case, in knowing that she was going to unseal this, said she was going to unseal it because a lot of this information is already in the public. And she said, for some of the individuals, they did not object. For others, their name is included because maybe they worked for Epstein but there is not a salacious allegation around them. It is just going to give us a fuller picture of the Epstein universe, 20 years or so of material. Because Giuffre has alleged this abuse went back to 2002. So we will get a sense of his world and some of the people that operated in that. We learned a lot from the trial of Ghislaine Maxwell. We'll be seeing potentially new information that fills in some blanks. But just because a name was on the list, does not mean something they did something wrong. We may learn of some people that maybe we didn't know about before, where there are more serious allegations. We will have to wait to see what the documents say. But it will, at a baseline, give us a sense of what Giuffre's team has uncovered through their litigation, in this space, depositions from other accusers, depositions with other people that they believed help recruit some of these victims, as well as people that were working by Epstein's side -- Becky.",

You have to understand this person who caused this incident, is there some sort of ideology, something on social media, something from parent interviews that points investigators to look into it in that way. But what we are getting from authorities is that a 35-year old named Michael Avery, from the Syracuse area of New York, actually drove his own car to Rochester, New York, where this incident happened. But he rented a vehicle, filled it up with gas canisters and then stayed in a hotel room and then targeted this concert venue while people were leaving, really, just an hour into the New Year's Day really. It is New Year's Day we are talking about at 12:50 in the morning. And at that time, when this collision happened with another car, there was a huge explosion because of all those gas canisters. We know two people, who this car, driven by Avery, hit were killed. And we also have since learned Avery has died as a result of injuries sustained as well. So at this point in the investigation, you can see the aftermath there. There is still a lot of questions. Why this venue was targeted, what the motive is behind Avery.
