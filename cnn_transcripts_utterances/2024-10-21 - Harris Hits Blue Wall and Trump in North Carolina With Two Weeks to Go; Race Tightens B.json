Let's get right to what America is talking about, oh, the places you'll go, or rather the places Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are going. Today, the map providing confirmation that both of these candidates see this election coming down to just a few states, and a few states only. Harris hit Pennsylvania and Michigan and Wisconsin with Liz Cheney, the Republican who has endorsed her, and Trump held three separate events in North Carolina. Two of the counties, though, where the former president stopped today, and they went blue for Biden back in 2020. So, our panel here in New York, what does this all say about what they're doing? It does seem like both candidates feel like they need to reach into the bucket of the opposing candidate and try to get some new voters. ANDREW YANG, FORMER 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  They have better numbers than we do, Abby. I remember when I was a candidate, we had all sorts of polling because we were testing numbers in the field and messages all the time. And the most valuable asset that each campaign has is the candidate. So, where they send the candidate is where they want to get votes in these final days.",

It was his narrowest margin of victory of any state he won four years ago, and he needs it back in his column to get to 270 electoral votes.How many people have voted thus far in the Tar Heel State? More than a million people have voted today, but that number is way down from what it was four years ago at this point, two weeks out. We've seen a drop, especially in mail vote, given that there's not a pandemic going on right now. What do we know about this vote? Well, if we break it out by party 35 percent of the early vote cast by Democrats, 33 percent of the ballots have been cast by Republicans. 31 percent no party affiliation. How does that party breakdown compare to four years ago? Democrats had a much bigger slice of the pie, 44 percent at this point, 15 days out. Four years ago, Republicans were only at 24 percent of the ballots cast and no party affiliation at 31 percent. This is a potential warning sign for Democrats, and we should note, we don't know how these people are voting. We just know the party I.D. But this is a potential warning sign, because if fewer Democrats are showing up to vote early, Democrats are going to need to up their game on the Election Day turnout, and that has been an area of advantage for Republicans.
