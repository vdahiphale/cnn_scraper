SETH MOULTON, (D-MA): Yes, in fact, we just got approval for the 9/11 war memorial to remember all of those who we lost in Iraq and Afghanistan. And it's going to be placed, they just announced the decision, to place it between the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and the Lincoln Memorial. So, we'll have a prominent place on the wall - on the mall, on the National Mall for, you know, for all those we lost so recently in our wars and who won't have the opportunity this Memorial Day to be with their friends and family and build a life back here in America.",

It's very rare that that's done.And so the way I look at this is, I got to read it and so did the ranking member. But, you know, I think the rest of the members of the committee, pursuant to the subpoena, have every right to see this as well. We have a lot of Afghan -- Afghanistan veterans. You saw two of them with Tapper in that piece prior. And, you know, the two that chair the oversight, one Brian Mast, who lost his legs in Afghanistan, and the other one, Jason Crow, the Democrat, served in Afghanistan. I can't really look them in the eye and say, hey, I got to read this thing, but you're not going to get access to it yourself. Frankly, I think the American people should be able to read what their embassy employees were thinking at that time. Their state of mind is critical a month prior to the fall of Afghanistan. And everything they predicted in that cable actually happened. And that is the immediate collapse, the Taliban taking over, leaving American citizens behind, and our Afghanistan partners that we promised we would protect and save them, and yet we left them behind only to be hunted down by Taliban.

Putin and Xi, Chairman Xi, China, are allies. Putin has decided to invade Europe. Largest invasion since World War II. And Chairman Xi is threatening the Pacific, the likes of which we haven't seen since my dad's war, World War II. And so I think an honest discussion is important with any candidate. I do think privately, and I've talked to advisors to a lot of these potential nominees, that privately they do support what we're doing.

Thank you for all the laughs, the fun, the many Starbucks orders, mostly the friendships. So, I was thinking about this last night. And I was reminded of this article I read from my hometown paper, \"The Minneapolis Star Tribune,\" in 2015. It was when Fleetwood Mac was going back on tour together. And Stevie Nicks said this of her longtime friend Christine McVie. She said, I never want her to ever go out of my life again. And that has nothing to do with the music and everything to do with her and I as friends. And I feel the same. And I am so proud of you. And I can't wait to see you shine in primetime.",
