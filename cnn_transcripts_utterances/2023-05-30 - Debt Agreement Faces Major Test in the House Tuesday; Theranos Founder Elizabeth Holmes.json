Moscow hit with a wave of surprise drone attacks, damaging buildings and causing injuries on the ground. Ukraine not claiming responsibility but predicting more strikes against Russia soon, this as Russia launches its 17th day of strikes against Kyiv this month. Plus, China charge Beijing launching its first civilian astronaut into space. A successful rendezvous with the Chinese Space Station as the superpower race to the stars heats up. We'll be discussing China's space ambitions later in the show. Also, a delicious day a key legislative test in the U.S. House Tuesday on the newly inked debt ceiling agreement, perhaps some tense hours ahead to for President Biden and Speaker McCarthy as they try and shore up votes a live report from D.C. just ahead. And in the meantime, U.S. investors back after the long weekend holiday and the reaction as you can see, I think to that deal, mostly positive, the NASDAQ could be outperforming up more than 1.3 percent pre market. Certainly a more cautious feel, I think across Europe, though, as you can see the German market outperforming the FOOTSIE pulling back after the bank holiday weekend there too. But advertising firm WPP a winner. We share spiking on news of an artificial intelligence deal with chipmaker Nvidia and there's that professional record high today too as it closes in on a $1 trillion market cap just as it CEO unveils a suite of new AI tied products over in Taipei and China welcoming its share of international VIPs this week too. Elon Musk arriving in Beijing and meeting with the Chinese Foreign Minister, the Tesla and Twitter CEO saying now is not the time for a U.S.- China Economic decoupling, which has been a key Beijing talking point too. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon also set to speak at that Chinese summit tomorrow. And it may be a warm welcome for the business community but Beijing they have more cautious on the political side. The Pentagon saying China rejected a request for their respective Defense Ministers to meet in Singapore this week. Lots to get to you today as you can tell, as always. But we do begin today with those drone strikes in Russia, leaving at least two people injured and causing damage as I mentioned two buildings in Moscow, Russia, blaming Ukraine for the attacks Kyiv again denying direct involvement. It follows news of those further waves of drone strikes on the Ukrainian Capital once again too. Fred Pleitgen has the details.",

We had showerheads drones flying overhead, while at the same time, Ukrainian air defenses were frantically trying to shoot them down. I met one of the places that sustained some pretty heavy damage. If we look over here, we can see that there's still a lot of debris lying around in front of this house. And if we pan up, you can see that the top floors of this building have been substantially damaged. And this is also the place where the authorities here in Kyiv say a 33 year old woman was killed while she was inside her apartments. Now, at the same time, the authorities here in Ukraine are saying they believe that their air defenses were actually once again, very effective. They say they managed to shoot down most of the showerhead drones. And also, the hit that happened on this building here was apparently a drone that was shot down. And then fragments, obviously including the warhead hit this very building. At the same time, we do have that situation that unfolded in the early morning hours in the Russian capital of Moscow where the first step for the first time since the war in Ukraine began. They were attacked they say by drones, they blame the Ukrainians. The Ukrainians are saying that it wasn't then, however, the Russian Military saying they managed to take down all of those drones eight in total, they say three by electronic countermeasures, essentially bringing them off course. But they also said that they had to activate their own air defense systems and use missiles to shoot down five of those drones. Fred Pleitgen CNN, Kyiv.",

And you have heard the conservative wing of the Republican Party and then progressives in the Democratic Party have voiced their frustration and skepticism about this bill. Now, as you mentioned, this agreement will face a key hurdle today as the House Rules Committee is set to consider the agreement and as you noted, two met Republican members on that committee have voiced their opposition. Now, it is important to note that they need at least seven members of the Republican Party to vote forward on this rule in order to make it out of committee. So they cannot afford any defections from GOP lawmakers. But that is really one of the key tests that this agreement is facing as House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is pushing towards a vote tomorrow in the house. But while you have conservative members of the Republican Party saying that this bill does not cut spending enough. You are also hearing very palpable frustration from progressive Democrats who are specifically frustrated with the inclusion and toughening of a work requirement for some recipients of food stamps. Now, President Biden has said he feels very good about the prospects of this bill, but he has acknowledged to reporters that he doesn't know if he can get progressives on board. Behind the scenes, the White House has engaged in lobbying with Democrats, with both senior staff at the White House and President Biden himself calling lawmakers to try to get them on board with this proposal. But even as some progressives are not yet committing to supporting the bill, the White House did get a boost. When there is a coalition, the New Democrats Coalition, which is comprised of about 100, moderate Democrats, the leadership of that group came out and said that they do endorse this agreement. So that is some welcome news for the White House as they are trying to get enough support to get this over the finish line. Now Republicans believe that they could be pushing towards 150 Republican votes, which would be more than half of the Republicans in the House. So there are some contours of what this vote could look like. But there are still some very serious hurdles ahead as they're trying to get this all passed in the House and the Senate by June 5.",

But to your point about the competition, and the sharpening competition, I think that other nations, the United States, the European see with China, particularly at the moment over tensions about technology, I sort of wonder whether we're seeing the path being laid or if not already been laid for the next sort of technological battleground space and lower Earth orbit.",

Now, this space station, obviously, is just above that. But having the ability to operate in this realm of either, you know, low earth orbit, or just below what's considered to be space in the stratosphere, it is a new battleground, it is a battleground militarily and it's a battleground technologically. And so focusing on, you know, technology that they're going to be testing on their space station, certainly there are going to be civilian uses, and also military uses as well. So for those who are concerned about China's ability to weaponize space, well, guess what China's there, and they're learning very, very quickly. Now, of course, the United States, Russia, still decades ahead of China, in many areas, but I have to say, Julia, you know, China's ticking off the list of achievements. And they're doing it faster than I think a lot of experts predicted, despite being essentially barred by the U.S. from this international collaboration into the International Space Station and all of the technological developments that have come out of that, both civilian and frankly, military as well.",

There please come as Iran resumes the execution of protesters after a month's long hiatus. The brutal practice restarted this month with the hanging of three young men accused of killing three members of the Security Forces during anti-government protests in November. The news sparked more demonstrations. But activist and human rights groups say the allegations against the Trio are baseless. Majid Kazemi was forced to watch video of interrogators torturing his brother, and he was subjected to at least 15 mock executions according to Amnesty International.

Before his execution, the family of 36 year old Saleh Mirhashemi, a karate coach from Isfahan tried to draw attention to his plight. This picture of his father spread on social media, my son is innocent, the sign reads. But to no avail. Activists shared this heartbreaking video, they say Mirhashemi's dad hugging his picture as he lay by his son's grave. Iran has not responded to CNN's request for common. The total number of demonstrators known to have been executed since last year now stands at seven according to CNN reporting, and more executions are likely eminent. Over 100 protesters have been sentenced to death or facing charges punishable by death says this human rights activist. MAHMOOD AMIRY-MOGHADDAM, DIRECTOR OF IRAN HUMAN RIGHTS NGO: When authorities fear protests or right after protests number of executions go up. The aim is to create fear in the society to prevent more protests. ABDELAZIZ (on camera): Do you expect that the number of executions is going to rise even more this year? AMIRY-MOGHADDAM: It is rising already unless the international community that takes a wrong move against these executions. We might be facing a very large number of executions in the coming months.

And for a technology that's as transformative as far reaching as potentially as ubiquitous as artificial intelligence, I unfortunately, don't think there's a one size fits all approach to regulation. For example, there are a number of industries that are going to need to regulate industries that are impacted by AI, such as the FDA for medicine and health, or the Department of Transportation for autonomous vehicles, or the FAA, for drones. And so you know, ensuring that AI is employed for maximal benefit will require a wide participation from everywhere from policymakers, industry, civil society organizations, and everyone needs to bring together come together to sort of educate each other to ensure that AI is developed in a safe and trustworthy way for the American people. One thing is clear, though, per our previous conversation, I think it's absolutely critical that we have proper testing, evaluation and, and understanding of the risks of these AI systems as we are developing them. So kind of, as you mentioned, how we've unleashed ChatGPT on the world, potentially, before there have been the right checks and balances put in place. I think, for all future deployments of powerful AI technology, we need to ensure that we have the right public safeguards and public testing to make sure that there's nothing risky or dangerous with any models that we're publishing in the future.",

And it said you employ sort of a company called Remotasks, which employs around 240,000 humans that other ones are going through all this data and trying to make sure that the right dataset fit for you guys is provided to the customers. Is that right, Alexandr? Does it take 240,000 people to sort of cultivate the datasets that you're providing to customers? Because human centric data also requires a lot of humans if that's true.",

One, it proves that China has the continuous capability to support human presence in low Earth orbit, which is a critical capability to then support missions to the moon, as well as China's ambitions to go to Mars and asteroids. So in terms of national security, this means that China is able to test capabilities and low Earth orbit like robotic arm, rendezvous and docking proximity operations. But deeper than that is the very critical component of economic development. So what this means is that China has announced ambitions to access the resources on the moon, which in their estimation is going to be a $10 trillion economy annually by 2050. So to be able to support missions, transportation cargo to the low earth orbit, Tiangong station is a way to showcase to the world as well as test capabilities for those ambitions that they have articulated.",

The difference in explaining their ambitions between China and the United States, forexample, I've never heard the U.S. government talk about this in terms of a $10 trillion economic opportunity by 2050. And that's on an annual basis. Is that rare earth minerals? Is that where this opportunity is?",

One is, of course, rare earth minerals, like titanium, platinum, silicon iron ore, which in their estimation, is that economy that they talk about. The second important critical component is helium three, which is the fuel that will be used for nuclear propulsion capability that will enable China to reach for example, Mars at a much, much shorter duration. And then the final resource on the moon, which is absolutely vital for that economic development, is water ice that can be utilized not just for rocket fuel, but also sustained human presence. And as you must have heard, just last week, China brought forward its human lunar missions to 2030 instead of 2036. So they are actually competing, and scaling up their ambitions as we speak.",

And we mentioned it in the introduction 2014, which happens to be the 100thanniversary year anniversary of the People's Republic of China; they want to be the leader in space.

We speak tostartups; we've spoken to the NASA administrator about the importance of this satellite, low Earth orbit and the importance of it on the ground for communications for logistics for bank transactions. For defense, it's fundamental. Talk to me about this and whether you see this being perhaps the next, if not already battleground for technology between China and the West? And how should it be handled by the West in your mind?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think when you want to understand China's investment in strategic technologies, especially the Communist Party of China, so thereare three very critical technologies that they have identified as vital for the National rejuvenation of the Chinese nation as well as taking leadership. One is space and space technology. So for example, China has its own bio navigation system that enables not just civilian navigation, as well as timing and precision, which is critical for container ship traffic, where China is the leader, but also national security. So it supports missile tracking and precision navigation timing of missiles, it supports command and control nuclear signaling. Also, what is fascinating is that satellite technology also enables satellite internet, which is critical, not just for civilian infrastructure, but also military. And so when you think about it from a national security perspective, China has also invested in certain counter space capabilities like anti-satellite, weapon, kinetic, which means you directly target and destroy a satellite, they show to the world that capability in 2007. But they also have invested in non-kinetic, which do not mean you launch a satellite, launch a missile and target a satellite. But you actually use spoofing, jamming, dazzling, and laser, laser is a critical capability and China has invested in that. So to answer your question, in short, there are three very critical strategic technologies China is investing in space, artificial intelligence that enables that capability. China just announced an artificial space orbital platform last year, and then finally robotic, so basically, robotic capability. And so the difference between China and the U.S. is that while the United States is very much focused on exploration, human spaceflight, showcasing a capability to go back to the moon, China's missions are very robotic, they're not announcing human missions for the next few years. They want to first develop that robotic capability supported by AI and 3d printing to demonstrate presence.",
