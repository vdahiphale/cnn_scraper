What we learned from last night's debate about the race for second place. Plus, I'll speak live with Independent Senator Kyrsten Sinema about the border crisis and Congress's failure to pass aid to Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan. And later, antisemitism on campus, several university presidents under fire after dodging questions from Congress. How they're handling the backlash. Good day, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt to our viewers watching in the United States and around the world. It's 11 a.m. here in Washington, Thursday, December 7. There are just 39 days until the Iowa caucuses, 333 days until Election Day. This is today's state of the Race. Welcome, and we begin in Alabama where the four top GOP candidates, who aren't Donald Trump, squared off at the fourth Republican presidential debate, the last before the Iowa caucuses, Chris Christie, Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis, Vivek Ramaswamy, still in a race for second place far behind frontrunner Donald Trump. The former President, of course, skipped the debates, and he has been in New York today appearing at his civil fraud trial. Here is a little taste of what he missed on stage last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RON DESANTIS, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I have delivered results. That's what we need for this country. NIKKI HALEY, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We passed pro-life bills. We moved in unemployment from 11 percent to three percent. VIVEK RAMASWAMY, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think I can reach that next generation. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I think Nikki Haley has been studying a playbook for how women operate and function on the national stage. And she is clearly redefining, I think, the paradigm on how to respond, and how to come across as effective. She was the only one I thought looked like the adult. She was the only one who looked presidential. My old boss, Speaker Pelosi, used to say that women leaders have to bring all of their assets to bear. And she actually did that last night. Not only was she strong, she was brilliant. She threw the punches as great as she took them. She knew when to backup, and she let Chris Christie do her bidding for her and defending her. And I thought that was absolutely brilliant. So, right now, I think she of all of those -- all of the candidates on stage looks like the one who is most presidential, and I think it's going to contribute to her growing this new coalition that she is building from, democratic donors giving money to her campaign, and disaffected Republicans. I just wonder though, too. I was talking to one of my Republican friends, and he said, it feels like Groundhog Day. But, I'm like, who is Bill Murray in this dynamic that's just going to change their own actions, to change the dynamics around them? And so, I just wonder this is a little provocative. But, whether or not Nikki Haley would try to get Democrats a caucus for her in Iowa or New Hampshire, there are no more rules and politics, I believe, post Donald Trump. Why not would do you have to lose? I mean, that's the only dynamic that's going to shift and change this thing. Otherwise, it's going to be more of the same.",

If they were black, then let's just stay focusedvery much on the offense towards Jewish students. I think we should just stay there and hold the universities accountable for their inaction on that particular issue, and not bring any other sort of racial group into the conversation. But, here is the other thing. I was recently talking to the White House about this, and this is obviously public knowledge. But, they're hyper focused on this. They filed seven -- the Department of Education has filed seven lawsuits against these universities for discrimination. The universities that testified yesterday are among them. So, they're not letting go of this particular issue, as they shouldn't. So, that's just sort of my reaction. I think, regrettably, the university presidents didn't have a more fulsome affirming answer that I think would satisfy the students. And I think that's regrettable. And maybe that means they need to readjust, go back to the drawing board on the policies, and we need to give them the space to actually do that. And I hope that they actually will. But, the administration and the president said they're going to keep their eye on this ball, and they're being very aggressive about going after these universities for not protecting Jewish students.",
