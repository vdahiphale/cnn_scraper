What we know and what the government will do next. Then the U.N. Chief slams oil giants for business practices that he says are at odds with the future of humanity. Climate change is top of mind in Davos. And then later, a new political trouble for Benjamin Netanyahu. We'll explain why his coalition is already under pressure in Israel. We start though with the new tragedy in Ukraine. A helicopter crash that has killed at least 14 people. The aircraft was carrying the Ukrainian Interior Minister and five members of the Ministry's leadership team. It crashed near a kindergarten near a residential building, killing all six passengers and three crew as well as five people on the ground. One of the victims was a child. Ukrainian security services are investigating the cause. There's no indication that Russia was involved. But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says ultimately, Moscow is to blame. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT, UKRAINE (through translator):  There are no accidents. This is the result of the war. And it's after this fire, everything which is happening, rockets that hit our people. Civilians. What is happening with the kindergarten schools. Every death is the result of war. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It really took a direct hit when that helicopter, according to eyewitnesses, came flying, appear to lose control here, clipped the edge of the kindergarten there, starting a fire and then crashed on the other side of it. When our team first arrived on the ground, you could see a number of bodies covered in gold foil. That had been recovered. But they're saying now that all nine people who were on that helicopter, including, as you mentioned, the Minister of Interior Denys Monastyrskyi, the deputy Minister of Interior, the Secretary of State of the Interior Ministry, that they were all killed immediately upon impact. And now, we know as well that the other people who were killed were a number of children and their parents. Parents dropping their kids off at school, Max, you can imagine this is every family's worst nightmare. The question becomes how did this happen? Because this helicopter was sophisticated, it's a Puma helicopter. Airbus had just updated the avionics on this, and so we don't know exactly how this happened. We know that there was a lot of fog, bad visibility in the area. Some people said that they were able to hear the crash, but they couldn't see it immediately because there was such poor visibility.

Which is the general complex of where that helicopter then actually crashed. It crashed on the foot of the residential building that is behind me. And that person said, they saw the helicopter coming in. And it really didn't look as though the helicopter was out of control or something, but it was losing altitude very quickly. And then it hit at first, a kindergarten, as was -- has been described. Hit that kindergarten, went across that kindergarten and then finally completely crashed at the foot of that building. Now, the person I spoke to said there was a gigantic explosion that took place, obviously -- to save anybody who was inside that chopper. The Ukrainians, you know, as we've been talking about, they don't believe that it was shut down or this is the result of the war that's going on here. They're looking at a lot of other options, however, they're looking at possible mechanical failure. They're also looking at the -- maybe pilot error as well. They do say that an investigation into all this is most probably going to take several weeks. It is very complex. One of the things we also have to keep in mind, Isa, is that the wreckage of that helicopter, we were up close to that a little while ago. It is in a terrible state. Obviously, at first, it crashed, then it blew up. There was a big fire. It was really just a mangled wreck that was on the ground there. So investigators are going to be spending a lot of time analyzing and seeing what is going on there. We do understand that at the time of the crash, there was a good degree of fog here in this area, some pretty bad weather in this area. However, there are people who saw the chopper come in, and they were obviously able to see it in the sky. So certainly, it does appear to have been a certain degree of visibility. As of right now, what we're seeing here is that the -- forensic crews on the ground. However, as we're speaking right now, Isa, it seems as though the clearing operations are being wrapped up. There is little work still going on. And right now, it really is up to that investigative and forensic work. And certainly, the Ukrainians are saying, they definitely want to get behind what exactly happened here and how something like this could happen, because, of course, as you were just speaking there with that interview guest, this is a huge loss for Ukraine. And certainly, the Interior Minister Denys Monastyrskyi; one of the most important people right now. Not just of course, for the police forces here in this country, but also for the defense of this country which the police forces are involved in. And then, of course, the emergency services that have had so much to do since Russia's war against Ukraine started, Isa.",

For instance, are you great at planning, but dread sitting down to actually get work done? Or do you get bogged down by the what ifs and then avoid making decisions. Well, you could be a dreamer or a worrier. Let's bring in Dr. Tara Narula for more on this study. Tara, great to have you on the show. Look, I'm intrigued by this study because at times, I feel like I procrastinate. But I am trying to understand why I do that. Because often, I'm quite productive.

And those individuals that reported going to or frequenting green spaces. So meadows, parks, zoos, even cemeteries also ended up having reduction in their use of certain medications. And those medications were blood pressure medications, mental health medications and asthma medications. So, what's interesting here, Isa, is that just viewing nature. So if you have a view of a lake or a river, a park, did not seem to have this effect, it actually required you to get up and go. And that's where we wonder what might the physiologic link be. Well, it's possible that just the physical activity of going to a green space may be what is associated with the reduction in some of these medications that they reported. It may also be stress reduction. And so when you're in nature, you turn down your stress response, and that can have benefits on the body. And then socialization. So, when you're around other people we know, that, that can be helpful to you. So it's another interesting study and more there to push us to get outside and get our sneakers on.",

For example, in the beginning of the, war there were a lot of checkpoints. And we continue to have checkpoints throughout the country. These checkpoints were manned by the territorial defense. And territorial defense, they're not professional military. They're new recruits during war or immediately before the war. So as the war progressed, there was a lot of frustration and standard issues with untrained. People started coming up at these checkpoints. The minister of the interior softly, very smoothly, introduced police at all of these checkpoints. And all the issues disappeared almost without instance.

This was a bombshell, 10 to 1 supreme court ruling thatcould have massive political and create a constitutional crisis for Netanyahu and for Israel. This is in a country where already a battle has been brewing over the role of the judiciary in the supreme court. In practical terms they said Aryeh Dery, who was convicted of tax fraud last year, he served a suspended sentence. And in his plea bargain, he said he would step away from public office. So they cited that. There was actually a law in Israel that said that convicts cannot serve in public office. But there was a bill passed in the last few weeks by the Netanyahu government called the Dery bill, essentially, creating a caveat that was specific for him, that would allow him to serve as minister. Yet the supreme court still struck this down. So of course, the question is what will Netanyahu do? Will he heed the court ruling or potentially not? Could he be found in contempt of the supreme court? Will Dery step down or be fired? And will he potentially -- he could, if he wanted to, essentially destroy Netanyahu's government by pulling his party out of Netanyahu's coalition? That is unlikely to happen. What is more likely to happen is it's only going to bring forward what we've already started to see in Israel, which is this battle over the role of the judiciary. Netanyahu and his government want to put forward a series of reforms, judicial reforms. One of them would essentially allow the parliament, which will mean any party that's in power, to overturn supreme court rulings. This has brought in 80,000 people into the streets on Saturday. We saw huge demonstrations in Tel Aviv because the opposition and those 80,000 protesters feel that these judicial changes will be essentially the beginning and the end of Israeli democracy. The proponents of it say that its supreme balance between the three branches, that these are long needed reforms. But the opponents really see this as a threat to Israeli democracy. But if those reforms go through, that could put the path forward not only for Netanyahu to get out of his own corruption trial that's still ongoing possibly also for Dery to come back into power.",
