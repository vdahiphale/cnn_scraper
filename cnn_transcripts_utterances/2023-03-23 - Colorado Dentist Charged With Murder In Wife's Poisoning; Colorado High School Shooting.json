      "sentences": "Well, what we're learning is pretty limited at this point because he's a juvenile. Up until yesterday afternoon, officials were reluctant to release any details about the suspect because he's a juvenile.But then later they decided that he presented such a severe risk to the community that they were willing to start putting out his name at his age. What we know again is that he's 17 year old Austin Lyle. He was to undergo a safety check every day that he went into that school. That safety check involved a pat down every day. According to officials, he had never produced a weapon until yesterday. They were reluctant to give details about why this particular student had a safety plan in place, but they said in general, it is based on past educational as well as behavioral experiences with that particular student. So much more to learn on that. As we move forward, the big question is, of course, how are the victims? And we are waiting for more details on their conditions, but what we can tell you are their names. That is Eric Sinclair and Jerald Mason, two members of the administrative staff there, both operating in the dean's office. And so, as we wait, there are so many more questions than answers at this point. Namely, what are Denver Public Schools going to do moving forward to ensure the safety of students as well as faculty? There are several events today. There's a -- we are awaiting a press conference from Denver Public Schools to answer more of those questions. But what I can tell you is at this point, the superintendent for Denver Public Schools says that they are going to put two armed police officers at that high school, at East High School in Denver for the remainder of the year. For now, classes are canceled. It's spring break next week, but beginning in early April, there will be two armed police officers at that school. In addition, there will be an armed police officer at all of the comprehensive high schools throughout Denver. However, this new policy flies in the face of a policy that was put in place in 2020 which removed police officers from Denver public schools. The superintendent sending a letter out to parents last night saying he is willing to accept the consequences of his actions, but he says he simply cannot sit by now. And he believes it is in the public's interest, in the safety of students and faculty's interest to put these armed police officers in place, even if it goes against that past resolution.

And now she -- you know, there's been so much wide speculation that the two divorced and announced their divorce in the fall because after he unretired, it's kind of like when we saw their marriage really unravel. So many have said it's because he went back to football and that, you know, if you want to make it so black and white that he chose football over her, now she's saying, not so fast.I'll read you a quote that Gisele says in the interview. She says, \"Listen, I have always cheered for him and I would continue forever. If there's one person I want to be the happiest in the world, it's him, believe me. I want him to achieve and to conquer all of his dreams to come true. And that's what I really want from the bottom of my heart.\" And she said it's just crazy that people think that she divorced him over football. I mean, look, they've been together since their 20s. They have children together. Tom's had married before. It's complicated. We all know that marriage and relationships are complicated. But she's getting out there in a very public way, talking about this next chapter of her life post-divorce.
