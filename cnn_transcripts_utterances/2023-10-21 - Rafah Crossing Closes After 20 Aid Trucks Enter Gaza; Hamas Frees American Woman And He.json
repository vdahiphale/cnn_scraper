It is 10 a.m. here in London, noon, in Gaza, with a Rafah Border Crossing into Egypt open about two hours ago for the first time in weeks, and then close just minutes later. You're looking, I believe at live pictures. It was just enough time for 20 trucks with much needed humanitarian aid to cross from Egypt into Gaza.Hamas says the trucks were loaded with medicines, medical supplies, and limited quantity of canned foods. So 20 trucks crossing over into Gaza. Of course what we know, what we've been hearing from officials, NGOs is that many, many more needed and more than 400 or so we're making this trip on a daily basis prior to this conflict. There is this is just a trickle. But we are starting to see the start of that aid going in. Meanwhile, Hamas took the unexpected step of releasing two American hostages on Friday, a mother and daughter from Illinois. Natalie Raanan and her mother Judith were visiting family at a Kibbutz close to Gaza when they were taken hostage by Hamas two weeks ago. Back home in Illinois, Natalie's father said he couldn't wait to see his daughter again. Have listened to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) URI RAANAN, DAUGHTER, EX-WIFE RELEASED BY HAMAS: I've been waiting for this moment for a long time for two weeks. I haven't been sleeping for two weeks. Tonight, I'm going to sleep good. I spoke with my daughter earlier today. She sounds very good. She looks very good. She was very happy. And she's waiting to come home. I'm going to hug her and kiss her and it's going to be the best day of my life. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

CNN's Katie Polglase joins us with the very latest.Katie, let's start really about the -- talking about the Rafah Crossing, because so much desperation I think, for so many trying to get their aid into Gaza, should give us a sense of how many trucks -- the trucks have gotten, when there will be distributed and any hope for those wanting to get out of Gaza as well.

They think that this crossing is going to let them out soon. But as so far, that hasn't happened. It's just aid getting in.Nonetheless, that aid is very welcome. We've mentioned already 20 trucks. Of course, that is not enough, there needs to be more. But 20 trucks is the agreed amount. That is the amount that the U.S. President Biden, along with the president of Egypt and with Israel all agreed would be the amount we waited for days. It was meant to be Friday, then it was Saturday it is finally opening. But, again, this is just a very short amount of time. And clearly the situation is very tense. We can see on the other side of the border, there have been people on the Egyptian side very jubilant, very happy about it opening in this aid. Finally getting in. We understand it was the Egyptian Red Crescent that was enabling this along with the United Nations, of course on the ground, then handing it over to the Palestinian Red Crescent, another form of the U.N. again, accompanying them and distributing it now to civilians. And we have now as well, a comment from the U.N. themselves on this aid and how welcome it is they've posted on Twitter talking about it. And there are some notable wording that I think we should look at here. They say that this is the start of a sustainable effort, that is what they are confident it will be, the start of a sustainable effort to provide essential supplies. Now, the meaning behind that is that there needs to continue to happen. This can't just be one convoy of 20 trucks. It needs to continue and that is very clearly reflected on the humanitarian situation on the ground, the dire need for food, water medical supplies. This entire area has not received any aid for 14 days since this conflict first started. So really we have to wait and see to see if more aid gets in.",

And we're happy to see that the International Committee of the Red Cross did have access and yesterday were involved in the release. And -- and indeed, we will -- we will continue to be cautious in our actions in order to bring them home as soon as possible and get them released. Hopefully in safe and sound.Unfortunately, you know, we don't trust Hamas. How can you trust a terrorist organization that butchers babies, abduct, kills, murders, massacres, the unfathomable -- unfathomable barbarism of this organization, and everything they're doing currently is, I would say psychological terrorism. So let's try and keep that in the context of this conflict. And that is why Hamas at the end of this cannot come -- can never ever be in a pot, in a position of power to conduct terrorism from the Gaza Strip using the Gaza Strip as a staging ground for that terrorism against our people.

According to the United Nations if tens of thousands of Israeli troops enter Gaza, I want to just start by playing a soundbite. So we have a current context of how this could play out from the former Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DANNY DANON, FORMER ISRAELI AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.: We will try to minimize the civilian casualties. But we are determined to eliminate Hamas. It will not be easy. We encourage the population to move out of Northern Gaza because we intend to come in and when we come in, we're going to hunt down Hamas, we will eradicate them. So the population must move south. They can ignore our warning, but then they shouldn't come in and blame anyone else by themselves. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Look, some 1 million people that's half the residents of Gaza have been displaced, already forced out of their homes in this conflict. They are desperate to find refuge. They are desperate to find safe haven. Some of them have fled south but the United Nation says there is no safe place.There have been heavy airstrikes on the south on areas like Khan Yunis and Rafah. We have heard and spoken to families who left their homes in the north only to find themselves caught up in bombardment in the south of the country, the whole of the Strip is being besieged. So no matter where a family goes, they're going to be looking at food shortages, water shortages, no power, no medical care. And then of course, you have to remember that the entire Strip is sealed off. Israel announced, of course, a complete siege of the Gaza Strip. That means 2 million people are trapped in a war zone, Isa. half of them, half of the population of Gaza is children. The United Nations saying look, this is simply not how a humanitarian evacuation works. You have to provide corridors, you have to provide ways for people who are incapable of moving, and pregnant women, handicapped, children, doctors, people who are wounded, you have to provide a way for them to move and you have to provide some sort of safe haven which simply doesn't exist right now in the enclave.",

To a crowd of a few 100 supporters of Hezbollah and its Shia ally, the Amal Movement who don't want to be passive bystanders to the bloodshed in Gaza.We want the resistance to liberate Palestine, Randa Mohammed tells me. Words in slogans like these are not new, again as the death toll in Gaza soars, passions are reaching the boiling point. Earlier this week, twice protesters north of Beirut tried to reach the American Embassy stopped only by riot police firing tear gas and water cannon. In Egypt, a rare unauthorized demonstration demands Arab regimes act to stop Israel's war on Hamas in Gaza. In Jordan, country where many trace their roots back to Historic Palestine. They call on the government to shut the American and Israeli embassies. But in Lebanon, it's not only protests on the border with Israel, it's just a notch below war. In South Lebanon every day Hezbollah is striking Israeli targets for five, six times today. Here in Beirut, they're holding rallies and talking about doing more, but so far it's just talks. Hezbollah's main backer, Iran, has threatened to open a new front. Notably silent is Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah who hasn't uttered a word since the war began. I asked Hezbollah parliament member Ali Ahmad if his group is ready to go to war with Israel. The answer to that will come later. The daily Hezbollah attacks on the border are a hint of what that answer could be. Ben Wedeman CNN, Beirut. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
