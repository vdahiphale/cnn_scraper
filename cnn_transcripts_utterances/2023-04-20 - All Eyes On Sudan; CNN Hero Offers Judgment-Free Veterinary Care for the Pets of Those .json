Since Saturday, the forces of General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as a RapidSupport Forces paramilitary group, or RSF, have been locked in battle with the Sudanese Army lead by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. The fighting comes as Sudan tries to finalize a deal to return to civilian rule after two military coups in recent years which temporarily united the army and the RSF. In a phone interview, Dagalo, who is better known as Hemeti told me ruling Sudan isn`t his endgame. (On camera): What do you personally want from this situation, General Hamdan? Do you want to lead the army? Do you want to be the chief? GENERAL MOHAMED HAMDAN DAGALO, LEADER OF PARAMILITARY RAID SUPPORTER FORCES (through translator):  I don`t want to be the leader of the army. There`s a framework agreement between all the Sudanese stakeholders that should be adhered to. I don`t want to lead anything. These are all propaganda they are making.",

Thetrophy itself is the oldest trophy still competed for in North America. And unlike other major sports that make a new trophy each year, this one is one of a kind. And players on the winning team, they get their names engraved on the trophy. But just like your English papers, there are a few mistakes. Over the years, several players and teams have been spelled incorrectly on the cup. Oops. But some fans say this actually adds to the authenticity of the trophy. Try using that excuse in English class. Now, that`s random. Now come along with me and meet one of our CNN heroes, Dr. Kwane Stewart, a veterinarian who founded a nonprofit called Project Street Vet. It helps to provide medical care to the pets of people experiencing homelessness. As part of his mission, Dr. Stewart has provided free treatment to thousands of pets living in the streets. We`ll hear what inspired him to grow his mission and about his personal journey to become a vet. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. KWANE STEWART, PROJECT STREET VET:  I`ve seen people give up their last meal for their pet and people who have $3 for their name. And after I`m done with the treatment, they will try and give me that $3. This is your partner? Obviously.",

It doesn`t matter what your situation is or what your back runner past is. I see a pet in need, and I see a person who cares for them dearly, who just needs some help. I`m going to do it right here. It`s at no cost to them. It`s free. That`s it, buddy. I`ve been carrying this dream since I was seven. And it was that movie The Black Stallion that did it for me, seeing that majestic black horse and the relationship with the boy. And I remember walking out holding my mom`s hand. I said, when I grow up, I want to be an animal doctor. The moment I graduated vet school and got my first job, it was great. Finally climbed the mountain, seeing animals every day, learning new things. I was Chief Medical Officer of a regional national chain. But then I went into shelter medicine. I moved from Southern California up to Northern California to take that job. And a lot of people are just trying to survive. That was the cold water in the face wake up call. Guys are so cute. It was during the recession, so I`m seeing hordes of unwanted pets dropped off, people who don`t have the money to feed them or care for them medically. I started getting a little despondent and depressed. One day in particular, I just thought about leaving the veterinary professional together. On this day, I stopped in at 711. As I was walking out with my coffee, I looked to my left, and I saw an unhoused gentleman with his dog. I`d seen this guy before, regrettably just walked by him. And on this day, I just broke pattern because I noticed his dog. And this dog looked like a burn victim, looked like a flea problem. Fleas can just destroy the skin. I said, I`ll be back tomorrow with something that I think will help. I returned his promise. It was $3 out of my pocket. Five more minutes of my time, and the dog was just transformed. That was the moment. That`s when I said to myself, I`m going to do more of this. I`m going to get back to saving animals on my terms, and I`m going to do it for passion, not for pay. It was a feeling I`d never had before. I`m building a network of trusted volunteers, technicians, but hospitals and clinics we can go to, we can call on. Everything looks OK. But spreading across the country. And I have teams popping up in Orlando and Atlanta, D.C. She`s beautiful.",

It was long, and to be honest I thought it`d be easy. I thought it was just going to be literally tying the bull to the hot air balloon and just floating up and it`d be easy, but I quickly realized that it was a lot harder than what I could ever expected.
