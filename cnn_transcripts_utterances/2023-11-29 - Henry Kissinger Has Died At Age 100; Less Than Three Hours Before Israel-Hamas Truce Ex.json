Right now, there's a very real possibility that it may not be extended. But first tonight, we start with this, which we have just confirmed moments ago, former U.S. Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, has died. That's according to his consulting firm, Kissinger Associates. He was 100-years-old. A statement says that he passed away, at his home today, in Connecticut. Kissinger, of course, was Secretary of State, under Presidents Nixon and Ford, the only person to ever serve as the National Security Advisor and Secretary of State, at the same time.

But Kissinger provided a genius, or multi-level -- playing multi-level diplomatic chess, which allowed the U.S. government, and the Nixon administration, to implement Nixon's policies, the most famous of which, of course, was the opening to China. Henry Kissinger began his career, as a professor, as an academic at Harvard, thinking about U.S. foreign policy, in particular, thinking about nuclear weapons and their utility, in the struggle with the Soviet Union. He sought power himself. He initially was an adviser to the Kennedy administration. When he didn't feel that he was listened to, he offered himself to Nelson Rockefeller, who was the Republican, Governor of New York. He later provided some assistance, to the Johnson administration. But found his home, ultimately, as the implementer, and chief adviser to Richard Nixon. And it is the Nixon-Kissinger team that would be the most consequential of any team, in U.S. foreign policy, until the end of the Cold War. After he left Washington, he remained significant, not only as a conduit, between American foreign policy leaders, and leaders that Kissinger had known. But Kissinger was the man to see if you wanted to meet the latest American president. So Richard -- so Kissinger was not only significant in shaping the policies of one presidency, as both a National Security Advisor, then a Secretary of State, then both. But he would become a signal figure, an important figure, for those trying to understand U.S. foreign policy for decades. Indeed, after his 100th birthday, Henry Kissinger was an honored guest in China. And for the Chinese, Kissinger was a symbol of a relationship, with the United States that, frankly, doesn't really exist anymore. Kissinger was also extremely controversial, because he and Nixon had undertaken extremely controversial policies, the Christmas bombing, and at the overturning of the Allende government in Chile.",

His enormous foreign policy vision and big brain shaped the later decades of the Cold War, in a way that we are still dealing with the legacy of it. The Middle East. He basically created the notion of shuttle diplomacy and the peace process. He understood in many ways that it was the process itself that could bring a form of stability to the Middle East. His opening with Nixon to China is something that has continued to shape the contours of U.S. policy towards China.

And something he said to me, when I was writing the book is, he was not disappointed that the fact that 50 years later, that agreement still held. He was -- when I wrote the book \"Master of the Game\" of diplomacy. And even though his great acts of statesmanship, in terms of big time (ph) with the Soviet Union and arms control, and of course, he opened China, are remembered, as well as his other controversial involvement in Vietnam, Laos, Chile and other places. The place where I think he may did the most good was in the Middle East, where he laid the foundations for peace, between Israel and the Arab states. He never managed to deal with the Palestinian problem. They were, in his mind (ph) nuisance, in those days, a terrorist organization, not a state. And Kissinger always dealt with state.

I think his advice to Joe Biden today would be it's fine to talk about a two-state solution. But it's a big mistake to try to achieve it, in these circumstances. We cannot get there from here. And so, his approach, which marked a lot of the way that he approached diplomacy, was incremental. He was conservative. He was a Republican. And he was conservative. And his approach was deeply skeptical of the pursuit of peace, because he feared that it would lead to war, because of the paradox of this. Instead, he felt that it was important to try to ameliorate conflict, do his best to get the sides their interest, their animosity towards each other, to find ways to live with each other. And then, over time, eventually, it might be possible to reach the final peace agreement, end of conflict agreement. But in the meantime, what was important was to ensure a balance of power, in favor of those, who sought to maintain order, stability, and give time, for everyone, to come to terms with each other. For that to work, there had to be what he referred to as a modicum of justice, for all sides to feel that they were getting something out of this tried-out process of coming to terms with each other. So, if you think about it today, Israelis and Palestinians are so frapper (ph) so mired in conflict, his advice would be, try to find a way to end the conflict, and begin small steps, towards reconciliation, with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but with very real understanding that it's going to take a long time, to get there from here.",

But we don't have any word on the second U.S. woman that is expected to be -- believed to be held hostage, not to account for the seven others unaccounted for Americans that are supposed to be believed to be held in Gaza as well. So, what we're seeing, tonight, I think, is just how much this truce has been a day-by-day sort of ordeal, where all of the parties involved basically have to wait for Hamas to produce a list. But it is worth noting that in previous nights, we have seen different problems, different issues come up. And they did eventually end up getting resolved.

So, they have some tactical advantages that they could exploit. By the same token, Hamas has also been active. They have been caught, in various places, trying to -- and place IEDs and things like that.

I mean, how do you even begin? I can't even imagine with an adult. But how do you even begin with a child, who's 4-years-old, 10-years-old, 13-years-old, to process this trauma with them? PESSACH: Right. So, we don't start. We just wait. There's a lot of very, very delicate interactions that you undertake. You wait for it a little bit. The first steps, the things that we do in the hospital, when they come in, this is just a transitional period for them, is to kind of weighing down the experience -- the experience, the excitement. We dim the lights, because they have not been exposed to light, some of them, for a long time. We keep everything really, really quiet. And gradually, you would see the child, kind of comes out of the shadow of a child that we see, when they come back. And then, kids are kids. So, by playing with them, by interacting with them, throughout, through playing with the dogs, like treatment dogs, and things like that, you start seeing things come out. But that's going to be a very, very long process, for them. We have availed for them the best teams in Israel, are all set, on actually writing the book, or the protocol, because this is something we have never encountered, as medical professionals.",

And when you say these words, the hostages that have been taken, it doesn't even -- it doesn't even begin to describe what really happened there. It's just a crime against humanity. And when you say a crime against humanity, you actually mean that they are taking an 84-years-old grandmother, from her home, in a kibbutz? That is, I can't even explain to you how easygoing the kibbutz was. You go into the kibbutz, and everything is green, and everything is nice. And you live right next to Gaza Strip.
