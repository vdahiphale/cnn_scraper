Antony Blinken says U.S. policy will adapt, so, are we about to see a shift in strategy? Plus, this horrific violence must stop. That's the message from the U.N. Secretary General as six UNRWA staff are among those killed in Israeli airstrikes. We'll speak with the Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council Jan Egeland, about whether the situation is worsening. And a giant leap for a civilian kind, as the first-ever non-professional astronauts take a walk in space. We'll have the details in the trip of a lifetime and what it means for the future, of course, of space travel. But first, tonight, we could be looking at a tipping point in the war in Ukraine. Pressure keeps mounting on U.S. President Joe Biden to lift limits on the use of U.S.-made long-range weapons against Russian territory. Kyiv has been asking the White House, as you know, for some time to approve the use of these precision-guided missile systems, which you're looking there on your screen. The head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Democrat Ben Cardin says the U.S. must quote, \"act swiftly and lift restrictions.\" But his fellow Senate Democrat Jeff Merkley says it is a weighty issue with the risks of further escalation. While pressed today, while visiting Poland, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken would only say their American policy will adapt. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And Fred, stand by for us because I want todelve a bit deeper into what Alex was talking about. These ATACMS and what they are, and why Ukraine wants to use them to strike targets deep inside Russia. Let me show you then. So, they're basically called ATACMS, they're Army Tactical Missile System, and they're long-range guided missiles, you can see there. They're produced in the United States, and these can travel up to 300 kilometers, about 190 miles, and can be launched from a mobile launcher. They can either carry a single warhead or hundreds of smaller bomblets. Now, we know that Ukraine has been hitting Russia  more frequently, like this one, this attack in the Moscow region just earlier this week, but these have been with drones. And Alex just -- Alex has just told you, in fact, we heard from him, there is growing pressure now on President Biden to lift the restrictions on Kyiv. The Institute for the Study of War found that there are more than 200 legitimate Russian military and paramilitary objects that are in range of Ukrainian ATACMS. Have a look at that. I mean, it's worth noting that U.S. Intelligence indicates that Russia has already relocated many of their fields out of the ATACMS range, and those are right here in the screen as you can see. That gives you a sort of idea of the potential for those targets. So, let me bring Fred Pleitgen in, who's covered this, he knows this region very well. So, Fred, just speak to the risks and opportunities for Ukraine because they have been calling for these ATACMS for some time, Fred.",

      "sentences": "Well, first of all, Isa, the Ukrainians are saying this risk of escalation they believe isnot as big as many in the West might think. One of the things that Ukraine keep pointing out is that, they have actually been hitting Russia with longer-distance weapons of their own-making over the past couple of months. And you alluded to one of the big attacks that happened just a few days ago, where the Russians say they had to shoot down more than 140 Ukrainian drones. Obviously, it seems as though some of those drones did reach their destination, obviously caused a lot of damage on the ground. But the Ukrainians have also shown that they can fly far beyond the Russian capital Moscow. They can fly to the St. Petersburg region and possibly even beyond that. So, the Ukrainians themselves have already been striking within Russian territory, and they believe that, that's not something that caused a further escalation than we've already seen. On the other hand, the Russians are already hitting Ukraine with almost everything that they have as far as conventional weapons are concerned. If you look at the past couple of weeks really, the increase in ballistic missile attacks, for instance, from the Russians -- and the Ukrainians are saying if they're able to use these ATACMS missiles against some targets inside Russia, they might be able to hit some of the launch sites, for instance, for the missiles that are being launched towards Ukrainian territory. I think one of the things that the U.S. had said, and then which the Ukrainians also acknowledge is that, the airfields that the Russians are taking off from to launch some of those devastating airdrop bombs called glide bombs, that can be launched from about 60 kilometers away from the actual frontline, those are probably out of reach. However, the command and control centers that guide these bombs certainly appear to be within reach. Also, other logistical centers for the Russians appear to be within reach as well, fuel depots, other things like that. So, the Ukrainians definitely believe that they could get a lot of benefits from using these longer distance weapons, if they are allowed to. And I think for them, the ATACMS missiles certainly would be one of the key components of that, if they were allowed to do that. But one of the other things that we also keep in mind is that there are other long-distance weapons that the Ukrainians would possibly be able to use if they were allowed to. Like, for instance, the Storm Shadow missiles that were supplied by the United Kingdom. That of course, with -- paired with an F-16, a western jet can do a whole lot different things than they've been able to do so far, launching these from older Soviet jets. So, the Ukrainians definitely think that the benefits could be very big if they get the permission to use these weapons.",

The United Nations and Gazaofficials say an Israeli airstrike on a school turned-shelter has killed at least 18 people, including six U.N. staff members. The compound in central Gaza sheltering more than 12,000 displaced Palestinians. Wednesday's attack marks the highest death toll of U.N. staff in a single incident, and the fifth time the compound has been hit since the war began 11 months ago. The Israeli military calls a quote, \"a precise strike on terrorists operating inside the school.\" The U.N. Secretary General calling for an investigation, saying, quote, \"the incident must be independently and thoroughly investigated to secure accountability. The continued lack of effective protection for civilians in Gaza is unconscionable. The Secretary General reiterates his call for an immediate ceasefire and the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages. This horrific violence must stop\", he writes.

This is themain agency operating inside of Gaza to help Palestinian there, food, schools, shelter, everything that they need at the moment, it's channeled through UNRWA. Six of their workers killed, that brings the total now 220 UNRWA workers killed since October 7th. That statistic stands out. The statistic that the school has been hit five times stands out. The statistic that these UNRWA schools that have become places of shelter for people who have lost their homes, who need somewhere to go to, to get food and to get water. That become an absolute dependency for so many people in Gaza, 70 percent of those UNRWA schools in Gaza have now been hit at one time or another by Israeli strikes since October the 7th. But what we are -- what we are hearing from the U.N. as you said, that Antonio Guterres saying it must stop, the head of UNRWA, Philippe Lazzarini has tweeted on X, saying that if these strikes are allowed to continue with impunity as they have been for so long, then this undermines international humanitarian law, it undermines the Geneva Conventions, makes them in effect that they cease to have a relevance is what they're saying. Now, the IDF have come back and they've said very specifically and clearly, that they were targeting Hamas operatives, they said, who were using the place, the school as a command and control facility. And the IDF has actually named three of the people they say were members of Hamas who they say were killed. They say were also working for the U.N., working for UNRWA. Now, UNRWA has looked at those names and have said there's nothing that the IDF has given us and the IDF has given UNRWA lists of names of people they say are on their payroll at the U.N., who are actually members of Hamas. The U.N. is saying those names don't appear on any of those lists. So, the U.N. is clearly pushing back about this contentious issue. Is not the first time that UNRWA and the IDF have split views of about the IDF's claims that people were members of Hamas or not. However, in this situation, the net result is that all the innocent Palestinians who are in schools around Gaza looking for protection, looking for food are vulnerable because the IDF believes that the way to target Hamas if they think they're in these schools where there are civilians then they will target them. The IDF says it does its best to avoid civilian casualties, but civilians are getting killed nonetheless, Isa?",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE &amp; DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  Well, up until a few hours ago, the only people who had ever conducted spacewalks were professional government astronauts that had the backing of big, powerful countries like the United States, Russia and China. That all changed with the world's first commercial spacewalk. Meaning you had a spacecraft and a space suit that was designed and built by a private company, SpaceX. And the space suits were worn by civilian astronauts. And so, the significance of that is that, you know, the private sector can typically do things a whole lot faster and for a whole lot less money than big governments can. And so, this is really a continuation of a trend that we've seen for the last 10 to 20 years or so. And that is the shift of human space exploration to the private sector. And also this trend towards the democratization of space, opening up space flight to people other than just professional astronauts. And so, what we saw when these private astronauts, the crew of Polaris Dawn emerged from the hatch of the Dragon capsule was, they were really testing out how this brand new space it -- space suit felt in space, how it moved. They were testing out the mobility of the suit, how the joints felt, how well they could grip things with their hands, and then they're feeding back all of that data to SpaceX engineers on the ground, who can go back, make some refinements with the ultimate goal being that this was just the first iteration of this space suit that someday may be worn by people on Mars. Because that is SpaceX's ultimate goal to land humans on Mars, ultimately colonize Mars and make humanity multi-planetary. So, today's first commercial spacewalk, really one small step, maybe even a big step towards that ultimate goal. Kristin Fisher, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

OLEKSANDR, UKRAINIAN ARMED FORCES MEDIC (through translator):  The most difficult part is evacuation from the front line. Combat medics who work on the front are dying, just like soldiers. AMANPOUR (voice-over):  As these carriages rumble on through fields of gold, think for a moment of history repeating itself in Europe when thousands of ambulance trains evacuated casualties from World War I's trenches, more than a million to the U.K. alone. Tonight, darkness descends as we arrive at the destination, and suddenly, there's activity everywhere again. As ambulances line up, collecting and dispatching to hospitals across the country.

The one that CNN did showed that probably twice as many people -- undecided voters thought Harris did better than Trump. Generally, it takes about a week to 10 days for a debate to settle, I think, in the electorate for all of the interpretations to play out. And I think Rove is right that sometimes we do act a little bit too dramatically in the moments after a debate and think it's going to perhaps change more than it does. But I think this debate really did lay bare the differences between the candidates. Trump missed a really good chance to prosecute his case against Harris. She, you know, took another step towards becoming a serious contender and quite a competent politician after years of people thinking she wasn't really up to it. So, it was very important. Too early really to say what it will mean on November the 5th.",

It's one that the Harris team really wanted. I'm quite skeptical about celebrity endorsements. Most times this could be slightly different. Taylor Swift has great economic and cultural power. She can get people to show up to places. So, she may have more influence than most celebrities on young voters who are really difficult to get out. There've been some figures coming out of some of these voter registration sites in the last few days saying that they had 10 times as many inquiries after the Taylor Swift endorsement than before their normal daily total. That doesn't mean -- you know, there are 160 million registered voters in the United States. They got about 450,000 inquiries. We don't know how many people registered. But in an election where every single vote counts, it could be important. If Taylor Swift, for example, could get 20,000 young Democrats to register and turn up to vote in Arizona, that could be important because President Joe Biden only won that state by 10,000 votes in 2020. So, you can see how close these things are. But as I said, young voters are notoriously difficult to get to the polls, even if you can get them registered. And you know, how much is Taylor Swift actually going to be willing to play in this election beyond her endorsement? Would it be, for example, a commercially smart decision to become -- to be seen as a partisan figure? I think that's a big question.",

In the north of the country, at least 50 people are still missing after flashfloods swept away a village early in the week. Authorities say search and rescue efforts though are ongoing. On the strange twist of fate, a typhoon may have been responsible for saving a penguin's life. Six-year-old Pen escaped from a Japanese zoo two weeks ago. Born in captivity, keepers say they didn't have high hopes for her survival. And then, powerful typhoon hit the region. The storm is believed to have saved Pen's life by keeping the seas clear from boats and nets she could get tangled in. Her keeper says it's nothing short of a miracle.
