I'm Kasie Hunt here in Washington.A dangerous ice storm now crippling parts of the American South, in Texas, reports of hundreds of accidents, some deadly, as roads turn into ice rinks. Right now, 40 million Americans are under storm threat. Freezing rain is raising fears of falling trees and power outages. And air travel is a mess too. We have seen ground stops,Well, about 1,500 flights canceled so far and more than 2,500 delays. We have teams tracking all of it. First, let's start with Ed Lavandera in Dallas. Ed, dicey, dangerous, deadly. And, like, quite frankly, it's only going to get worse. What are you seeing out there?",

But (AUDIO GAP) Expressway Highway 75 coming out of downtown Dallas, we're on the far end -- in the far northern end of the city here. And you can see just how little traffic there is, some people (AUDIO GAP) other people driving rather slowly. It's just very treacherous out there, depending on how confident you feel in driving, but so far state officials are saying that the power grid here in this state is holding up well. They do not expect any issues. Of course, everyone can remember, two years ago, how dreadful the winter storm experience was here. But the roadways have been a mess. We spoke with a couple by the name of Amber and Jason Kelley. They were driving to the Fort Worth Stock Show and Rodeo delivering three steer in a trailer. They left Wichita Falls at 9:00 last night. They were trying to make it there last night, but they spent the entire night on Highway 287 about 40 miles outside of Fort Worth. It was a long and frigid night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, Kasie, we are seeing freezing rain and ice anywhere from South Texas all the way up through portions of Oklahoma, Arkansas.If you are expecting winter weather, this is the last thing you want. Freezing rain is incredibly dangerous. It falls as rain and then freezes on all the surfaces, roads, cars, bridges, overpasses. We're talking about everything, even tree limbs and power lines. And it doesn't look like much, but you can see just a very thin layer of that ice and your car can lose control completely. And so, sometimes, it's even hard to see where that ice is. And so that's why it's incredibly dangerous. We could see up to half-an-inch of ice in these areas shaded in blue. You can see through San Angelo. And this is going to come in several rounds. So we see the ice coming across the Dallas Metroplex. We're going to get a brief break, and then more is expected. So this is far from over. We have had many reports of ice and sleet anywhere from Texas all the way up to the Ohio Valley. And, again, it's not ending anytime soon. So we have had between a quarter-of-an-inch and a half-inch of ice across portions of Arkansas, Missouri. Texas has received about quarter of an inch of ice, so dangerous travels where we are with quarter-of-an-inch up to half-an-inch. That's where you will start to see those tree limbs start to break because of the weight of the ice. And we will see a lot of power outages with that. So, once again, here's the radar. You can see still a lot of ice across the Dallas Metroplex. Here are all of your warnings, your watches, your winter weather advisories still in place. And as we go forward in time, you can see a little bit of a break for Dallas, really picking up across Little Rock, Memphis, Nashville, and then, Kasie, another wave of this is expected across West Texas, even into Dallas by the time we get into Wednesday morning, so far from over.",

All right, everybody, thank you very much for those updates.But now let's go to Memphis, because we have new information about the initial police report from the deadly Tyre Nichols beating. Videos of the incident that were made public flat out contradict several claims that Memphis officers made in that early report. CNN's Nick Valencia has been tracking this. Now, Nick, we already knew that the footage contradicted the Memphis P.D.'s first public statement about the arrest. But now there are more inconsistencies showing up in this initial report.

But very importantly and the bottom line in this is that the initial claims, these alleged claims made in the initial police report directly contradict what we all saw with our own eyes. Most importantly -- this report was written in the hours after the Tyre Nichols stop -- and, most importantly, it makes no mention of officers kicking or punching Tyre Nichols while he's on the ground. It actually alleges that Nichols was the violent one. It says that he was an aggravated assault suspect, that, when officers approached him, he was sweating profusely and irate and refusing to exit the vehicle. And then it goes on to say that Nichols grabbed for Detective Martin's gun. And it was Martin, one of the five officers, former officers, that has now been charged with second-degree murder, that was listed as a victim on this initial police report. It went on to say that Nichols pulled at the officers' duty belts, again, making no mention of officers punching or kicking Nichols. And we all saw, Kasie, that there was really no indication that Nichols was fighting back. We are learning -- actually trying to figure out who authored this report, who in the police department wrote this report. We have reached out to the district attorney's office to try to get more information on that. But we want to show you this video of officers talking amongst themselves immediately after the arrest had happened. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I think most people were just happening -- were hoping that he would show that he can help bring the temperature down, show that there was at least somebody having a dialogue between both sides. And, in that sense, he did achieve that. There is a dialogue happening. I think where the actual work will happen and what was most notable for me was to hear from the secretary of state that he has senior staff that is actually staying behind, as you noted, to continue this conversation with both sides. And it's from those meetings, I think, that we might see those concrete steps. Notably might be the Palestinian Authority agreeing to reinstate the security coordination. They cut that off last week, the security coordination they have with Israel. This is something the State Department came out right away and said they disagreed with, they wanted that security coordination to continue. And perhaps they're going to be asking for the Israelis to moderate some of the steps that they are taking in the wake of the violence of the last few days. Obviously, I mean, things like settlements, those are big ideas. Not sure whether they're going to help to moderate or bring those back. But these meetings between the senior staff and the Israelis and the Palestinians, that was where the big work will happen. I think it was also notable the Antony Blinken kind of made an acknowledgement. He said, listen, the prospect of a two-state solution, that horizon is shrinking, and they are under no illusions that these tensions are going to be able to be defused overnight. I have to say the feeling on the ground here is, it's great that the secretary of state is here, they hope that something good will come out of it, but there's almost the expectation that, now that he's gone, that things could potentially just continue in the sort of spiral of violence and potentially even get worse, especially when you look ahead on the calendar, because Ramadan and Passover are coming up.

Meanwhile, fierce fighting in Eastern Ukraine today, as Russian forces try to take control of a key highway and cut off Ukraine's supply chain. The Wagner mercenary group has been a major fighting force for Russia across Ukraine. Wagner has also -- has roughly 50,000 fighters there. Most of them are convicts who've been promised freedom in exchange for their service. Their merciless tactics have proven to be successful. But Vladimir Putin could pay a price. Their victories have given Wagner more power and influence within Russia. And there's a rift that's developing now. U.S. officials say some Russian military officials are actually taking orders from Wagner commanders. And the oligarch who is the group's figurehead has been openly critical of Russia's military and its bureaucracy. CNN's Sam Kiley is in Kyiv.

This is not a sign of Russian strength, but rather of weakness. And I think that was borne out with Anderson Cooper's recent interview with one of the officers of the Wagner Group. And this is what he said about fighting around Bakhmut. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANDREI MEDVEDEV, WAGNER GROUP DEFECTOR (through translator):  There was a question of how to persuade new recruits who arrived at the front lines and saw what is going on there and decided they don't want to fight to still go ahead and fight.
