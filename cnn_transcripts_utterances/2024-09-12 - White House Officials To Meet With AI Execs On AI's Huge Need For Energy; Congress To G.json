Now, what this special status means is that there will be additional officers, there will be an extended perimeter around the Capitol, and there will be advanced technology apparatuses that will be part of this day. In a statement, the Secret Service said, \"The U.S. Secret Service in collaboration with our federal, state, and local partners are committed to developing and implementing a comprehensive and integrated security plan to ensure the safety and security of this event and its participants.\" Now we should note that the security preparations are one thing.

But it's not -- so for most Americans listening to that they would be confused and rightly so because this is just another conspiracy theory from the darkest corners of the internet that Donald Trump has brought to the mainstream with no credibility, no evidence -- only an attempt, it seems like, to demonize immigrants and Black and brown people.
