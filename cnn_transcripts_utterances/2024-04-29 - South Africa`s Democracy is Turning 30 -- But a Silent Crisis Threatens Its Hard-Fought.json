United States, Japan, Mexico, Nepal.Japan`s Mount Fuji was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2013. Hundreds of thousands of people travel to the mountain each year. Ah, Japan, a truly remarkable place to which tourists are flocking. When the nation reopened to visitors after the pandemic, this picturesque spot in front of Mount Fuji became selfie central. Tourists routinely flocking to this convenience store to capture the quirky contrast between the glowing neon lights and the serene mountain behind it. But now, locals are fed up. They`re putting up a giant mesh barrier to make one of the town`s most iconic photo spots disappear. This is part of a larger problem of over-tourism in Japan after the country experienced a record number of visitors in March. This is requiring the Mount Fuji area to put new policies in place, such as daily limits for hikers and mandatory fees. Locals are concerned that the mountain could lose its prestigious status as a UNESCO Heritage Site due to overcrowding, erosion and the mess that tourists leave behind. Last year, CNN`s Kristie Lu Stout traveled to Japan to learn more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Human traffic jams on sacred Mount Fuji.",

It`s a side to Japan`s popular tourist site that`s not in the guidebooks. But for Mount Fuji ranger Miho Sakurai, it`s just another day on the job. MIHO SAKURAI, MOUNT FUJI RANGER (through translator): There are definitely too many people on Mount Fuji at the moment. The numbers are much higher than before. STOUT (voice-over): Famous for its snowcapped volcano, Mount Fuji has inspired artists and been a pilgrimage site for centuries. Less than two hours away from Tokyo, Japan`s highest peak attracts visitors globally. And in 2013 it became a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Overtourism has become a big problem. This year, a post COVID tourism boom has brought thousands more hikers to Mount Fuji, according to a Yamanashi prefectural government official. The environmental damage being done could cost Mount Fuji its heritage status, according to the local government. MASATAKE IZUMI, YAMANASHI PREFECTURAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL (through translator): Fujisan is screaming out in pain. We can`t just wait for improvement. We need to tackle overtourism now. STOUT (voice-over): Volunteer take away tons of trash each year. Climbers are urged to donate $7 to help keep the mountain clean. But not everyone pays up. And Sakurai says some behavior is even harder to control. SAKURAI (through translator): People of all experience levels come here, including first timers. We want to prevent accidents, so we give them advice. STOUT (voice-over): The risk of altitude sickness and hypothermia has been increased by a trend called bullet climbing, where hikers begin their ascent at night, pushing on until dawn, according to the Yamanashi tourism board. According to the local government, they start their hike from a place called Fuji`s fifth station, where the number of climbers arriving here from Tokyo has more than doubled between 2012 and 2019. The local government also says it wants to shift from quantity to quality tourism. It says replacing the main road to Fuji with a light rail system would be a more sustainable solution. SAKURAI (through translator): I`d be devastated if Mount Fuji`s World Heritage status was taken away. I wanted to have that status forever. So we`ll do our best to keep it that way. STOUT (voice-over): But with no easy fix in sight, Sakurai will keep doing her bit to protect the mountain she loves. Kristie Lu Stout, CNN, Hong Kong. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
