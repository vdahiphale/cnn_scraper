But right now at this moment, as we speak in the darkness, suffering in those tunnels, their hostages alive. There are still hostages alive, 97 when people taken one year ago today. A third to a half of them may be dead. Others are alive, their families here just miles away from them so close and yet they may never see them again.

When you listen to folks on the ground in the community in North Carolina, where my mom is from, it sounds a lot like what we heard from officials in Springfield, Ohio, after Trump and Vance falsely claimed that Haitian migrants were eating their neighbors cats and dogs. Those same Republican officials in Ohio called the -- those claims a distraction from the real challenge which is an influx of legal migrants, straining resources such as schools and hospitals and housing, creating a situation that needs to be addressed, needs to be discussed. But isn't eating people's pets, this same misinformation, these lies about FEMA also a distraction, hindering recovery efforts, taking away from the real problem, hundreds dead, dozens missing communities that will need to be rebuilt from the ground up and also legitimate questions about whether FEMA and the Biden administration responded as quickly and as efficiently as they should have. All these lies are not helping focus on the real questions. Let's bring in our panel of political experts to weigh in. So, today, North Carolina Senator Ted Budd was asked on Fox why he thinks residents of North Carolina are frustrated with FEMA's response. Here's part of his answer. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TED BUDD (R-NC):  Whether it's money, a billion dollars that's been allocated for illegals that's not coming here to western North Carolina.
