      "sentences": "Right. Well, John, we have some new reporting out that was published recently essentially that in the days leading up to the debate last week in Atlanta, Donald Trump's team had begun plotting for a potential vice-presidential announcement rollout.We're told that many of his aides and planning staff had been sent to Miami where Trump's Doral Resort is to begin a setting up for a rally that many people in Donald Trump's top circle had believed would be the place where he would announce who his vice-presidential running mate would be. However, they also cautioned that many of these people, including Donald Trump's top advisers, are still in the dark about who Donald Trump is going to pick. When I talk to his team they often say it's still unclear if he has made up his mind. If he has, he has not shared it with us. They are reserving the right to have Donald Trump really continue to marinate on this decision for -- up until his -- really, his self-imposed deadline of the Republican National Convention in two weeks for when he said he has to announce. Now, look, when I talk to these people about these plans to set up this rally as a potential rollout they said we have no signs in warehouses. We have none of the merchandise that you would see with Trump's name as well as some of these top three contenders, as you laid out -- J.D. Vance, Doug Burgum, and Marco Rubio. They continue to be the top three people under consideration on this short list. But there is the no kind of branding for any of these men just yet. And I think it just goes to show how Donald Trump's team is being very reserved about this decision. And again, they continue to argue that look, we need to reserve the right for the former president to change his mind up until the time that he makes this announcement. Now, I will say the posture did change earlier this week after the debate with many people thinking that Donald Trump was going to make this announcement sooner -- far sooner than the actual convention in Milwaukee. That has changed since the debate given that Donald Trump and his team really do want to focus on the handwringing around Biden's performance. And so, we're still waiting to see if that has changed. But this rally in Miami next Tuesday is still on the books, John.",

And so, there is no question that there is a lot of worry within the party right now and within President Biden's most ardent supporters. Having said that, we should also know that the conversations that are taking place are the ones that need to take place. The campaign, the White House, the president is reaching out to governors, to members of Congress, to supporters, to allies, to donors, and that is going to continue.And there is no question, Sara, that the campaign and President Biden himself have some very important days ahead. We know that they have announced an event in Wisconsin and several other campaign events. There is going to be the interview with George Stephanopoulos. He's going to be also being put in front of Black journalists, Latino journalists, other journalists. Those are going to be key moments to make sure that what we saw on Thursday was, in fact, an aberration and that is going to, I think, really lead into what happens in the next couple of days. It's also recess right now in terms of lawmakers going back to their home districts for the July Fourth holiday. They're going to hear from their constituents. A lot of them very much support Joe Biden right now. I've heard from many of them. But like you said, a lot of them are also going to be very concerned about how the party moves forward. So, some key moments coming up for the campaign and for the president where they're going to really need to prove that they can move forward in a strong position to make sure that we beat Donald Trump, which, as you know, is the most important thing ahead for the Democratic Party.",

BUSH:  Yeah, and Donald Trump, I think, has gone radio silent, which is the best thing he can do. Look, I think the big lie of 2024 is the idea that what happened on Thursday night to Joe Biden is an anomaly or an aberration. There is now credible reporting from Axios -- Alex Thompson at Axios that there's been a 3 1/2-year coverup to try to keep Joe Biden away from other people so folks wouldn't see just how bad it is. Last night, the most alarming article I read yesterday was from The New York Times. It said his lapses in meetings are getting worse and more frequent. There was a paragraph in that story where senior diplomatic officials in the United States and in Europe said that they weren't sure you could put Joe Biden in the same room as other world leaders right now. Last night, Joe Biden told donors to the Democratic Party that the reason he was bad on Thursday night was because of his foreign travel -- a trip that ended 12 days before the debate. What we saw on Thursday night was Joe Biden at his best. Seven days of rest, prep with his top staff. That was Joe Biden at his best. I've honestly stopped worrying about the campaign and I have one question. Who is running the White House today? Who is making decisions today? I'm not really worried about the presidency in January. I'm worried about it right now. We have serious problems going on right now and I don't really think Joe Biden is up to the task today, let alone seven months from today.",

      "sentences": "It's an interesting question and truthfully, I don't know. I mean, I see the merits of both sides of keeping Biden and just trying to ride it out versus going to somebody like Kamala Harris who, by the way, is also dramatically unpopular. I see no way, by the way, that -- how the Democrats could skip overKamala Harris. I mean, if they're going to change candidates here, they have to give it to her. She is not going to step aside. They're not going to go from Joe Biden, skip over Harris, and give it to one of these other people. So it's either Biden or Harris. She's got an approval rating right now that's under 40 percent as well. However, I would point out one thing. When you look at the swing state polling and the polling where you have Senate races going on, the Democratic senators do much better right now on their ballot tests than Joe Biden does. It tells me that the Democrats have a unique Biden problem. And this was before the debate. So there is a world where you could conclude we couldn't do any worse with a fresh face, so why not roll the dice on it. It may be that the riskiest thing the Democrats can do is stick with Joe Biden. But as I said, I'm not really as worried about the campaign right now as I am about the state of who is running the country today. And I don't think we're thinking enough and putting enough focus on the day- to-day operations of our government right now. We're -- I know we're all political contributors but we're all Americans, we're all taxpayers, and we've all got to live in the country for seven months. And we have a president right now that I think, according to very credible reporting, is not up to the job of running it.",

It's a hopeful time to be a patient with the earliest symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's is a brain disease that develops silently over decades. And now that we realize this, we know that when symptoms just begin -- when the symptoms are mild -- the memory loss and the changes in thinking skills begin -- that's when we can intervene.

If we can keep people out of a care home, if we can keep people more independent in their daily lives, that will actually save money in the long term.
