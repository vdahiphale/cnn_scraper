      "sentences": "Well, tonight, some pretty major victories for this guy, Donald Trump, in two of the major cases against him. Plus, hear him in his own words when he's asked if he will go after his political opponents.Also tonight, the alleged Gilgo Beach serial killer, accused of having hunted even more victims years before the others. The new murder charge is expected to be handed down. And a forgotten hero of D-Day. Eighty years since the storming of Normandy, a Black Army medic is forgotten no more. His son is here to share his remarkable story tonight on \"Laura Coates Live\". All right, not one, but two of the major legal cases around Donald Trump are now in a kind of legal quicksand, and they're going nowhere fast, including the one that brought us this infamous mug shot, the one down in Fulton County. Now, the chance of a trial happening there this year, let alone before the November election, it basically evaporated today. A Georgia Appeals Court put the election interference case on hold indefinitely until it rules on the appeal to disqualify the D.A., Fani Willis. And let's be honest, that is going to take months. And we are, what, 153 or so days away from the election? The bureaucracy moves pretty slowly. The Mar-a-Lago classified documents case, that's also stalled and appears to be in some sort of pre-trial hearing purgatory and limbo. Just today, Judge Aileen Cannon came up with a new hearing schedule for different motions that could delay the case some more. Mind you, this case doesn't even have a trial date yet. Now, Trump and his allies have railed against all of these cases collectively. But lately, their anger has been focused on the one prosecutor who had a trial and secured a conviction. I'm talking about the Manhattan D.A., Alvin Bragg. And in a preview of what they say is in store, should Trump win, his ally Steve Bannon told \"Axios\", \"Of course, Bragg, should be and will be jailed.\" For what? How? For what and when? Well, that's, I guess, the details. And it's not just Steve Bannon. Trump allies on Capitol Hill say that they're ready to retaliate.

Now, these expected charges come after police recently searched Long Island's Manorville, where the partial remains of Taylor and Mack were first found more than 20 years ago.I'm going to get right to John Miller, CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst. John, this story continues to evolve, even more of a mystery here. You've got remains of these two women were first found in Manorville, Long Island, in 2000 and also 2003. This is long before the other victims were found or thought to have been killed. More partial remains found in Gilgo Beach in 2011, less than two miles away from the other four victims.

How and why?First, because they're looking at someone who the offender characteristics would suggest probably started killing before the murders that they know about from the Gilgo Beach burial site or even the one in Manorville. Those victims go back to the early 2000s. Studies show, Laura, that most serial killers start killing when they're 20. So, that would put us back into the clock of 1985, 1987. So, they're looking at unsolved murders, missing persons who never turned up, bodies that were recovered in burial areas or dump sites that might have similar offender characteristics in how they were tied or how they might have been dismembered and left at more than one location.",

This was D-Day, the largest invasion from the sea in military history, with over 850,000 ultimately joining the fight. Every soldier on those beaches has a story. And this week, those soldiers are returning to where it all happened, honored for their courage and their bravery.But there's one soldier I want to specifically bring to your attention. This is the story of 21-year-old Black Corporal Waverly Woodson. A part of the 320th Barrage Balloon Battalion, the only black combat unit to take part in the D-Day invasion. Now, Corporal Woodson spent 30 hours treating over 200 injured soldiers on Omaha Beach. And it wasn't without his own injuries. Upon arrival, his battalion's landing craft hit a mime. Corporal Woodson had shrapnel in his back, in his groin. But he made it to the beach and set up a first aid station. The only one on that beach, treating soldiers while taking enemy fire. Corporal Woodson's heroism reached the ear of a White House aide who recommended him for a Medal of Honor. He didn't get that medal. In fact, not a single black member who served in the Army in World War II was awarded one of the 432 Medals of Honor. Thankfully, that's not where Corporal Woodson's story ends. His family pushed for his bravery to recognize for decades. You know, after 80 years, after a decade of research, the Pentagon and Senator Chris Van Hollen finally awarded Waverly Woodson the Distinguished Service Cross. The nation's second highest honor that can be awarded for combat bravery. And here with me now, we have the honor of having the son of Corporal Waverly Woodson, Stephen Woodson. Along with him is Garrett Graff, who was the author of When the Sea Came Alive, An Oral History of D-Day. And he is profiling Corporal Woodson's story with his article, \"The Forgotten Hero of D-Day\". Steve, I'm so glad that you are here today and what an honor to learn more about your father. The idea of this recognition, and I understand the Army is going to bring the medal to the Omaha Beach, that before it's handed to your family, it is literally going to touch the space and the place where he should have been rightfully honored. How is that feeling for you? STEPHEN WOODSON, SON OF CORPORAL WAVERLY B. WOODSON, JR.: Oh, it's incredible. I had the opportunity to go to Omaha Beach last year. I was part of filming with a documentary. And when I got on the beach lower, quite honestly, I wasn't prepared for that. And the emotion just ran wild. So I can -- our family is so thankful for the honors that are being bestowed upon him.",

Corporal Woodson's case was actually passed over at that time because by then the Pentagon had lost his personnel records. And that this has been a real journey for archivists and historians with the First Army. Another historian, Linda Hervieux, whose work to try to resurface some of these stories of black soldiers and their heroism in World War II.
