When I talk to Donald Trump senior advisers, they tell me there are no concerns about his chances of winning it come November, but he instead chose to come here instead of a battleground because he was stomping for Tim Sheehy, the Republican Senate candidate. Now he is locked in a tight Senate race with the longtime Democrat Jon Tester, and it's really considered one of the hardest fought battles for control of the Senate majority come the fall. Now Senator Steve Dans of -- Steve Daines of Montana, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee was also at that rally on Friday, and I caught up with him beforehand, off stage, and he told me that he was the one who privately encouraged Trump to come and support Sheehy so publicly, he said really that he reminded Donald Trump of the importance of having Republicans control the Senate, particularly when it would come to potentially confirming his nominees. Now, Donald Trump did give Sheehy and other Montana lawmakers a shout out while on stage, but really his speech is very similar to what we heard at that press conference he held in Florida on Thursday. He ran through a laundry list of familiar attacks against Harris. He attacked her intelligence. He attacked her positions on the border, on the economy. He also described her running mate, Tim Walz as someone who was radically liberal. But one thing that was new that we saw on Friday was that he actually stopped at two separate points to show videos going after Harris. I want you to take a look at what he did.",

If you're a Democrat trying to win office in less than 90 days, you've got to talk to them in the way that they'll actually hear you, and you've got to make promises that you can really keep.So in this case, I think what she's saying is pretty much what the administration has been saying all along, which is that they want a ceasefire. They want the hostages home. They want the restart of something resembling a peace process that can lead to a two-state solution.

First of all, that kind of a spin, a flat spin, literally, it's your -- spins like that are and falling like that has been compared to a leaf that is classic of a stall at altitude, and then the plane just literally falls. Because what an aerodynamic stall is, is that the air flow across your wings is not sufficient to keep the plane in the air, and that interruption of the air flow can be due to a lot of things.For example, you know, lack of engine -- lack of engine thrust, or in the case of this aircraft, in prior accidents, icing. A lot of the criticisms of this plane and prior crash isn't there about 17 major investigation reports out there, a lot of times, the criticism was weather and of a major report in the United States when I was Inspector General, it was icing, and the plane, they concluded, was not tough enough to take bad icing conditions. They wanted the deicing systems, what they're called boots on this plane, it's a pneumatic device on the wings that bust the ice off. They wanted those enhanced, strengthened, made larger. So there's lots of clues in this. There was a warning on weather. And eyewitnesses do report hearing the engines running. Ear witnesses say so. So many clues, including a clue that doesn't that isn't there. There were no mayday calls. The pilots, whatever happened, did not have time to call air traffic control and call mayday.

He was supposed to put on the flaps which assist in landing about the same point in the landing sequences here, and instead did what was called feathering the prop.In other words, he turned the blades of the prop such that they were not getting any more thrust and they thought they had an engine -- were losing their engines, but in fact, they just hit the wrong switch, and that plane fell from the sky very much like this one. So they'll be looking at the pilot training, did they know about this, and the call accident? Were they warned about these switches? And did they have good training on how to recover from an aerodynamic stall, especially an icing. But you know, all the training in the world, if you get stuck in icing and you're playing can't-handle-it, then you don't have much choice, except to climb out or dive out of the ice.",

Well, Friday, that was a deadline for both sides of this case, prosecutors and Trump defense attorneys to present Judge Tanya Chutkan with a plan for how they want to proceed with this case after the Supreme Court's historic ruling, granting former President Trump some immunity from prosecution.Now, learned from my sources, there were a series of calls between defense attorneys and prosecutors over the past week. Now, I will tell you, there's no love lost between these two teams. So, it's not surprising that they weren't able to find really any areas of common ground to present to the judge. For what was surprising, even shocking, is that prosecutors informed the defense attorneys they were going to ask for an extension. They needed more time to figure out how to proceed in this case. And that's really surprising because prosecutors have been the ones who have been pushing to try to get this case to trial before the election. Of course, now that's impossible after the Supreme Court took out many months to contemplate and decide this case. But now, the judge has granted that extension. She's given them until the end of the month to present their plan, and then said they'll all be back in court on September 5th to talk about the status of this case. So, they are expected to use those few weeks to consult with other experts inside the Justice Department, the Office of Legal Counsel, others who might be able to help them interpret the Supreme Court decision and figure out exactly how this will apply to the case that they've brought, and what will remain after they take out any official acts over where the Supreme Court said Trump cannot be charged for official acts. But they also said you can't charge him for unofficial activity and use any official acts as evidence. So, this is really going to require some sophisticated analysis, and this will ultimately really determine what will remain of this case. Now, if Trump is re-elected, he will likely have this case and the other federal case dismissed. But if he's not re-elected, we'll wait and see what they do with this case. But it's going to take a few more weeks it appears before they figure that out. Amara, Victor.",

And so, sorting that out and then going on the record and having a new theory of the case with the readjustment of the case based on the gutting of the case from the Supreme Court. That's heavy lifting. And so, I think it's appropriate that they take their time, they being the special counsel, and get it right and have their arguments in order and go before the judge what those arguments are and what evidence they're going to use.",

And what you noted is outcome determinative. And any prosecution and assessment has to be made to how it impaired the prosecution.To what extent, if any, did it affect the indictment? Was there evidence that was proffered before the grand jury? That should not have. Was there any other misconduct with regard to any other evidence or information that was considered by a grand jury that they shouldn't have. And so, yes, we're going on trips, and not going on trips, and when a relationship started and ended and where you went, and you know, who paid for what? You know, those are all things that she gave, that is the District Attorney Fani Willis to the defense as issues, but I don't think there are really core issues as to the ultimate issue of whether she should stay on. Last point, Victor, and that's this. Ultimately, remember that McAfee, the trial judge, made a determination, and that's what the appeal is about. And what he found is that, there is no actual conflict of interest. However, there is an appearance of a conflict of interest. And with that appearance, that could be solved by letting the special counsel, right? Mr. Wade remove himself. That happened. And so, now, it will be up to the actual appellate court to decide whether they agree with McAfee in letting   her continue, which I think is a substantial likelihood that they will, or whether or not she's disqualified because of all of this err of the appearance, appearance of impropriety.",

A Butler township police officer asking for a boost to check the roof of the AGR building outside former President Trump's rally. There's no audio in this video obtained by CNN. You can see on the timestamp, this is less than one minute before Crooks started shooting. The officer climbs up to the roof and almost immediately drops down, and the tone changes. You don't see it on the video, but police have said Crooks aimed his rifle right at the officer. He runs to the other side of the building to look at the roof, and on this officer's dash cam, which was recording audio, you can hear those first three gunshots from Thomas Matthew Crooks at 6:11 p.m. (GUNFIRE)",
