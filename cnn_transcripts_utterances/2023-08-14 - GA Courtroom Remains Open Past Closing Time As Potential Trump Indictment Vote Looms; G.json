The judge does not read through it, and have to sign off on it. That's the grand jury's province. That's already happened. The judge is just making sure that there's no procedural irregularities. That's why you heard that quick questioning. \"Did everything go as expected in the grand jury room, or were there any problems?\" And the individual said, \"No problems.\" So, now it's being sent to the clerk's office, where the next step is it will be docketed, meaning it will become part of the official record. It will be available to all of us, in the public and the media, assuming it's not under seal. All indications are here that it's not going to be under seal.

And then, there's a stack that is returned into court. In this case, obviously, the grand jury was doing a pretty targeted session. And they obviously considered the allegations. We'll see how many defendants they indicted. By all accounts, we're expecting a dozen or so, which now sets the stage for the battle. And so, this is the beginning of the race, from the prosecutor's standpoint. Getting the indictment is fairly simple. You know that from seeing this grand jury meet today. And so now, we'll be offered -- we'll see a flurry of pretrial motions, after we see if those tasked (ph) with the former President, or whoever is charged, to come in, and has to appear before the court. There'll be a question of some bond and how that works. And by all accounts, there'll be no real issue with that. It'll just be a formality.

And so, I don't know how long this particular one has actually had their hands, on the indictment, and have been presented with the evidence. You can receive evidence, from other grand juries.The former grand jury, the Special Purpose Grand Jury, which met for about eight months, remember, did not have the power, to return an indictment. That grand jury just simply had the power to investigate, to issue subpoenas, to look at the evidence, to have the witnesses come before them. A grand jury in Georgia, a regular criminal grand jury, does not have investigative powers. Typically, that grand jury has to be confronted and presented, what we call laying the indictment on the table. And that is that -- there's the prosecutor comes in and says, \"We intend to seek an indictment for charges A through Z. And we want to present evidence about that.\" And then, there'll be an introduction of some prosecution witness. It can be done by summary witnesses. It's oftentimes done by some investigator, some law enforcement official, who comes in. And of course, the grand jury has a chance, then, to ask questions about the indictment, but is not investigating. So the accurate return or the decision, by a grand jury, to criminal process to give an indictment can be fairly quick. And, I think, here you can tell, we had eight months of investigation and, really, a relatively short time of consideration, for the return of the indictment.",

There won't be typically some sort of formal announcement, by a clerk.Now, the D.A., Fani Willis, may choose to come down, and make an announcement, at any moment. In fact, prosecutors tend to do things that way. As soon as the document hits the docket and becomes public, the D.A. will want to come down and make a basic statement, to inform us of what's in there. But there's not going to be a judge taking the bench again, in the ordinary course, to say that this indictment has come back. So, it does look like the documents that were signed, reviewed quickly, and properly, by the judge, and sent back to the clerk, had been walked back into the clerk's area. And that does look like the clerk's office that we're seeing, right now.

I mean, there are so many different indictments that he kind of has a different legal team, for each of them.And we're waiting to see what they're hearing, themselves. I mean, we're watching this process happen, as the paperwork is being delivered, to the judge, those findings there. We don't actually have confirmation that it was the indictment we believe it was. But Trump's team is waiting, just as we are. I mean, they kind of have an expectation of what to do, once he is informed that he is indicted, if that is what happens here. They certainly believe that he is going to be one of those names, potentially indicted. But his legal team has obviously, just been watching this as closely as anyone else has, as we are, to see when this actually happens, when they are actually notified of it. I will say one thing that I do believe is going to be different here. Beyond the fact that we were just able to watch that moment there, which in and of itself, we have not seen with the other indictments, is that we do believe there's an expectation, we would likely hear, from the District Attorney here. That is the same District Attorney that Trump has been attacking. And what I have heard is from seeing these other indictments happen, where Trump has kind of been the first person, to come out and present his side of it? It seems like that time span is getting shorter and shorter with each indictment. And instead, we are hearing from the prosecutors, earlier on. We certainly did with Jack Smith, in the last indictment. There is certainly a potential that we would hear something, from Fani Willis, here, someone who I should note, in recent days, had to email her staff and say, \"Ignore the attacks, focus on the work, keep your head down,\" because there have been these persistent and repeated attacks, from Trump. But as for his team itself, and how they're preparing for this, I mean, this isn't their first indictment, and they were expecting this. And so, they do have surrogates and allies ready to go. But I do think it is notable that his legal troubles are certainly piling up. I'm told it's something that is very clear, when you're around Trump, and his inner circle. He's been out in public recently, at Iowa, at the LIV Golf tournament that he had, at his course. But so many people around him are -- (CROSSTALK)",

So, we don't know exactly how long it's going to take for these full indictments to be made public. And then, it's possible that we could hear remarks, from Fani Willis, on this case. Again, she spent two-and-a-half years investigating this. This is clearly something that they felt like they could do, in one day, before the grand jury.

Or are we going to break it up either into individual indictments or smaller groups? And the fact that we are now hearing that it's 10 different indictments, tells me they've gone, for the latter approach.One of the strategic benefits of sort of stripping out your defendants into individual or separate indictments, is it does enable you to get any one of those indictments, to trial, more quickly. Because, if you have 10 people together, on one indictment, that's a huge undertaking, that's going to take quite a while to get to trial. If you have one person charged individually, that's much quicker, to get to trial. So, I think there's a streamlining consideration, happening here.",

But you could have more. You could have, for example, one indictment, with one person, another one with three. They might have chopped it up into sort of substantive blocks here. Could you see multiple -- the same person, charged in more than one of those indictments? Yes, theoretically. But that would be a very confusing way to charge this.

If it is 10 different individuals, then you're going to have 10 separate potential trials, which of course means that you're going to have issues with the efficiency.If the underlying factual predicate for everything, means that it could all be tried together, you're going to have delays that otherwise would not be there. If it's all together, you have the delay, of every single duck, trying to get in a row. And every different defense attorney assigned each particular person, trying to figure out, who getting advantage and who does not. What's so significant here, though, is the way this has happened. People have expected this, for quite some time. The fact that it's taken place, in a day, might confuse some people, towards the voting. What happens is a presentation of a closing argument, if you will. As the prosecutor, you go in, and you say, \"Here's all the evidence I have before you.\" You essentially say to them, \"Here are the potential charges I'd like you to consider.\" You're going to line up the facts, the data, the testimony that you've already come in, and you're going to align it next to each individual element of a particular crime. And you're going to say to them, \"I'd like you to vote on these charges.\" And you do it in such a concise and methodical way, as to leave no room for error that they can have a finding of probable cause. That's all this is. It is not beyond a reasonable doubt. But it is very difficult to have the breadth of information, over multi years, to have a grand jury, who has been meeting, for months and months, if not longer, to try to keep their own individual notebooks of everything. You're going to present it to the jury. And you're going to say, \"Here's what I'm asking for you to do.\" The fact that there was not a single indictment that was voted against, leads me to believe that there was substantial evidence, to support the probable cause finding. It was done in a clear and compelling way. They had the proverbial horse's mouths, to actually testify to different things. And this is, of course, not in a vacuum, is it?

The courthouse closes at 5. I'm still going to be here.\" It was very clear in the clerk's office that while a number of people were leaving today that there was still some staff that was staying behind, in anticipation, of the grand jury, handing up these indictments.

That's very possible. Because again, especially, if you're talking about a RICO case, where she's naming several people, she's talking about this scheme?

I mean, you get to get sold out by everybody, that you know, who was part of your corrupt organization. And so, that's why I think there'll be much detail here.

Somebody who wants to be in the courtroom is obviously leaning in.But then when you see the fact that this now opens up each of the people within that courtroom, to the exposure of the wrath of somebody, who's not afraid, to use the court of public opinion, and bend it at its will, in a way that undermines the safety at times with people? You already heard Judge Chutkan, in the Washington, D.C. case, leading to the culmination of January 6th, saying \"Listen, the more you play in this court of public opinion, the likelihood increases that I may move that trial date up.\" Now, I wonder if this judge will have a similar notion here. But for the very reasons you articulated Abby, we just saw, although she is a -- was a clerk, it seemed, we saw a Black woman walk across that screen, next to a Black man. You've already heard Fani Willis be called \"Racist\" by Donald Trump. You've heard accusations that she has been somehow in an intimate experience, a relationship, with a gangbanger, for some reason, because it helps his narrative. And so, her security has had to increase. All of this, the idea of courtroom drama and antics, presents opportunities to become a spectacle. And it really cannot be. It has to be following the notion that we are watching it all unfold that a former President of the United States, chose Georgia at all different levels, to try to, allegedly, go forward with this plan. That's why the RICO charge would be something so interesting to see, if it happens.
