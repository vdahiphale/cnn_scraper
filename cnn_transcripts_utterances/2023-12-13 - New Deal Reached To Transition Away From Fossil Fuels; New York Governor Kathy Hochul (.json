Now, the optimists would say wow -- for the first time ever, we have language that says the world is agreeing to move, eventually, away from fossil fuels and find a cleaner future. The pessimists would say it took us 30 years to finally mention the elephant in the room that everybody knows and it's pretty squishy. There's a lot of loopholes here. Instead of saying, like at Paris, we will hold the line at this temperature and do everything we can, now there's eight different pathways that countries can take.One would be to get off of oil and gas and stop production and stop use. Another pathway would be to triple renewable energy. So let's say Saudi Arabia, for example, could say hey, we tripled our solar power, but they're still putting gigatons of carbon pollution into the sky at the same time. And that's where the small island nations take issue with this. The activists who are saying this is not enough at this point, but it is something. And right now, John Kerry, the U.S. climate envoy, is talking with Chinese counterparts about long-term plans. A lot of good came out of this COP. First-ever loss and damage fund for small countries not big enough, but it's there at least. Commitments to dial down methane gas and natural gas as it's sold to us. Huge contributor to the problem. So you take your wins where you can and in the end, they still could nibble around the edges on the -- on the language.
