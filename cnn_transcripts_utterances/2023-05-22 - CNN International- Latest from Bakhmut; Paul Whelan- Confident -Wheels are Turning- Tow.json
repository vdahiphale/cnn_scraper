      "sentences": "Hello, welcome to CNN \"Newsroom\", I'm Max Foster in London. Just ahead, Ukraine denies that Russia has completely captured the busy city of Bakhmut, the latest from the ground. Also ahead, CNN's exclusive conversation with Paul Whelan, an American wrongfully detained in Russia, what he has to say about U.S. efforts to get him out.And a record breaking fine slapped on Meta. What European regulators say is a very serious infringement, details coming up. So Ukraine is denying Russian claims that Moscow has completely captured Bakhmut the scene of some of Europe's bloodiest fighting in decades. A top Ukrainian general acknowledges that Kyiv holds a significant part holds an insignificant part of the decimated Eastern city but says his troops maintain control of the outskirts. The Governor of Russia's Belgorod region, meanwhile, claims an area close to the border was shelled by Russian forces earlier. And Ukraine's energy company says external electricity to Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is held by Russian troops, has now been restored after a failure earlier. CNN's Sam Kiley joins me live from Southeastern Ukraine. Just tell us about this apparent incursion into Russia.",

      "sentences": "Yes, so Max, this is now being claimed by the Russian Governor of the Belgorod region is saying that what he's describing as a sabotage team crossed from Ukrainian territory into Russian territory and conducted some kind of operations in those border villages.Now at the same time on social media, and we have no independent verification for this yet. The Russian Legion, which is a legion inside the Ukrainian Armed Forces of Russian dissidents opposed to the rule of Vladimir Putin. They have a blue and white flag, for example, they say that they have indeed crossed into Russia that they did conduct some operations there. And indeed, the Russian security forces are now they say hunting for them. So there is some synergy in terms of overlap in terms of these claims here. This is somewhat problematic for the Ukrainians who at the moment have been conducting longer range, very secret operations inside Russian territory that they never or very seldom claim responsibility for. But usually make some kind of wry tongue in cheek remark when there's an incident inside Russia. But this is the first time it seems that there may be some hard evidence of an actual cross border, physical incursion by troops badged to the Ukrainian Armed Forces. So this will come in of course, as Bakhmut continues to be the scene of very heavy fighting with the Ukrainians flanking to the north and the south of the city and the mercenary group continuing to claim that they control the central urban area of that city, Max.",

It comes as U.S. President Joe Biden announced a new $375 million military aid package to Ukraine. Mr. Biden and Volodymyr Zelensky met at the G7 over the weekend.With President Biden vowing America and the rest of the G7 nations have Ukraine's back in its fight against Russian aggression. The U.S. and Papua New Guinea have signed a new Defense Cooperation Agreement this coming during U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to the Pacific island nation. New pact is expected to expand U.S. access to military facilities in Papua New Guinea at a time when Washington and Beijing vie for influence in that region. Paul Whelan remains optimistic that the U.S. government will eventually succeed in bringing him home. He's been wrongfully detained in Russia since 2018, and was sentenced to 16 years on an espionage charge. In an exclusive interview with CNN, he says he feels confident his case is a priority in Washington now. He just got wishes, just wishes it would go a little faster.",

And it's the Russians who have committed a crime here by holding him in prison. And I do think it's important to note that as he is, you know, pushing for his own release, the reality is that there's another American Evan Gershkovich, who was wrongfully detained by Russia, that Wall Street Journal reporter just about two months ago. And the concern for him, obviously, is that he could be left behind if there's a deal for Evan Gershkovich that leads him out. But what he's saying right now, Paul Whelan is that he's been told by U.S. officials that he is a priority, just as much as evanesce. And we know from behind the scenes, talking to U.S. officials, that what they're really trying to do here is put an offer on the table for Russia that can secure the release of both of these wrongfully detained Americans. FOSTER: OK, Kylie Atwood, thank you for joining us then from New York. Now, Facebook's parent company, Meta has been slapped with a record fine for transferring user data across the Atlantic, the $1.3 billion fine is the largest levied under Europe's data privacy law. European regulators say Facebook transfer data from EU users to servers in the U.S. Meta plans to appeal and says such data transfers are necessary to its business.

His center right New Democracy party got more than 40 percent of the vote but fell short of the majority needed to form a government.The Prime Minister has indicated the rejects the mandate to form a coalition government this likely sets the stage then -- election likely in a month or so. Journalist Elinda Labropoulou joins us live from Athens, a truly spectacular performance from him. Many just didn't see it coming. ELINDA LABROPOULOU, JOURNALIST: No, they really didn't, Max. I mean, all the polls before the elections were proven wrong. And he has won by a landslide, basically, at least with double the amount of votes that people expected all the same due to a short difference in the electoral system. Just this once it meant that the threshold to be able to win an outright majority was very high 45 percent, which all degrees knew it would be a very difficult number to reach. As a result, we've this vote and it was always known. And this is something that's also reflected in the amount of people that went to the polls. There was not a very strong participation simply because people always knew that there may be a second round. What's the Prime Minister has done is he has already said that he will not be going ahead with trying to form a coalition. He already signaled this since his victory speech yesterday. He said, well, clearly, you know, the support is there for his party to go ahead and try to form a majority government and we're likely to see within a days of probably a new day, announced in Greece heading to new elections, Max.",

Epstein met her in 2013 and later paid for her to attend software coding school. In 2017, Epstein emailed Gates and asks to be reimbursed for the cost of the course, according to people familiar with the matter. The email came after the convicted sex offender had tried unsuccessfully to get Gates to participate in a multibillion dollar charitable fund. According to the journal, the implication behind the message, according to people who viewed it, was that Epstein could reveal the affair if Gates didn't come up, an association between the two men. A spokeswoman for the Gates told her the journal. Mr. Gates met with Epstein solely for philanthropic purposes. Having failed repeatedly to draw Mr. Gates beyond these matters, Epstein tried unsuccessfully to leverage a past relationship to threatened Mr. Gates. The Russian bridge player declined to comment on Gates and said she didn't know who Epstein was when they met? According to the journal, we should note that CNN can't independently verify the claims. In the journals reporting CNN spoke to one of the Wall Street Journal reporters who broke the story just moments ago.",

And so this now seems to be a fixture of modern American politics, where one party punishes the other party for spending that has already happened. And it's trying to force I guess, concessions for the future. Maybe they can find some middle ground on tying work to some welfare payments in the U.S. or maybe some permitting reform in the energy sector. Maybe there are some places where they can find some common ground, but you know, they're so far apart right now, Max. They're just really, really far apart. And I will make, I will make the point. At some point, the U.S. national debt gets so big that it chokes out other investments in the U.S. in the decades ahead, right?
