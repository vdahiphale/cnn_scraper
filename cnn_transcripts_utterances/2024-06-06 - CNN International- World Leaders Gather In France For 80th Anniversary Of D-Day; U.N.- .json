Eighty years ago today, freedom defeated fascism on the beaches of Normandy. In the dawn hours of June 6, 1944, 150,000 young men stormed the French coast lines on D-Day for a prolonged bloody, but ultimately triumphant battle that marked the beginning of the end of World War II. President Joe Biden, global leaders commemorated the heroism of those soldiers, thanking one-by-one the veterans who returned home, some of them now more than 100-years-old, and they honored the more than 4,000 who made the ultimate sacrifice. It is a day about the victories of the past, but also about the fights still underway and not yet won, the emotional embrace between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and one D-Day veteran spotlighted the unmistakable through line between the values that brought the D-Day's heroes to Normandy 80 years ago and the battles still being waged for peace and democracy in Ukraine. In his remarks, President Biden issued a call to action on that forever cause. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Will we stand for freedom? Will we defend democracy? Will we stand together? My answer is yes and only can be yes.

Well, 80 years ago today, the Soviet Union was, of course, fighting alongside the U.S. and its allies to defeat Nazi Germany. Today, Russia missing from that stage in Normandy. Russian representatives not invited to attend because its ongoing invasion of Ukraine. The last time Putin attended D-Day commemorations was in 2014, after Russia's annexation of Crimea and following, of course, its first partial invasion of Ukraine. Yesterday, the Russian president warned Western countries that he could arm their enemies if Ukraine uses NATO supplied weapons, to strike inside Russia. CNN's Oren Liebermann joins me now from the Pentagon. Oren, Cuba's foreign ministry has just announced that Russian navy ships including, and this is crucially, nuclear powered submarine well visit the island, what, 90 miles off the coast of Florida, as part of their historically friendly relations.

And as you point out this time, it does look like it'll be a larger scale, beginning sometime next week, including a Russian nuclear powered submarine. Now it's worth noting that Russia has not yet publicly commented about this. But Cuba's government says this won't involve any nuclear weapons, and that it's not a threat to anybody in the region. The U.S. largely views it the same way, saying it does not pose a threat to the United States, even as it's obvious that the Pentagon will be monitoring what's happening here. The Pentagon also says a spokesperson here but one of the reasons this may involve a Russian nuclear powered submarine is because Cuba was angry when it was a U.S. nuclear power to tax submarine that visited Guantanamo Bay last year. So this may be at least a partial response to that. Nevertheless, the U.S., of course, closely monitoring this, but not viewing it as a threat and at least right now, not viewing this as an attempt to escalate anything, even with Vladimir Putin's recent threats there.",

Is that a significant shot across the bow as it were for the U.S. from Putin? GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, I think it's just more hybrid warfare and maneuvering, but I am concerned about Guyana because Maduro in Valenzuela is a Russian client. He visited Putin in December. I was down in Guyana. There really having trouble sort of grappling with what this means, just as Venezuela builds up forces to intervene, possibly in Guyana.

We should note she actually dated Hunter Biden during the time that he purchased the firearm, which is at the center of these charges. President Biden weighed in on the trial today. In an interview with ABC News, he said he would not pardon his son if Hunter is found guilty, adding that he would accept the outcome of the trial. CNN's Marshall Cohen is tracking all of this for us. And, Marshall, I understand that Hallie has now left the courthouse. She is off the stand. What do we learn exactly from her testimony today? MARSHALL COHEN, CNN REPORTER: Jim, in many ways, Hallie, Biden was the star witness for special counsel, David Weiss. She is the only person who is actually with Hunter that month in October 2018 when he bought the gun, who is testifying in this case, and importantly, she's the one who took that gun out of his car threw it in a dumpster and that's what triggered the series of events that led to this prosecution. So she did give some help to the prosecutor while she was on the stand. She said that she observed what she believed was a Hunter Biden under the influence of drugs in October 2018. And she also said that on the day that she searched his car and found the gun, that she also saw what she believed was powder residue of drugs on the day she found that gun. However, during the cross-examination while she was questioned by Hunter's defense attorneys, she acknowledged that she never actually witnessed Hunter Biden using drugs or even drinking alcohol in her presence in October of 2018. And, Jim, in addition to all that, she did talk about her own struggles with drug abuse. She said that Hunter introduced her to crack cocaine and that she used the drug for a period of time which she said was one of the most embarrassing and shameful and regretful periods of her life. So she's done now. They have a member of the Delaware state police who actually recovered the weapon. He's on the stand now and remember, prosecutor said they think they might be able to wrap things up today, but Hallie went pretty long. So this may stretch into tomorrow -- Jim.",

Number three, you cannot illegally possess one.So the critical inquiry and why she is so important, she being the widow of his brother, Beau, attorney general, one-time attorney general of Delaware. He involved in a romantic relationship that is Hunter Biden, she knew what he was doing, what his activities were, what his proclivities were, what his inclinations were, and whether he was actually using at the time. Remember, the core issue for the prosecutors are what? What did at the time of the purchase, the defense trying to establish that at that specific time, he wasn't so to the extent that she said she did not see him, right specifically making an observation of amusing drugs it could be that during that roller coaster of a time as many addicts endure, that he was not addicted at the time. And that's the specter of doubt that is trying to be raised. And so when you say if they hit the mark, I think the jury can process it needs to determine that, hey, he had to be an addict at that time because of the proximity of his usages that she described in his behavior as she described, but the defense saying, well, you didn't see him doing it and certainly acts go in and out.

Or if he didn't willfully indicate that he was, you know, lying, then it wouldn't be a lie, and so that gets him out from under lying to a federally licensed dealer or lying on the form or illegally possessing. So that's what they're using. And just quickly, Jim, I think a big issue in the case for me is going to be whether the jury nullifies. This is a really a public shaming, right, of someone who is addicted. And I know the prosecution is saying addiction is not on trial, lying is on trial, but I think that the defense through all of this humiliating testimony about what he was enduring, what he was undergoing, what he was going through, the jury, it may resonate with them, people who know addicts, people know addicts overcome so much of, why are we here? Are these resources really being brought to bear on this when the gun was for 11 days, when there was no untoward, inappropriate, or illegal use with that gun? S a critical question inquiry for me is even if prosecutors technically prove their case, whether the jury's -- his hometown Delaware say, hey, wait a second. We're going to kick it out anyway.

However when you talk about messaging, there is a little but particularly right now of continuing to harp on that trial using that trial to try and raise money.And I will say when I got here, Charlie Kirk was up the stage, the head of Turning Point, which is an organization aligned with Donald Trump. He's friends with Don Jr., he was talking about essentially giving more money to Donald Trump because of the verdict in that case. So, they are still using that messaging. But we are told today that Donald Trump is expected to focus more on political. Whether or not he can actually do that remains to be seen because as you have noted, most of what we've heard from them has been rants against the justice system, against Biden, essentially calling himself the victim and saying that this is political persecution. Obviously, he said, there's absolutely no evidence that Joe Biden had anything to do with this. This is the case that was brought by the state of New York. But last night, we actually heard from Donald Trump in an interview with Sean Hannity and he seemed to be trying to give him an out on this idea that he would seek retribution if he was reelected to office. It didn't go as it seemed Hannity wanted it to. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The cliffs in shores where 150,000 Allied soldiers defeated the Nazis 80 years ago are literally disappearing before our eyes. The Normandy climate change report last year concluded two-thirds of its coastline is already eroding with climate change-fueled sea level rise and storms further endangering historic sites there.CNN chief climate correspondent Bill Weir has more on that threat. Bill, the Normandy tourism office lists 100 places more along the coastline to visit. And remember, but many of them are now being washed away? Tell us what's happening.",

There's a memorial for the Rangers near Utah beach that is on a cliff face that crumbled recently, they had to close that out of safety concerns. But it's just a matter of time, sort of a military metaphor, the war with an angry or nature is fought at sea levels by inch by inch by day by day.And then big events like there was a storm Kieran (ph) a couple of seasons ago, just massive winds came in and that can batter and erode beaches much faster. That that report that said two-thirds are receding, said there's no sort of data to show that storms are getting more frequent there, but sea level rise is this is increasing. It's still, you know, in small measurements, but going up more rapidly. And so just like everywhere else from Charleston in the United States, where they're planning $1 billion seawall to the outer banks in North America, historic places, going back on this side of the pond to the revolutionary war and over there there's something poignant about that, especially for the Western world. But this will affect very special places to people everywhere, South Asia and Africa. And so, but this is sort of, unfortunately the new reality, what to do, what to save, how to -- how to save it?",
