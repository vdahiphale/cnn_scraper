We begin with new developments in two investigations to leave Washington in a remarkable and unprecedented place. Both the current and most recent former president, now face special counsel investigations for mishandling classified documents.The Trump investigation is months old, and the Justice Department is now questioning whether former President Trump has fully complied with the subpoena issued back in May to hand over all classified documents he took with him when he left office. Sources telling CNN federal investigators want to talk to two people hired to search Trump's properties back in November for any additional records that have not been turned over. And now President Biden faces his own special counsel investigation after his lawyers discovered Obama era documents in his garage and a personal office in his Wilmington home and also in a Washington D.C office, Mr. Biden used during the Trump presidency. There are important distinctions between the two investigations. The Trump reviews involved way more classified records and questions of obstruction once the government demanded their return. Team Biden says it immediately notified the appropriate agencies when the first documents were found, and that it worked with the Justice Department on the search that turned up additional classified records at the president's home. Still, there are important unanswered questions in both investigations. CNN senior crime and justice reporter Katelyn Polantz joins us now with some new reporting. Katelyn, what do we know?",

Kaitlan Collins and I have confirmed that the Justice Department now wants to question to people that Donald Trump's legal team hired in November to go and search four different locations, his properties in New Jersey, New York City and Florida.Those two people had found two classified documents just this November, after the Mar-a-Lago search, after the Trump team sent back many classified documents to the Justice Department last year, they still were finding records. Now the Justice Department wants to talk to them. So, this is an indication of an ongoing criminal investigation where work is still being done by prosecutors. And we also know that the Justice Department has considered whether there has been obstruction of justice here, that is something that they have been investigating that makes this much different from the Biden situation as we know it right now. We also know that the Justice Department federal investigators want to make sure that they have gotten everything back from the Trump team two years after his presidency, that they are in court under seal that court fight is still unresolved, and that court fight is about making sure they get everything. Now they are still trying to investigate and nail down what happened with these investigators who found two classified documents just in November. John?",

With me to share their reporting and their insights, Tamara Keith of NPR, CNN's Evan Perez, and our senior legal analyst Elie Honig.Evan, let me follow up on Katelyn's point based on everything we know today. And we're open minded to surprises because they often happen in special counsel investigations. What is the clearest way to explain the distinction? A Trump investigation that's months old, more documents, allegations and some evidence the Justice Department would say of obstruction or at least not cooperation? And what we know about the Biden investigations?",

It is not a cooperative process, despite what the former president's team likes to portray.In the case of Biden, you know, they are trying to portray that they had been Boy Scouts on this right, that they went to the archives as soon as they found these initial set of documents. And then of course, while the U.S. attorney in Chicago was starting to investigate it, they turned up another set of documents in December 20. And so, that's the biggest difference, but we can look at what was happening in the Trump case, to sort of get a little preview of what we're going to see in the Biden case. And that is, you know, at some point, the Justice Department is going to ask the Biden team to attest, but there's nothing more right, that there you've searched everywhere, and they're going to want to talk to those people. There might come a time when they were going to ask to talk to the president. How do they handle that? Again, that's going to be where the spirit of cooperation and, you know, getting along, may get its first test.",

He was nominated to a prior position by Donald Trump. But I think when you look at the body of his work, he's not a partisan player. I think he's somebody who based on what he's done, can be trusted to do this in a straightforward way.And by the way, I think it was a very smart and necessary move by Merrick Garland, both to appoint special counsel and to appoint somebody who at least gives the perception of being if anything leaning conservative. Because if he had appointed somebody who had Democratic leaning credentials, that would override the entire purpose of appointing special counsel, which is to get rid of any potential appearance of a conflict of interest. I think Merrick Garland had to appoint special counsel here, especially because he already appointed special counsel for Donald Trump. If there's a conflict of interest in Joe Biden's DOJ investigating Donald Trump, there absolutely is a conflict of interest in Joe Biden's DOJ investigating Joe Biden, so we did the right move here.",

He got a good inflation report this week. The president wanted to get off on a very different early January, if you will, or mid-January.Instead, we're going through the timeline and trying to answer questions about how this happened. It was back in November, Biden lawyers found documents at his former D.C. office, they notify the archives. On the two days later, the archives notified the Justice Department. The attorney general asked the Chicago based Trump holdover U.S. attorney to look into this very smart there, give it to a Trump holdover. Biden lawyers then find additional docks in the Wilmington garage. The White House acknowledges not in January, January 9, December 20 they were found. January 9, the White House acknowledges them. And then on January 12, yesterday, we get the special counsel. In terms of having to deal with this, what is it doing to the White House?",

They didn't tell the public before the midterms, even though they had found the documents. They didn't tell them after. Their argument is that they've been waiting for the process to play out. And if you look at the president's public remarks, he keeps saying, well, God willing, I should be able to talk more about this soon as if he thought it was going to end. Obviously, it is not ending it, it's sort of metastasized into becoming a special counsel investigation.

I came to Washington back in the days of Lawrence Walsh Iran- Contra that went on, I believe, for seven years something to that effect. If this - view and Evan both described Mr. Hur as a stand-up guy, as a career prosecutor, a guy who's going to follow the letter of the law based on everything we know. If this was just a mistake. If it's wrong, I'm not justifying it in any way. But if the documents came for some briefing that was legitimate, and then were not returned, and there's no nefarious intent here, how long would something like this end? And what is the end? If it's wrong, and it shouldn't have happened. People should have had the experience to not do this, but you find no nefarious event. What is the conclusion?",

And sometimes the mission tends to expand. But that said, I think you've hit on the exact make or break issue here, which is, did Joe Biden know about these documents? Did he have intent? Now he has denied categorically that he knew anything about them. That's where you have to focus your investigation. Now, you don't necessarily take someone at their word, you want to test that? So, you want to investigate? How did the documents get there? Why are they stored this way? Who didn't know about this, but if you can confirm and locked down, that Joe Biden did not know about these documents, it's over case over.There's no criminal case to be made. I'm not saying that's what the conclusion is going to be. But if you can get there very quickly as a prosecutor, then you don't need to worry about all the other stuff because there's no criminal charge without knowledge.",

So, his belief whether the storm, let's see what happens, it'll probably go to the ethics committee, that's going to take some time. Yes, there'll be new revelation after revelation. He also says that look, the precedent in the - the rules in the conference, say if someone's indicted, you lose your committee assignments, then they'll take action like that.

When we didn't hear anything when this story was breaking back in December, we've heard him say that he's going to not see him on the top committees.But if you think about it, members of Congress do have access, they are privy to certain security issues. If you think about it during the few months of the Ukraine war, they had briefings on the Hill for all members of Congress. So, it's not just about the committees, it's really a broader look at how much access a member of Congress has.
