He was also shown how the water then has been pumped out. At one point, though, we could hear him asking about the smell at the site, the acrid smell, which is still here.It remains to be seen if he will be speaking with residents. We do know he will be speaking with reporters here. As you know, Jim and Kristin, he has come under fire for not coming here to East Palestine earlier, so we will see if he does speak with residents later on. We did hear from the residents last night, though, in no uncertain terms during that CNN town hall, many of them angry, frustrated over the response.

And a lot of folks here are wondering why was that decision made, what wasn't the decision made instead to dig up all of that contaminant soil so it doesn't remain there, test it and then cart it out of here?

Look at the compensation for the employees, it is $2.6 billion. But keep in mind, there are about 19,000 employees at Norfolk Southern. So, we are really talking about only just north of $100,000 for the average employee salary. And when we talk about the profits, right, that Norfolk Southern pulls in, look at this, $4.8 billion last year. It was $4.45 billion in profits back in 2021.

That is what the NTSB will find, and really assess some blame to figure out exactly what the mechanical failure was and who is to blame for that. There are still big questions here.

I mean, I look at this report, it says that the train was traveling below the authorized speed limit at the time of the derailment, 47 miles per hour speed, maximum would be 50 miles an hour.

People are familiar with the federal, state and local governments' responsibility for highways and roads, the federal government through FAA is responsible for the airspace.But going back over 100 years ago, the railroads carved very favorable positions for themselves, and they own their own lines. There are thousands of lines that carry these hazardous materials across the country. And the federal government essentially along with Congress has failed the oversight of these companies and they ensured that regulations are being followed. You know, I have followed transportation industry for over three decades, and what we see with this horrible derailment is the same situation we saw with the Boeing Max. It appears that the company moves towns, moves headquarters, changes sales stock for their own benefit of the executives and the federal government does not pay attention until something like this happens. In fact, the head of Norfolk Southern guaranteed the people of East Palestine that they are going to be taken care of, but what about citizens in communities all across the United States, because in every city (INAUDIBLE), there are these trains running with hazardous materials?
