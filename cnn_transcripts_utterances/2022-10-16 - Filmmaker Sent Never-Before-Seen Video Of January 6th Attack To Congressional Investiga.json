What we know is that the 2020 election was actually the most secure, transparent and verified election in American history. More paper ballots than ever before including 2016. More audits of those ballots than ever before. More litigation to clarify the rules and to confirm the results than never before, and yet still we're seeing that disconnect.And in these two years, we're now over 700 days since the 2020 election, these two years have just seen more and more lying to this sincerely disappointed supporters. Not all of them are violent insurrectionist. Many of them are just sincerely disappointed and wanted President Trump to win. They're raising money off of those people and they're continuing to tell them that elections are rigged. Arizona is a great state as an example. You've got a state like Arizona that has pretty much the same election rules they've had for the last two decades. Same as in 2020. Largely put in place by Republicans in that state. And yet the Republican candidate for governor in that state and other candidates in that state are not willing to accept the judgment of the voters regardless of what happens even if that means that maybe they lose.",

Because this was a premeditated attack by the executive branch, which I've covered alongside you and many others, on the legislative branch which I also spent a decade covering. That's what it was.

Our election system is as good as it's ever been. We don't have something like slavery during the civil war that we have to figure out a way to fix. We have a good election system. It's getting better every day. Solutions include participate.If you really have doubts or questions, go and volunteer to be a poll worker, learn about the ins and outs of what's going on, the checks and balances, the redundancies, the transparency, the bipartisanship and professionalism of that. You'll see why poll workers have to show up a few hours before the polls open and stay several hours afterwards. That's because they're checking a lot of boxes with a lot of observers. We also have to I think move towards the Electoral Count Act reforms that are being proposed in both Houses right now. They're both very good. They're slightly different but they both clarify the rules. They don't change the law. The vice president never had the ability to choose the president. But they make clear to everyone involved that there is -- the process has already been determined, the electoral votes are already certified, you're just there for a ceremony to present them and count them. And then finally we're seeing this now hopefully some accountability. Accountability for the bad actors who for two years now have led violence, have led to harassment and abuse and threats against election officials, and who continue to profit from that abuse. We saw in Arizona, for instance, the Republican attorney general just referred a group that has been doing that, that has been lying for some time, to the IRS and the FBI because they failed to present evidence of any claims that would support a claim of voter fraud.",

He is escalating in terms of the threats he's making. The implications.I actually took this last comment of his to be a little bit of a climb down because if you remember, over the last week or two, he had been casually talking about using all means necessary, clearly implying nuclear weapons to defend Russia. Now what he's saying is, you know, I don't want to get into a world war. It would be dangerous. So that's in some ways an improvement and I think it probably reflects a certain confidence he has that the new troops he's sending in are going to stabilize the situation. I don't know if that's true. These are 300,000 untrained or poorly trained troops, you know, but I get the feeling that he is not ready any time soon to compromise. The Ukrainians are of course not.
