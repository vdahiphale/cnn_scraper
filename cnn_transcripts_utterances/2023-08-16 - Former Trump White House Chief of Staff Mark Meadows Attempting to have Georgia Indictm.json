There are just nine days left for Trump to turn himself in. The district attorney, Fani Willis, has given Trump and 18 co- defendants until noon next Friday to surrender. One of Trump's alleged co-conspirators, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows is fighting to move the case from state court to federal court. Maybe he can get it dismissed, then.

To be clear, once again, Georgia confirmed Joe Biden won after ballots were counted three times. That included a recount by hand of every ballot in every county. An audit of voter signatures on absentee ballots found zero fraud. Trump's lawyers brought at least a half-a-dozen cases to court to challenge the results. They lost or withdrew them all.

BOB MARSHALL, CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, WHISKER LABS: Yeah, we've got an advanced sensor network all over the island of Maui and across the United States, and they measure the quality and the reliability of the power grid. So, in the United States, voltage in our homes should be 120 voltage. Precisely at the same time as video shows that arc flash, we measured in ten different sensors a sharp drop in voltage, which is indicative of an arc flash.

And aloha for us is to just have that patience. And the second word I want to bring up is malama. Malama in Oleo, Hawaii, the language of Hawaii is to take care.
