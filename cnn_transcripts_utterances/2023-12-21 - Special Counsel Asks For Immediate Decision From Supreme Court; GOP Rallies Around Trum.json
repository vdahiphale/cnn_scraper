Donald Trump is on a social media tear, sending dozens of posts and reposts, slamming the court ruling that kicked him off the ballot in Colorado. His Republican rivals are for the most part standing with him.Plus, President Biden is grappling with a critical decision on Israel. The U.N Security Council is set to vote on a resolution to stop the fighting in Gaza. Big question, will the U.S. block it? And Congress is paralyzed. Lawmakers heading home for the holidays after one of the most unproductive years in history. And 2024 might be even worse. I'm Jim Acosta in for Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines in Inside Politics. I want to start with Jack Smith responding to Trump's legal team, trying to delay the January 6 case. The special counsel is stressing the gravity of the situation and urging the Supreme Court to immediately hear the dispute over presidential immunity. And CNN's senior crime and justice correspondent Katelyn Polantz is following all the developments for us. Katelyn, what are we hearing about the special counsel's requests?",

A legal issue that has to be determined before Donald Trump goes to trial. That trial is set for March in federal court in Washington.And so, there's been a back and forth here of whether it's time for the Supreme Court to step in now to look at these legal issues and to decide them with some sort of finality about the immunity around the presidency, the protections around the presidency. And so now, the Supreme Court could act at any moment. They could decide to take this case or not. If they choose not to or if they sit on it, is going to be an issue -- a legal issue that intermediary court. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals already has teed up to be looking at in the beginning of January but there is a lot at stake here. And the latest filing that came in from the Justice Department, Jim, today argues that this is an issue of great constitutional moment. They cannot be clear that this is one of the most significant constitutional issues in criminal history for the country and that they want the Supreme Court to be dealing with it now that it doesn't need to be going through these extra steps. Of course, Donald Trump says, well, we can delay because everything here is political.",

Maybe there are some things that could find a way to the appeals courts, but very unlikely because what is charged in that case about the documents that happened after Trump was president. And so, this presidential immunity issue, it's the one thing where Trump's team has this opening to argue. We don't need the case to go to trial right now and the Justice Department is saying no.

And the bottom line to all this is Nikki Haley has been saying and Ron DeSantis -- when you've sort of brushed aside his conspiracy theories on this been saying that look, do you want all of this drama again? Do you want 2024 to be playing out at the Supreme Court or should this be about you? The challenge is though, at least the Republican primary, the base is still very squarely behind Donald Trump. And, you know, this has elevated him throughout the year. One thing I noticed this morning, when the Florida governor was out campaigning and said, what if the indictments hadn't happened back in April? What if Alvin Bragg hadn't indicted Donald Trump?

And it's proven to outlast a lot longer than I think they were anticipating. But as for the red meat that he's throwing at these voters. I think it's important to remember that this is an entirely new rhetoric from Donald Trump in 2016. In 2020, we've seen him use the same type of anti-immigration, violent, dark rhetoric. If anything, though, it's become far more extreme and far more dark now that it's in 2024. But you're right, they are responding very well to it.",

Let's do something different or let's stick with Biden. TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, THE ATLANTA JOURNAL- CONSTITUTION: Yeah. I think what the voters talking about is definitely the conversation about the general election and why Republicans are concerned that a Donald Trump nomination would make it easier for four more years of Joe Biden but unfortunately, we are in primary time right now. And what we're hearing from Republican voters in the primaries in a lot of the early states is that they're sticking with Donald Trump. They like his rhetoric, or at least they're responding well to it. The fact that he's playing the victim, they're responding to it. Donald Trump has shown he knows how to speak to his base and keep his support strong, quite frankly, and build support in some ways. So, what message resonates with primary voters is one that benefits Trump. But the concern in the party is that that same message will not communicate well in a general election.

The other concern is that this would slow humanitarian aid into Gaza with U.N. monitoring. Now Secretary of State Antony Blinken has expressed some optimism. He said, just yesterday that they expect or he's hopeful to get to \"a good place.\" But of course, Jim, all of this comes against the backdrop of the growing death toll in Gaza. U.S. officials have said that they expect Israel to transition to a more precise military operation, one that targets Hamas leadership. But they are still waiting and in discussion with Israel about avoiding civilian casualties.
