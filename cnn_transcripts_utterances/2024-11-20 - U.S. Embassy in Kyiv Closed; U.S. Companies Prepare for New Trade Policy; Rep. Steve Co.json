Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin telling reporters it would be up to $275 million and include rocket systems and artillery. It comes as another major policy shift from President Biden as he attempts to bolster Ukraine in the last months of his presidency. The administration is now giving the Pentagon the OK to send anti-personnel landmines to that country. And this comes after Biden gave Ukraine the green light to strike deep inside Russia with these long-range missiles, the first strikes coming on Tuesday.Russian President Vladimir Putin responding by lowering the threshold for their use of nuclear weapons. Russia now saying that any attack supported by a nuclear power could be met with a nuclear response. The State Department slamming that change in policy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

What - what does - what does that set up here across the world big picture? STEPHEN COLLINSON, CNN POLITICS SENIOR REPORTER: Well, it's always been clear that even if Biden won the election there was going to be some kind of negotiation next year about ending this war. That's become more intense by the fact that Trump won and he's made no secret of the fact that he wants to end the war. This is all about creating situations on the ground that advantage Zelenskyy in the eventual negotiations that come. Everyone knows what it's going to look like. There's going to be a divide. Putin is going to get his reward for the invasion. He's going to bite off more Ukrainian territory. He's trying to get as much as he can. He's trying to expel Ukrainians from the Kursk region of Russia to set up the negotiations. It's all about the terms. Does Ukraine get some kind of path to NATO? Does it get some association with the EU. In a way, what the president is doing, while it's escalating the situation, it is giving Trump some tools because Putin is doing so well right now in the war. I don't think he's going to make it easy for Trump in ending this war. He's going to drive a hard bargain.",

The Walmart CFO, John David Rainey, also told CNBC yesterday that while that company never wants to raise prices, there will probably be cases where prices will go up for consumers.The statements coming as other retailers like Elf Beauty, AutoZone, Columbia Sportswear also warned they may have to raise prices to offset heavier tariffs.
