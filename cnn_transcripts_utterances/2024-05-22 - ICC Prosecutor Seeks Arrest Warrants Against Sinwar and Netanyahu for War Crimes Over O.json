Next, we head to Ukraine, as the U.S. ally fights back against its neighbor Russia, which invaded the sovereign nation more than two years ago. Heavy fighting is raging in the eastern Kharkiv region of Ukraine, as billions in new U.S. aid is just now making it onto the battlefield. CNN`s Nick Paton Walsh takes us to the front lines.

Like so much in this fast-changing war, their task was unimaginable when Moscow invaded. Their target is on the horizon, Russia itself, into which they fly and plant mines on key roads. They wait for dark. WALSH (on camera): Those lights twinkling over there on the horizon, that`s Belgorod, Russia. How close they`re operating towards Russian mainland. PATON WALSH (voice over): Putin`s latest offensive towards Kharkiv has made the fight personal for Artem. His parents live about a five-minute drive away and fighting for his literal home is unsettling. ARTEM, DRONE OPERATOR, \"CODE 9.2\" DRONE UNIT (through translator): It`s anxious. For real. For a year and a half they didn`t know that I`m in a combat brigade fighting near Bakhmut. I was telling them I`m guarding checkpoints. PATON WALSH (voice over): And now, for the first of many times, their only defense is to listen for drones.",

All right, sea stars, if you said giant squid, you are correct. They can grow up to 60 feet long. It`s the world`s largest invertebrate, which is an animal with no backbone. For our penultimate story of the day, we get a glimpse of some rare footage of a deep-sea squid. Scientists from the U.K. and Australia captured visuals of this deep sea hooked squid, one of the largest deep-water squids in the world. It was filmed grabbing a camera over 1,000 meters deep in the South Pacific. The creature flashed bioluminescent lights on two of its arms and sank the camera. Those lights, called photophores, are the largest known in the world. They`re typically used to startle prey. Scientists say the squid mistook the camera for a snack. Today`s story getting a 10 out of 10, a real-life magnet man cleaning up the streets. Did you know that according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the average American produces almost five pounds of garbage each day? And some of that trash ends up on the streets. Use a trash can, people. Well, you`re about to meet a superhero of sorts, a man with a genius plan to keep the streets clean. Meet Alex Benigno. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

My initial goal was to clean up my route to work. And when I started doing this, I had no idea just how much more was out there that I never saw before. I put a lot of research into it, a lot of trial and error, trying to figure out what would be the best way. The goal was to get the magnets as close to the ground as possible, and the easiest way was on a bicycle trailer. So I put these rows in this configuration to make it easier to go over bumps, and then I just kept going with it and see, well, how much can I pick up? And within eight weeks, I went 522 miles and collected 410 pounds. That`s a lot of stuff. Wow. It never ceases to amaze me every single time I lift this up, just how much I`ve picked up. After I made the Instagram account, people will message me and ask me to do areas that are particularly bad. You know, it makes me realize just how important it is to get this out to as many people as I possibly can. Any bit of free time I have, I dedicate to doing this. And my goal is to try to get as many other people interested in pulling these behind their bicycles, and they can do the same thing in their neighborhoods. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
