Thanks for joining us. And we begin in Syria where CNN's team in the capital of Damascus heard strikes in the early hours of Monday morning after the fall of Assad's regime. It's not immediately clear who carried out those strikes. On Sunday, the leader of the rebel forces in Damascus delivered his first public remarks since their takeover of the country. Abu Mohammed Al-Julani says defeating the Assad regime is a, quote, \"victory for the entire Islamic nation.\" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ABU MOHAMMED AL-JULANI, LEADER, HAYAT TAHRIR AL-SHAM MAN (through translation):  This victory, my brothers, is a victory for the entire Islamic nation. This new triumph, my brothers, marks a new chapter in the history of the region, a history fraught with dangers. Leaving Syria as a playground for Iranian ambitions, spreading sectarianism, stirring corruption, it became the world's leading source of Captagon. But today, Syria is being purified by the grace of God Almighty and through the efforts of the eroque (ph) mujahideen. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So no one is going to shed a tear, Rosemary, for Assad being an exile in, Moscow, which is where the Russian say he has ended up tonight.But that leaves open the question of who's going to rule the country. And the lead rebel group that was behind this was known a number of years ago as Al-Qaeda in Syria. They have since said that they transformed themselves and there are no longer Sunni hard line Al- Qaeda adherents, much more of nationalist tendencies. Other rebel groups joined who have differing views as well.

Israel has certainly maintained a close eye on the Syrian defenses.But we have to remember something. A lot of these weapon caches are as we found as we discovered in Gaza, they're in tunnels. There was -- there were a couple of reports even today that the Syrian opposition forces have now found some of these tunnels. They were searching some of these tunnels, ostensibly to find Bashar Assad. But tunnels, areas in which these weapon systems and especially chemicals could be maintained, it is of absolute critical importance that some organized force that is attentive and concerned about the horrible implications of these weapons should take custody and control.

Of course, it's a speculation, but aggressive period of negotiations with whomever appears to be in charge of Syria. And to what extent, for instance, Julani is in charge remains to be seen.But it's to Russia's best interest to open up communication and dialogue with these new powerful political forces. And Russia might not necessarily stand and say, look, we're guilty of supporting Assad all these years. What Russia will say is that there's a continued benefit for us to be present in Syria. And as one of the last speakers, the last contributor before me, there is that strongly suggests that the U.S. not necessarily put forces on the ground, not to intervene, not to chase after the weapons of mass destruction, but should enter into some diplomatic dialogue with the surviving forces. Meaning those forces that have now assumed responsibility for Syria and establish that to some degree, the U.S. must be interested, must dialogue, has to communicate because of all the problems that are going to arise in the development of, hopefully, a new and much more democratic Syria.",

Let it play out do not get involved. But then overnight, after the rebels had successfully taken over Damascus, Donald Trump wrote this. He said, quote, Assad is gone. He has fled his country, his protector, Russia, Russia, Russia, led by Vladimir Putin, was not interested in protecting him any longer. He went on to argue that Russia is now in a weakened state due to its war with Ukraine, and then said that Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president who he met with just on Saturday, a day before in France, he said that he wants to, quote, would like to make a deal and stop the madness. He then went on to urge Russian President Vladimir Putin to come to the negotiating table, saying that he knows Putin very well and wants to see an end to that war.
