The judge's ruling included a heated response to the special counsel scathing criticism of how she's handling the case. And troubling new details emerging about the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, CNN has exclusively obtained transcripts of interviews with State Department officials that were kept under wraps until now. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. Let's get right to the breaking news on President Biden making new demands of Israel. The deadly strikes on aid workers in Gaza apparently, a tipping point for the Biden administration. I'll speak with the key White House official, John Kirby, in just a few minutes. He's standing by. But, first, let's go to CNN Senior White House Correspondent Kayla Tausche.

And it becomes an increasingly challenging political question for him here at home, with pro-Palestinian protests erupting nationwide, and many questions for him and his administration about why there haven't been consequences for Israel so far. There were high stakes for the conversation that took place today. It lasted about 30 minutes during the middle of the day. And certainly there were high expectations too, especially after Israel had said that this is the type of attack that happens in war, calling it unintentional, and launching its own preliminary investigation, which concluded this week, and a full investigation that will follow. The U.S. so far had said that it would reserve judgment on exactly how this happened until that full investigation took place. But here's how events unfolded in Washington and in Brussels today.

They have already begun briefing relevant parties on this. But I do think it is important to note just how significant and how different this investigation is into the deaths of these aid workers than anything else that we have seen since the beginning of this war. We have see tens of thousands of civilians, Palestinian civilians, killed in this war since October, and yet this is the first time we've seen such a thorough, comprehensive and public accounting of the deaths of civilians there's no question that the fact that six out of seven of these aid workers were foreigners is playing a factor, not only in the Israeli response but also, of course, in international uproar.",

It's not about the precision of the weapons. It is about the decision- making process, the human loop that actually gets after those targets and makes the proper analysis.
