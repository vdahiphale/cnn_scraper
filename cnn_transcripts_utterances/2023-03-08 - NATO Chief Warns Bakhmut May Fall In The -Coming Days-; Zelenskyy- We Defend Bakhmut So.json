I'm Wolf Blitzer.At this very, very moment, Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and his nation, are facing a critical time, in Russia's invasion, now in its second year. For the first time, in some eight months, the Russians could, could be on the cusp of capturing a Ukrainian city, Bakhmut, in the east, the site of the longest and bloodiest battle of this war. NATO Secretary General warned that Bakhmut may fall in the coming days. Today, Ukraine's military claims to be holding off Vladimir Putin's army, in areas, around the city, saying they killed more than 100 Russian soldiers, in a 24-hour period. But they also acknowledge, the Russians are still advancing and they're advancing fast. We're live in Ukraine's capital, we're seeing, as Alex Marquardt, is standing by, with the very latest, from the ground. But first, President Zelenskyy says if the Russians gained control of Bakhmut, it could change the course of the entire war. Here's part one of my interview. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Why have you decided not to withdraw from Bakhmut? ZELENSKYY (through translator): Firstly, thank you, and all your audience, for this opportunity, to talk to you. And international support is extremely important to us. And the international support is no less important than the support with weapons. That's why, thank you, again. As to Bakhmut situation, we understand what Russia wants to achieve there. Russia needs at least some victory, a small victory, even by ruining everything, in Bakhmut, just killing every civilian there. They need to put their little flag on top of that, to show their society. It's not a victory for them. It's more like support to mobilize their society, in order to create this idea of they're such a powerful army. For us, it's certainly (ph) different, this is tactical for us. We understand that after Bakhmut, they could go further. They could go to Kramatorsk, to Sloviansk. And it will be open roads for the Russians, after Bakhmut, to other towns, in Ukraine, in the Donetsk direction, in the east of Ukraine. That's why our guys are standing there.",

We don't have that, and we won't get it in one or two years, because this manufacturing is a long process. But what fighter jets could do, they could help us, to defend ourselves. That's why we need it urgently. And I explained it to President Biden. And I said, \"Let's just start the training mission.\" And I have the confirmation from the Polish, and the U.K. side that they would go ahead, with the training mission, tomorrow. [21:20:00] And the coalition of the fighter jets, for different countries, they want to have the U.S. decision. That's why, as I said, a lot depends on the U.S., here, because we're talking about a training mission and the supply of fighter jets, by other countries. They wait for the United Nations -- United States' decision. That's what I said to President Biden. And I said, \"OK, let's work on this issue.\" So, a ball was in the court of the U.S. President.

And we've had a look at the very own (ph) memory Wall of Remembrance of our fallen heroes. And I'm happy that the sirens didn't affect President Biden, or his team.
