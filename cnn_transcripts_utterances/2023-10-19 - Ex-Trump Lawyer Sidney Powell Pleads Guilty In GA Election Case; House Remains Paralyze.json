Now, Sidney Powell had been adamant leading up to this that she would not take a plea deal, she wouldn't take her chances in trial that was supposed to start tomorrow.But I'm told that in just the last several hours, you know, a deal did come together that allowed Powell to basically avoid being charged and pleading guilty to felonies. She was facing prison time if convicted of those felonies. Now pleading guilty to six misdemeanors that do take the pressure off her and do add some pressure to her fellow co- defendants. As you said she has to now testify as a witness in the -- because of the terms of this agreement. So we could see her take the stand potentially in a hearing down the line, you know, featuring Donald Trump or Rudy Giuliani, where if she has first-hand knowledge of their efforts to overturn the election results in Georgia.",

But the former president was in New York this week, because he is so worried about what the civil trial up their means for his businesses.And -- but back to what this Sidney Powell situation means, and we should remind our viewers that we're talking about plans to overturn the 2020 election. And specifically, there was a key meeting at the White House, this was December 18th, 2020. Military seizing voting machines and states Trump lost naming Sidney Powell as a special counsel to investigate supposed voter fraud, and Trump invoking martial law to overturn the election. This is just some of what we're talking about. And so if this is a White House meeting, and if, again, this is mostly about -- this is about Georgia, but still, if Sidney Powell is willing to spill the beans on what Donald Trump might have been saying in that White House meeting, that could be significant.",

So, you know, I expect that you will see if she is called to testify, which I expect if there are trials in this case, she will be, her having to talk in full about that.Now remember, she and other participants in that meeting, and it was a wild meeting that we reported on, that CNN reported on, Jonathan Swan at Axios reported on, it was a lengthy, wild meeting that laid bare how serious Donald Trump was about trying to stay in office once we learned of the details. But it's a meeting that Powell and Giuliani and other people who were in that meeting from the other side trying to stop it. Testified to extensively before the House Select Committee investigating Trump's efforts to subvert the election. How much more she would offer on top of that? I don't know. But certainly, prosecutors sometimes tend to ask different questions. And yes, there are a few meetings that were as revealing about Trump's mindset and what he was thinking about than that one, including the fact that he really was talking seriously to people as we reported, as others have about making her a special counsel in the White House and getting her security clearance.",

She is now the former speaker but still very much in the House of Representatives. Nancy Pelosi is here with me now. Thank you so much for being here.First question is about whether or not you and other Democrats will vote to grant Patrick McHenry, more powers, to expand his power so that you can get on with the business of the American people since the Republicans don't have the votes to elect a speaker properly. REP. NANCY PELOSI (D), FORMER HOUSE SPEAKER: Well, my motto is still the same. Our diversity is our strength. So we respect our differences of opinion and that was -- that's what makes us strong. The -- our leader, Hakeem Jeffries has -- just manage this so very, very magnificently as we're listening to our caucus representing us so beautifully. And he will decide what the agreement could be if there is one. So I'll just leave it up to him. However, I will say from the standpoint of the speakership, you really cannot give Mr. McHenry power. Someone suggested, well, just let them do this and let him do that. No, you have to make him speaker and then he has the awesome power of the speakership. Question is, for how long? The longevity of it, my hearing is that it will be to the end of this session. So until the end of the year. Secondly, what is the legislative scope of it? What does it contain? And third, as the structure, what do they do anything about the motion to vacate or what we do about motions -- other motions on the floor? So it's substance, its timing, its structure. It'll be up to Hakeem. And we all have confidence in him.",
