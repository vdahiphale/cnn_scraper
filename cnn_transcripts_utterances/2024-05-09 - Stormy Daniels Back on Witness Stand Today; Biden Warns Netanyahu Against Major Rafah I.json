We're going to have much more from that CNN exclusive interview ahead.Trump's lawyers ready to escalate their attacks on Stormy Daniels when she takes the stand again in just a few hours. And RFK Jr. claiming part of his brain was eaten by a worm. Yes, this is a real story this morning. All right, 6 a.m. here in Washington. Here is a live look at New York City where Stormy Daniels will be back on the stand today. Good morning, everyone, I'm Kasie Hunt. It's wonderful to have you with us. Donald Trump's hush money trial resumes in just a few hours with Stormy Daniels back on the stand. A source telling CNN that Trump's lawyers are planning a longer and more forceful cross-examination to help protect Trump's reputation after Daniels raise the possibility their alleged sexual encounter in 2006 wasn't entirely consensual. Our Brynn Gingras is outside the courthouse in Lower Manhattan this morning with the latest. Brynn, what do you expect today?",

      "sentences": "Yes. Listen, Kasie, this is why the defense attorneys asked for, you know, this trial to be over with, asking the judge basically to rule, because of what Stormy Daniels was testifying to. Of course, that was denied. But we know that the defense attorneys were about 90 minutes into their cross-examination on Tuesday when we last had court. And they still had more to go. They weren't expecting to have a long cross- examination, but like you just said, after her testimony on direct, and basically, they said it's going to take a little bit while longer.Because they want to restore the president [SIC] -- former president's credibility. They want to make sure they address the fact that they believe Stormy Daniels was insinuating to jurors that this was not a consensual relationship. So there's a little bit more to go with Stormy Daniels on the stand. And of course, after the defense is done, then we're going to see redirect from the prosecutors. Now listen, while she was on the stand, you know, there were some really bombshell moments. Really, people were sort of taken aback by everything that she was saying. She was feisty when the defense was starting to question her. With a break in the court, let's see how she is on the stand today. Does she seem more composed? Is the president [SIC] more in tune into what she is saying, as he was seen sort of keeping his eyes closed, as we have seen him in the past with other -- with other witnesses. So yes, that's what we're expecting today and, you know, we don't know if she'll finish on the stand today. It could be a long day of testimony from her again. And it's unclear who, again, is up next. But certainly, we are waiting -- waiting here to see.",

She didn't say no. But she talked about how there was this level of fear. She talked about blacking out, despite a lack of alcohol and drugs.

You just attack a witness, based on things that you heard in the prior examination.Now, usually cross-examinations tend to be shorter than direct examination. You keep it tight, you know, punchy like you've seen on television -- yes-no questions, leading questions -- and then get out of there. The more you have a witness on the stand, even when you have something like this where there's a contradiction, you run the risk of, No. 1, opening up something that isn't great for your own side. And No. 2 -- and this is far more acute here -- appearing to bully and badger the witness. And it's not clear, regardless of what we may say watching this from the outside, it's not clear how the jury is reacting to her. And an attorney sort of being seen as pushing too hard, fighting too hard with a witness can really backfire. So in many respects, yes, it's probably worth a few questions to clean it up, but then get out of there, because they have plenty of time to make arguments about what she says later on in trial.",

You know, the president is, in sort of an impossible situation here, where he's already getting a lot of criticism, even from some Democrats who are strongly pro-Israel.

And he knows that there's an issue in -- in Gaza. And he's trying to protect more human life. And he is saying we are not going to be complicit in you killing more people. So it's not necessarily a policy shift. I think this is where he has -- he's being more empathetic. And he's showing that. And I also -- I disagree a little bit, that he doesn't, you know, say to Netanyahu what he's doing. I think that they are having a lot of private conversations.

Another Jewish student talked about how an anthropology professor wanted him to do a project talking about how the Palestinians were the real victims, and Israel was committing genocide. And she said, Well, I'm Jewish. I lost family during October 7. And the professor said, Well, if you don't write the paper, you're going to fail the class. These students on -- these Jewish students are experiencing very terrible things. You have one student said, I wish I could just leave. I didn't come to college for this. And so I understand no one wants innocent lives to be lost, what about the Jewish students who are having to traverse through college campuses, afraid of their lives, hiding their star of David because they don't know if someone's going to physically or verbally assault them?

The one further to the West that includes most of Alabama and areas of Mississippi, that one is valid until 10 a.m. Central Time today. The newer one, this is the one that includes the bulk of Georgia, including Atlanta, Macon and even Augusta. That one is valid until 1 p.m. Eastern Time this afternoon. And it's all because of this main line of storms that's sliding through. We've got several severe thunderstorm warnings active at this moment. That's what those orange boxes are. And this line is going to slowly make its way South and Eastward in the coming hours. It's not just severe potential, but also flooding. All of these red boxes you see here are flash flood warnings, including a flash flood emergency that is just North of Nashville where they've had four to seven inches of rain that has already fallen, and we're still adding more rain on top of that. There will also be the continued threat for severe storms. That's why we have the tornado watches in effect. But essentially, all of this area you see here has the potential for some large to very large hail, possibly baseball-size. We can also see some damaging winds and, yes, even a few tornadoes. And the tornadoes would likely just add to the already very high tornado count we have. Just in the last 24 hours, we've had 13 tornado reports, 160 wind reports, and 180 hail reports. And that overall number is because of a very long stretch of days that we have had with tornado reports. We are now up to 323 total tornado reports since April 25th, Kasie.
