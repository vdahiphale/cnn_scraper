With Russia's elections on the horizon, we take a look inside Moscow's mission to misinform the public. Then, gangs running riot in Port-au-Prince. A special report on the escalating violence in Haiti. Also, ahead, \"The Real Culture Wars.\" PEN America CEO Suzanne Nossel tells Walter Isaacson how art shapes the contest between democracy and autocracy. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. On this day, five months ago, October 7th, Hamas stormed out of Gaza across Israel's border. And Israel says they murdered 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took another 240 hostage. Now, Palestinian authorities say more than 30,000 people have been killed in Gaza in Israel's ensuing war on Hamas. But the Hamas delegation left ceasefire talks in Cairo today as negotiations stalled. And this leaves in doubt the fate of more than 100 Israelis still held hostage. And across Israel, families are taking to the streets, demanding their government prioritize their release. One of the most fervent campaigners was a hostage herself. Chen Almog- Goldstein witnessed her husband and her eldest daughter murdered in their home by Hamas that day. She and her three youngest children were then kidnapped and held for 51 hellish days in Gaza. She told me in detail about that experience and the moral duty to do everything possible to bring home those still being held. Chen Almog-Goldstein, welcome to our program. You have gone through the most appalling experience. You've lost your husband, you've lost your eldest daughter, and you've been held captive for many, many weeks. You said you were trying to get used to life now without your husband and daughter. Are you managing? CHEN ALMOG-GOLDSTEIN, HUSBAND AND DAUGHTER MURDERED BY HAMAS AND FORMER HOSTAGE HELD BY HAMAS (through translator):  With great pain. The loss is a new feeling for me, such a tragic and deep loss. It's so final. Occasionally, I touch the loss and go back to life, which is very strong. It's hard for me to be in this loss all the time. And in this great pain, losing my eldest daughter, Yam, and my husband, Nadav, we're trying to build something new from this pain. We're trying to build something new because we are alive and we are saved. We're trying to create a new life.",

If you didn't understand, I will repeat, not to let a person cry or give them privacy or take control of our life. This is abuse, mental abuse. They put us in traditional clothes in order to move us from apartment to another, which is supposedly an external act. But Agam and I looked at each other the first time we did it, and we cried. You need to understand, they took our identity away. It was extremely difficult for us. This is also abuse. They didn't hate us. There wasn't any sexual abuse. They humiliated us though, sometimes mocking us. They talked to us about Gilad Shalit and laughed. They told us that we had been forgotten, that the only important thing for Israel was fighting. This is also a type of abuse.",

You may have heardstories that have subsequently been reported about sexual abuse against some of the women hostages. And I wonder whether you were afraid for yourself or for your daughter that there might have been sexual abuse. And did you hear stories from other women about sexual abuse committed against any one of them? ALMOG-GOLDSTEIN (through translator):  We heard stories about cruel sexual attacks. I'm not going to get into it again, following the family's requests. They are concerned about their return back to Israel and their rehabilitation, and asked us not to speak about it anymore. We already talked about it in interviews in order to get international support, but we will now respect the family's requests not to discuss the horrendous sexual abuse cases that took place. Agam and I were worried. She was worried that she would be assaulted. And every time she went to the kitchen to help cooking, for example, I went to the kitchen with her to guard her. I couldn't let go. I would go to the kitchen to make sure she was OK.",

The voices that we should fight for them and not forget them, and that we should do everything, like going to rallies, speaking on their behalf, do everything to release them. They thought that they were going to be next in line. The female civilians and the wounded and the soldiers and the elderly, they were anticipating their release. And since then, three months passed. It's unbelievable this long time has passed, and we don't even know their fate. The people in the Gaza Strip don't know what happened to their loved ones. As uncertainty regarding the hostages and their uncertainty regarding what is happening here, we need to release them. Some of them are injured with complicated injuries, some with mental injuries. We should do everything to release them. We have no right to exist, nor our society, if we don't bring them back. This is a moral duty.",

Injured girls with missing limbs. One of them with an injury on her right arm and could not even move her hand is learning to do everything with her left hand. Do we as a society and the world do everything for them? I can testify that it is hell there. And I must say that I'm sorry that I was harsh, aggressive when you described abuse. There was abuse there throughout. And even if it wasn't rape, it was still abuse to take our freedom away, to eliminate control of our life, or force the children to be quiet, not having your personal space and hunger and terrible hygienic conditions. This is abuse. Taking our identity, forcing us to wear different clothes. Yes, this is abuse.",

SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  Alexei Navalny knew how to get around Putin's propaganda machine and its long-standing policy of ignoring him. From this cramped Moscow headquarters, which I visited in 2017, he and his colleagues beamed their message to millions of Russians via YouTube. And yet, his death was something state media temporarily found itself unable to ignore. First, discrediting his legacy, then blaming the West. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator):  For them, this is excellent timing, we have elections coming up. Support for the president is off the charts. SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  Finally turning on his widow, Yulia. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  We looked at the life of the queen of the opposition, during the time he was in prison. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator):  Two hours after the news of the death of her husband, the wife emerges all made up. Listen, the girls will understand me, even her mascara didn't run. How do you manage that? SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  For Akunin, Navalny's death is more than just a propaganda challenge. It signals propaganda may now be taking a back seat to a much blunter instrument of control outright repression.",

Xi Jinping propounding his principles, publishing a little red book that -- and investing in a big publishing conference here in the United States to spread those ideas around the world, in Russia, elevating, and trying to rehabilitate Stalin and retell the story of his rule, digging up graves to try to contradict the prevailing narrative, jailing historians who expose the truth, shutting down organizations that are focused on historical memory. And so, witnessing the degree to which authoritarians have zeroed in on culture as a centerpiece of how they're advancing their own agenda, how they're sustaining control, how they are projecting a global image, I wanted to focus on the role of democracies and what democracies could do to engage culture.

My argument isabout local cultures and the role of local cultural figures, culture makers, cultural icons, and the power and the potency they can have as counterweights to authoritarians. I've seen it very vividly in Ukraine. We've done a lot of work with PEN Ukraine over the last sort of seven or eight years building up that organization of writers. And Ukraine is a place with a very strong literary and scholarly tradition. And witnessing the pride that they are taking in their own culture now. I went to Ukraine in December of 2022. So, really a dark moment, you know, six or seven months into the war. And when we got there, we were stunned to see in a cultural hall in the center of Kyiv, they were mounting a brand- new exhibition devoted to a venerated philosopher. And it was beautiful. And it had, you know, all kinds of explications of his work and interactive elements, and they had brought there a statue from a museum dedicated to his life. And the statue had been damaged in the war. They had attacked the statue, it was kind of pockmarked, but still standing. So, kind of an icon to the resilience of the Ukrainian people. And just the pride that they had in that exhibition at that moment really spoke to me. I saw to myself that this -- you know, they are deriving strength and spirit and nurture from their own culture to help them get through this moment. And it was just so powerful. And they've continued with that, you know, over the ensuing now, you know, 14 months. They travel all around the country doing events, bringing books to the front lines. They teach the Ukrainian language to Russian speakers who now want the Ukrainians to be their lingua franca. And so, it's extraordinary to see sort of what role culture is playing in their effort to fight off -- fight this war and win this war and sustain the morale of the Ukrainian people. And so, you know, that for me was an important spark for this piece.",

And, you know, all of that over time made it impossible to sustain the story of this powerful nation. Of course, it coincided with economic decline that, you know, overtook them. But I think the cultural piece, the fact that authoritarians pay so much attention to shaping this. And you know, now it's a very different arena. So much of our cultural engagement happens in the digital realm. There are all kinds of efforts through social media, through propaganda and disinformation, now enabled by A.I., where governments can tell whatever story they choose, and they're investing very significantly. You know, the Chinese government in trying to shape the political attitudes of their diaspora communities around the world, through online channels, through news outlets that are controlled in Beijing, that are read by Chinese communities here in the United States, by trying to rein in what Chinese people here in the United States publish or say or what dance performances get done. And so, you know, to me, the amount of effort and attention that the authoritarians are paying to this ought to be a signal to us of how it matters and how central they see it to the continuity of their regimes.",

And it was a very kind of bold-faced unvarnished look by Agnieszka Holland, who's a well-regarded filmmaker. And the government got very upset by this film. They wanted to suppress it. They delayed it. They tagged kind a warning screen on it, saying that they disagreed with it. But within a matter of weeks, it became the second most watched film of the year, even though it was released at the end of the year.
