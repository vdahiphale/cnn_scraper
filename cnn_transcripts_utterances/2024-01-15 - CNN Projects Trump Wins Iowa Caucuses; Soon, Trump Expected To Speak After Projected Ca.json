      "sentences": "With 92 to 77, to DeSantis, 61, Trump, 40, Ramaswamy. Haley wins in a suburban precinct, where this is where she needs to do well. I think you would argue that they would like to do it by more than that. We'll see how the other precincts come in, it's just one. But for Nikki Haley, you know Donald Trump is going to win in all these rural areas. If you're trying to get close to him, you have to really perform strongly in the suburban areas where you find your Marco Rubio voters, your more traditional Republicans, where Trump has had trouble, especially with suburban women.So, that is a win for Nikki Haley in that precinct. I would argue if you're trying to offset all this red you see up here, it's not by enough. This is what Trump wants, right? This is what Trump wants Haley and -- Trump would like to win. But if he's not going to win, he's in play, he's third, and they're kind of fractured. So, that's the math. That's the math. Back to as we get through the rest of the night, we have a long way to go before we can talk definitively about how much did Trump win by. Is there a clear second place or is it a very cluttered, close together, DeSantis and Haley, and who's second and third, and what does that mean going forward? We're going to have hours to talk about that. I want to spend a minute, again, you started it, Dana was right there, what you just saw, the woman who was a DeSantis supporter, saying there's no precinct sticker on this, so we can't count it, setting aside a vote for her candidate, because it's not properly allocated. The other campaign standing there, take a picture of it in case anybody has a vote and we have to recount it. That's democracy in action. And I just want to say this, because more Republicans are watching tonight because it's a Republican caucus night, maybe. Guess what? People with the same conviction and the same determination to get it right are the people counting the votes in Philadelphia and in Fulton County and in Maricopa County, Arizona, and in Detroit, Michigan, Wayne County, Michigan, they might be Democrats, they might be Republicans, they might have been Sanders voters in a primary or Hillary Clinton voters in the past, they're Americans who show up to help with democracy. In most cases, they get paid nothing. The people who are on the payroll get paid little and they do that. They do that. With everybody else watching, friends or neighbors who disagree, voting for other candidates, and they look around and say, we okay? And then they report the votes. The distrust in American politics, in the process, in the legitimacy of the process, is a cancer on American democracy. And so as Republicans watch this tonight, set aside anyone who tells you, yes, but we do it right and the Democrats do it differently, or if it's in a blue city or a blue state, they do it differently. It's just not true, historically. There's zero evidence of that. Now, back to the math, the person who most raises the most distrust about American elections is winning one tonight by a pretty convincing margin. That is what he needs to do. He's trying to make a comeback. He's trying to say, despite 91 indictments, despite losing in 2020, despite Republican performance in the 2018 and 2022 midterms that are on him, that I should be your nominee and the first verdict tonight in this very conservative state, but the very first verdict is Republicans say, we agree, sir.",

These were Haley voters. She won the folks that decided in the last two weeks, 34 percent. DeSantis got 30 percent. Donald Trump was only a 24 percent with this group. So, the last two weeks of this campaign were good for Haley and DeSantis if that's when you decided. Their problem is if you look at those that decided a while back before that, remember, that's two-thirds of the electorate overwhelmingly for Trump. We've talked a lot about his sticky support. His voters were locked in from the get-go in this race. And if they made up their mind before overwhelmingly, 64 percent of those that decided before the last two weeks went with Donald Trump.

What I see when I look at these numbers is this is not something that DeSantis' campaign wants to hear, because they really feel like he hit his stride probably in the last month or so.It was a campaign full of fits and starts from the beginning. He had his issues with the launch. They persisted with internal campaign drama. They feel like they've done so much better in the last month. But when you look at these numbers and the people who had already made up their minds, it may be too late. The other number that sticks out, I think it was 64 percent that said that they had already made up their decision before than the last month of so to vote for Donald Trump. And I think that that speaks to what we're watching happen tonight, which is Donald Trump has upended the way that you win Iowa. It is not typical that you see someone who spent very little time in the state, didn't do the Full Grassley, going into all 99 counties, gotten to an open feud with the state's governor, who is very popular, Kim Reynolds, because she chose to endorse DeSantis in this race, he changed the way that you win Iowa. It doesn't mean it's changed going forward. Donald Trump is a unique presence, as we all know, in politics. But it does show that he had fewer events than Nikki Haley, Vivek Ramaswamy and Ron DeSantis, yet he has still early projected the winner of this race.",

He's watching CNN and Fox watching the margin in particular. This is what his entire team is looking at. We know that not only is Donald Trump big on the numbers but they wanted a definitive win here in Iowa. They wanted to set the tone for the primary season, and they also wanted to stop any momentum from his GOP rivals heading into New Hampshire. We know that they were particularly concerned over Nikki Haley. They have seen her rising in the poll. They are already spending millions in the Granite State attacking Nikki Haley on various issues, including immigration, which they think is the key issue in that state. But it is a close margin. And they are hoping that this win, once the final margin is there, that it will be definitive enough to carry him into New Hampshire to give him that momentum and to keep him flying high. That has been something that they've been looking at. Now, I can tell you they are very pleased. I had been really talking to a lot of senior advisers who had been tamping down expectations, telling me they thought it could be closer to just over 12 percent.

This person was pretty upbeat about the prospects for Haley right now. Obviously, we still got a ways to go to see how that battle turns out for number two but they're feeling pretty good as they are watching what's happening.The campaign, for their part, is being tight-lipped Jake.

Nikki Haley, for her part, hasn't said anything.

We've been stuck at this for a long time.So, this is an important county for Nikki Haley and for Ron DeSantis. Haley needs to do well here if she's going to climb into second place. This is one of the places she would have to do it. If DeSantis beats her here or is competitive here, maybe. Where is he leading at the moment? DeSantis is leading out here in Sioux County. Again, just barely. By our count, 30 percent of the vote. We have to see if the rest of this comes in. One of the things about Sioux County, if you come in and look at the demographics of Iowa -- sorry, let me come back up here for this -- it's one of the most evangelical counties in the state. If you look at the -- the darker the shading, the higher the evangelicals. That's what DeSantis hoped to do everywhere in Iowa -- is run strong among evangelicals. That is simply not the case when you look at all that deep red. Doesn't mean he's not getting votes in these places. So, again, we started this a little bit earlier, let's just look at it again. Trump is leading just about everywhere, right? And so then the idea is, so where is DeSantis coming in second? The counties that stay lit, that's Trump red. He's leading in those counties. DeSantis is coming in second in most of the counties Trump is winning, most. A lot of them, this is why, so you say at home, well, if he's coming in second in most of those counties, why doesn't he have a more clear lead in second place? Because Haley is coming in second, when you look here, she's coming in second to Trump in fewer counties, but she tends to be doing them closer to the major population centers.",

He's winning college graduates to Haley's DeSantis not too far -- to Halley's 30 percent, not too far behind DeSantis at 27 percent. I just want to note this number Donald Trump now at 36, eight years ago when he was running he was at 21 percent among college graduates, just 21 percent. Now, take a look at the non-college graduates Donald Trump's winning 65 percent of them. They make up, again, half the electorate. He's over two-thirds of the non-college graduates are with Trump. DeSantis got 16 percent, Haley at 10 percent. Again, eight years ago, that Trump number was 28 percent. Tonight, it's 65 percent. Do you think Biden legitimately won the election? Thirty one percent of Iowa Republicans, just 31 percent, said yes, correctly, that Biden legitimately won 2020. Haley wins 54 percent of those voters. DeSantis, 30 percent. Trump, as you might imagine, only wins nine percent of those voters. But two-thirds of the Iowa caucus goers tonight believe that Biden, incorrectly, they believe, that he was not legitimately elected. Donald Trump wins seven in 10 of them, 69 percent. DeSantis wins 18 percent. Ramaswamy at eight. Haley only wins five percent of those people that say Joe Biden was not legitimately elected in 2020. Jake.",

The small number that do think that Biden legitimately won the election, only nine percent of them voted for Donald Trump or said they were supporting Donald Trump. Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis did better than them. Donald Trump, obviously, ran away with these voters and it just makes me think of how Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley handled this campaign and where they were willing to go there with Donald Trump and where they weren't. And on the election lies, there were parts of it where initially they would kind of answer it a certain way. I remember in New Hampshire when Ron DeSantis was asked by a voter about January 6th, and he said, I wasn't anywhere near the Capitol that day, not really addressing it.

That's his strong suit.I think what we're seeing tonight is a flattening of some of that. He's doing well with college educated voters. He's doing well with non-college educated voters. He's doing well with women. He's doing well with men. I mean, this is a candidate who is basically becoming just almost like what you would expect a generic Republican to look like in spite of all of his flaws. And for Democrats who are preparing for a general election, I don't think the Republican electorate is going to be, obviously, what the general election electorate is going to be, but Democrats should pay attention here because Trump has been able to somehow get college- educated voters, including some suburban voters, enough tonight, to give him another look, to push aside their concerns about his fitness for office, about the charges against him.
