TOM OXLEY, CEO, SYNCHRON:  For people who have got paralysis or motor impairment, but they have that part of the brains still working, then if you can put a device in, get the information, get it out of the brain then you can turn what previously was a signal controlling your body into a single that controls the digital devices.",

Instead, it`s able to travel through the body`s natural network of veinsand sit in a major vein, right in the middle of the brain. Our brains have billions of neurons firing electrical impulses that control our movements, everything from shaking hands to taking a step. Each and every one of those actions is associated with a specific electrical signature. The stentrode, which again sits right here around that area of the brain responsible for movement, learns to recognize those specific electrical patterns and essentially creates your own personalized dictionary of movement.

Which president was the first to call his annual speech to Congress a \"State of the Union\" address?Martin Van Buren, George Washington, William Howard Taft, Franklin D. Roosevelt. FDR doesn`t just stand for factually definitely right. It also stands for Franklin D. Roosevelt. The first president to refer to the annual address to Congress as the State of the Union. It became official in 1947, though, under President Harry Truman. President Joe Biden delivered his State of The Union speech last night, a high-stakes moment as he`s preparing to face former President Donald Trump in a likely rematch in the general elections in November. Trump and Biden dominated their respective Super Tuesday races this week while two of their respective party rivals former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley on the Republican side and Representative Dean Phillips on the Democrats side both ended their campaigns. We`ll show you some key points from President Biden`s address and break down how both sides of the political aisle are responding to the State of The Union on Monday`s show, but there`s some other political news worth touching on today. The U.S. Congress avoiding a partial government shutdown this week agreeing to continue funding the government on a temporary basis until they can vote on individual spending deals, also known as appropriations bills. Top Democrats and Republicans have already agreed to six funding bills for various government agencies and are now working towards agreements for six others before a new March 22nd deadline. This is the first time since 2018 that Congress has not funded the government by tying all appropriations bill into a single deal. Next up the oldest dead galaxy ever observed. It was spotted with the James Webb Space Telescope and astronomers and researchers say that this galaxy existed when the universe was only about 700 million years into its current age of about 13.8 billion years. So what is a dead galaxy? It`s essentially a galaxy that no longer has the ability to form new stars because there isn`t enough gas that`s needed to create them. Some factors that can cause the gas to disappear or dissipate are a supermassive black hole, stars violently interacting, and new stars consuming all the remaining gas when they`re born. The astronomers and researchers observing this newly discovered dead galaxy have been left puzzled and they are still trying to uncover the reason the stars there lived fast and died young more than 13 billion years ago.
