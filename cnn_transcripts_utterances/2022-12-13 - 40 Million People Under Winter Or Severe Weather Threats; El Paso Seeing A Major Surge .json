Blizzard conditions are creating a mess across the central and northern plains. Look at this. This is what's left of some homes and businesses in Dallas-Ft. Worth in the area there in Texas after a string of severe storms moved through earlier today. One man described the devastation in his neighborhood.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, in the South, we'll start there because a new tornado watch has just been issued until 10Across the North we have blizzard conditions that have been on going across portions of Nebraska as well as eastern sections of Colorado. And so, we're going to continue to see that as we go into the overnight hours as well. So, some interstates have been closed in eastern Colorado east of Denver. This is I-70 and I-76, I believe. Those have been closed because of the snowy conditions. And as these storms continue to march to the east, we'll continue to see the severe weather threat. Once it gets dark, that threat is going to become even more dangerous because people will be sleeping. They'll need a way to get weather alerts. And then as we get into tomorrow, the risk is going to be a little bit farther to the east. That's going to include places like New Orleans, Mobile, the Florida Panhandle. And that's going to extend into tomorrow through about midday or so. So, we do expect these conditions to continue throughout the afternoon hours overnight, and then the stormy conditions will also be there through much of tomorrow as well -- guys.",

One is that lawmakers have legitimate concerns about TikTok, about whether U.S. data can be accessed by the Chinese -- which obviously TikTok says no -- and then whether China could eventually tweak the algorithm may be at some point to alter U.S. perception toward the Chinese government. Those are some concerns that lawmakers have. I think the other thing that's happening here is Republican lawmakers have.I think the other thing that's happening here is Republican lawmakers primarily are using TikTok as the face of the Chinese government. And so, to show to their constituents, which is very popular right now, to have a hard stance on China, to show to their constituents that they're taking this hard line stance, they are basically saying we want to ban Tik-Tok and using this as a vehicle to deliver that message to their base.",

And what's clear is that the special counsel does want to broaden the probe that they have right now. And they want to look at efforts by Donald Trump, by members of his former presidential campaign, other aides and advisers and their potential communications with officials in these battleground states.You know, we know for instance, in Georgia, that Donald Trump -- then the president -- called Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger asking him to overturn the vote, to find the votes needed for Trump to win. You know, we know that a top aide, former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows showed up at an audit in Cobb County in Georgia when they were doing a ballot audit there. So, it's pretty clear the special counsel does want to dig in on any contacts the Trump team may have had in these important swing states around 2020.",
