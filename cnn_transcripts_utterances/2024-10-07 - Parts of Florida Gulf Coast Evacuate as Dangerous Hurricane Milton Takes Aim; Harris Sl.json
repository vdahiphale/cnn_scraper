And now, we're into this thing called a loop current.The loop current is the water that comes out of the Caribbean just to the east its of Cancun, which is the warmest water yet, it's already 180 miles per hour. This thing will hit the West Coast of Florida. Is it going to be on the south side of the cone to the north? I don't know yet. We're still probably 36 hours away from really getting an idea of where this goes. But hurricane hunters are in it right now and they found the winds still at 180 miles per hour. An intense storm. I can't imagine being in that aircraft and flying around seeing what's going there and getting bounced around because what was a 50 mile per hour storm just 36 hours ago, is now 180. And yes, we will get what's called an eye-wall replacement cycle when that inner eye wall, right now it's only four miles around. If you were inside the eye its two miles to that side of the eye wall and two miles to that side of the eye wall. That will eventually collapse and a larger eye wall will form around the outside and the pressure will go up and the wind speed will go down. We expect that, when you get a big storm like that, that just happens all the time. But look what's going to happen here. Major hurricane winds in this entire purple area, hurricane winds all the way past the East Coast. There will be a million or more people without power. Guess where the power men are, guess with a line people are. They're up in the Carolinas trying to get their power back on. This take a very long time. Power could be out for weeks, if not longer. Now, you talked about the storm surge in Tampa with Helene, it was about seven feet. The forecast right now is 10 to 15 feet. So, double the surge that they had from Helene and how much damage was done there. There will be homes that no longer exists, especially along the coast. That's just obviously going to happen when you get a 10 foot surge and homes are right on the beach there going to be missing. We can't have people in those houses that are missing. This is the problem that's why you need to go today. The great news about this and unlike what when we were in Charlie years ago, this did the rapid intensification days ahead of time. So we have the knowledge that it's going to be a big storm. Charlie was down here, it just went boom and all of a sudden, 12 hours later, it was onshore. This at least is giving us a little bit of time to get out of the way. All the models here, obviously on the West Coast of Florida. Some though much farther to the south, If you remember, we were waiting for Charlie in Tampa and it was weighed down here in Punta Gorda. And so, that can happen. It can turn, they still do when they get close to land, they can turn. Flood watch in effect, obviously four to eight inches of rainfall. Some models now predicting probably in the neighborhood of about 15 inches of rainfall. And that's just a freshwater flooding that's possible. From Alberto to Beryl, the very earliest Category 5 in the Atlantic, to Milton, the very latest Category 5 ever in the Atlantic Ocean.",

Let me just say very quickly as well, look, whether DeSantis or Biden or Harris talked and DeSantis worked very well with Biden, the last set of hurricanes that came through, what's more important is that these are not sexy positions, but your regional small business administration, your regional director is speaking to their state counterpart, the regional FEMA director is speaking to their state counterpart, and that is definitely happening on the ground and its why we're seeing the relief efforts now really ramped up after starting off slowly.",
