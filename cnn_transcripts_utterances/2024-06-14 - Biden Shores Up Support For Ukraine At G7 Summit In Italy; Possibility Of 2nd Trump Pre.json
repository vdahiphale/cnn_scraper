American voters will decide in November, whether or not to send President Biden back to the White House or keep him in the White House for four more years. And I think that's creating a good deal of anxiety for European officials in European leaders who have welcomed the stability and the commitment that America has made since Biden has returned to or die -- has been in the White House.",

Obviously, this has been a huge family drama playing out in a Delaware courtroom over the last week and a half or so.And, you know, what's striking here in Italy is that three of Hunter's daughter accompanied the president on the trip here, and two of them were sitting in the front row last night at that press conference where the president answered the question about his son. The president's aides have been deeply worried about the fact and the toll that this has taken on the president. Obviously, he's put out a number of statements talking about how proud he is of his son, but, you know, a strong statement there from the president that he would not pardon his son or commute his sentence. That, of course, comes before Hunter has been sentenced. There's a chance that he's not sentenced to any sort of jail time, just probation or for other disciplinary measures.
