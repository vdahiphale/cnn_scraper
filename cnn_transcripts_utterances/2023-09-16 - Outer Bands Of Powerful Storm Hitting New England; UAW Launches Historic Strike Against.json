The storm is packing hurricane-force winds, heavy rain, and dangerous storm surges as it swipes the New England coast. Now, while Lee is not expected to make landfall in the U.S., the outer bands of the powerful storm are already hitting the East Coast, packing winds of 50 to 60 miles an hour and bringing storm surges that could cause flooding along the New England coast.

And you know, a lot of hospitality, and a lot of beach homes here, and inns, and suites, basically bed and breakfasts, have really handled this storm like it's a nor'easter. They're used to this type of weather. They've taken in the furniture. You can see it behind me. They give you a little bit of a perspective of where we are.You can see the Atlantic Ocean behind me and some 300-400 miles over my left-hand shoulder is where the center of Hurricane Lee is located. Now, it seems tame here, but we have had those occasional tropical storm force gusts. And I think the idea and the story that we have been hammering home to our viewers is that this storm is so large, the wind field that expanded, literally ballooned over the course of this past week, means that the impacts will be felt well outside of where that center eventually makes landfall. So, check out my graphics and you can see exactly what I'm talking about. 400 miles, roughly, that's how far the tropical storm force winds extend and that has implications for the New England coastline, particularly, where I'm standing in Cape Cod into Nantucket as well. It's just incredible to see how, if you time that with the tides on my graphics, we have had low tide at the peak of this storm. So, that is also a little bit of a saving grace for this area because that means that the low tide and the highest winds are not in conjunction or are in conjunction, so that doesn't mean that we'll have this coastal storm surge threat as large as if we had high tide at the same time, right? But if you look a little bit closer, the wind gusts here, you can feel it occasionally about 30 to 35 miles per hour. There has been actually reports of large breaks on the water near Nantucket. That's just out over the open ocean there of upwards of 20 feet. So, obviously, Hurricane Lee sending a massive amount of energy from the Atlantic Ocean. And that will cause some beach erosion, but really, the concern here is that this storm is packing quite a punch, especially as we go a little bit further to the north and east, down in east, Maine, they referenced that. That is the area where we expect some of the hardest and worst impacts from this. But here in the Cape, they're treating it like a nor'easter. This scene here looks serene, but the ocean is quite chopped up, and you can see the wind gusts there, about 20 to 30 miles per hour, so not quite tropical storm force. But Allison, you know, you've seen this storm. We've been studying this for 10 to 15 days, really. It's just been this slow lurching towards the New England coastline, and you know, it looks like it's just moments, if not hours, away from a landfall in Nova Scotia, is that true? Are you seeing that?",

And really, in the lead up to this strike, as these two sides were at the negotiating table, the White House really did avoid taking an explicit position on either side of this. But you did see that change yesterday in the Roosevelt Room, the president coming out very forcefully on the side of the unions, on the side of the autoworkers, and saying that record profits for the automakers must translate into a record contract for these workers whose wages, he said, had eroded over the last several years, whose benefits had eroded.

Now, the other objective for the president, the important thing that this could have a role in is electoral politics in Michigan. That's a critical battleground state. This is a state that will be affected by this work stoppage. Of course, the president is also pursuing an endorsement from the UAW. They have withheld that up until now. Now, yesterday, the president did say that he was dispatching two of his senior most aides, Gene Sperling, who has acted as kind of the go- between for the administration in these talks, and the Acting Labor Secretary, Julie Hsu. He's sending them to Detroit to sort of support both sides in this. It does remain to be seen how effective they will be as these talks continue, guys.",

At this point, about a tenth of that figure is actually striking. So, keep that in mind. But that estimate does include things like lost pay, losses to manufacturers, but also suppliers. Another way to think about the potential impact, Mark Zandi, the Chief Economist of Moody's, I talked to him and he said a full strike, again, a full strike, but lasting six weeks, would be the equivalent of about shaving two-tenths of a percentage point from GDP. Now, he admits that's modest, but he says it's meaningful when you think about some of the other economic headwinds that we're experiencing.

And I think to your point, Victor, five years is an awful long time. We have a pretty efficient prosecutorial process. The DOJ, Department of Justice, prosecutes people all the time, a lot more swiftly than that. The FBI goes out and investigate cases a lot more swiftly than that. And so, I think it undermines certain trust in our system. And then, of course, after the blown-up plea deal before, as we know, where Hunter Biden was supposed to plead a gun charges and tax charges and get this deferred prosecution agreement, here we go again with this special counsel indictment of these three charges.

The reality is, is that if your client is not going to fare well, you plead guilty. The other reality is that in federal cases, unlike state cases, the federal government investigates, investigates, investigates, and then they charge you. In a state prosecution, they arrest you and begin the investigation. That's a mass distinction. It gives them a major advantage.Here, as to the issues that you mentioned, number one, when you talk about the charges he's facing, I think they're going to be, as we look at Hunter Biden there, if it went to trial, members of the jury pool saying, what are we doing here? The reality is, is we're talking about an addict at the time. We're talking about a person who possessed a gun for a short period of time. 11 days, was it thrown in a dumpster, right, by his girlfriend when she realized he had it? Why did he get it? There'll be assertions he got it to take him away from any drug addiction. Was he drug addicted at the time? Was he getting sober at the time? Is it proper to do this? There's a constitutional challenge to your final point as to whether or not drug users should be prosecuted, right? And does it violate their second amendment for possessing and owning a firearm? Will there be jury nullification? Addiction is something that affects so many people. So, it would be interesting to see if he went to trial, could he overcome it? I think he potentially could. I think, though, his lawyers will argue victor that: A. It's unconstitutional; B. Let's enter into a plea deal; C. Come on, we don't prosecute cases like this. We do, if it's a violent offender, if it's a felon, if it's a convicted felon. In this situation what are we doing here? There will likely be a deal and it will likely not go to trial but certainly his prospects of success if it did go, he could, in fact, prevail, potentially.",

And so, I think to your question, what happens now is that the judge has to fashion an appropriate remedy so that there is a court proceeding that goes forward, that witnesses are protected, that witnesses are not intimidated, and that there's some decorum with respect to what goes on. Yes, it's hard because it's a president, former president, who likes to speak a lot. She's not saying, or prosecutors are not saying, you can't speak. You can talk about your innocence.

And earlier in the week, MGM acknowledged a cyberattack left guests unable to make room charges and access their own rooms with their digital keys. The city's multibillion dollar casino and hospitality industries are ripe targets as you'd imagine for cyber criminals. According to tourism officials, nearly 39 million people visited Las Vegas last year spending nearly $45 billion. Joining me now to discuss is Amit Yoran. He is a CEO of Tenable, a cybersecurity company. He is also a former director for U.S. cybersecurity with the Department of Homeland Security. Amit, good to see you. It's been a while. So, talk to us about the nature of these hacks between Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts. They're a bit different because one focuses on customer information, the other seemed to target the resort's operations. But at the end of the day, does it all come down to money? What -- What's the objective of these hacks?",

But an organization known as BlackCat, it's a ransomware group, is targeting Las Vegas casinos. We've seen them target other organizations in the past.And in this case, they've been successful gaining access. And we've seen these casinos impacted.

In this case, they only needed one particular victim within the organization and then began to expand their access.

In one case, Caesars has filed and told the market that they paid $15 million, about half of what was being asked to them.In MGM's case where the damage and the ongoing operation seemed much more problematic, they were hacked and they decided we're going to take our systems offline, at least that's what the hackers are alleging that MGM themselves took the systems offline to prevent further damage. And there's been significant impact. We see casino floors impacted. We've seen room doors impacted. We've seen ATMs impact -- impacted, and it's disrupting -- it's disrupting their customers.",

And then, you have the water that was coming through here pretty much destroying everything in its way, including a bridge that was here, you might not be able to see it by this traffic that's blocking the roads right now, because this has become a main artery in the city, where much of the infrastructure has been destroyed and roads have been blocked. But that is where a bridge stood connecting the city. Now, that's gone. And it might be difficult for us to move the camera because coms are very challenging in the city right now. Over my right shoulder that was a neighborhood. An entire neighborhood that no longer exists right now. This entire neighborhood was washed into the sea. And while we're standing here, we have seen people walking past survivors from Derna, carrying whatever they've been able to salvage of their belongings. Grown men and women who are walking past and sobbing. This is absolutely shocking and heartbreaking to see.

While we were there, we saw several bodies being delivered.Yesterday, 90 bodies. And people are so emotional, they tell you right now, these bodies have become unrecognizable.
