It's adjourned for the day, and it will not pick up again until next week. This comes after Hunter Biden's daughter, Naomi, gave an emotional, hours-long testimony about her father's past drug addiction. Our own Paula Reid was inside court and reports that Naomi appeared very uncomfortable while on the stand, and when she left, she gave her dad a hug, a kiss on the cheek, and was seen trembling and wiping away tears as she exited the courtroom. We want to go to Paula Reid now, who's been tracking this closely. Paula. Why did court adjourn so quickly?",

We were expecting to come back and hear from Hunter's uncle, James Biden, and a few more witnesses. When the defense came back from lunch, they said they're no longer calling any of those witnesses. The only outstanding question for the defense is whether they will call the defendant, Hunter Biden, to the stand. The judge is now giving them a long weekend before deciding if they're going to do that, but it appears that after Naomi Biden's appearance on the stand, which did not exactly go, I think, how the defense expected it to go, they are switching up their strategy, and now they have what could make or break their case, this big decision about whether to put the defendant on the stand on Monday.

James Biden is here. He's actually in court waiting to be called. They are changing up the strategy. They're no longer calling him. Of course, we're going to talk to our sources about what exactly happened during the lunch break. One of our colleagues actually commented that right behind me, actually, Hunter Biden and his wife just leaving court a moment ago. But there was a lot of shouting heard by some of our colleagues from the defense room where they do their lunch. And the defense officer actually had to open the door and say something to them, which quieted them down. But it's just unclear what happened during the lunch break that made them do this incredibly serious shift in strategy. I mean, when you have a witness here, you fully expect to call them. It wasn't just one witness. It was a few witnesses. Now they're no longer putting any of them on. I mean, this is a real turn in this trial.",

Right now, the president is in France, where earlier he delivered a historic speech standing atop the cliffs of Pointe du Hoc in Normandy. Those are the same cliffs where hundreds of American rangers scaled to secure key positions against the Nazis. Their heroism was a key turning point for allied forces in World War II. And in his speech, the president called on Americans to honor the legacy of those soldiers by protecting democracy. Biden drew parallels. He compared tyrannical threats to democracy to threats that are looming today. And without naming names, Biden highlighted stark differences between himself and his political rival, former President Donald Trump. CNN's Melissa Bell is joining us now from Paris. Melissa, this was indeed a historic speech.",

But it was also the spot, very symbolically, where 40 years ago, Ronald Reagan made an impassioned plea against isolationism. And, of course, in the planning of the speech, that would not have been lost on those organizing not just Joe Biden's return to Normandy, but what he was going to say. Have a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: As we gather here today, it's not just to honor those who showed such remarkable bravery on that day, June 6, 1944. It's to listen to the echoes of their voices, to hear them, because they are summoning us, and they're summoning us now. They ask us, what will we do? They're not asking us to scale these cliffs, but they're asking us to stay true to what America stands for. They're not asking us to give or risk our lives, but they are asking us to care for others in our country more than ourselves. They're not asking us to do their job. They're asking us to do our job, to protect freedom in our time, to defend democracy, to stand up aggression abroad and at home. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yeah, I think you're absolutely right. This is why this week feels so poignant to us, is it's not just the 80th anniversary of D-Day, but it's really the final passing of the greatest generation. Great Britain estimates now there are just six living D-Day veterans left. And this -- what I tried to do with this book was to tell the story of D-Day in the first person, in the voices of the people who participated in it. And when you read those accounts, the memories of people like the rangers who scaled Pointe du Hoc, you know, it's easy to get lost in the mythology of D- Day, to say this is this huge Herculean triumph of Western democracy. But when you hear the voices of the people who actually, you know, charged those cliffs that morning, you know, they're not feeling particularly courageous and brave that morning. You know, they're scared. They're lonely. They're sort of wondering if they have what it takes to perform in combat. They're wondering if they're going to let down their comrades and their friends. And that's, to me, one of the stories that really stands out of the rangers is what a tight unit that was. It was such an elite, well-trained team. This was the early start, of course, of the American Special Forces. And the rangers were sort of the elite of the elite. And the way that they bonded and the way that they tried to support each other that day, climbing those cliffs. And then, of course, the rest of the story is that they get to the topof the cliffs and the German gun battery that they think that they're storming is gone. And they actually have to fan out across the German countryside. And it's Sergeant Len Lomell who finally finds in sort of a copse of woods back from the cliffs the German guns and is able to destroy them before they are able to fire down on Omaha Beach or Utah Beach. And so, these rangers who sort of do this audacious maneuver this morning, you know, get to the top and they're like, where are all the guns?",

And that's both a question in Europe where you have, you know, an active land war going on. And that's also, as President Biden made the point today, a battle here to fight at home. And I think, you know, one, Ronald Reagan, who sort of, with that speech at Pointe du Hoc in 1984, lifted D-Day from the history into legend. You know, what he said in one of his speeches was democracy is never more than one generation away from extinction. And as we mark this final passing of the greatest generation, I think President Biden wants to make this choice very stark about what our generation is going to do with the legacy they're leaving us.",

Just when it looked like things were slowing down, we find out today that hiring unexpectedly accelerated in May. 272,000 jobs added. that is a strong number in any environment. It crushed expectations and it's looking more and more like that slowdown in April was really just a blip. Clearly there is still a lot of demand out there for workers. Wages rose sharply, notably increasing more than prices did. And really there was across the board strength when you look at the sectors. There were 68,000 jobs added in healthcare alone, another 43,000 jobs in government, 42,000 in leisure and hospitality. Now, all of this is good news for workers. One thing to keep an eye on is the household survey. Part of the jobs report was weaker. That's why the unemployment rate ticked up going from 3.9 percent to 4 percent. Now that's the highest level since January of 2022, but it's not high. This is still a historically low number, a lot lower than people had anticipated given the pandemic. How much the Fed is trying to slow the economy down. I think Bank of America economists summed it up best. They said, quote, the economy may be cooling, but it is not cool. Boris.",
