I'm Fareed Zakaria coming to you from New York.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ZAKARIA (voice-over): Today on the program, the Knesset votes to take away a key power of Israel's Supreme Court. And as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urges calm, the nation's political center and left erupt in anger. I'll talk to the \"New York Times'\" Tom Friedman about the politics involved and with his colleague Emily Bazelon about the legal issues. Then, the secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas, on the good news and the bad news from America's southern border. Finally, did President Putin use or gain power after Prigozhin's failed mutiny? I'll ask Russian journalist in exile Mikhail Zygar. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

He lost so many allies that he had to reach over the fence of Israeli politics and bring into Israeli politics people who have never been there before. Tamir Pardo, the former head of the Mossad, basically equated them to the American Ku Klux Klan. So imagine if a president brought members of the Ku Klux Klan into the Cabinet.Now the only way he could hold these people together in a coalition with his other only allies left, the ultraorthodox in Israel, he basically had to accede to their demands. What are their big demands? This Israeli version of the Ku Klux Klan or the American Proud Boys basically wants one thing. Their Jewish supremacists, they want annexation of the West Bank. More settlements, more absorption of the West Bank, ultimately annexation. What do the ultraorthodox want? They want their sons not to have to serve in the military and they want their schools to be free to teach only religious subjects and no math, science, reading or democratic civics. Who stands in the way of that? One body left in Israel with independence, the judiciary, the Supreme Court. So the religious want the Supreme Court out of the way basically so it won't interfere with their efforts basically to teach purely religious subjects and not have to serve in the military, and the right-wing Jewish supremacists want the court out of the way so it won't be interfering with their attempts to seize more Palestinian land and build more Palestinian settlements, and to legalize more wildcat illegal Israeli settlements. That's what this is about.",

It comes out of British law. Why would a government want to get rid of a reasonableness cause that the court enjoyed unless they want to do things that were unreasonable? Of course that's what the Israeli public understood. Then Netanyahu has been saying this is a small thing, this is a little thing. Nonsense.This was a power grab. It had nothing to do with legal reform. None of that is on the level. If you want to do legal reform, if you want to do the Israeli equivalent of a constitutional amendment in the United States, oh, my goodness, you would have done it over a long period of time, brought in legal experts, worked for a consensus. They did none of this. They had a majority, they rammed it through, end of story.",

They pay about 90 percent of the taxes and they fight 105 percent of the wars. So behind this sort of legal issue is a feeling that, hey, you know, I was ready to do that, as long as it was live and let live. You know, Fareed, I've lived in two countries in the Middle East intensively, Lebanon and Israel. They have one big thing in common. They're tiny countries with incredibly diverse populations. Very small but incredibly diverse. The only way countries like that can work is on the principle of live and let live, no victory, no vanquish. That is what Lebanon blew up unfortunately over the last 20 years, that's what Israel is blowing up now. Live and let live.

But the U.S. Senate is quite interested. And the base of the Democratic Party is interested in this. You know, it's an ironic situation, Fareed.

She's a fellow at Yale Law School and a co-host of \"Slates Political Gab Fest Podcast.\" Emily, first, let's talk about Israel.

That's when the Supreme Court says we have the power to say what the law is, to say what the Constitution means.For a long time, the United States was kind of an outlier. Lots of countries did not have judicial review. But then, you know, starting in the '60s and '70s, partly relating to the fall of communism, for lots of different reasons around the world, countries start to write constitutions in which judicial review, the power of courts, becomes very important. And so Israel kind of joins with that transformation and constitutional revolution in the 1990s when the Israeli Supreme Court declared that the basic laws were like a constitution and that it, the Supreme Court, had the power to interpret those laws.",
