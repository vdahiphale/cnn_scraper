So we're going to -- we don't know yet what this looks like.We do know though, just in terms of the disruption of these mass shootings. This is a mall, massive mall, many entrances and exits, people are leaving. That's traumatic. Period. Like whether this is a big deal or a small deal. Living like this is traumatic for people who just thought they were going to the mall on a Saturday. There is an orderly exit, which means that whatever they were worried about, whether it was an active shooter, or whatever else has been disabled, or is not presently a threat, people don't seem to be running, and then we wait. Because the waiting is, of course, the search of the shopping mall to determine what noise was this? Why were so many people talking about an active shooter in a soft and rich target. I mean, that's the scary thing here. These are soft targets, they have to be, and they are also rich in the sense of there are just lots of people at a mall on a Saturday, and here we are.",

It is a nightmare because of the actual incident that we're talking about, where one or more people have been injured or possibly killed.And then also for law enforcement to try to contain a crime scene on this scale, is just a daunting task, you're talking about, you know, dozens, probably more likely, hundreds, maybe even a couple thousand people or more, in a very wide area, and numerous places inside and outside, where a potential shooter or shooters could be hiding. So now, you have law enforcement trying to get in there to neutralize the shooter or shooters, right? So you know, they are trying to do that, while they are also trying to navigate how -- what their level of safety is at that moment, right? Because the shooter is not going to just stop, but just the average citizen, if anything they're going to attempt to shoot at law enforcement, it has happened before. So I mean, you know, so now they have to think about trying to save lives, but also making sure that their safety is paramount, because they get taken out and then who's going to help the average citizen who is under this, you know, the siege?",

I'm sure that they sharing jointly, so there are going to be a variety of agencies that will respond state, federal, local, but they do train for this and they use what's called ICS Incident Command, which determines who is in charge, not only who is in charge overall, but who is in charge of what, and that's very important.Because right now, you're going to have to conduct a search, so you're going to have to really be organized, you can do a systematic search. The other thing I want to mention, you know, these malls have a lot of -- there are a lot of video. So someone is somewhere in that security room right now trying to isolate the area where the shots allegedly took place to see what they can find out. You know, can they identify an individual who is responsible? You know, what were the circumstances that took place when the shots were fired, and I'm assuming shots were fired. We don't even know that right now. So I think, it is important that we don't speculate too much, but someone is going through the video as well. But Incident Command is how you organize and that's how you train, and it is very unfortunate because we get an awful lot of practice. I mean, you know, your viewers know as much about what police ought to do when they go to the scene of an active shooter is people that have been in police for 20 to 30 years, because it is unfortunate, but you see it almost every single day. This is what we're talking about and it is nuts. It's crazy.",

So of course, run is always it.So word has gotten out to the Incident Command that you can have an orderly evacuation, that they don't believe that the public is any longer under threat. That's either because once again, this was either a false alarm in which you know, you're having honestly these fears of active shooter come up. And so you know, things are getting amplified, we don't know; or a hundred shots are fired as we're hearing from some witnesses. That's a big range, and so the police need to be careful in terms of how they're evacuating people. The most important thing now that you're seeing is of course, family unification. It is the most pressing issue for people who are leaving. I saw an H&amp;M, anyone with teen daughters or sons knows this store and you know, this is a shopping mall on a Saturday. Kids, teenagers may have been there alone. Family members dispersed; some go here, some go there. People are in the parking lot waiting for family, and so you just have a lot of madness, in terms of getting people together, because you need to get all of these people away from the shopping mall. So in the next hour or so, there is going to be an incredible focus on people who weren't witnesses, who just happened to be in the mall, get them with their families and get them out. You know, it's traumatic for kids. I mean, you just -- and parents, but I mean, if you're alone in a mall, and you're evacuated for active shooter, you know, we may be putting them through this often, but it doesn't get any less traumatic.",

So I think they are trying to establish areas where they can have gatherings of people, either A, that have seen something and they can gather as much information about the potential if there is a potential shooter or shooters and/or what did they see, what did they hear versus those who didn't see anything, and they wanted to keep them temporarily in some sort of a safety zone.And also, you know, there may be some that are injured. So, I would imagine there's a potential triage station that has been set up with medical EMTs and whatnot to treat those who are maybe again, if this was a shooting, and they were injured by the shooting, but also potentially maybe injured by people, you know, stampeding out of the mall. In a lot of these cases, especially with this many people, you know, people are fleeing for the exits, they're flying down escalators and stairs to get out. And, you know, some people get seriously injured that way. So, there are going to be a number of reasons why they're going to have people clustered up as, as long as they feel that that those areas are within a safe distance from any potential danger that may be occurring within the mall itself. And again, at this point, they may not be any danger at all. The danger has passed. It's unclear you know, based on reports, it is unclear what exactly they're facing inside there. So again, because the situation is so fluid, they're kind of doing this on the run. Regardless of the training that occurs and again, Chief Ramsey probably opine on this as well. You know, when these things occur, even with the best training, and you know, the increased levels of training and the more the training takes place, when these things occur, it still is chaos at the get go, and then as things kind of play out, it kind of calms down and we can get things done in a more methodical manner. And especially again, in such a large facility such as this, it is one thing when it is a smaller facility like a church, but when we get to a school, it becomes a lot more to manage, right? [18:10:10] And here, we are talking about a massive shopping facility with a massive parking lot.

Details are very limited, but they have said that they were responding to shots that were fired. So, I know that a lot of the analysts have said, we do not know exactly if shots were even fired. So far, that's the only thing that officials have said. The ATF actually saying that they were responding to an active shooter and headed that way. So, we know that there are multiple agencies that are responding. As you can see, there are crowds of people that have been out there trying to figure out exactly what is going on, where their loved ones are because as many people have already mentioned, there were many people who are out this outlet in Allen, Texas. This is the Premium Outlets in Allen. So of course, there were many, many people that were shopping or in the area. And authorities, what they're telling people is to stay away from this area as they handle this incident in particular. So again, they're just asking people, if you're in the area, it's better if you stay away. We have heard from witnesses or people who live in the area that say they have heard a lot of gunshots. But again, we're waiting for authorities to confirm exactly what happened. This is still a developing situation. We are waiting to get confirmation from authorities. But clearly, there is a lot going on at the outlets there in Allen, Texas and authorities just trying to get a handle of all of this. One of the members of our team called the Allen Police Department and they said they were extremely busy. It appears they are the ones in charge or sort of leading this investigation and leading in terms of getting all of this under control, but we do know that there are multiple agencies that are responding to this as well. This happened, you know, on a Saturday afternoon. This is a suburb of Dallas, Texas. And again, we are just waiting for a lot of these details to be confirmed. But of course, we already know that there are people, many people who have been impacted by this, who are trying to figure out where their loved ones are, who are concerned. You know, our affiliate has been talking to a lot of people on the ground, who are just saying, you know, they were terrified, and are still trying to figure out exactly what happened. And so we do have our team in Texas headed that way, and should be able to confirm a lot of these details, you know, in the coming minutes or hours. But again, we are waiting for police to really tell us exactly what happened here. We know, according to authorities that shots were possibly fired.

It is not going to solve itself, and thoughts and prayers aren't going to do it. If thoughts and prayers work, we'd be the safest country in a world.

It looks like a fairly newer facility and even older facilities have been retrofitted to incorporate modern-day digital surveillance.Largely - nowadays unfortunately, largely for situations like this, as well as in some cases where you have some of these random gangs that go in and loot stores. Like you can catch a bunch of kids or young people on camera and then if there's facial recognition software involved, it's easier to try to narrow down who we're looking for and the same goes here. So hopefully if they have that type of technology to review these cameras and if it has the ability to have facial recognition, if this person is already known to law enforcement, then we're going to know who this person is right away. If not, then it's going to be more of an old-school search as to putting a picture up on a wanted poster, if the person's got away and/or out to the public, to ask them for information as to who this person is. That will potentially happen anyway, even if this person has been identified. This way we can find out if there were any clues leading up to this incident, and particularly depending on what type of weapons were involved, where those weapons were obtained from, whether or not they were obtained legally or illegally. And just to go back to a point that Chief Ramsey had made as well and a very valid one. While we focus many times on these mass shootings, the streets of the United States in these large cities such as New York City where I worked, and where Chief Ramsey's from as well, whether it'd be Baltimore or Chicago, Detroit, a lot of these major cities are - the streets are running red with blood of victims that have been victimized by gun violence and in many cases it's gang violence, right? So we're talking about more isolated incidents, and maybe not on the scale where half a dozen or a dozen people are being shot and killed, but every day we're using - we're losing young people to gun violence. We're losing our friends and loved ones in shopping malls and in churches and in schools to gun violence. And while investigatory-wise, we are in better shape now to investigate these incidents largely because of the advent of cameras being put up everywhere. At the end of the day, that's great for investigators to help give them more clues and more leads. But at the end of the day - I mean, look at the people that are leaving this mall here with their kids. These little kids or anyone who's leaving this facility today, this is something they're going to remember for the rest of their lives. And for young people, for little kids, that's going to be unbelievably traumatizing to them. So it's just - it's a shame, I feel bad for anyone that has been victimized here today down there in Texas. It's a shame that this has occurred. I'm hoping that the shooter or shooters have been neutralized and this - the situation, at least, has been halted from becoming an even worse situation than it potentially could have been. But yes, I think video surveillance here is going to play a key part in this investigation like it does in a number of these investigations.",

With that many people, and you're talking about thousands of people, it looks like. Of course, they're looping the video footage, so we're seeing a lot of this over and over again. So it's kind of hard to get a real assessment.But a mall that size on a Saturday, I mean, you probably - it's probably reasonable to think that you had thousands of people there. And so they will talk to as many as possible, certainly as those that were in that part of the mall where this shooting took place. Someone who's on the far end really may not have had any meaningful information, but they'll do as best they can to try to isolate people and conduct some - get some statements, get some interviews going on. That's all part of ICS. You have specific people who was charged with that responsibility as well to interview people. Again, it's challenging when you've got a situation like this and you've got a lot of people that by itself is a humongous task. An enormous law enforcement response we can see here. Tom Verni, can you take anything away from what you're seeing right now? Large groups of law enforcement we see right here a moment ago we saw convening just outside the mall. Is there anything that you're taking away from what you're seeing and how law enforcement is moving right now?",

And in a place such as Texas, sometimes, if it's not around the major metropolitan areas, it's tough to get a lot of personnel to a place really quickly, right, because it's separated by dozens, if not hundreds of miles.But here, it seems as if they do have a sizable contingent of officers, I would imagine, not only from the local police department, but on a county and/or state level, potentially, if I had to guess based on the amount of officers that they have here. So that's good. I feel good about that. It seems as if the evacuation of the multiple parts of this facility have been done in a very orderly manner. Again, this is a kind of a tip of the hat to the training that these police departments now undergo every week, every month, every year. So they know how to kind of set up, get large scale numbers of people to - from point A - which is in that facility where there's all kinds of chaos potentially happening, out to a safe distance from that location and to some sort of staging area where they could either interview and/or triage any potential injuries that may have occurred one way or another. So it seems like, at least from this perspective, and based on the footage that we've seen, that the training here seems to have worked well. So hats off to them that have kind of coordinated all this. And then I hope they can get this - hopefully, this individual has been apprehended and/or disabled at this point. And they know who exactly they're looking for if they haven't. And at least hopefully to have them isolated and contained, which is the next best thing. And then try to talk to them out of a location if they have to put them under arrest. So yes, it looks like they've done a really good job here under extremely difficult circumstances. Again, I have to - I can't underscore how difficult a facility of this size is to try to get a crime scene such as this, under control with so many people in so many different ways in and out of this facility. So it's just - for me, I mean, I can't even think of a - the only incident that I can really kind of - which is a completely different incident for me was 9/11. [18:45:05] On 9/11, you had the Trade Center and 10s of thousands of people fleeing that area and trying to get a - that crime scene under some sort of control, which was nearly impossible. So - but - this type of a mass shooting in this type of location or shooting in this type of location is just very, very difficult to try to - to get a handle on. But it seems like they've done a pretty well - a pretty good job at this point.",

I mean, that would indicate to me that the situation inside is - has to be under control to some level.Again, either the shooter has been intercepted and/or disabled or isolated and contained in an area where they're no longer a threat to the greater masses that are there. And now you have officers kind of clustered in different parts of this facility. I guess they're trying to reassess where they're going to have the - where are the most useful points to have manpower at this point. Because as Chief Ramsey had mentioned, you now have to do a series of interviews with as many people as possible, particularly those who saw this incident occur from the get-go, right, and kind of be able to release those who had nothing to do with this incident. You don't necessarily have to hold people for hours and hours and hours to do interviews if they had nothing to do with this incident. So - and if they were on the far end of the mall and they didn't see or hear anything, especially if they got - have children, particularly young children, yes, you don't want to have to hold people there for a long period of time when they're not going to provide key bits of information that we would need to get - to piece together the bits of the puzzle of this puzzle. So we're going to want to get those people out and then get the people who have all the information that we need, kind of narrow it down to those few dozens of people and extract the information from them as best we can so we can start to piece together this mess that's been created by this individual today.

It seems like things have settled down at least for this moment.So a lot of people waiting to see what they're going to do and what they are going to be able to do. If you look back in here, this is the entrance into the outlet mall area. As you can look there in the distance, you can see just how many - hundreds of cars are in there. These are people who've had to leave everything behind. The witness that we talked to who worked at that restaurant, the burger restaurant there inside the Outlet mall, said that people scrambled and got up and left as quickly as they could. Tables were left with purses and belongings and wallets and that sort of thing. So there are a lot of people who had to race away from the scene and now they're trying to figure out how they can get their belongings or their cars and figure out what to do next. All of this transpiring as investigators are in there in the crime scene trying to piece together what has happened, how many victims there are. We're waiting to hear all of that.

The areas around where - as I mentioned, we're on the southern end of this outlet mall. There's a parking lot with a hotel and other businesses, shopping centers. You're able to kind of get into this area. But there's definitely a perimeter that is set up around the back part of this outlet mall.If I can paint a picture here a little bit better for you from our vantage point, all of the stores kind of face into a central parking lot area. So what we're seeing here are the backside of some of these outlet stores. And the entrance to these stores are just around on the other side of the buildings there. So everything's kind of like in this central congregated area. That's where people move into to move through this open air outlet mall. And it's pretty - the distance is rather long. You can see probably a good thousand yards to the other side, the north side of this outlet mall in this parking lot. So we're talking about a rather large area and then there's other shopping areas all around this particular outlet mall. So it's a large scene, difficult to process, mix that in with all of the cars and the vast amounts of people that were inside. You can imagine how chaotic it becomes just with that much activity going on in one place. REID: Absolutely. Now, one thing our law enforcement experts have noted is that they don't see a lot of ambulances and they don't see a lot of EMTs. We obviously can't see everything from where we are.

I did see one ambulance - I'm coming north - one ambulance was going south. That is all that I've seen. I would imagine, though, by the time I got here, those who needed the most immediate attention, medical attention, would have already been taken - rushed away from this scene in those moments. But the police activity that I have seen has really been setting up the perimeter, blocking entrances into various parking lots so that more people don't come here as so many family members and witnesses are trying to reunite with their loved ones, which is obviously a great deal of concern for people who had friends or family that were here at this area when the shooting scene erupted this afternoon.",
