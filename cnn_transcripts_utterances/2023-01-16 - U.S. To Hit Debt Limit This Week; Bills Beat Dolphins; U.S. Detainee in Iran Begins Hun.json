It's exactly what it sounds like. This is the limit, the total amount of money the United States is - is authorized to borrow to meet its existing legal obligations. This is the credit limit. Now, here's what happens. Congress does this over and over again. Congress, together, as a body, decides to spend money and then Congress later says, we don't want to pay the money we already spent. We don't want to pay the credit card bill. And then you get into these perennial fights over raising the debt limit. We've done it over and over again.

The CDC scientists who did the study, they took on the enormous task at looking at deaths and saying, hmm, how many of these were attributable to excess alcohol? So they looked at everything from drunk driving accidents, which obviously are all about the alcohol, to things like cancer and heart disease, where alcohol can play -- excess alcohol, I should say, can play a factor.So, here's what they found out when they looked at deaths attributable to excess alcohol intake. What they found was for ages 20 through 49, that one in five deaths were attributable to excess alcohol, and for ages 20 through 64 it was one in eight deaths. And so you might wonder, well, if you drink a little bit is it a problem? Let's take a look at how CDC defines moderate drinking, in other words not excessive but moderate drinking. CDC says for men it's no more than two drinks a day, for women it's no more than one drink a day. And I'll add a little P.S. to that, which is you can't kind of add them up. You can't abstain all week and then have seven drinks on a Saturday night. That's called binge drinking. That has problems all its own. This is two per day or one per day.",

Listen to your body. If your body liked not drinking, don't drink. But the CDC doesn't say that all drinking is bad. They don't come out and say all of us need to be teetotalers. They say, look, there is such a thing as moderate drinking. And those are the amounts that we just went over.
