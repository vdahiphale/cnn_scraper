      "sentences": "... 10 days or so here before committing this horrific crime and now again it appears that he has left the same way he came via a bus. Again the chief they're telling me that this was really well planned, this was targeted and that the suspect here really did a lot of work and preparation before he came to New York City to commit this murder.The other thing I want to stress about is the photo that police released of the man at the hostel, that man police believe is the same man that they are looking for in connection with the murder. They believe that is the same individual who shot the CEO. The other thing that's important they say is that if you look in that photo from the hostel he's wearing different clothing. They believe based on what they can see there he is wearing different clothing. Again obviously it all goes to the preparation here. And the other thing is the NYPD wants to stress is just the dozens and hundreds perhaps of detectives that are now working on this case that literally one detective could sit in front of a monitor and watch videotape, the CCTVs that are all over New York City for hours and hours for just an eight-second clip to try and locate the suspect. They say they're not using AI technology. I know there's a lot of questions about that. They say they're not. So it's painstaking work really for these detectives to look through this video. And they also say the commissioner there told me there was a lot of evidence, the forensic evidence that they've recovered, the cell phone that they've recovered. She didn't want to get into specifically what they've recovered in terms of a fingerprint, DNA but it's certainly going to help them when eventually they catch the suspect for a criminal prosecution.",

Moments ago, our own Shimon Prokupecz sat down with the NYPD commissioner and the chief of detectives who's leading this investigation about the manhunt for the gunman suspected of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. They said that they have reason to believe the person of interest left the city shortly after the shooting, riding away on a bike, then hailing a taxi before finally being seen entering the Port Authority bus terminal in Upper Manhattan.",

He's a retired FBI supervisory special agent. Steve, what happens now that they believe he's left the city?

You know, if he's from Atlanta, you aim it obviously at Atlanta, you blanket it there. But between New York and Atlanta, there's a lot of stops a bus makes. So they're really kind of in a bind here trying to figure out where he went. Of course, if they later on determine exactly which bus and what ticket he purchased, it's going to be a little easier.

      "sentences": "CNN's Gloria Pazmino is outside the courthouse. Gloria, what can you tell us? GLORIA PAZMINO, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENTThey are saying we are willing to do away with the first charge, manslaughter in the second degree. Remember, in order for this jury to reach a verdict, they have to rule on that first charge before they can even begin talking about the second charge. But the judge has not made a decision. Now, it's very important to highlight that while this discussion is happening, the defense has been opposed. They're saying that the jury cannot dismiss the charge because it will be coercive to the jury. They're saying that this should be a mistrial. They have called for a mistrial multiple times throughout this trial. But now that we are in the face of deliberations, and this jury has said twice now that it cannot get to an agreement on the first charge, Tom Kenniff, the lead attorney for Daniel Penny, is asking the jury, the judge, to declare a mistrial. They are going over the case law. Judge Wiley is looking closely at the proposal by the prosecution. But this is a very interesting development, and it just gives you an idea of how difficult it is, but also what these jurors might be talking about inside that courtroom. We know that they have asked for the definition of recklessness, the definition of what it is to be a reasonable person. They have asked to review video evidence. They have asked what it means to be charged with criminal negligence. This was part of the instructions that they received when they began deliberating this Monday. So it hasn't been that long, but it is Friday. There may be some people in there who want to go home and not come back here on Monday morning, but it's unclear to me as of this moment whether or not that is going to happen. Now, there is something that we can sort of interpret here from the prosecution's willingness to dismiss that first charge. They might be looking at this and saying to themselves, we may be only able to get a conviction on the lesser charge. And that's the only way they can sort of get a win on this case. So maybe that is why they are willing to let the first charge go. But you have to worry about how that could play with a jury who might hear we're letting the first charge go. They might think, well, why are we even here in the first place? So it's a really difficult position to be in. And the big question right now is whether or not Judge Wiley is going to allow the dismissal of the first charge. We're getting closer to the end of the day now. So he's either going to have to tell this jury you're going to have to come back here on Monday or he's going to have to make a decision on whether or not there is case law that allows him to dismiss that first charge or if he needs to give a real consideration to what the defense is asking for, which is a mistrial. Just hours ago, he told them it wasn't time for that yet. So we'll see if this jury is going to go home for the weekend and not come back here next week or if they'll be back here first thing Monday morning to continue deliberating on a case they seem to be not getting to an agreement on -- Brianna.",

Judge Wiley now granting the motion to dismiss the first count of manslaughter in the second degree. What this means in simplest terms is that Daniel Penny, who was looking at 15 years in prison, if convicted, is now looking at a maximum of four on the second charge, the criminally negligent charge.That's what he is facing now. The 15-year possibility is out the window after this jury has said twice now throughout today that they cannot get to an agreement. Now, the defense has motioned for a mistrial multiple times now, but the judge has not granted that motion. And we have also just learned that not only is he going to allow to dismiss the first charge, he's going to have them back here on Monday. So this is not over yet. Even though the defense has objected to the fact that they are allowing the first charge to be dismissed. Judge Wiley is telling them he will bring back the jury on Monday for them to continue deliberating on that second charge.",

NATHAN HUBBARD CO-HOST, THE RINGER'S \"EVERY SINGLE ALBUM\" PODCAST: I'm a little embarrassed to tell you that I went to seven shows at least. I saw it in London. I saw it in L.A. I saw it in Las Vegas. My girls made a cameo in the Eras tour film. So I have a lot to base it on. But to me, it was this monocultural moment at a time of a lot of division around the world and in this country. It was just this safe haven of a place where people could go and just be together in community with 70,000 of their best friends every single night. That to me is really what the lasting legacy and impact of this is going to be. And the fact that it was just this athletic feat. No one really had been up on stage for three and a half, three hours and 45 minutes playing their entire catalog. And I think as the world started to hear and see this through the online introspection every night and into some of the surprise songs, they started to understand this was something you just had to go be a part of.",

But at the end of the day, I think even with this last set of shows in Vancouver, she sold some seats that supposedly had no view for people to go stand in. She's put up screens for people to see. And I think the legacy for me of this tour is how much she invested in the fan experience, and it really raised the bar on a go-forward basis for all live performances where you're going to be expected to get up there and work your backside off, but also the visual component, the breadth of it, and the fan experience at the end of the day, she's really raised the bar for everybody.",
