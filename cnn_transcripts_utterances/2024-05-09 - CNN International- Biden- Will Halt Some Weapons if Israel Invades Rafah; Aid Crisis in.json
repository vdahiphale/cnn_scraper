      "sentences": "Yes, basically going back to the summer of 1982 when President Ronald Reagan, during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon and the subsequent siege of Beirut, essentially told the Israelis they have to stop bombing the western part of that city. This is certainly the first time since then that the Americans have really told the Israelis they've got to stop.But the Israelis, of course, are reacting with a fair amount of gall that the Americans would dare to suggest that they might limit the amount of weaponry provided to Israel in this war that's now gone on for more than seven months, resulting in the deaths of almost 35,000 Palestinians, 70 percent of whom it's believed are women and children. Now, we heard Israel's U.N. ambassador Gilad Erdan saying it's clear that any limitation in Israel coming from its allies is interpreted by its enemies as something that gives them hope to succeed in their actions. Now, another reaction we saw from Itamar Ben-Gvir, who's the national security minister and an extremist, he basically put on Twitter, Hamas heart Biden. So it does appear that despite the fact that the United States has just approved $14.1 billion in supplemental aid to Israel, in addition to the more than $3 billion that the United States provides to Israel on an annual basis, that the Israelis are very angry that after all this time, more than seven months of this war, the United States has finally told Israel it needs to put a limit on its operations in Gaza -- Max.",

It does not appear that they've gone much beyond that.The Israelis are insisting it is a limited operation, even though some of the open source imagery that has been made available from there would indicate that certainly they have deployed a huge number of tanks and other armored vehicles in that area. But as a result of this, we're hearing from the United Nations and others that there is a looming crisis, even more so in Rafah, that, for instance, the supply of fuel has now been cut off, that the hospitals have perhaps two, maybe three days' worth of fuel, after which they will stop, be able to run their generators that are providing power to all sorts of equipment, keeping people alive. Now, yesterday, the Israelis said that the Karem Abu Salem, or the Kerem Shalom crossing, that they control was open, but the United States and Palestinian officials are saying that, in fact, nothing crossed from Israel into Gaza through that crossing. So the situation continues to get worse and worse, in Rafah in particular, but, of course, in Gaza in general, where 2.3 million people are suffering from a lack of food, a lack of clean water, electricity, and basically, you know, the basic requirements of daily life -- Max.",

Now, Chinese President Xi Jinping is scheduled to meet with Hungary's president this hour in Budapest, the last leg of Xi's European tour. Later, he's expected to hold talks with Viktor Orban, Hungary's autocratic Prime Minister. Mr. Orban greeted Xi upon his arrival on Wednesday. The two are set for talks and a signing ceremony in the coming hour. Xi is looking to deepen his ties with Eastern Europe, where Chinese companies have invested billions of dollars as part of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative. Earlier on Wednesday, Xi and Serbia's president agreed on a shared future for their countries. They signed more than two dozen trade and regulation agreements and vowed to continue their partnership. Russia carried out a massive missile attack on Ukrainian energy infrastructure on Wednesday. Ukraine says Russia launched dozens of drones and missiles on Wednesday morning, targeting energy facilities across the country. At least three people were injured, and three Ukrainian power plants were struck, along with a number of other infrastructure targets. That was Russia's largest attack in weeks, which came as Ukraine marked its victory day over Nazism. But Ukraine's president used the occasion to denounce what he called new Nazism. In a video released on Wednesday, he compared the Russian invasion with Germany's occupation during World War II. He said history is now repeating itself in Ukraine. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): The world has slept through the revival of Nazism at 5 a.m. on February 24, 2022. And today, everyone who remembers World War II and has survived to this day is experiencing deja vu. The Battle of Kyiv, the bombing of Kharkiv, Odessa, Dnipro, mass graves, blockade of ports, plundering and seizure of grain, tortures, executions. Russia has brought the terrible past back into the daily news, proving with each new crime that Nazism has revived. Just this time, it has a new label, Made in Russia. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And it is very powerful in Russia, and it is a very meaningful day in Russia. Don't forget, some 27 million Soviet citizens were killed in World War II. It is, you know, something that everyone will be involved in. I've been in Russia for multiple victory days. You know, it's a day off work, it's a day off school. There are multiple celebrations. Lots of kids will be dressing up in military uniform. All of that predates the war in Ukraine. But it is significant that he has co-opted this messaging to support his war. And even though Russia is now, you know, in a better position on the battlefield than it was last year, we do see that sense of Russia being under threat, that nuclear saber rattling. That has been something that has stepped up in recent weeks as support for Ukraine among its Western allies has also stepped up. So there is that feeling of Russia under siege as well.",
