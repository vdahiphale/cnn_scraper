This was just a few vehicles carrying just a little bit of aid, absolutely nothing compared to the enormous crisis that's on the ground. And it's come a bit too late here, Lynda, to be frank. We're looking into the fourth day of this crisis, this aid should have shelter equipment in it essentially to try to give those who've been forced out of their homes by this earthquake or lost their homes in this earthquake. A bit of cover in these freezing cold temperatures. We have pictures we've seen on the ground from eyewitnesses of people just literally sleeping on the sidewalks in below zero-degree temperatures. So yes, this might begin to help some of that population. But I just can't emphasize enough how vulnerable millions of Syrians are. Some 4 million of them already depended on humanitarian aid before this earthquake hit. And shelter is just one of the many, many needs, the many, many things on the wish list for Syrians. They need medical air -- medical aid. Hospitals are running out, they're overwhelmed. They don't have the supplies they need to take care of many hundreds, if not more, thousands wounded people in Syria who need that care. You have to remember, we're talking about different authorities on the ground here. So I'm conflating it and making it all one area. But really, we're talking about a rebel enclave. That's one area, that's one set of authorities that aid groups have to deal with. Then you have other areas which are run, of course, by the Syrian government. They have other needs, a very complicated patchwork. But if you look at the human impact of that, what it means is there are kids who are gone cold and hungry, and many million people who simply don't know where they're going to sleep tonight, Lynda?",

But at night, those same clear skies allow all of the heat to escape into the upper atmosphere. And so temperatures drop very, very rapidly. This is cold, dry air. Temperatures right now are nice in the sunshine, five, seven, even up to even toward Elvaston (ph). We're still seeing temperatures around minus one, but it feels better than that in the sun. Here's the problem. 14 degrees below tonight in Elvaston (ph). There is still snow on the ground there. That's also allowing the heat to escape quicker than it would be without the cloud cover. So this is an up and down, up and down type of situation where morning lows in Elvaston (ph) will be 14 degrees below zero. It's hard to survive, even standing outside trying to stay warm. Think about that being under a building or not being able to get out of a building, 14 degrees below zero. Now in the afternoon, we're back up above zero for the most part. But it's the clear skies, it's the calm winds that are really making this a problem. And in the afternoon, those calm winds go away and you get wind chill factors 10 to 15 degrees below zero.

And then there is a spring offensive coming. And this could have an impact on Ukraine that doesn't have the number of tanks that Russia has, or the number of men that Russia can put into the front line with a high attrition rate there is. So, for the leadership, there's that understanding, but there's also, I think, more broadly an emotional connection as well. And President Zelenskyy thanked the European people for that, for looking after Ukrainian refugees, for coming out in support of Ukrainians. And that was really part of his message, to really connect with the population of Europe to, you know, tell them that we have shared values, explain to them why it is Ukraine wants to become a member of the European Union, which the European Council President Charles Michele said Ukraine have been taking good and positive and strong steps in that direction, despite the fact that it's under war. That the importance of making that connection that the Ukraine shares these European values is important for all the leaders that he met today, whether it's a 705 European members of parliament or the leaders of the different governments. Because it is that popular support, that popular support through the 446 million people that live within the European Union. It's their support that's going to allow the politicians to continue to spend from their budget, and put in the defense and military aid, humanitarian aid and all the other support that Zelenskyy knows he needs and he knows he's going to need it over the longer term.

So we are learning this morning actually that the Biden administration has determined that theseChinese balloons are able to conduct surveillance and eavesdrop essentially on communications. And that is something that had not previously been disclosed. Of course, the U.S. was concerned about the potential capabilities of the Chinese balloon to spy on sensitive military sites. So but that is a new detail that we are learning this morning. But we're also learning that just before this balloon actually entered U.S. airspace on January 28, the Defense Intelligence Agency which is the intelligence arm of the Pentagon, did flag through classified channels that a foreign object was headed towards United States airspace. However, this was not deemed as particularly urgent because the U.S. has surveilled a balloons like this in the past, and did not view them as a military threat. It was just not seen as something that would need to be dealt with urgently because it did not appear to pose a risk to people on the ground or a potentially large national security risk. So the thinking was that they would just wait and see what this balloon did. And they would potentially try to collect intelligence on the balloons maneuvers and what it actually was capable of doing. Well, now we are learning, of course, that the balloon actually did not take the expected path that officials believed it would. It made a sharp downward turn towards the continental United States, and ultimately ended up over Montana. And that is when officials started getting very concerned because this is not a pattern of behavior they had seen from these kinds of balloons before. And now, of course, we are learning this morning that this particular balloon was able to eavesdrop on electronic communications within the United States. But I should note, a senior administration official does tell us that the United States knew this at the time and took steps to avoid any unencrypted communications happening in the vicinity of that balloon.

Well, now China's defense ministry is saying they rejected that call because the conditions were not right, given the U.S. is, quote, irresponsible and seriously wrong approach. Now we've seen rhetoric from Beijing significantly harden after the U.S. military shut down the balloon. After Beijing initially expressed regret for what they claimed as a weather balloon flown off course, Beijing is now accusing the U.S. of overreacting and violating international practice. The contrast between what Beijing and Washington are claiming is only getting starker. China still doubling down on that claim that this was a civilian balloon that took an unplanned course that was out of their control. Meanwhile, the Pentagon has said it is -- has 100 percent certainty that the downed Chinese balloon was not being used for civilian purposes. CNN has also reported that U.S. intelligence officials believe the balloon is part of an extensive military run surveillance program that involves a fleet of balloons spanning five continents. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that claim is, quote, likely part of the U.S.'s information and public opinion warfare and accused the U.S. of being the world's largest surveillance reconnaissance country.

In Aleppo, 100,000 people are believed to be homeless, most of them are trying to stay warm in the cold and snow. In Turkey, aid is arriving from dozens of nations amid growing anger there over what critics call a slow response to the disaster. Turkeys President acknowledged the shortcomings but says his government is doing all it can to help every citizen who's been affected. In time, of course, running out to find trap survivors but there are some success stories. A man in southeastern Turkey rescued earlier Thursday after spending 77 hours buried in the rubble.

But for too many, it was too late. In the town of Kerkan, they mourned one of the many who've not made it out alive. With the death toll rising by the hour, this is a race against time. How many are buried under the wreckage of this massive quake zone? No one really knows. Estimates in the tens of thousands. Here in Adana, search and rescue crews worked tirelessly around the clock, digging through what used to be a 14-storey residential building where families lay asleep when the monstrous earthquake hit. Survivors have gathered at the site of the rescue mission, their shelter and hot meals. And in the bitter cold, they huddle around these fires, everyone with a story of the horror they've survived. The shock, the trauma, the pain visible on every face. Parents doing what they can to try and make their little ones forget. Many here are anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones and friends buried under what's left of their homes. (on camera): Get down. They're asking us to get down. And we believe this is because they're scanning the building, the wreckage. This is a very, very careful and delicate operation that's going on to try and see if they can locate any survivors, because so far they haven't been able to.

Even a small number of Western fighters would make a big difference, says Ukraine's Air Force spokesman. We can start with a few squadrons, he says, each with 12 jets. If we have one to two or more squadrons, it would be the first step for our pilots to transition. They can be information and perform combat missions on different directions. The U.S. has given the Ukrainian some air-launched anti-radiation missiles called HARM. But Kyiv says those too would work much better if launched from Western jets. The HARM missiles aren't as efficient as if they were used from American or other allied aircraft, the spokesman says. Their functionality is restricted. The range is shorter, making the efficiency lower. Ukrainian officials say they want U.S.-made F-16. So far, President Biden has ruled out giving Kyiv combat aircraft. But the U.K. says it will soon start training Ukrainian pilots. And Ukrainian officials tell CNN, they're confident they'll get jets, just like eventually they got the main battle tanks they requested.
