The IDF says they were killed by Hamas terrorists as they tried to escape the Nova Music Festival back on October 7th. Now, Israel believes that of the 240 people taken hostage, 125 are still in Gaza. Around 40 of whom are now believed to be dead. Jeremy Diamond shares the stories of three more lives lost. And a warning, his report does contain distressing images. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): They managed to escape Hamas' terrifying rampage at the Nova Music Festival on October 7th. But they did not survive the day. Hamas terrorists killed Shani Louk, Amit Buskila and Yitzhak Gelernter 10 miles down the road from the festival, according to the Israeli military. Their bodies taken into Gaza and held hostage.",

      "sentences": "Hi, Julia. Yes, you're absolutely right. It was a very, very poignant Friday here. Day two of one of the big four men'smajors. The biggest global events there are when it comes to world golf. A tragic loss of life in the 5:00 a.m. hour local time here. We now know that that was the last event connected to the tournament, a man working in the tournament. But Scottie Scheffler certainly generating all the headlines here. The world's top ranked golfer. He recently won a second Masters and he's trying to win a fifth victory out of six and a third career major. So, huge focus on him. What we do know is that this is the alleged altercation with the police officer in question. And I do want to tap into more about what Scottie Scheffler said earlier in the day, before he even started his round two. He started the day Friday in detention, in a jail cell, that mugshot going viral around the world, but he ended his day with some really impressive golf going right up the leaderboard to put the pressure on the leaders. But to elaborate more on the Scheffler statement, he said, I never intended to disregard any of the instructions. He wanted to make his focus on golf and he wanted also to pay his deepest respects, as I mentioned, to the loss of life. Though that was before he took to the field of play on the golf course here, having been detained and then released. And then there was a frantic dash to try and make his tee time. We were all wondering, would he actually make it in time to play? Would he be allowed to play legally speaking? He did. The crowd gave him a terrific reception, a real show of support for him. He is very, very popular. No question about that. And he really let his golf do the talking. He started with a birdie, then a bogey, then another birdie. But then he spoke after his round of 66. A very impressive 66. A five-under round of 66 Friday. Listen to what he had to say. The inner workings of his mind as he reflected back at those events during the 6:00 a.m. hour, Julia.",

Patrick Snell there at the PGA Championship in Libbyville for us. All right. Turning now to a CNN exclusive and disturbing new video shows business mogul Sean Diddy Combs beating his then girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, in a hotel hallway. Ventura sued Combs last year, alleging he raped and trafficked her, as well as subjecting her to years of abuse. Now, the footage appears to match an incident outlined in Ventura's suit. The case has since been settled. Just to give you a sense of what else is going on here, Combs is facing five other civil lawsuits accusing him of sexual misconduct and other illegal activity. He's denied the allegations. Elizabeth Wagmeister has more. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ELIZABETH WAGMEISTER, CNN ENTERTAINMENT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): New surveillance footage obtained exclusively by CNN appears to corroborate some of the allegations of abuse against music mogul Sean Diddy Combs. The video captured on multiple cameras shows Combs wearing only a towel, assaulting his then girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, in a hallway at a Los Angeles hotel in March 2016. A lawsuit filed by Ventura in November last year and settled the next day referenced actions that seem to match those seen in this video. There is no audio. According to the complaint, Combs became extremely intoxicated and punched Ms. Ventura in the face, giving her a black eye, which according to the lawsuit, prompted Ventura to try and leave the hotel room. The surveillance video obtained by CNN begins as she enters the hallway. The complaint says as she exited, Mr. Combs awoke and began screaming at Ms. Ventura. He followed her into the hallway of the hotel while yelling at her. The complaint goes on to say, he grabbed her and then took glass vases in the hallway and threw them at her. In the surveillance video, Combs can be seen grabbing Ventura and throwing her to the ground. As Ventura lies on the ground, Combs then kicks her twice and attempts to drag her on the floor back to the hotel room. Ventura is seen picking up a hotel phone. Combs seems to walk back to the hotel room, then returns and appears to shove her in a corner. Moments later, he can then be seen throwing an object in her direction. According to Ventura's now settled lawsuit, the pair began dating several years after they met in 2005. They parted ways in 2019. Combs' attorney said the decision to settle was in no way an admission of wrongdoing. Ventura declined to comment on the video, but her attorney told CNN, the gut-wrenching video has only further confirmed the disturbing and predatory behavior of Mr. Combs. Words cannot express the courage and fortitude that Ms. Ventura has shown in coming forward to bring this to light. The video hasn't been seen publicly before and comes on the heels of a series of civil lawsuits alleging Combs' involvement in sex trafficking and sexual abuse. Allegations that Combs has repeatedly denied. Authorities search Combs his home in Los Angeles and Miami in March as part of an ongoing federal investigation carried out by a team that specializes in human trafficking crimes. In a December 2023 statement, Combs responded to the claims in some of the lawsuits saying, sickening allegations have been made against me by individuals looking for a quick payday. Let me be absolutely clear, I did not do any of the awful things being alleged. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I think that's one of the biggest challenges that they're up against in sort of fleshing out this business model of licensing data to A.I. companies, is that users may not want to have their comments, their thoughts, their posts used and sold to A.I. companies as training data. But look, what we know about this deal is that it's going to provide OpenAI with Reddit data to train its models. But they've worded it in this way that suggests that they want ChatGPT, other OpenAI products to be able to surface Reddit content when people ask them questions, which could really benefit OpenAI because this is a whole repository of data where people are speaking in this very casual language, which is useful for training A.I. And people are often discussing current events, which is something that A.I. models currently sort of struggle with. They're trained on older data. And so, they're surfacing older information when you ask them questions. If they train on this Reddit data, they could potentially be surfacing more current information, which could be helpful. This deal also apparently will include OpenAI advertising on Reddit. So, again, sort of going to be beneficial for Reddit's core business as well as this new line of business that it's trying to build.

And it's -- I mean, thankfully the military support is getting there and the Ukrainians have mobilized additional troops, but it is late. They are stretched. They need to train those troops. And they also don't have the air defense. And the air defense doesn't appear to be available. It's certainly not in transit. It's not about to be approved.

It's got a cruise speed, I believe, of 110 miles per hour while in the air, but only 25 to 35 miles per hour on the ground. And it only weighs the same as a golf cart, I believe. So, I just worry about safety if it is involved in some kind of collision on the road. How do you get around sort of all of these things? I think the practicalities, I guess I'm asking.",

      "sentences": "Sure. So, on the ground, it's actually illegal because we don't want to crash test the car initially because you need the certification forthe car. So, it can drive much faster. It can go over 100 miles per hour. But legally, we're just limiting it to 25 to 35, right? Just because we don't want to crash test and we're going to different classification. Now, the safety, I love that you brought it up. Actually, so there is a flying safety and the ground safety. On the flying safety, so think about the current airplanes. You have two engines, right? And you have wings to engines and sometimes propellers, right? In our case, we have eight independent systems of propeller motor speed controller. And what it does, it makes it at least four times more redundancy, four to 16 times more redundancy because we have also in their system redundancy. And also, we have a ballistic parachutes, a full vehicle parachute, if anything like that. All the propellers and close. So, there is like level of safety, which had never been seen before in the air. On the ground when a car drives, it's actually also because it's a little bit longer and has like designed a little bit different. It uses incredibly strong carbon fiber. It also is one of the safest vehicles. And when it flies, it's a longer argument for what we have time, but it's actually good when you fly because you have more space to maneuver and more time to recover. Think about when the collision happens, like two vehicles try to occupy the same space and usually damage happens when you hit the curb or a tree, something where you don't have in the air and you have more time to recover, especially with redundancy on the systems and ballistic parachutes.",

I want to talk about cost, $300,000. Now, I will say I was so excited by the prospect of this that I did sign up. I'm one of those on the list that paid the $150. I've got my certificate and everything, Jim. It's very exciting. I'm clearly hoping to be involved in some kind of test ride at some point. But talk to me about how -- there it is, look -- how quickly can you make these things once you get the certification? As you say, you're hoping to make them, but, God, you're going to need a lot of money to produce these. Do you have enough money?",

      "sentences": "Well, right now we do have enough money to start producing the first batch. I'm assuming since you signed up recently, you're not going tobe in the first batch, but we'll get -- hopefully get to you pretty soon. So, we do have like on a first batch. Obviously when we go further, we're still fundraising. So, we'll need that. That being said, the cost being $300,000 right now, it's because only few are produced by hand. And the production is not optimized. When the volume will increase and when production will be optimized, we tend to go towards something under $35,000. And the reasoning for it is very simple. The simplicity of the design, the car itself is simpler than Ford Focus or Toyota Corolla or anything like that. But we need to get to their numbers. We need to get to their level of efficiency production, then it will be affordable. Right now, it's early adopters like you, which is absolutely great. You would be one of the first people, hopefully in your town, maybe in your country to actually use it and get all the benefits, but then the cost will shrink eventually. And hopefully, we'll get to people down the line.",

To have 3,000, the wait list, to be in a position where you've got 3,000 of these that are flying around, how long are we talking, five years, 10 years? What do you think?",
