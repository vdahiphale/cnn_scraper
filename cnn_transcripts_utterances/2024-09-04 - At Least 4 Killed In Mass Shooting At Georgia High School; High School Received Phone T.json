I'm Brianna Keilar alongside Boris Sanchez, and we are following breaking news.At least four people are dead, nine others have been taken to hospitals after a school shooting in Winder, Georgia. This is about 45 minutes or an hour northeast of Atlanta. And authorities say the suspect is in custody, is alive. Sources telling us he is a 14-year- old boy, but it's unclear if he attended Apalachee High School. The shooting happened around 9.30 AM this morning. That's when the 911 calls started coming in there from the high school in Barrow County. And aerial footage of the campus showing students actually forming right here in the end zone of the football field a prayer circle. Right now, authorities are working to reunite students with their families, many describing a terrifying moment that they started hearing gunshots. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And I was like, no, no, guys, like I told everybody to get down, get down, because this like - you don't joke around with that, you know.So then like the - like we got in a corner, some girls started crying. And then like - I was, like, calm down. And then the teacher, she was shaking. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This was an event in which she was going to unveil a new phase of her economic plan for her potential administration. But obviously, we think that she is going to address what happened in Georgia.We also are getting some breaking news from CNN's John Miller and Mark Morales. Apparently, the high school at the center of today's mass shooting had received an earlier phone threat. That's according to multiple law enforcement officials. Let's go ahead and go to John Miller right now. Because, John, as you're getting these details, this is very significant. Apparently, law enforcement got word that there was a warning about shootings at five schools and this would be the first.",

      "sentences": "That is what we're told. Investigators are probing reports that a phone call was made to Apalachee High School this morning saying that there would be shootings at five schools, that it would be the first. If we go back through some of our reporting and we talk about how police deployed to all the schools in Barrow County, all the high schools, even though there were no reports of shots fired there, that could have been an abundance of caution and a good response tactic or it could have been in relation to that threat.So what they are investigating now is, is it possible that that threat came from the student who is in custody as the alleged shooter? Is it possible that that threat came from someone that he asked to make that phone call at or about the time that he opened fire? The timing here is obviously going to be important as to when that threat came in, whether it was reported to police, how it was handled and so on. But we now have from multiple sources that that is an avenue of investigation, that there was this phone threat that came in this morning purportedly about a shooting that was going to take place at five schools, including this one.",

But we also have to remember that these threats come in quite often to schools, sometimes in large spates, and they are almost always unfounded. And they are largely generated to cause disruption in the school system.If you look at this particular Board of Education's website for Barrow County, they acknowledge that there are unsubstantiated threats. They acknowledge that they're mostly to cause disruption, and they acknowledge that they treat threats that mention one of their schools with specificity differently. [15:05:00] So the questions are going to be, who at the school took the threat? What did they do with that report? Was it reported to local police? Was there a response from local police? And what was the timing between that threat being received, police arriving on the scene if in fact they responded to the threat, and the actual shooting, which, of course, brought a larger police response? We need to be very careful about making any prejudgments there, because this is just a lead, we are told, that's being investigated. But as you point out, all of those questions will have to be gone through.",

They must have been allowed in at some point to go up there, because they're escorting their children down. So I'm not sure if they're releasing kids, maybe by the classroom. But it's very clear when looking at the faces of the parents, the relief or shell shock. These are the two things that I'm seeing on their face. Hugging their children, knowing that they're safe or just shell shocked at the situation, at the fact that this happened in their backyard at the school.But an incredibly emotional - understandably emotional moment for so many kids, piecing for me in their tales what it is that happened, telling me that they got a hard alert on the monitors there of the screen and red letters telling them that they were on lockdown, letting them know this was the real deal. This is not a drill. Shouts, cries, screams from the students as they took cover in the classrooms, as teachers were helping to barricade the doors. I've also been told time and time again, students on their cell phones, right? Internet culture immediately reaching out to their parents, letting them know, hey, I'm okay, or mom, dad, I'm scared. I don't know what's going on. Just in case anything happens, I love you. Here's one of the students and what she witnessed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

In fact, if you break down battleground state polling across six states that CNN looked at, among - even among voters that don't have the economy as their top concern, there is still evidence that Donald Trump is more appealing on this issue to a significant swath of the electorate. So that's why you see Harris opening up this new avenue with promises to small businesses and an added emphasis, again, on handling economic issues.To the breaking news that we were tracking earlier, her comments about this shooting at Apalachee High School in Winder, Georgia, the Vice President saying that her heart is with that community. It is a senseless tragedy on top of so many other senseless tragedies. She said it's outrageous that parents in the United States have to worry about whether their kids will come back home from school alive. She repeated the refrain. It doesn't have to be this way to applause. She said it's one of many issues that will define this election. One of many things that's at stake in which she differentiates herself from former President Donald Trump.",
