Here are some of today's top stories.An oppressive heat wave is set to hit large parts of the U.S. this week, and nearly 200 heat records could be tied or at least broken. About 82 percent of the population could see temperatures above 90 degrees Fahrenheit right now. More than 60 million people are under heat alerts. Two trains collided in India's West Bengal state, leaving at least eight people dead and dozens of others injured. Police say three compartments were derailed when a goods train rammed into a passenger train from behind. Anti-government protests blocked major highways across Israel for a second day. The protesters, many of whom are students, called for elections, the release of hostages in Gaza and the return of Israeli soldiers. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrapped up his peace summit in Switzerland, seeing a strong show of support from his allies. More than 80 countries backed a joint statement calling for territorial integrity for Ukraine, but key holdouts included India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and the United Arab Emirates. This comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin unveiled his terms for a so-called peace proposal on Friday, which was criticized by many world leaders. Mr. Zelenskyy closed the summit with this warning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It contained the same demands that we heard from him before the war, that Ukraine should remain neutral, not join NATO, all of that. And his spokesman actually came out and said that he thinks people in Kyiv are looking at this and saying, look, the conditions are worse now than they were in 2022, and considering it. So they are openly making it clear the strategy is to try to exhaust Ukraine through these ongoing battles, which we still see raging on the northern front.",

It's a very clear sign of improving ties as the Chinese Premier, Li Keqiang, continues his four-day visit to Australia.Again, this is the first visit to Australia by a Chinese Premier since early 2017, and relations are improving despite many years of tension, tension over trade as well as foreign interference. Now, the two leaders met for talks earlier today, the Australian Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, and the Chinese Premier, Li Keqiang. They agreed to greater military-to-military communication, and China also added Australia to its list of visa-free countries. Other agenda items up for discussion also included -- let's bring it up for you -- trade and energy, of course, regional security, climate change, human rights, and the fate of a jailed Australian writer, Yang Hengjun. Now, Yang is a pro-democracy blogger and a spy novelist who is facing a suspended death sentence on espionage charges in China. Now, despite the many points of contention here between these two countries, the Australian Prime Minister hailed the stabilization of ties. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Planes grounded Tuesday in the capital of the Spanish island, Mallorca, one of Europe's hottest travel destinations. Meanwhile, roads in Murcia more resembled raging rivers. In Mexico, the opposite problem. This lagoon used to be filled with water, now largely dried up with a sea of dead fish left behind. High temperatures in the northern part of the country have caused a drought, withering crops and drying up water reservoirs. These cows slowly succumbing to their now barren environment. ISMAEL CATANO, FARMER (through translator): Many farmers have already gotten rid of their cows because of the lack of water and food. It hasn't rained and the food is very scarce. The animals are very weak because of the lack of food and water. HOLMES (voice-over): Blistering heat now a common theme, as naturally warmer summer months in many countries combine with human-caused global warming to cause locals and tourists alike to swelter. Greece has begun shutting down its Ancient Acropolis during the peak heat of the day. Tourists equipped with fans, hats and umbrellas douse themselves with water, doing their best not to let the heat set their summer vacations ablaze. Meanwhile, the elderly find temporary relief in cooling centers. FOFO KALYVA, GENERAL SECRETARY, HEALTH MINISTRY OF GREECE (through translator): Every year we see a rise in temperatures, and every time we remark that they are higher than the usual levels for the same period. June was never such a warm month with such temperatures. Every year the departments of the health ministry would issue guidance. Nowadays this is happening sooner and sooner and more frequently. HOLMES (voice-over): From droughts to floods to brutal heat, regions sitting a world apart are linked by some of the same challenges. As extreme weather takes hold of countries across the globe, the effects of a warming earth are ever clear. Michael Holmes, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

McIlroy led at one point but faltered in the home stretch, bogeying three of the final four holes.DeChambeau held his nerve with a crucial sand save at 18, made par, and at one over for the round secured his second championship in five years.
