Israelsays a female Israeli soldier kidnapped by Hamas on October the 7th, is being reunited with her family. The army says she was released as part of a ground operations in Gaza and appears to be healthy. And just a short time ago, Hamas released a new hostage video, which we are not going to air right now. And in that video, it shows three women confirmed by the IDF to be hostages. One of them addresses Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying you promised to release us all. CNN is unable to verify whether the statement was made under duress or anything about the women's well-being. All this, of course, comes as Israel expands its ground operations, moving deeper into Gaza. Israel's military says it killed four senior Hamas operatives and dozens of Hamas fighters. And the humanitarian crisis in Gaza growing more dire by the hour. A U.N. official says the fabric of society is starting to break down in Gaza. Well, just minutes ago, in the last ten minutes or so, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a stark message. This is a time for war, he said. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The situation is as dire a situation as I've ever dealt with, about 30 years working in humanitarian assistance. So, you know, you heard the figures, over 8,000 dead, over 20,000 injured, now only two-thirds of hospitals functioning, 71 percent of clinics not functioning.

We don't have many details or very scant details, in fact, about how she came to be released, but the IDF says it was a ground operation. We do know, to give this some context, that both the IDF and private individuals had been offering incentives to the citizens of Gaza to provide information about the whereabouts of hostages. We don't know if it was intelligence, timely intelligence that led to her release, or whether it was the ground invading force happened to find a tunnel system that she was in, those details haven't been released. But I think, you know, is in many ways unexpected at this early stage of the ground incursion. I think a lot of people were fearing that once the ground incursion got underway, that many of the hostages would die and perish in the intensity of the fighting.

Possibly, helicopters firing munitions down, sort of in a steep trajectory. We can see them going down, we can see the sort of red traces, the red trace, if you will, the back of it -- the back of these individual rockets. We don't know precisely what they are, but I think this is indicative of ground forces calling in precise and smaller munitions on targets. You get the explosions like the one we just heard there.

So, the way this is supposed to work, at least, is the northern part will be the military zone, the zone of battle, if you will. The southern part will be more or less a safe haven.

First of all, the hostages we believe, that most and the Israelis seem to believe the same thing that most of, if not all of the hostages are actually in the tunnels. And so from a military perspective, that's one part of the mission, is to free those hostages. The other part of the mission is, of course, to go after all the elements of Hamas and render them inoperable, in essence, and of course, they're also in the tunnels. So, this gets to be a very difficult proposition to -- for the Israelis to carry out, because on the one hand, they want to save lives in the form of the hostages, on the other hand, they want to be able to eliminate the threat that they perceive from Hamas. And so, from a pure military standpoint, what they're looking at is trying to, in essence, destroy the military infrastructure and the leadership infrastructure of Hamas. So the tunnels are key to this, and those helicopter gunships that Nic was describing, they are the ones -- they are a primary instrument of power that can be used in a situation like this, where they will go after these targets, and they are probably the best weapon that the Israelis can use, in addition to, of course, their ground forces, and they are really skilled at eliminating opposition through, you know, using that form of air power as well as infantry and armor as it goes through that -- those areas.",

The Israeli government has since come out and called on the Russian Federation to ensure the safety, not just of Israeli citizens, but of course of all Jews inside Russia as well. The United States has done the same thing as far as that airport in Makhachkala is concerned. The authorities are saying that they've surveyed the damage there. The airport is once again open. Flights are departing from there, however, certainly no flights to and from Israel, Isa.",

According to the IDF, the soldier was released during Israel's ground operations in Gaza. They say she is doing well and is back with her family. Earlier, Hamas released a new hostage video showing three women who they say are being held. We will not be airing it right now. One of the women in it pleads with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to secure the release of all hostages. CNN cannot verify whether the statements were made under duress. Well, some of the family members of the hostages held by Hamas spoke earlier in Tel Aviv in the last 20 minutes or so. Here's some of what they had to say. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): These crimes against humanity, these crimes against kids, elderly, children and are unforgiven. In addition, all the families would like to thank citizens for all the strength you give us. Don't leave us. Don't leave us alone for a minute. Support us.

But we're also getting signals that Hezbollah is not as eager as some might think to actually become involved in a full-scale war. For instance, today, a senior Hezbollah official at a speech at a ceremony said that Hezbollah is fully prepared and ready to confront all possibilities, but then he added but we also take into account the national interests and the interests of the people. Hezbollah is, as aware as anybody else here in Lebanon, that this country is in the depths of the worst economic crisis in its history. This is a country that cannot afford a repeat of the 2006 war, which left large parts of Beirut destroyed and much of southern Lebanon destroyed as well. And even for instance if you go look yesterday over the weekend, Ebrahim Raisi, the president of Iran said on social media that Israel has crossed the red lines in Gaza which may force everyone to take action. I think what you should -- we should stress when looking at that sentence by president Raisi is may be forced to take action. Certainly the rhetoric from the Iranians has sort of swerved back and forth between caution and these veiled threats. But even Iran perhaps doesn't want to risk losing Hezbollah and perhaps being at the receiving end of fire not just from Israel, but from the United States as well, which has concentrated large forces in the Mediterranean in the form of two carrier groups. The situation is tense, but there are indications that Hezbollah, for its part, does not want to cross what the Israelis have called the threshold of escalation. Isa.",
