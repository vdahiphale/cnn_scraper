These people were in their 30s, 40s and 50s, and CDC is issuing a very brunt piece of advice. Cancel any appointments that you might have to get an epidural for an anesthetic in Mexico. Now if anything sounds familiar, it's because 11 years ago something very similar happened. People in the United States getting care in the United States were getting fungal infection from epidurals.

So, it kind of makes sense if you keep up with exercising regularly, that means you'll have a stronger immune system that can fight off flu infections easier.And in this particular study researchers looked at data on more than 577,000 adults -- that's from 1998 through 2018. They found that compared with the adults who did not get the recommended amount of exercise each week, those who did have a 48 percent lower risk of dying from flu and pneumonia. And even the adults who got the recommended amount of aerobic exercise, but maybe didn't do as much strength training, they had a 36 percent lower risk of dying from flu and pneumonia. So, this study shows that getting regular exercise does have those benefits. And what I mean by the recommended amount, it's recommended for adults to get at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise each week, as well as two days of strength training -- Jim.",

So those are differences. If you do tend to do more vigorous exercise, it's recommended to get at least 75 minutes of vigorous, at least 150 of moderate each week. Jacqueline, thanks so much.

Right now, in South Carolina, a fierce debate over a six-week abortion ban. Democrats have turned it into an endurance test, attaching roughly a thousand amendments to the bill, a delay tactic to make this take as long as possible.In North Carolina, Republicans voted to override the Democratic governor's veto of new abortion restrictions. So, beginning in July, most abortions after 12 weeks will be illegal in that state. And nationally, a ban on the widely used abortion pill mifepristone is again being weighed by the courts. The medication has been on the market for more than two decades, and it's become the most common method of abortion in the United States. Three Republican-appointed federal judges are now hearing those arguments. CNN's Jake Tapper is covering all of this on the next hour on \"The Lead.\" He joins me now. Jake, abortion medication being tried in front of the most conservative court -- (CROSSTALK) JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR, \"THE LEAD\": In New Orleans, yes. And the -- it's a three-judge panel at the 5th Circuit Court. One of the judges, a Trump a appointee named James Ho, has in the past referred to abortion as a moral tragedy. So, it is -- I mean, who knows what's going to happen. But it does not seem likely that they are going to side on those who want mifepristone to be available nationally. It's, look, I mean for those who support abortion rights and access to abortion, it's a very difficult time for them right now. Conservatives are passing abortion bans all over the country. You mentioned North Carolina and you mentioned South Carolina. There's also Nebraska. They are attaching an abortion ban of sorts to a bill that has to do with banning transgender health care, puberty blockers and the like, to minors. And of course, and then you have the mifepristone issue. We're going to be talking about this with Congresswoman Nancy Mace. She is a Republican from South Carolina. She calls herself pro-life, but she is also somebody who thinks that Republicans are going too far in these bans. So, we'll be talking to her about that.",

So, they're saying chances are 98 percent we're going to set a new record. Break the 2016 record for the highest record ever recorded. And then the five-year period going forward is 98 percent chance that will be the hottest five years ever. We just had the seven hottest years ever recorded as well. But it's important to remember that 1.5 number that we've trying to avoid with the Paris Accord, that's the long-term trend. We could cross it. Maybe go to 1.8 in the next couple years and then come back. And it wouldn't mean that we've gone past the point of no return. It could take decades for the long-time trend line to get past that one point. But if that does happen, what we're worried about is ice sheet collapse. And we're worried about methane being released from the permafrost up in the arctic. And coral loss -- a lot of coral around the world would be lost between 1.5 to 2. And there is time to stop this warming, especially by going after methane -- the main ingredient for natural gas. That is a much more potent heat trapping pollution than carbon dioxide, much easier to capture and easier to control in the near-term.",
