Today on the very last day of its term, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that former President Trump does have immunity for some official actions during his presidency, possibly including attempts to overturn the 2020 election. But the justices did not specify exactly which actions that includes which sets up another lower court battle in the January 6 case and making it incredibly unlikely that Trump will actually face that trial before the November election. On the other side of the ballot in just hours, President Biden will return to Washington, D.C. undoubtedly a weaker candidate than he was at this point last week. President Biden huddled at Camp David over the weekend with his family, which sources say encouraged him to stay in the race. His family reportedly blaming Biden's stunningly flawed debate performance on his top aides and advisors.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Presidents have to be given total immunity. They have to be allowed to do their job. PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Supreme Court partially siding with former President Donald Trump in his ongoing January 6 case, ruling that former Presidents are entitled to some immunity from prosecution for official actions, but not for private conduct. In the 6-3 opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts writing for the majority: At least with respect to the president's exercise of his core constitutional powers. This immunity must be absolute. The president enjoys no immunity for his unofficial acts and not everything the president does is official. The president it is not above the law. The high court though, leaving it up to lower courts to determine which actions are official and therefore immune. Roberts writing: Other allegations -- such as those involving Trump's interactions with the vice president, state officials, and certain private parties and his comments to the general public present more difficult questions, meaning District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is overseeing Trump's January 6 case, will need to decide whether Trump's pressure campaign to get Vice President Pence --",

They can bring him Mike Pence, they can bring in Mark Meadows, they can bring all these people.

But Biden it has been performing poorly in front of cameras for some time now, right? There was a big course around this when he gave the press conference after the special counsel report, but right around that same time, people now forget it a bit. But if something that was on my mind, but I did that piece in February. They skipped the Super Bowl interview. Why did they do that? He's been getting fewer interviews and any other president in recent history. He's been getting fewer press conferences than any other recent president in history. There has been a clear way in which they have not trusted him to be out there in improvised settings off of the teleprompter responding to be given take when things could turn antagonistic. Then in the single biggest showing that we've seen the debate, he fell apart. There's an issue here whether or not he is capable of performing the job of the presidency, right, performing get in front of cameras on the campaign, and also a question of actual capacity. I mean, the idea this is all completely separate from the job of the presidency, from what he might be like evoking up in the middle of the night in an emergency, it doesn't make sense. And the fatalism the Democratic Party has fallen into where they're giving the American people, let me keep saying democracies on the ballot, a choice for the American people say, well, we think this person is too old to serve as president, I do believe democracy is on the ballot and this is not important.

Convention processes or thing we have done for a very long time in American history. Frankly, a lot less unprecedented and running and 81-year-old who is behind in the polls and just got demolished in the debate for reelection. And so, I did along pockets, Kay Mark (ph), who's an expert on convention rules on this. People go look at, look it up. We also republished it on Tuesday. But the basic thing is they would have to be a different kind of campaign if he said so I did step aside tomorrow. What would have to happen as it there'd be a lot of town halls in the media with different Democratic candidates would be a lot of meetings at the convention.
