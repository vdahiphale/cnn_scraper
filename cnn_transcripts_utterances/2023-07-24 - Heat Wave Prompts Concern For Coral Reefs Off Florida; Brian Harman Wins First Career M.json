Governor Greg Abbott maintains the state has sovereign authority to defend the U.S. border and is refusing to pull a floating barrier from the Rio Grande River. The Justice Department has threatened to sue Texas if the barrier is not removed. Amid widespread protests, the Israeli Parliament is scheduled to vote next hour on part of that controversial plan to overhaul the judiciary. It comes after Prime Minister Netanyahu was fitted with a pacemaker. First lady Jill Biden is heading to Paris today to make the U.S. decision to rejoin UNESCO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. She will also honor U.S. troops who died during World War II. At least 35 million people are under excessive heat warnings this morning as dangerously high temperatures bake areas that have been scalding for weeks. This unrelenting heat could break even more records in the days ahead with little relief in sight. CNN's Derek Van Dam has the forecast. This has been unrelenting.

The Liberty breaking the WNBA record for points in a quarter, dropping 44 in the first against the Indiana Fever. New York made its first nine shots of the game -- 15 of their first 18. They led by 27 after one. New York went on to win by 18. They now find themselves in second place behind the Las Vegas Aces, just past the halfway mark of the season. And if Shohei Ohtani's days with the Angels are numbered he sure gave the fans a way to remember him. Ohtani unleashing his league-leading 36th home run of the season -- an absolute laser to dead center field and a win over the Pirates. Yesterday was the Angels' last home game before the August first trade deadline. Ohtani, in the final year of his contract, has never made the postseason with L.A. and the team is four games out of a playoff spot this year. So making the two-way star potentially the biggest trade chip since Babe Ruth. I know a lot of fans are going to be sad to see him go if he does go. He is just incredible. And finally, a bit of a snafu during the post-race celebration at yesterday's Formula One race in Hungary. While trying to open his giant champagne bottle by slamming it on the podium, second-place finisher Lando Norris accidentally broke Max Verstappen's first-place trophy. But you know what's funny about this? You can see Norris kind of barely give a second look before just kind of moving on. He's like oh, I guess that happened. But Verstappen has quite a few of those. I mean, he has won seven straight races. He's a two-time champ. But a little bit of a 'my bad' there. It's just a shame when your champagne bottle gets in the way of breaking your trophy as a Formula One driver. You know what I mean?",

Thousands of part-time workers were pushing for higher pay. If no deal is reached by July 31, the Teamsters Union, which represents 340,000 UPS workers, has vowed to walk off the job. It would be America's biggest strike in 60 years. More on that in just a moment here. But looking at markets around the world this Monday morning, Asian markets finished mixed. The Hang Seng finished two percent lower, dragged down by weak Chinese property stocks. European markets are mixed this morning. And on Wall Street, stock index futures are leaning higher here. The S&amp;P and the Dow finished higher last week. The Dow notching 10 straight days of gains. That has not happened since 2017. The Nasdaq fell, though, driven by a sell-off in Tesla and Netflix. On inflation watch, gas prices rose a penny overnight to $3.60 a gallon -- still, considerably lower than a year ago. It is a very busy jam-packed summer week for investors. The economic calendar is really full here. The Fed is expected to raise interest rates this week, and we have some big names in tech reporting earnings. You can see Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet on the docket. All right. Tomorrow, UPS and the Teamsters will be back at the negotiating table. They're trying to reach a new contract agreement to prevent a possible strike that could cost the country billions of dollars. Teamsters Union president Sean O'Brien spoke about the situation on Saturday.

The impact that we're seeing right now, I think most of us hope that it's a short-term hit if the strike occurs.
