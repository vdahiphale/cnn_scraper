      "sentences": "Good evening. Welcome to THE WHOLE STORY. I'm Anderson Cooper.Tonight brings us to one of the most beautiful and progressive cities in America. It's a city known as much for its social activism as it is for its wealth and innovation, particularly in the tech world. It's home to the highest number of billionaires per capita in the country. But it's also one of the least affordable places to live. It's San Francisco. The city some say is in steep decline because of crime, homelessness and drug use. More people died from drug overdoses in this city during the COVID pandemic than from the virus itself. CNN's Sara Sidner heads to the Bay Area, a place she once called her home to show us what it looks like now and find out what happened to San Francisco. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR (on camera): So when I first laid eyes on San Francisco, I was enchanted. From where I am right now, driving over the Bay Bridge, and it looked like someone had taken an enormous vat of fog and just continuously poured it over the hills, like dry ice being poured over a perfectly sculpted city on a stage. And then you get down into the city and you meet these glorious human characters. And you get to experience the micro climates and the terrifyingly steep hills that make the city an adventure. Then there's the glorious bridges that sit in the bay and welcome you in to the shining city on a hill. The endlessly diverse neighborhoods, from Chinatown, to the Mission, to the Italian enclave of North Beach, to the pristine presidio, which gives the city its lungs, and down to the Pacific, that rests below, inviting you in, and then biting your skin with its ice-cold touch. This city was endlessly magic. And I loved this city. I mean, truly loved the city. And I still do. It's just that it hurts to see what's happened to it.",
