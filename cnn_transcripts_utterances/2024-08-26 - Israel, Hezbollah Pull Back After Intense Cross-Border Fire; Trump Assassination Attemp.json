Both sides claimed success after a barrage of cross-border fire over the weekend. Israel launched what it called preemptive strike, saying it destroyed thousands of rocket launcher barrels in southern Lebanon just minutes before has below was set to fire them as blow still managed to launch hundreds of rockets and drones towards Israel. What it later called the first stage of retaliation for the assassination of a top Hezbollah commander by Israel last month. Remarkably, the attacks did not scuttle the Gaza ceasefire negotiations which a U.S. official familiar with the talks tells me, have made progress and are now centered on final details and nuts and bolts issues, though. Some questions remain new Israeli evacuation orders in Gaza forced the U.N. to suspend aid deliveries on Monday due to security risks. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is in Haifa in northern Israel. Jeremy, I wonder when you speak to Israeli officials, do they believe the temperature has been lowered somewhat?",

      "sentences": "They do, Jim, but there are qualifying that quite significantly by saying that it really is just for now, just for the short term. And that's because beyond Hezbollah, of course, there is still this threat of Iranian retaliation aimed at Israel over the killing of Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas's political leader while he was does in Tehran.But for now at least, both Israel and Hezbollah seem to be more eager for de-escalation rather than continuing to climb up that ladder of escalation as we have been watching over the course of the last few weeks. And it's quite remarkable yesterday how quickly that attack started and how quickly we then headed for de-escalation. It was just a matter of a few hours that we saw those Israeli strikes in southern Lebanon carried out by a force of about 100 Israeli fighter jets striking -- striking dozens of Hezbollah rocket launcher sites and then those hundreds of Hezbollah rockets and drones, all of which appear to have not hit their targets, at least according to Israeli officials who say that all those drones were intercepted, none of the rockets hit military bases in central or northern Israel. And what we have seen emerge here is both sides basically trying to claim victory, both sides claiming short-term victories, at least here. Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's head yesterday, saying that it -- Hezbollah carried out the first phase of its retaliatory strikes, he claimed that they had been successful. Israel for its part touted that preemptive strike for thwarting what they said would have been a much larger attack as well as of course that successful air defense operation for now, at least the temperature in the region is lowered. But how long that actually lasts remains to be seen.",

But of course, the devil is the details with negotiations like this, and it boasts sides have different definitions of what's populated and unpopulated.Jeremy Diamond in Haifa, thanks so much. The Pentagon on Monday did not put a timeline or an end date on keeping not one, but two U.S. carrier strike groups in the Middle East amid tensions in the region, ongoing threat from Hezbollah and Iran. That U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin decided over the weekend to keep the U.S. as Theodore Roosevelt carrier strike group in the Middle East, along with the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group. CNN's Jennifer Hansler, she's been covering diplomatic developments from the State Department. Jennifer, that presence is part of the U.S. response here, deterrent in part, also providing intelligence support and air defense support to Israel.

We just heard from the National Security Council's John Kirby, that they are keeping this robust presence as he called it, as a way to ensure that there are no further flare-ups that could derail these talks. He said, it is the U.S. view that Iran remains posture to and prepared for a potential retaliatory attack if they choose to.Right now, we don't see any indications that Tehran is necessarily looking to cause a regional war. And there has been a number of diplomatic exchanges through third parties to try to keep that from happening. But the U.S. is keeping this robust military presence there to show that they are ready to defend Israel should that become necessary? Now at the same time, this is happening. We have these working level talks continuing in Cairo. Kirby said they are expected to continue over the coming days and that they are continuing to seem constructive. Now, as we heard from Jeremy, oftentimes we have where the U.S. go a little bit further in terms of their optimism. He is saying that it has gotten to the point though -- Kirby is saying they've gotten to the point that they make sense to go into the nitty- gritty details like you and I have reported out on the Philadelphi corridor, on the number of hostages exchanged for prisoners in each phase, in each week of that first phase. So they are down to the nitty-gritty according to the U.S. But we have also been here before. We heard just a few weeks ago, a senior administration official saying that they hope to bring this to an end last week, that clearly it did not happen. So a lot rides on these working level talks as they try to get to this implementation phase and get this deal across the finish line here, Jim.",

While we're talking about six weeks after that shooting, an attempted assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, it's a little less than a dozen lawmakers here who have arrived at the grounds of the Butler farm show as you said and as I believe we have video of that, they actually not just went to the area where former President Trump was speaking. They also he went on top of the roof where the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire.We're actually about to hear from a number of those lawmakers as they're just wrapping up their tour and about to address the press probably in the next five minutes or so. But let me tell you what exactly they're hoping to find. Like you said, this is a bipartisan group of lawmakers. They make up the official task force here on behalf of Congress. And I should note, this is one of many investigations that we should say that are currently being conducted into what exactly happened back here on July 13. But this particular group, their goal is to fact fine on the ground with Congressman Jason Crow from Colorado, a Democrat, saying that there really is no substitute for being on site where it all happened. That's why they're out here. They're speaking with Pennsylvania state police and other local law enforcement officers as well to get their perspective of what was happening on the ground specifically leading up to the moment of that shooting. Now, meanwhile, this comes as we've been learning a lot really troubling details about some of the planning that went into the day of the rally locally and specifically from Secret Service, we learned late last week our team from CNN reporting that there were actually radios that local law enforcement had left out for Secret Service to use and Secret Service never came to collect them. And, of course, we've been talking so much about the importance of communication at that rally on the lack thereof that may have contributed to this shooting incident. The other thing that we learned, Jim, over the past 72 hours is that multiple Secret Service personnel from the Pittsburgh office about an hour south of where we are here in Butler, and one member of the Trumps security detail, they have I've been assigned to administrative duty in the wake of this shooting. But again, what were looking at here specifically with this congressional task force and this site survey, if you will, they're taking one step to really put a clear picture and a clear description as to what happened and what went wrong and to try and prevent a gym from happening again -- Jim.",

So, in two weeks, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have agreed to take the stage and debate September 10, hosted by ABC News, despite some questions based on Trump posts over the weekend. The terms, however, are still being negotiated and like so many things in this race, it's getting messy. At the center of the feud is whether to mute or not mute the microphones when it is not a candidate's turn to speak. Harris's campaign says, do not mute a challenge for Trump, in their words quote, to act presidential for 90 minutes. Team Trump says the rules should not change from the deal struck with Biden though Trump himself today contradicted his own campaign. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're thinking about it. We're thinking about it. They also want to change the rules. You know, the deal was we keep the same rules. Now, all of a sudden, they want to make the change in the rules. We agreed do the same rules. I don't know, it doesn't matter to me. I'd rather have it probably on, but the agreement was that it would be the same as it was last time. In that case, it was needed. I didn't like it the last time, but it worked out I fine. I mean, ask Biden how it worked out. It was fine. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, I can't think of something more ridiculous to be debating in this campaign right now, given all the issues and all the differences between these candidates on so much, then whether to mic or not to mic. But there is some method behind this madness is there not, Laura, in that it appears that Trumps own team, his own campaign, believes muting the mic is to his advantage, seemed to have made him seem more presidential in the Biden debate. And Harris seems to think that un- muting him is to their advantage. Is that -- is that the right impression of this? LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  Yeah, that is the right impression, Jim. I mean, we've seen in focus groups after not just the last Trump-Biden debate, but also their debates in 2020, that Trumps its ability to veer off message him, making strange comments, him lobbying personal attacks, all are bad for him when it comes to voters' perceptions of him. And in focus groups, after all of those debates, be the ones in 2020 or the one that happened earlier this year, voters didn't like it when they started hearing Trump just personally attack Biden or go after him. And so, Kamala Harris's campaign thinks that the more that voters hear from Trump and all of who he is, that it could be beneficial to them.",

McMaster describes meetings in the Oval Office as exercises in competitive sycophancy during which Trump's advisers would flatter the president by saying stuff like your instincts are always right or no one has ever been treated so badly by the press.Meanwhile, Trump would say outlandish things like, why don't we just bomb the drugs in Mexico, or why don't we take out the whole North Korean army during one of their parades?

But with those Nikki Haley voters, primary voters with those Republicans who are, who were turned off in 2022 to Donald Trump, his temperament, his character, here, his former administration officials say these things about him. They hear Stephanie Grisham at the Democratic National Convention, say that he referred to his own supporters, as, you know, basement dwellers and things like that I think do have a cumulative effect, Jim.
