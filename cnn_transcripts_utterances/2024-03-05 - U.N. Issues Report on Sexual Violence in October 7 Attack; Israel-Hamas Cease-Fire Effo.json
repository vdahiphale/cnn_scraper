Hello. I'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington and you're in the CNN NEWSROOM. Happening now across the country:  Americans are heading to the polls and making their voices heard. At this hour, voting is under way in all 16 Super Tuesday states in what effectively could be the beginning of the end of the 2024 presidential primaries. Tonight, barring a major upset, the country will be one step closer to the contentious rematch that many Americans do not necessarily want. For Democrats, President -- excuse me. For many Americans, for Democrats in particular, President Biden's path to the nomination remains virtually unchallenged. But questions remain about whether voters disillusioned by his support for Israel will stay home. And on the Republican side, with more than one-third of the total delegates at stake, tonight could be Nikki Haley's last stand. As Trump inches closer to clinching the nomination, he's on track to win more primaries and caucuses than any nonincumbent Republican candidate in history. CNN has crews coast to coast staying on top of all these races. Let's start with CNN's Dianne Gallagher. She's just outside Charlotte, North Carolina. Update our viewers where you are, Dianne.",

Now, in North Carolina, you have to vote for what you are registered with, but there is a large number of unaffiliated registered voters and they can choose whichever ballot they want when they go into the polling place. And many of those individuals have told us they are choosing the Republican ballot today.

That's a big number.However, that 30 percent, where do you see it? You see 30 percent roughly who say, if Trump is convicted of a crime, that they won't vote for him; 28 percent voted for Nikki Haley, of self-I.D.ed Republicans, voted for Nikki Haley in Michigan, voted for her in South Carolina, and that 30 percent number is also the number of Republicans who do not think the election was stolen. And so that is the persuadable group that Donald Trump is really soft with. They want to move on from Trump. They don't like Trump. That's the part of the party we're really going for, and so I agree he's weaker with that group, and that group includes a lot of suburban women, a lot of college-educated voters.

That really sways an election. So I think one thing that's not, to Paul's point, is being put a spotlight on is Donald Trump's current vulnerabilities. Not only is there a lack of enthusiasm beyond his base, but he's underwater in terms of his fund-raising. He's got -- there's questions about whether or not he can bring in Nikki Haley's voters.

It is certainly there's an emphasis on getting the cease-fire done, which Qatar has been helping with, but Secretary of State Antony Blinken making clear that, even if that doesn't happen, more aid needs to be allowed into Gaza, that Israel has to open up more crossings. Israel so far has refused to do that. That's why we have seen these airdrops taking place over the last few days by the U.S. and Jordan. And that is something that Benny Gantz will have been hearing throughout his meetings, the importance of getting more aid into Gaza.

And she said in her report -- quote -- \"Some forms of sexual violence against Palestinian men and women in detention settings during house raids at checkpoints were reported. Though the mission team did not visit Gaza, the office will continue to monitor the situation.\" So this is something that they included in the report, but something that Pramila Patten said needs to be further investigated. Israeli authorities are already saying that this is part of their internal investigation as well. So, obviously, we will continue to follow this story. But, Wolf, if I could just end on this. Though they did note that there were multiple locations where there was rape, there was gang rape, horrific events that they say there's enough evidence to suggest that they indeed happened, what is really upsetting and tragic in a lot of rape situations, especially in a wartime setting, is that they may never get to the complete conclusion and bottom of just how prevalent this was and how widespread this was. They were hoping that witnesses could come forward. They did speak to witnesses, though they did note that they were not able to speak to any survivors of sexual assault. Sadly, we know that most of them had been killed, but even those that had survived did not feel comfortable enough to come forward. That is not unusual, given the circumstances.
