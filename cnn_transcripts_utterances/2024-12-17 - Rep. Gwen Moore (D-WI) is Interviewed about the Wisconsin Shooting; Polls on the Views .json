But he has also said just in July, quote, \"there is no vaccine that is safe and effective.\"CNN's Harry Enten has been looking into kind of the broader issue that this raises, which is vaccine skepticism.

Look, in the last five years, we're talking a third of Republicans who believe this falsehood that vaccines are more dangerous than the diseases they're designed to protect against. And I think this goes hand in hand with the vaccine skepticism and a lot of folks thinking that childhood vaccinations are not that important, when, of course, they're extremely important.

And she responded by saying, look, it begs the question, is it just that one vaccine or kind of where is it coming from more broadly?

And he's been very clear that he supports polio and he gave - made a statement yesterday. He talked about friends who survived. Experience - experience that he talked about how he would want to focus on a litany of things from the types of pesticides we use in agriculture, citing Scandinavian countries, which I, once upon a time, remember many of my Democratic friends lauding for their great health care system.

So that's not my concern.I think John Kirby's explanation seems reasonable. The problem is, it took us two weeks to get there. And the bottom line is, we should know everything that's flying up there at any time. We should be able to identify it, classify it, call the owner of the UAV (ph) or whatever the case may be. But more importantly, I think, John, when you step back, the proliferation of drones flying in civilian airspace is only going to get bigger and broader and denser. And we need the FAA and the FCC, to a certain extent, to kind of speed up the process by which we write these rules for the future or else people are going to get more upset because, you know, it's one thing to have a small drone flying around your neighborhood, but to have an SUV-sized drone that could possibly fall on your house, that's a concern. [08:55:15] BERMAN: This was something - again, the technology was five years earlier, four or five years earlier when you were secretary of defense, but this was something that was becoming an issue when you were there.",

And we pressed within the Pentagon to get that authority. It comes from both the FAA for sure, and the FCC, if you want to use some type of directed energy weapon to knock it down in a non-kinetic means.So, look, we need to accelerate the regulatory adoption of certain rules, authorities, this has been talked about by members of Congress, to kind of make sure we bring the FAA and FCC up to where drones and drone use is not just today, but where it's going in the future.",

So, when we talk about teens in particular, we start to get a sense of just the impact.But now we also have images and studies that actually look at what's happening to the brain in people who are on - consuming this low- quality content for excessive amounts of time. It tends to thin certain areas of the brain, called the cortex, that is responsible for your memory and your perception. And it also - there's - so that's gray matter. There's white matter that's sort of in between all the gray matter in your brain, and it seems to slow that down as well. That can lead to people feeling like they're not thinking as quickly or the brain fog type symptoms. So, it's a real thing. And it's concerning for a lot of people. Brain rot is the word of the year for a reason. By the way, it's not brand new. It goes back to the 1800s. Henry David Thoreau actually first used the term \"brain rot\" when talking about the fact that we are devaluing complicated ideas. Same concept, just much wider scale now.",
