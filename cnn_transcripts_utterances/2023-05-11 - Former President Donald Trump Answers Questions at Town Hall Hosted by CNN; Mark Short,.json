He defends the insurrectionists.Let's set that aside for a second. As a matter of pure politics, he did exactly what he wanted to do last night. He rallied his base. And his base is all he cares about. He is trying to be the nominee of the party. He probably advanced that project last night. Now, for Biden, that's OK, because he wants Trump as an opponent. He thinks Trump is eminently beatable. And Trump said many things last night that reminded us why he is eminently beatable in a general election. The one thing I would be concerned about in making this draw if I were Biden, and I do think this is his draw, is that the thing that Trump was last night was very energetic.

      "sentences": "Well, thanks for having me, Phil. I guess, it's not really a matter as to what the president thought whether he was in danger. I was by the vice president's side when the United States Secret Service three times asked him to evacuate the capitol. And as you know, the vice president refused to leave because he said that that's not the image he wanted the world to see, the hallmark of democracy, where a vice president would have to flee that setting.So what the president thinks is probably not consistent with what the United States Secret Service thought, which was by the vice president's side at that time. And after conversations I had with Secret Service, they commented that, look, we were just inches away from actually having to open fire on that crowd, which would have led to a massacre in the Capitol. And so whether or not -- the vice president certainly was protected, but there could have been a lot of more carnage that day, and I think we were very close to that. Regarding what the president and vice president's dispute of the vice president's role on day, I think it's important to remember that really the president and his team's request was the vice president simply reject the electors. When it became crystal clear that he was not doing that, I think in the aftermath of January 6th his advisers told him, look, just say you wanted him to return it to the states. And of course, there is no authority in the Constitution to do that. There is no vice president 250 years who has exercised a mythical authority such as that, even though we have had contested elections in our history before. And I think for anyone who advocates that theory, they are not really accepting a negotiation that Kamala Harris could unilaterally reject electoral votes from Texas or Alabama in 2024. And so I think we know on the face the absurdity, there is nothing in the Constitution that suggest that a vice president can do that. And I think in fact we fought a revolutionary war to assure that no one person can determine the outcome of an electoral process. And so I think there is a lot of absurdity on the face of it, and I think there is also a lot of revision because really the request was to simply reject states electoral votes so you would get under the 270 threshold and force a vote in the House of Representatives. So a lot there to sort of answer your question, Phil.",

A close friend of the president, Democratic Senator from Delaware, Chris Coons, who's also the National Co-Chair for President Biden's 2020 for reelection campaign. Good morning, Senator, thank you for joining us. SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): Good morning, Poppy, great to be on with you. The clips I just saw about President Trump, former President Trump shows that his eyes are firmly trained on 2020. He spent a huge amount of time last night, relitigating the 2020 election and insisting that he would pardon many of the folks who stormed the Capitol on January 6 and assaulted police officers.",
