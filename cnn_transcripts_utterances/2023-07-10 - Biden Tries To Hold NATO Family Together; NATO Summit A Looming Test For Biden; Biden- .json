The president of the United States is abroad for a big NATO summit, but an urgent conversation on if and how quickly to bring Ukraine inside the alliance threatens to fracture unity across Europe.Plus, trouble since he walked in. Ron DeSantis falls back on blaming a familiar culprit to explain why his campaign stumbled off the blocks the media, and it might be the ugliest headline of the Biden presidency. A New York Times column ignites a conversation about the Biden family and the cruelty of counting to six versus seven. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. Up first, geopolitics. The president tries to hold the NATO family together. Joe Biden is wheels up right now to Lithuania. He will land to a new uncertainty about Ukraine's future and if it's with NATO. And he will confront rare public fractures among allies over a Biden decision to send cluster munitions to Ukraine's front lines. But this morning, the president took pains to project that everything is a, OK, in the stop to number 10 Downing Street with the British prime minister. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, 46TH U.S. PRESIDENT: Couldn't be meeting with a closer friend and a greater ally. We've got lots to talk about our relationship is rock-solid. (Inaudible) and I look forward to our discussion. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, this is a very high stakes meeting. Obviously, Dana, this is a meeting where essentially Ukraine's fate and NATO could be decided. And there are multiple different opinions on this. There is no unanimity in NATO right now as to what Ukraine's membership should actually look like, how fast it should happen. And of course, whether the war with Russia needs to end before Ukraine can actually be admitted into NATO.Now, the president who is coming here this evening. He has said just this weekend, that he does not believe that Ukraine right now should actually be in NATO. It is not the right time, especially because if it wasn't NATO, then of course, NATO is committed to defending every inch of its territory, would essentially mean American boots on the ground inside Ukraine, if they were to join NATO right now. But that's not necessarily what President Zelenskyy is even looking for. He is more looking for a clear signal that once peace is achieved, then the United States will back its membership in NATO. They want something to show Vladimir Putin, essentially that NATO stands behind Ukraine. And that even if they don't join, right at this moment, there is a path for them to do so. Of course, the timing of this is also going to be very key. Will Ukraine be able to have an expedited membership into NATO? Or will have to go through the more traditional path, which could lengthen the process out by months, if not years? All of these things are going to be discussed here tomorrow. It is a really key moment that the Ukrainians are really looking forward to. Dana?",

Happy Monday to both of you. Let's start by playing with Joe Biden, the President of the United States said to our colleague Fareed Zakaria on Sunday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRES. BIDEN: I don't think there is unanimity in NATO about whether or not to bring Ukraine into the NATO family now, at this moment in the middle of a war. If the war is going on, then we're all in war. You know, we're at war with Russia, if that were the case. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And he, in that interview, talked about Ukraine also needing to take steps on other benchmarks that they would have to meet to join NATO, like democratization and, you know, corruption and government those things.So, I think, front and center is the issue that the United States doesn't want to be in a war with Russia right now, and neither do these other NATO countries. But the key here is that there's division within the NATO alliance, about how to thread this needle, and how to give Ukraine the assurances that it needs and really, you know, make more commitments that will bring it closer to joining NATO than it was before this war. And that's why we have heard so aggressively from Ukraine saying, we really need a clear pathway here. The president did say that there's a need to lay out a rational path for Ukraine, you know, coming into NATO. And so, we're waiting to see is can the United States and all the NATO allies come up with some language that makes everyone happy here? Or are there fractures in the alliance that are demonstrated at this summit?",

We'll see exactly the amount of money that is needed here, because you're seeing this divisions play out on the issue of the munitions transfer.

And I know that I've talked to a number of DeSantis advisors, who say that part of the problem they believe with these polling numbers that have been continually going down is that he doesn't have the name recognition.

I think in fairness, not much more than the media.And also, you can look at what he has done in his campaign or not done. But you kind of alluded to this. The Wall Street Journal has some reporting from over the weekend, saying DeSantis has largely avoided talking to the mainstream media. But his campaign, in a sign of strategy shift is planning to do interviews around a series of policy proposals he will lay out in the coming weeks. That's according to people familiar with the plans. The campaign is also counting on DeSantis's biography, becoming better known through advertising and his own telling, that's the kind of thing that Tim Scott is doing out there, and others who have name ID that is sort of lower among Republican electorate voters, primary voters, caucus voters. And it's not something that DeSantis has done. He has an interesting biography. We don't know a whole lot about it, because all we hear about is Disney and woke and everything that he is saying, not that the media is saying that he is saying, but the media is reporting that he is saying.",

And it's -- well the national polls, there might be a name recognition situation. He has been dropping in New Hampshire. People in New Hampshire know who he is.

But they also don't want to hear you rag on Donald Trump, which is why an ad like that is really so effective, because they're not ragging on him.

They have been split over tactics, over policy, over membership rules, and even over whether to support former President Donald Trump.And in fact, the group has been so divided lately that we have learned there's been a side group that has been holding sort of secret side meetings to discuss strategy because they don't trust other members of the Freedom Caucus. And those tensions really came to a head when they voted to remove Marjorie Taylor Greene just before the July 4 recess, in part because she is so loyal to Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Now, we should point out that not everyone in the group actually supported her ouster. And just another example of how prominently the group has flipped. Jim Jordan, a member of the Freedom Caucus, a co- founder who has also become close to Kevin McCarthy, did support keeping her in the group, even though many other members voted to remove her. This according to sources to both me and my colleague, Annie Grayer. But this group has been struggling with their identity for a while now, particularly in the post Trump years. We also learned in the course of this reporting that Ken Buck and Chip Roy to Freedom Caucus members who opposed Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election, actually seriously contemplated quitting the group in the wake of the attack on the Capitol, the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Now they ultimately decided to stay but notably, and interestingly, they have been among that pack of Freedom Caucus members who have been splitting and deviating from the norm to sort of do their own thing. So, just a lot of concern right now about this group's future, especially, Dana, as you know, because they derive their power from unity and strength in numbers.",

The recent cracks that have emerged within the caucus, a band of roughly 40 rabble rousers who derive much of their power, as she just said, from being unified against Republican leadership are emblematic of a broader identity crisis that the eight-year-old group has been wrestling with, initially formed to help pull the GOP legislative agenda to the right.The ultra conservative caucus quickly became a fan club for Donald Trump, more defined by personalities than a devotion to policy as somebody who watched the birth of the Freedom Caucus and watched it mean the end of John Boehner and eventually Paul Ryan, their speaker chips, you are still running around the Capitol every single day.
