And you know it's interesting, Douglas, because yesterday we saw Xi and Putin together there in Russia.But then we also saw the Japanese prime minister on the ground, making that surprise visit to Ukraine. Of course, the key Western ally, key U.S. ally, Japan. And this really underscores, it would seem, just how pivotal this war in Ukraine is and what a role it is playing in this push and pull that we're seeing but between these two worldviews.",

Something like that's happening now. And Japan, thank goodness, is declaring their continued alliance with the United States. They're upping up, they're upping their military spending to historic heights. They're standing in solidarity with democracy in the Ukraine. And so it is reassuring to have an ally like Japan. And you know, but, nevertheless, China is the big player now in international affairs. And you wonder if this is going to start leading - if American suspicion of China is going to create in the political sphere here in 2024, more than \"Made in America,\" you know, kind of economic program for both Biden and whoever the Republican might be. Because we can't build cars in America if we can't get - if all of our products that are being made in China. They can, in many ways, hold our economy hostage in addition to great cyberwar, cyber mischief problems to come. So we're at a nadir in our U.S./Chinese relations right now. I haven't seen this happen since, you know, the pre-Nixon years where the tension seems to be this tight. BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN HOST: Yes, and part of what you just described about American manufacturing, so many of our chips come from Taiwan. And that's why it's such an important geopolitical ally Douglas Brinkley, thank you so much.",

      "sentences": "So look, this is the first real update that we have received from state investigators since they announced that they were opening that investigation into the killing of Stephen Smith back in June of 2021.If you remember, they said the reason they were opening that investigation was because of information gathered during the course of a different investigation into the murders of Paul and Maggie Murdaugh. Now look, there's never been any official connection made between the Murdaugh family and Stephen Smith's death. SLED has never explained what information they gleaned. But in this conversation with an attorney for Stephen Smith's mother yesterday, they said that they, too, believed that he had not been hit by a car and was not the victim of a hit and run. This mirrors what highway patrol said at the time. Now look, there are a lot of questions about the Murdaugh connection here. Again, no suspects. No one's ever been arrested. No one's ever been named as a suspect in Stephen Smith's death. But the name of Buster Murdaugh has been thrown around in rumors, documentaries, social media, podcasts, things like that. The Murdaugh name was brought up by witnesses in highway patrol investigations back in 2015 but, again, no connection. Buster Murdaugh, releasing a statement this week, calling these vicious rumors, saying he's just been trying to grieve the death of his mother and his brother. His father, of course, was convicted to life in prison without parole for those murders earlier this month. Buster Murdaugh, saying, \"This has gone on far too long. These baseless rumors of my involvement with Stephen and his death are false. I unequivocally deny any involvement in his death. And my heart goes out to the Smith family.\" Look, as far as the Smith family is concerned, his mother has said that all she cares about now is getting justice for her son. State law enforcement officials are asking anybody who may know anything about the death of Stephen Smith to contact them in South Carolina.",

And he is, of course, not only - we were just talking about, kind of created this media spectacle around what's going on.But he's under investigation in multiple cases. Republicans want to be talking about agenda items. When I'm in the halls of Congress, they didn't want to be talking about Donald Trump. But what does this mean for the 2024 presidential race? But even the House and Senate races, as we look ahead to all of that? JOE WALSH, (R), FORMER U.S. CONGRESSMAN FOR ILLINOIS &amp; HOST, \"WHITE FLAG\" PODCAST: It's a great question. What it means is Donald Trump is the front runner, and, in all likelihood, he'll be the Republican Party nominee. And in all likelihood, the Republicans will lose that House and, continue out of power in the United States Senate. Look for Republicans who were living in Donald Trump's world, I know for the rest of us, this is crazy, right? Trump could be indicted two, three, four times this year. And you know what? In a weird way, that will - it's not a weird way. That will help him in the Republican Party because Republican Party voters look at him as a victim. The deep state is after him. And if you're Nikki Haley or Mike Pence or Ron DeSantis, you can't disagree with that, because that's not what Republican voters want to hear. So Trump's actually strengthened with all of this potential criminal activity.",

He parrots all the actions. He parrots all of these initiatives. So he's Trump's Mini Me, right?And so I think when it comes down to the voters, I think they're going to turn around at some point and be like, well, actually, he's Trump and we're already behind Trump, so why not stick with him? And again, like I don't see any differentiating between the two of them. I don't see any actual substantive policy initiatives behind DeSantis. But, unfortunately, if you look at the polling, it's Trump and DeSantis certainly at the top. None of these other people that I think would be more traditional, responsible conservatives that are behind in the polling. But look, this is still Trump's party and all of these people are helping him, including my former boss, Mike Pence, who was out there pushing this is a political hit job, talking points with the potential Trump indictment. I mean, that's absolutely shameful. I don't know what kind of path he's on for political suicide there, but why not just speak about this honestly and stop undermining our judicial system? DEAN: And I hear what - Olivia, what you're saying in terms of DeSantis kind of parroting the same policy initiatives and whatnot. But, Joe, he seems to be trying to, based on the comments he had a couple of days ago, kind of thread the needle where he has the Trump policies. But he's going to try to make the case that he doesn't have the Trump baggage. Do you think he can sell that to primary voters?",
