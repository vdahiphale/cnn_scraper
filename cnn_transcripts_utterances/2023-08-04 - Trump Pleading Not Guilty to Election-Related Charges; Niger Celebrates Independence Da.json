His next hearing is set for August 28th when the judge is expected to set a trial date.

LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Former President Trump in federal court Thursday pleading not guilty to those four felony counts that he is facing. And going forward, it appears this could be a rocket docket. The judge who will oversee this case through a possible trial, giving the government just seven days to tell her when they're going to be ready to take this case before a jury and how long that jury trial could take. Now, defense attorneys are supposed to give her the same information just a week later, so that she can possibly set a trial date at a next hearing, which is in August 28th. That is a pretty quick turnaround for these kinds of decisions, suggesting that the judge would like to move this along quickly. Now it is unclear at this point if this case really will go to trial before the 2024 election. One of the big outstanding questions that could really impact a possible schedule is if the special counsel intends to add additional charges or additional co-defendants. We know from our reporting, they will continue to interview witnesses over the next several weeks, suggesting that there could be additional charges which could impact that timeline.

And many of those drone attacks, largely Iranian-made Shahed attack drones, have been repelled by Ukraine's air defense systems, but of course some have impacted infrastructure, have met their targets. Particularly, in the port city of Odessa where those drone attacks have caused damage to port infrastructure and crucially grain storage facilities as well.

They are not focused on the timing of this counter-offensive but rather their main priority is focusing on protecting Ukrainian lives and particularly protecting those of the Ukrainian soldiers on the front lines. And one of the key obstacles that Ukrainian soldiers are now facing across the Ukraine's eastern front lines is the amount of territory across those eastern regions that have been mined by Russia. We've heard from one Ukrainian official saying that between two, there are between two and five mines on average per square meter in some areas of the front lines, which is making it increasingly difficult for Ukrainian troops to operate on the ground. But at this stage it appears as though that fighting is really concentrated in two key regions, in the Zaporizhzhia region, but we continue to see that devastating artillery fire across that region impacting civilian life day in, day out.",

It's possible that those individuals are working with the special counsel and they may enter into some kind of plea agreement, may give testimony favorable to the prosecution as it relates to this case. We know they all were intimately involved in this scheme to prevent the lawful transfer of power. So. My guess is, my suspicion is, that the prosecution wanted a very streamlined case. You have one defendant. It's much easier in terms of scheduling. If this case involved all of those co-conspirators, there would be seven defendants, all of them requesting continuances, different trial dates.

He said that Donald Trump tried to pressure him to overturn the election. He says that he knew from the beginning that what Donald Trump was asking him to do was illegal, that he didn't have the power to reject the electors that were being sent by the various states or to do anything to prevent the counting of votes or to prevent Joe Biden from becoming the next president of the United States.

And likewise, if there is a conviction, unlikely that someone like Donald Trump would escape all jail time. Now, we know he's running for president essentially to win so that he can pardon himself. So this whole presidency run is not about serving the American people, but it's about serving his own needs and trying to escape accountability for the actions that he's engaged in. But he wouldn't have any power over these two, the one state case that's pending and the potential other state case. So even if he is elected and tries to pardon himself, although there's no legal precedent for that, Donald Trump still faces significant legal jeopardy.

There are a total of four criminal cases that the former president has been investigated in, three of them where he's been formally charged and pleaded not guilty.The January 6th case that he was just arraigned in on Thursday, where he's charged with four counts including obstructing federal proceedings and conspiracy to defraud the government. Then there's the Mar-a-Lago documents case, where he faces 40 counts related to the allegedly illegal retention of documents at his Florida estate. There is the New York hush money case brought by the Manhattan D.A. where he faces 34 counts of falsifying business records related to hush money payments to Stormy Daniels and to Karen McDougal. Those are the cases where Donald Trump has already been indicted. Then there's the Georgia case where an indictment could come soon. That case focuses on Trump's alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in that state of Georgia. Now let's look at what happens next on the calendar. In just about a week, August 10th, he'll be arraigned on three additional charges brought in the Mar-a-Lago case, although he's not expected to attend that hearing. Also, likely in August, could be a decision on an indictment in the Georgia case. Now, as far as when the actual trials in these cases will begin and how they square with the election calendar for next year, well, two of the cases he's been indicted in are scheduled to start in the middle of the primary season. Super Tuesday is on March 5th, 2024; and there are several other primaries during that month of March. And the first case to begin, the first criminal case to begin, the Manhattan D.A.'s Hush Money Trial is scheduled to start about three weeks after Super Tuesday on March 25th. In the Mar-a-Lago documents case, a pre-trial hearing is scheduled for May 14th. The trial itself could begin as early as May 20th. On the election calendar, there are several primaries in the month of May and the Republican Party's nomination deadline is 11 days after the Mar-a- Lago trial is slated to begin. That deadline for the nomination is on May 31st. But that Mar-a-Lago trial, we need to point out, could easily slide until later in the year. As for the case he has just been indicted in, the January 6th case, the start date could be set during the next hearing in that case, which is on August 28th. Brian Todd, CNN, Washington.

That's the uniqueness of America. But you know what? You shouldn't be prosecuted for your thoughts. And the difference here is, when Hillary Clinton said it, nothing happened to her.

He allegedly entered into a handler asset relationship with a Chinese intelligence officer a few months earlier.Wei allegedly sent photos and videos of the USS Essex and other U.S. Navy ships to his Chinese officer as well as dozens of technical and mechanical manuals relating to the ship's layout and weapon system. This apparently went on for more than a year. Now much of the information was stored on restricted access Navy computer systems that Wei was able to access because he had security clearance. As for Zhao, the other sailor, well he was responsible for installing, repairing and servicing electrical equipment on U.S. military installations. He also had security clearance. He allegedly provided sensitive military information to the Chinese for almost two years, including operational plans for major military exercise in the Indo-Pacific, plus photos of blueprints and diagrams of a U.S. radar system stationed on a military base in Okinawa, Japan. Now this week's arrests, Lynda, come amid growing concerns by the U.S. military about China's ongoing and brazen campaign to target U.S. officials with access to sensitive military secrets.
