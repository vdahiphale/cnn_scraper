It is day two of jury selection in Donald Trump's historic hush money trial and it's in full swing. The judge just admonishing Trump and his defense team after saying Trump was \"audibly uttering and gesturing at a potential juror during questioning.\" The former president is facing 34 felony counts for an alleged hush money scheme to conceal potential damaging information from voters back in 2016. He's also facing dozens of potential jurors. Right now, the focus is on a subset of 18. And as expected, some social media posts by those prospective jurors are now in play. Let's check back in with CNN Anchor and Chief Legal Analyst, Laura Coates, who's been outside that courthouse all day long. Laura, it seems like they came back from lunch and things have gotten heated.",

Now, for anyone who thought that social media posts were not going to be a part of this selection process, well, then you are sadly mistaken. They have been now a pivotal role at this point in time. It's almost like a tale of two or three different social media posts because, one by one, jurors have now been called to task about posts that they have made either recently or in the distant past.And I'll turn to Kara Scannell here on this because the first one we heard about was a juror who was a woman who apparently posted something on Facebook of a celebration in the year 2020. We don't know whether it was around the election time or what. She was questioned about whether it was biased. She said, no, it's just a celebration. She was filming from afar in New York. She was not released. But the second juror, different story.",

They must know their name, their social media handles as well to be able to look through all these things. They are going to that level of granular detail to figure out, do they have a stealth juror among them.",

Normally the judge is usually asking, well, in spite of this, can you put your feelings aside and follow the law and the instructions? The judge did not seem to have it for that one because the phrase lock him up, which is an ironic thing to say because Trump campaigned primarily on lock her up that time, meaning, of course, Hillary Clinton.Going forward and thinking about this, this is really a quickly moving process now where the judge is trying to make sure that this is a very tight line that's walked. But I'm most intrigued by what Donald Trump's reaction has been to all of this, because earlier this morning, of course, Jessica, he saw a potential juror who was excused because he thought he could not be impartial and was leaning in favor of Donald Trump. Now he has one juror excused because of a lock him up posting that he doesn't recall. And two others as bookends here that had posting that he wanted to have that person struck, but were not. You wonder how he's feeling in this courtroom, like an average defendant waiting to figure out who will choose and decide his fate.",

So you saw that Donald Trump touched that third rail by making gestures and utterances within 12 feet of the jury and the judge gave a stern warning. And that you'll see that over and over again. Trump can make comments about the judge, about the court, about the DA, but you do anything involving the jurors, you're going to see a very swift reaction.",

      "sentences": "Well, look, it's no secret that Manhattan skews highly Democrat and Trump has been making many motions to recuse the judge and change the venue, because saying he can't get a fair trial because of the Manhattan jurors. And when you look at what happened during jury selection, they called a hundred people in, roughly, and about half of them said, I can't be fair and impartial.And the rest are really, I think, surprisingly honest and saying, I don't really have these strong opinions that make it so I can't be fair. So much so that these challenges that are happening, that there are two types of challenges. There are the ones that are for cause, meaning that through questioning, they will be excused, and those are unlimited, okay? So that's why people - that's where you're going to see the lawyers fighting to get someone challenged for cause. Meaning, they've expressed some bias that makes them not be able to be fair in this case. And the lawyers on both sides want for cause challenges because you don't want to waste your peremptories, which are your, no - for no - no matter what, for whatever reason, you want challenges. And you only get 10 of those each. And the prosecutor here did something very interesting. In the first 12 jurors, they didn't have any for cause challenges. So for them, that kept the 12 jurors in the box, and they didn't have any perempts. So they were saying, you know what, I'm good with these 12 jurors. That's a chess move on their part because it forces. It forces the defense. They only have 10 challenges. If they don't like those jurors and they don't get any for cause challenges, you could have two jurors right there, so, right, that they could use all 10. And then they're stuck with those two and then whoever else comes in who could - you could like even less. So there's this whole gamesmanship as, I don't like this guy, but I don't know who's coming down the pike, so I don't want to use them all up because I want to be able to save them for the future panel. We're going to have a jury this week, I think. It's going much faster than I thought.",

Now, it's worth noting that while the president was out campaigning today, former President Trump is in a courtroom in New York City as he faces criminal trial, really setting up a split screen that could continue in the weeks to come. But President Biden today really tried to zero in on the differences that the two men have when it comes to tax policies. The president tried to argue that the former president is on the side of the wealthy and billionaires while President Biden is trying to lower taxes for the middle class. Now, this all comes as the President has also been trying to move the needle with voters who have pessimistic views about Biden's handling of the economy. Some things that he was trying to lay out today were how he would raise taxes on the wealthy and corporations and pointing to the fact that Trump has pledged to donors to extend the 2017 tax cuts, which did offer tax cuts to all Americans, but benefited the wealthy much more. Now, Biden really tried to frame this, as you mentioned. Back in 2020, he had this argument that this was a - that was a choice between Scranton and Park Avenue values. Today, he laid it out in different terms, saying that it's Scranton values versus a Mar-a-Lago approach, referring to the former president's residence down in Florida. And the president really tried to argue that he sees the economy from the middle class, from Scranton values, while the former president adopts those of Mar-a-Lago. Now, Pennsylvania, as you noted, will be critical in the upcoming election. President Biden won here back in 2020, including here in Lackawanna County, where Scranton is based. There are some counties in the surrounding area where Trump won, but the president is hoping to keep this very close race, as we've seen in the polls, as the current state is.",

If you look at the U.S. economy today, relative to, let's say, 2019, or most other periods of time over the last few decades, it looks as good or better on everything except for inflation.So if you look at, for example, unemployment being very low, GDP growth being strong, it also looks quite strong relative to pre- pandemic forecasts, that's what the IMF economist you just cited was referring to. The fact that if you go back and looked at what the International Monetary Fund expected the size of the U.S. economy to look like today, back when they made their last pre-COVID forecast, and I think it was January 2020, we're besting even that. And all of these things are related, right? We've run a very hot economy. That characteristic explains the low unemployment, the strong job growth, the strong GDP growth and high price growth. Those are all about demand being really, really strong. Now, the trick is to get sort of the good things out of that strong demand and not so much the bad things, which means maybe we don't want the economy to be quite as hot as it is. We want there to be strong job growth but not quite as fast price growth, and hopefully we're getting there.",

Today, the State Department said the U.S. hasn't received any details about Israel's plans, but a source tells CNN the U.S. believes the response will be limited in scope. Iran's president is warning that even the smallest Israeli action would be met with a severe and painful response.Let's discuss with retired Army Lieutenant General Mark Schwartz. He's the former U.S. security coordinator for Israel and the Palestinian Authority. General, great to have your perspective. Thanks for being with us. Israel's war cabinet is obviously mulling a response to this unprecedented attack by Iran over the weekend. As we noted a moment ago, U.S. intelligence believes that the response would be limited in scope and inside Iranian territory. I'm wondering what you think that might look like. LT. GEN. MARK SCHWARTZ (RET.), FORMER U.S. SECURITY COORDINATOR FOR ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY: Hey, Boris. Great to be with you this afternoon. Well, I think there's a number of options available, as has been discussed really since the attacks that took place on Saturday evening, anywhere from a significant lethal response and the deployment of Israeli attack aircraft all the way to cyber operations or some type of further down the line covert operation. But I would - what I would assess that Gen. Gantz and the Minister of Defense Gallant are discussing with the Prime Minister is what was fired or launched at Israel over the course of Saturday evening and what poses in their view the most significant threat as a result of what they saw play out that evening. And so going after ballistic missile test sites or ballistic missile storage sites and the same with the cruise missiles which have a far greater capability than the unmanned vehicles that were launched and many of those failed. I think that would be probably very high on the list of what the security cabinet is looking at.",
