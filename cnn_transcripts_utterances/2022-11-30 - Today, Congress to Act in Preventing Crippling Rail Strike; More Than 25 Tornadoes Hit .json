He said that some probably are not. But he said there will be enough Republicans who will ultimately support that, so he called it, quote, a fudge factor that will eventually lead for this bill to be approved by the House later today.So, the Democratic leadership set up two votes for today in order to placate concerns on the left that this rail deal, to avert the strike, was silent on the issue of paid leave for rail workers. So, they have two votes, one, to allow for workers to get certain number of days for paid leave, and another to pass the tentative agreement that was silent on this issue to avert the rail strike. Now, the Senate is a different question. The Senate can ignore this issue about paid leave altogether, and just pass the bill, the underlying bill to implement that agreement, which seems the most likely path that will ultimately go into law. But the Senate is the big question going forward. Because after this passes the House today, then there will need to be an agreement among all 100 senators to set a vote on the rail deal. And there is not an agreement yet, because some Democrats, some members of the Democratic caucus, including Independent Bernie Sanders, want a vote to implement that paid sick leave. And some other Republicans have made some demands as well, have raised concerns as well, they may have suggestions for amendments. So, that process still needs to work out as Democratic leaders are hoping this could pass by the end of the week. Still uncertain whether they can get there, as they move through a long list of legislative priorities in this lame-duck session, guys.",

Good morning to you both. Toluse, if I could start with you on this vote that's taking place today, these two votes at the House that's taking up, obviously, all eyes are going to be on what the Senate does in terms of averting a rail strike. What is the likelihood that the Senate will not only pass the one vote, the legislation that was agreed to in the preliminary deal back in September to avoid it, but also the second vote that the House is taking up, and that is paid leave?",

A few of the Democratic sources that I've been texting with on the Hill are hopeful that, given the signals that they have seen from some Republicans, like Senator Marco Rubio, that maybe there could be something, a deal that could be struck here, that adding seven additional days sounds reasonable, which is that the separate bill that the House is going to vote on and send over to the Senate.Now, Nancy Pelosi is doing it separately, because, technically, if they do run out of time because, again, December 9th is the deadline, if they run out of the time, that bill that just covers the rail deal could be sent on to the president's desk and signed. So, like Toluse said, they could do these at separate times. But I think that you are going to see a push -- a bipartisan push from a number of Republican senators and as well as Democratic senators to really try to fit this paid sick leave in there, if they can.",

Some of those, the members could be part of the building block of the coalition that Biden will need to pass things, like an omnibus bill that would allow us to avert a government shutdown as well as fund the government far into the future and not allow this same fight that we're potentially having right now over spending to be happening again early next year with Republicans in charge.

And a number of Republicans have even forecasted that they think that it could go multiple ballots on the floor come January for McCarthy to even get there.So, we've seen how he's been playing this dance of trying to really appease the conservatives, the Freedom Caucus, I should say, and members like Marjorie Taylor Greene of his caucus, because he ultimately needs all of those, as many of those votes as possible as he can get. On the Democratic side, Jim, yes, it is a major shift, a generational shift, when you go down the line, and Hakeem Jeffries has long been seen as the likely heir apparent to Nancy Pelosi. And so it's pretty, frankly, stunning given that in recent cycles, there was a lot of angst among the Democratic caucus about how long Pelosi was staying on, and yet they seem to be having a very seamless transition right now.",

They needed help. They were able to get there to rescue them out of their homes.And when you look at damages like this, you can understand what is that 911 call like when a tree comes through your trailer slices it in half, like the one that we're seeing right here? The resiliency, though, is in action, because you can people who are actively at work, trying to get their houses back together. There's a backhoe on the backside, and this gentleman right here is pulling out jars from the inside this trailer to try to cu -- as he's cutting down this tree at the same time. So, we've seen some of that action. There has been a massive amount of power outages in this area. You talked about that power line that you can see down here on the ground right here. But as we are talking, you can see the crews that are in the distance that are actively working to get some of these power lines and get the restoration of power to this area. We do know that there was probably at least three to four rescues in this area, everyone is okay, but we also got that sad news about those people in Alabama who lost their lives. When you walk back this direction, though, and you see how the storm path cut through here, you can understand the power of this wind. You see these people giving a slight hug as they had a conversation. That woman didn't have a jacket earlier and she was learning about her house and what was going on next. So, we've been trying to give some people time to kind of work some of these portions out. They've walked over to us said everyone has been helpful so far. You see the side of this truck right here. Look at that. That truck actually still works, but you can see how damaged it is. And as we turn to the side here, this is what a lot of people heard that last night, that siren that was going off, but then all of a sudden, the tornado took that as well. It's going to take some time to put all this back together.

There are top Pence advisers, there are top people from the White House Counsel's Office. Now there's Stephen Miller going into the grand jury, talking to investigators and the grand jury about what happened. And what we know about what Miller witnessed, we already know a little from the House select committee investigation, and that was Miller was working as Trump's chief speechwriter on January 6th. So, as Trump was preparing to deliver this address to the crowds, to his supporters who then went and rioted at the Capitol, tried to block Congress, Miller had a had a 25-minute conversation with the president. And after that conversation into the Trump speech went words of Mike Pence, essentially this idea telling the supporters that there should be pressure on Pence to block the election.

And by that, I mean how these verdicts will impact the ongoing threat of domestic violence extremism. And, hopefully, that very strong message that this is a -- even though it's a hard case to prove and even though it's rarely ever charged, the Justice Department is willing to go there. They have the evidence necessary to bring these charges and they have now shown that they can convince a jury that this sort of activity should be punished to the absolute extent of the law. So, that sends a very strong message to that extremist community that this sort of behavior will not be tolerated.

She couldn't even get a restraining order against him. But she also noted that she didn't think that would impact his support amongst the ultra right-wing. That said, what do you think that means for preventing future attacks like this? MCCABEThat prompted a change -- not the eradication of the Klan but a change in their tactics. That's when they went through a much more diffused kind of small cell structure, less central oversight. So, that's what we could see here, the message may be received by these right-wing extremists that, hey, we can't be so overt in what we're doing, we can do the paramilitary training, all wear the same uniforms and patches, we have to be a little bit more covert about how we're organizing and deploying ourselves.
