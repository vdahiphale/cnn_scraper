We're following breaking news over the skies of Israel, a wide scale aerial assault is going on right now with waves of drones and missiles streaming into Israel from Iran, directly from Iran. Our teams on the ground in Jerusalem and northern Israel, they've been hearing explosions above, as U.S. and Israeli forces have reported intercepting multiple, multiple Iranian attacks.But we still do not know what the ultimate impact of this Iranian barrage will be not the immediate damage inside Israel, nor the response that it might bring, next. I want to go back to Jeremy Diamond, our correspondent, is in northern Israel right now. I take it you've heard the explosions. You've seen the fighter jets. All of a sudden these rockets these missiles are coming in to Northern Israel, from Hezbollah territory in South Lebanon, Hezbollah being an Iranian proxy. What can you tell us to update our viewers, Jeremy?",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right, Wolf. I was in Jerusalem earlier tonight, when this Iranian Response began, I heard multiple interceptions, saw those interceptions happening in the sky as Iran fired more than 200 projectiles, drones and missiles towards Israel. And just as my team and I were arriving here in northern Israel, we heard multiple interceptions overhead.And when we were speaking on air moments ago, I also saw and then subsequently heard a few moments later, more interceptions happening in northern Israel about six miles away from here. We know that this latest a barrage of rockets or drones, we're not quite sure at this point, we'll just call them projectiles for now, were fired from Lebanon, likely by Hezbollah, towards the Golan Heights as well as northern Israel. And so that's significant for a couple of reasons because it raises the question, first of all, of coordination between what is -- one of Iran's biggest proxies in the region Hezbollah and Iran itself, or the possibility that this latest barrage is simply part of this cadence that happens here in northern Israel, as we have watched over the course of the last six months, as Hezbollah and Israel have traded fire back and forth over the Israel-Lebanon border since the beginning of this war. Now, interestingly, before this latest barrage happened, before the sirens sounded in the Golan Heights, the Israeli military actually changed its guidance to civilians, who earlier tonight had been told to stay near shelters if they are living in this part of the country. But then were subsequently told that that guidance was no longer in effect that they could return to life as normal. And it was only very shortly after that, that that first barrage came across the border from Lebanon, towards the Golan Heights. And so this obviously gives you a sense that even as Iran indicates that its military response to the Israeli strike on that consular building in Damascus, they have indicated that that response is over. But still, this cross border exchange that has happened for months between Israel and Hezbollah is likely to continue. Wolf?",

Hezbollah's arsenal of rockets is not only larger, but it is far more sophisticated has a much larger reach bigger payloads than Hamas's rocket Arsenal in Gaza.And so as Israeli leaders have talked about the possibility of war with some Israeli officials in recent months, putting that chance at more than 50 percent in conversations that I've had with them, they are also well aware that it would likely result in significant damage inside of Israel, far more significant than the kind of damage that Hamas has been able to deal to Israel, certainly in terms of infrastructure within Israel.",

I don't think anyone expected to see so many dangerous munitions over such a densely populated area. And it was really the first place in the country outside of the north, right along the border there where Jeremy is, the Israeli citizens were getting to experience the first taste of what Iran's response was going to be, the leading edge of those 200 killer drones, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles.And the interceptions that we saw here, were coming from multiple directions, we can take a look at that again now.

      "sentences": "So, some of those intercepts, obviously, the IDF has been telling us they wanted to intercept a lot of the missiles outside of Israel's territory, they say that they were able to intercept at least 10 cruise missiles, dozens of other those slow moving drones were intercepted outside of Israel's airspace. And one of the logical places between Iran and Israel to the east of here is Jordan and residents of the Capitol there Amman, did report seeing flashes in the sky indicative perhaps of what we were seeing here as well in Jerusalem, that there were intercepts there.And I think this gets to how dangerous potentially what has happened tonight can be for the region, certainly if Israel response and Iran response again, because this is a very fragile mix of emotions in the region at the moment. And for many Jordanians, they really do not like the way that Israel is treating the Palestinians inside of Gaza. So they don't want to see missile intercepts over or above their heads intercepting missiles, that Iran is firing towards Israel, because they don't support Israel. Of course, the leadership in Jordan has a relationship with Israel, an established relationship that has its ups and downs. And they have some common security interests. But that's not necessarily how the majority of the population feel. So if there are repeated waves of what we're witnessed tonight, with not just interceptions in the skies above us here, but interceptions in the skies above neighboring countries like Jordan. This is going to make the dynamic and the pulse and the fragility of security in the region, even weaker. So when you look at how and when President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu speak about how or if Israel should respond to this disproportionate response, the White House says has come from Iran tonight. There are more factors than just Israel and Iran in the dynamic of the equation, as Jeremy was explaining, Hezbollah in the north in Lebanon. But there are countries that are not in the fight, where tensions can rise. And that would lead to a broader instability, Wolf. BLITZER: Yes, that would be Jordan as well. And it was very significant then. And Nic, Jim Sciutto is with me as well, I want to bring him into this conversation. Jim, I know you have a question for Nic as well. But in Jordan, for example, if rockets or missiles are coming in from Iran, towards Israel, and going over Jordan, it's not the Israelis who are intercepting those rockets and missiles over Jordan, it's the U.S. that is doing so from various bases that the U.S. has in the region. JIM SCIUTTO, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: That's right. And I think Wolf, to your point, and I was going to ask Nic about this as well, that you have partners like Jordan, Saudi Arabia, both with an Iranian attack like tonight, but also the Houthi attacks, for instance, in the Red Sea, that, Nic, as you know, they oppose those attacks, and sometimes take part in defending against them without advertising that participation, because they're concerned about being, seen publicly supporting U.S. military action in the region or being perceived to help defend Israel. I wonder, have you seen any reaction so far in the region from countries such as that to Iran attack on Israel?",

[22I want to bring in CNN Global Affairs Analyst Mark Esper, who served as Defense Secretary under former President Trump. He also works with some aerospace and defense technology companies.

      "sentences": "Sure, Wolf, it's good to be with you, first of all. Look, I'm a little surprised by the scale and scope of the Iranian attack. It's clearly disproportionate. I expected to see something much smaller, and maybe something that did not hit Israel proper. And so this is a really significant escalation.And when you step back and look, you know, over the decades, you can see, you know, since the Iranian revolution in 1979, when Iran and Israel broke off relations, this is the first time that I can recall the direct confrontation between these two countries. And a major change, of course, in the proxy wars the last 20 years between the two. So I think we're seeing a major historical point in the Middle East, certainly between these two countries. And I think it's unclear where this goes from now, I suspect I'm fairly confident Israel or will respond, but how each side moves back and forth up the escalation ladder from there, can really open up into a much wider regional war.",

He said that what Israel and maybe the United States should think about doing is at least in the short run, is trying to destroy whatever nuclear capabilities the Iranians might have, because he's concerned, if Iran were to build a bomb, and put it on one of those rockets or missiles. It could be devastating that Israel -- at least Israel should think about going in launching an airstrike and destroying Iran's remaining nuclear capability. What do you say to that?",

      "sentences": "Yes. I'd say first, when I was in office in late 2019, early 2020, when we looked at options, of course, we you always present the President a number of options, and some of them can be quite tactical, and some of them can be very strategic. Now, in this case, clearly the ball is in the hands of the Israelis. I'm sure Prime Minister Netanyahu is now looking, working with his war cabinet trying to figure out what to do next and looking at a similar set of options. I suspect that they will be discussed with the United States. And he has to ask himself, what does he want to do next?Clearly, the Iranian nuclear program would be a strategic target of great value. But it's a very difficult one, it's an interior of a country, it's well defended, a little bit hard to get to. The Israelis may look at something operationally more, more easy and could open up the door to other things. So for example, taking out Iranian air defense systems on the eastern side of the Persian Gulf, which would open up a door so to speak, to attack other targets within a country. Or Israel may say, look, I want to go at some of their defense industrial base, for example, it's fairly well known where they produce their drones and items like that cruise missiles, maybe they want to take out a major factory. So it depends on what you want to accomplish with this next strike, because you don't know whether it will be your last one or whether it will be one of many to come. And so I think those considerations get weighed out. Now, a part of this problem too, though, Wolf, is, you know, Israel has a very capable Air Force. And the challenge will be is will they get over flight rights, for example, to fly across Iraq and Jordan and Saudi Arabia, wherever the case may be to attack Israel, if they want to do through airstrikes as compared to missile strikes? I suspect the Arab countries will say no, because they don't want to get involved in this as well and be complicit in what will look like will clearly be an Israeli counter attack. So there are all these different issues, you have to figure out what do you want to strike? How do you want to go about doing it? What forces can you commit? Will the United States support what type of support for the United States do you need? I think all those things are now being discussed in a lot more detail.",

There may be some other targets where they see that are useful to is -- to Iran as a support proxy forces like Hezbollah and the Houthi.So I think all those different options are on the table. But clearly, they're going to strike back. They're going to strike into the heart of Iran. They may go after a -- the leadership as well, who knows. And so this is where it gets really tricky, because it's hard for me to see Iran not striking back at that point in time, it would be the first time again that I can recall that another nation aside from the Iran-Iraq war that Israel leads to struck into the interior of Iran. And to me, I think the Iranians would be compelled to strike back again. So here you go back and forth up the escalation ladder. So this is where it gets really dangerous.

So it doesn't mean this is over right now. And the U.S. is still very carefully watching what's going on. There is at least an indication that Israel believes the immediate threat has passed as well. And that's because the IDF home front command lifted the request for citizens to remain near bomb shelters. That's a request that's only lifted when the IDF believes the imminent threat has passed. So an indication from the Israeli side and two U.S. officials from the -- from here, effectively saying that from what they're seeing, and they have been monitoring these attacks from the very beginning, it looks like these waves of attacks of drones and missiles have at the moment subsided. That being said, U.S. forces which have helped intercept many of these drones as they were on their way to Israel. They're still looking out for any possible launches coming from Iran. And of course, this doesn't mean that everyone has stopped attacking because after we saw the Iranian attacks subside, we saw Hezbollah and Iranian proxy in Lebanon launching missiles -- launching weapons, I should say rather, at Northern Israel. So not to say in any way the situation has ended or is calm here, but at least from the U.S. perspective, officials who we've spoken with have said they have seen the specifically the direct Iranian attacks subside, at least as of right now, Wolf.",

There were dozens if not more than 100 launched at Israel. So that number could be anywhere in there. That's information we're still looking for. And we don't yet know how they were intercepted. Was it U.S. fighter jets that were likely up throughout the course of these five hours or so? Was it ground based aerial defense systems? Both are very much a possibility. And then of course, as you point out, Wolf, this was a defensive essentially array that was coordinated with Israel. Israel has its own very capable aerial defense systems from long-range, mid-range and short-range, but they relied as well in the U.S. to try to intercept as many of the incoming launches as possible.",

For now we have the retaliation, which the U.S. as, MJ was describing earlier, says is disproportionate, right, but to have this massive attack on Israeli territory itself is a step up.So then the question is, how does Israel respond? You know, the whole thing about escalation ladder is that each step can be bigger than the last one, right? And when you have, for instance, folks like John Bolton, calling now for strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, that's not to say that Israel will choose to do so. But you do have that option. And that's the difficulty and the danger of escalation ladders is that they expand, they can expand by nature as they go on, and sometimes beyond the limits of what either side wants, right, because we were discussing this earlier, that from the early days of this conflict, going back to October 7th, of course, a horrific attack and escalation of its own, there had been some assessments that Iran did not want a direct conflict with Israel, and certainly not a direct conflict with the U.S. But since then, actions have taken on a life of their own. And they're at least setting up the circumstances for exactly that. And that is the danger of this that whatever your intentions are limitations that one side might want to place going in as they consider their range of options, you can easily lose control of that.

Shawn, thanks very much. What's your immediate reaction to this direct attack from Iran against Israel involving more than 200 drones and missiles that according to the Israel Defense Forces?SHAWN TURNER, FORMER DIR. OF COMMUNICATIONS FOR U.S. NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: Yes, Wolf, thanks for having me. You know, like a lot of people have said tonight, I think that when we look at this, we look at what happened prior to this, and the proportionality of this attack. I think a lot of us are a little taken aback. But, you know, Wolf, a lot of folks have been on tonight, and they've been talking about the idea that this is the time to deal with Iran, sort of once and for all. And I think a lot of people are sort of feeling the heat of the moment. I think we can't lose sight of the fact that as we talk about escalation, as Jim was just talking about, as Mark Esper talked about, we've got to remember that, you know, a couple of weeks ago, we were talking about Israel and Hamas, and that war that fight, to the degree that this escalates, is Israel could find itself in a situation where it's really fighting a two, perhaps even a three front war as Hezbollah loves to get into this. So my immediate reaction to this is, yes, this was an unprecedent attack to see Iran attacking Israel from Iranian soil, directly into Israel, unprecedented and when we look at the number of rockets and missiles and drones, but we've got to remember that for Israel, Israel has to respond to this. We have to take a step back and look at the type of targets they might respond to, and what those targets look like, because Israel has a fight that it has to deal with in Gaza and Hamas.",

      "sentences": "Well, we've been waiting for this readout of the President's phone call with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. And let me just read for you a part of the statement that discusses that phone call. It says I've just spoken with Prime Minister Netanyahu to reaffirm America's ironclad commitment to the security of Israel. I told him that Israel demonstrated a remarkable capacity to defend against and defeat even unprecedented attacks, sending a clear message to its foes that they cannot effectively threaten the security of Israel.So, Wolf, we're getting the first sort of clear indication of how the U.S. is discussing with Israel, these Iran attacks against Israel. I'm also learning from a senior administration official, Wolf, that in this phone call with the Prime Minister, the President made clear to his counterpart that the U.S. will not participate in any offensive operations against Iran. So that is really significant drawing a line on what the U.S. is not willing to do, given what we've seen tonight with the U.S. is involvement here in helping to knock down some of these weapons that Iran had launched. And in fact, according to the same senior administration official, Wolf, the U.S. assessment earlier this evening, was that almost all of the drones and missiles, I'm told, including more than 100 ballistic missiles launched by Iran had been knocked out of the sky, and that no cruise missile made impact in Israel, according to this official and that nothing of value was hit. You know, we were talking about earlier in the evening, how the process is still unfolding of getting a full assessment of Iran attacks against Israel. And this is the assessment that we are getting right now that the President, in fact, told the Prime Minister that the assessment is that, you know, he should take this as a win, because the U.S.'s assessment is that, largely speaking, Iran's attacks and attempts to hurt Israel had been largely unsuccessful. So this is a pretty critical piece of reporting. Our first piece of reporting sort of getting a really clear sense of what the U.S.'s assessment is of Iran attacks and also how the President is viewing all of this on how he spoke about this with the Israeli Prime Minister, Wolf.",
