The person of interest, that's what the NYPD is calling these images that they just released a short time ago because they want to identify who this person is, talk to them, see if they have any connection to this gunmen that they are searching for, for over the last 24 hours. So that is why they are being described as a person of interest. And we know from sources telling CNN that a canvas of video collecting video from the Upper West Side of Manhattan led them to this hostel on the Upper West Side. And that is how they uncovered through a search of that hostel these images that you're showing your viewers showing this person with a mask down, giving a facial image, very striking facial image, because in one of those pictures you could see that person is smiling, of who may be the gunman. But, again, that is something that they are still trying to make a connection on. What we have learned from sources, though, is that hostel also -- they learned that that person stayed with two other people. And most of the time that person was there, they had a mask on. They really didn't want to be identified. So these are some of the things that investigators are trying to piece together as they continue to work the timeline, the movements of the gunman before and after the shooting occurred as they work, of course, to find this person. I want to show you another piece of video that we have into our NEWSROOM. And that is of just minutes before this shooting actually occurred. We actually see the gunman walking down the street toward the hotel, looks to be on a cell phone. And this was just minutes prior to actually carrying out that fatal attack. So, again, police at this point collecting evidence, collecting images, releasing some to the public, still trying to I.D. the person that they're looking for and then, of course, find them.",

We are told that they spoke this morning on the phone, that he said he would support Hegseth.And part of this really comes down to the math here. They talk -- these allies that I'm talking to, they say this is a very different situation than what happened with Matt Gaetz, meaning, yes, we have heard a number of senators say that they are concerned, but right now Donald Trump and his team have not heard any hard no's. They believe that these senators are still open and they believe there is a pathway to getting Hegseth confirmed. Obviously, they acknowledge, based on what we have obviously seen in the last several years, that this could change at any point. But right now, Donald Trump believes the math is there to get him through the door, but that Hegseth has a lot of work to do. Now, the other thing that I was told specifically was that this could all change in terms of Donald Trump's support if more allegations come out. Remember that that report in 2017, when that actually surfaced, his team was blindsided by that. There are people within his orbit who felt like Hegseth wasn't transparent about his past, wasn't transparent about things that were out there. So, if that changes, that could also shift the support. Now, I specifically asked the difference between the Matt Gaetz situation and what was going on with Hegseth. They talked about the hard no's, but they also talked about the fact that Donald Trump was really pushing senators. He wanted to know just how seriously these senators were against Matt Gaetz when he was the nominee for attorney general before telling Matt Gaetz he didn't have the votes. He's not doing that this time. He has J.D. Vance out there, who is talking to these various senators, but he himself is kind of sitting back watching all of these meetings.

I think the challenge, and Republican senators are acknowledging this to me today, is that what is one senator's waste, fraud and abuse is another senator's constituency, right? Some of these senators have things and agencies in their states that employ people. And I think that that is going to be one of the really difficult pieces of trying to knit together a constituency to back some of these ideas. Obviously, we're going to see a lot more after this 2:00 meeting today. So we will be staying tuned on what exactly the plan is. Right now, it's a little bit light on details.
