      "sentences": "A lot of it is still unclear. What we're about to see here is a big legal battle between TikTok, potentially, and the Montana government over this law, which TikTok and many other civil society groups say may be unconstitutional. There are really kind of two main issues here.One, being whether this law infringes on the First Amendment rights of Montanans to access lawful information, as well as to you know simply express themselves on an internet platform. The second issue we're talking about is whether or not this law is an unconstitutional bill of attainder or essentially a law that unfairly penalizes without due process, you know, a person or a company. And so, these two arguments, I think, are going to see a lot of play in the weeks and months before this law goes into effect in January. And you know depending on how that legal battle shakes out, it could have a really powerful effect on whether Montanans can access this app. Now, it's not just TikTok that's affected here. This app also -- I'm sorry, this law also targets app store operators and puts them on the hook too for making the app available to Montana. And so, companies like Apple and Google could potentially face penalties under this law if they are accused of violating it. And the penalties are steep. We're talking about $10,000 per violation per day. And that could be you know, potentially millions of dollars that TikTok or Apple or Google could have to pay you know if they're found to be violating this app and indeed, if this law survives the court, John.",

So, what we're learning is that in September of 2022, he was actually observed by his superiors taking detailed notes on classified intelligence and then putting those notes in his pocket prompting a reprimand from his superior telling him essentially not to do that again. Then in October of 2022, he attended a classified briefing in which he asked very detailed and probing questions about classified intelligence prompting yet another warning from a superior that he had been given a cease-and-desist order when it came to getting involved with this kind of classified information and to focus on his duties.And then in January of 2023 of this year, he was observed looking at classified information yet again, in a way that did not comport with his official duties, which was essentially to act as an IT person. So, three separate warnings here. It does not appear that the third warning he was issued any kind of reprimand, Kate.",

One of the people in this group chat apparently told him to continue to leak classified military documents \"for their own amusement.\" And Teixeira in another conversation with a user on that Discord chat platform, he did say that none of this that he was revealing to them was currently public information.And so, all of this was laid out in the filing to show that Teixeira really had a willful disregard for the national security secrets that he had sworn not to disclose as part of an NDA, as part of his position. Now, we should note that the commanders of his unit were actually suspended pending the completion of this investigation, but obviously a lot of questions about why action wasn't taken sooner, Kate.",

We have a bill this bipartisan, Ted Lieu, Ken Buck, and I, to make sure we don't use artificial intelligence for the nuclear launch codes, that we don't make a decision to send an ICBM to another country based on artificial intelligence.
