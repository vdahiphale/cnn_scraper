It gives more political fodder. But in the end, they don't have to show their hand. Trump doesn't get to say, as the defendant in a federal case, jump and then I respond as a prosecutor how high. I can share what I'd like to share and develop my case because not that you want a gotcha Perry Mason moment, but you want to be able to not preview your case to such an extent that, on the one hand, it preserves the defendant's right to a fair trial. But doesn't allow for this year long, which it could be months long ability, to negate and undermine my case. If he has the roadmap and the keys to my castle, he can then come in and find his way.",

Why the former president was so adamant about hanging on to these documents, that remains unclear.

Of course, they were on the stage of a public ballroom. They were in a shower, an office, a bedroom.And, of course, the indictment says that tens of thousands of people came through Mar-a-Lago while all those things were just laying around. The national security risks, of course, to this could be profound. And our Alex Marquardt has a breakdown on just how close people might have been able to get to these documents. There was that crucial line in there, Alex, about tens of thousands of people would have come through Mar-a-Lago over the timeframe we are talking about here. ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Members, staff, guests, tens of thousands of them, according to that indictment, between the time that former President Trump took up residence there after losing the election in January of 2021 and then the FBI search in August of 2022. These documents were spread all over that resort in that timeframe. Some pretty extraordinary locations when you think that these are some of the country's most closely guarded secrets. Erin, starting in January of 2021, right there in the white and gold ballroom, that's where many of those boxes were stored. You can see right there in the middle of the Mar-a-Lago complex. That is where, according to the indictment, events and gatherings continued to take place. And then in April, many were moved to what's called the Lake Room. That is essentially a fancy name for that room that you are looking at right there. It is a bathroom with a shower and a toilet. Those boxes piled six or seven high right next to that toilet. And then in June, the former president asked for the boxes to be removed to a storage room. There were some 80 boxes that were moved. And that hallway, Erin, could be reached, according to the indictment, by several different entrances, including one that was often left open. Now, a few months later, Walt Nauta, who, of course, is the alleged co-conspirator of the former president, he visited that storage room. And you can see what he found, several of those boxes fell over with their contents spilled out onto the floor. In that pile of documents is one that is classified \"secret,\" which means, by definition, that if exposed, if revealed, it could cause serious damage to the national security of the United States. That document also had a classification that said \"relating only to Five Eyes.\" Five Eyes is the alliance, the intelligence sharing cooperating alliance that the United States has with its closest intelligence partners. You can see the flags there, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. So that just gives us a sense of how these documents were treated, that one of these documents that could only be shared with the United States' closest intelligence partners, just splayed out there on the ground in boxes that fell over in that storage room -- Erin?",

And it is impossibly early to try that case starting in January. The defense has a constitutional right to more time to prep. So the question is, are any of these other cases going to realistically going to get tried in June, July, August, that close to November? And remember, a defendant has a constitutional right to prepare. You can't make them go one right into the next. So huge question to watch for tomorrow when we get into scheduling: How quickly does is this going to move, is there any chance they get this in before November?",
