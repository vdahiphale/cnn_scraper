We'll get an update on their talks and the state of the war from key White House Official John Kirby. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer and you're in THE SITUATION ROOM. Tonight, the alleged anti-Semitic plot uncovered in Michigan is adding to fears for the safety of Jewish-Americans and elected officials. CNN's Polo Sandoval has all the new details on the suspect and the deadly threats he's accused of making. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  Tonight, the FBI foiling an alleged plot to kill Jewish government officials in Michigan. A federal complaint filed in Eastern Michigan naming Jack Eugene Carpenter III as a defendant. Sources telling CNN he was arrested just a day after allegedly posting disturbing anti-Semitic threats online using the handle, temperedreason. A law enforcement source telling CNN among those specifically targeted by Carpenter, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel. I was a target of the heavily armed defendant in this matter, she wrote on Twitter, court documents laying out the details on February 18th. The FBI in Detroit was alerted by the bureau's national threat operation of the post, tweeting, I'm heading back to Michigan now threatening to carry out the punishment of death to anyone that is Jewish in the Michigan government. Carpenter's account also showing a bizarre declaration of sovereignty to a new country named new Israel at Carpenter's property in rural Michigan, according to the criminal complaint. That address revealing Carpenter had three nine millimeter handguns registered in Michigan, one of which had been stolen from his girlfriend, according to that complaint. That criminal complaint also shading light on Carpenter's background, who had an unserved personal protection order against him from early February and had been arrested in December of last year for assault. That unhinged plot just the latest since several threats and attacks on lawmakers and officials in the United States as well as increasing anti-Semitic attacks.",

They would not speak to the circumstances about his departure. However, Wolf, when you read some of those unhinged ramblings that according to federal prosecutors were actually written by Carpenter, he writes that he was fired for refusing to take what he described as an experimental medication. So, that certainly speaks volumes. Meanwhile, Carpenter does remain behind bars ahead of a future court hearing. CNN has reached out to his defense, Wolf.",

And you're quite right, it is with that dreadful, relentless pounding of heavy artillery that the town continues to get hit with all those civilians inside.

The case has always been about three things, motive, number one, number two, the timeline, and, number three, alternative explanations, and so what did they seek to do?On the issue of motive, they sought to say that the prosecution's theory does not make sense. Will you kill your wife and your son because you feel the world is closing in on you as it relates to your financial crimes, right? You would not. And especially in this instance, the defense argued when you had everyone who would say that he was a loving father and husband, pivoting to the issue of the timeline, defense spending a lot of time on the issue of the timeline and how it was not the short timeframe in which the prosecution would suggest, right? Randi Kaye spoke about the issue of just because your phone, you're not using it, it doesn't mean you're dead, right? So, it could have been longer. Also regarding putting your finger right, an expert witness testified, they measured cause of death or at least time of death, by putting your finger under an armpit. That's not the way you do it. It's longer than that. And then pivoting to the last issue, of course, which is other reasonable alternative. They spoke to the issue of these two shooters, and so could it have been someone else? Why and how? Because, of course, if you have a pill addiction, you may be around unsavory characters, and if your son killed a young woman in a boating accident, there were people who hated him.

They're arguing as to the timeline that initially you said you weren't even there. Who would say that in the event that they didn't have something to hide? A normal person would suggest they were. You lie, you lie, you lie, you had no credibility. Why should the jury believe you now? With regard to when it happened, you were there right around the time that we believe the prosecution says that it occurred. Who else possibly could have been the one who did this?

And because that incitement, DOJ says, is outside the scope of official duties a president can't by immune for this speech. So, these were all lawsuits that were filed more than two years ago right after the January 6th Capitol attack, and they look to hold former President Trump responsible for the injuries that various members of Congress and Capitol police officers sustained during the attack. So, the federal district court judge previously ruled that these lawsuits can move forward. But now the federal appeals court here in D.C., it needs to decide whether to side with Trump and declare that he's immune in this lawsuit for everything he did or said on or leading up to January 6th or on the other hand whether this lawsuit can proceed. And the appeals court here specifically asked DOJ to weigh in. So, that's what they're doing now. And this brief from DOJ is notable, since they usually take a fairly expansive view of executive power. But right here, they're actually saying that immunity in this case should be limited when a president's speech is used to incite violence. Wolf, I will note, though, DOJ really in this brief is stopping short of specifically endorsing the idea that former President Trump incited any violence leading up to the Capitol attack, just broadly saying if violent speech is used, a president should not by immune.

But these storms are very powerful and gusty winds up to 80 miles per hour and very large hail. Once again, here are the tornado warnings, the areas in hot pink, and this is a broader view of what's going on this evening. The storms are only going to intensify as we go through the next couple of hours. The threat will remain throughout the overnight hours and especially through tomorrow as well as the storms march to the east. So, here are tornado watches through Texas, Louisiana, the Ark-La-Tex region. We have thunderstorm watch as well. These storms are very powerful. Severe weather risk, this is the area we are watching. Tornadoes, some of those could be strong, Wolf, widespread damaging winds and very large hail. This is the largest -- this is the area where we could see the biggest tornado threat. The area shaded in orange. I want to mention the hail threat we could see hail greater than 2 inches in diameter. That is baseball size hail that could fall in this area. That is one to watch especially throughout the overnight and into tomorrow morning. Once these storms go to the east, we have a widespread flash flooding risk across the Mississippi River Valley and Ohio Valley, so we could see up to 6 inches of rain in a short amount of time.
