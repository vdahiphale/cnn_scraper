He's urging the Florida pension fund to consider legal action against Bud Light's parent company. Sales and the stock price of the parent company have plummeted following a market partnership with transgender, influencer Dylan Mulvaney in the subsequent conservative boycott of the beer.CNN's Steve Contorno is in Florida for us. So, Steve, what's the latest here. What can you tell us?",

      "sentences": "Well, we obtained a letter last night that Governor DeSantis sent to the director of the state pension board asking for them to consider all options to potentially getting -- taking recourse against AB InBev, the parent company of Bud Light, for the recent down turn in the company stock. If you -- when you look at the state's investments in AB InBev, they have about 682,000 shares in AB InBev, totaling about $46 million.And DeSantis said that the company's actions have hurt shareholders like Florida which holds a lot of money in its pension fund for retirees, for state workers. And he says that there should be some potential legal action. Here's what he said last night when talking about this on \"Fox News.\" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. RON DESANTIS (R-FL), U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT CANDIDATE:  We're going to be launching an inquiry about Bud Light and InBev. And it could be something that leads to a derivative lawsuit filed on behalf of the shareholders of the Florida pension fund, because at the end of the day, there's got to be penalties for when you put business aside to focus on your social agenda at the expense of hardworking people. (END VIDEO CLIP) CONTORNO:  Now, I should point out, the Florida pension fund is $235 billion. So, this AB InBev investment, while pretty large, is still just a drop in the bucket. But this is not the first time that the Florida governor has tried to use the state pension fund as a cajole (ph) in his fight against, so-called WOKE Capitalism. Last year, he tried to pressure Twitter's board to sell the company to Elon Musk. Also, threatening action as a shareholder. And he has pushed the state board -- pension board to divest and to break away from, so-called, ESG Investing, that's Environment Social Governance Investing, that considers the environmental and social good of a company and not just the bottom line. He has said Florida is not going to do that anymore, and he is trying to get Florida's financial interest out of politics.",

About a month and a half ago, he convened in the White House, the CEOs of these companies, quietly, we had a long multi-hour working session. I was there. We dug into the details.And the president said to them, you know, it's going to take time for Congress to act and come about with regulation, but we don't have time, because this A.I. is moving so fast. And he challenged these companies to step up and prove that they'll, you know, protect people's privacy, have cybersecurity protection, use this technology for good and not for evil.

We work with Europe, Japan, and the G7, India to come up with a global code of conduct. And of course, work with Congress. Congress will ultimately act here to set forth regulations with teeth, as you say. You know, you need a statute to come up with penalties and teeth. So, we're going to get there.

And the estimates were that between a quarter of a million and million people would die, both Japanese and also U.S. soldiers, which is why for instance, Ben Affleck's grandfather was sitting there cheering, because this would save their lives. So, I think, as a no-brainer -- I mean, as a political issue, it is a no-brainer.
