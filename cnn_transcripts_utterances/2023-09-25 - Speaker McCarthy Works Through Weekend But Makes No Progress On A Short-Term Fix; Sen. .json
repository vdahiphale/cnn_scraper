This deadline is fast approaching and like Congressman Gonzales says, everything I'm hearing off the Hill is that this is basically inevitable at this point. What are you reporting? LEIGH ANN CALDWELL, CO-AUTHOR, \"THE EARLY 202\", THE WASHINGTON POST (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah, absolutely, Kasie. There's very little chance that Congress can avert this shutdown. The reason is because McCarthy isn't even talking at this point about a short-term stopgap spending bill to keep the lights on past September 30. He knows that can't pass with just Republican votes. He's refusing to work with Democrats to get that across the finish line. And so, he's basically abandoned it. What he's trying to do right now is now pass long-term spending bills -- the spending bills that would fund the government for the rest of the fiscal year -- for the 2024 fiscal year. He's hoping that buys enough goodwill for him -- for his hard-right conservatives to come to the table on the short-term spending bill to fund the government for just a few weeks. But as McCarthy said, they want to burn the place down but he's still trying to negotiate with them.",

Let's just kind of try to get this out of the way.

I really appreciate it. All right. New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez set to speak publicly for the first time since his indictment on federal corruption charges. The New Jersey Globe says Menendez will hold a news conference today. He is not expected to resign. In fact, he's expected to say he's running for reelection in 2024. He does, though, we should note, already have a primary challenger, Democratic Congressman Andy Kim. Let's bring in CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson. Joey, thanks so much for being here this morning. I really appreciate it. I think we should note when we're talking about primary challengers that there are quite a few Democrats in the New Jersey House delegation that would very happily take a promotion to the Senate, which is I think part of why you're seeing a lot of calls for him to resign from those corners. Not a lot of calls from fellow senators at this point. But I want to talk to you. Your expertise is actually what's in this indictment. We know Menendez was indicted once before and it ended in a mistrial. This one, though, comes after a yearslong Justice Department investigation. I mean, they have been sitting on those incredibly damning pictures for almost a year at this point. How damning is this case? JOEY JACKSON, CNN LEGAL ANALYST, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY (via Webex by Cisco):  So, Kasie, good morning to you. Depending upon who you ask, of course. If you are the prosecutors -- as we look there at what was in the indictment -- very inflammatory indictment having those gold bars that we see, showing the Mercedes, showing Menendez's jacket with money all over it in the envelope. And if you're the prosecution you're going to say that his office was for sale. That the reality was is that he was engaged with these business persons, in addition to his wife, in order to do favors that were improper, untoward, and absolutely outright illegal. And he was doing it for and in exchange for money and everything we saw. The defense will say something quite different, however. Notwithstanding the fact that it is damning and tells a compelling story, they will say that he's a senator and that's what senators do. Not engage in corruption but they advocate vehemently for their clients. And yes, of course, as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, he had interests with respect to Egypt and what was going on, and the success that government would have, and he acted in kind. And with respect to engaging or at least intervening in federal and state investigations, that he was doing it because it was in the best interest because he didn't believe in those investigations. So those will be the competing narratives. The challenge will be whether the government can connect his office to a quid pro quo of illegality; not that it was part and parcel to what he was doing as a senator.",

Because of the fact that they will allege that as the prosecutors, that he was exchanging, really, his position on the Foreign Relations Committee not because it was in the interests of his constituents, not because it was in the interests of America, but because it was in the interests of himself. And because he was acting out of that self-interest he was helping the government and loosening up this money that was on hold, et cetera.And all these actions were engaged in because he was getting paid to do it -- not by the taxpayers as it relates to his basic salary, but because he was engaged in this corrupt bribery scheme and he was acting as a result of that. And then prosecutors will say but there's more. It's not only that but it's everything else that he was doing as it relates to helping his friends. This wasn't a senator who was in agreement that a federal prosecution shouldn't go forward and as a result, installing people who he could control. This was about the fact that he was installing people and recommending names to President Biden in terms of who he should appoint as a result of this corrupt scheme. So that will be the narrative. Of course, his defense will be vehement in saying listen, senators have lunches. Senators have dinners. Senators exchange text messages. Senators get gifts from clients. And they do it for a job well done. And there would be nothing to suggest, the defense will say, as a result of his activities that there was any quid pro quo. He wasn't doing it because of these things and gifts. He was doing it and engaged in these activities because that's what senators do. And if you're going to be effective you have to do it as well as he did in this instance. So those will be the colliding narratives in court. The one that succeeds, of course, will be the one that carries the day. Will he be guilty? Will he be not guilty? That's the open question.",

That ABC number is so different from other polls that we've seen, but the network and the Post acknowledge it is likely an outlier.

Biden's going to be with the UAW on Tuesday on the picket line. You're going to see Donald Trump there on Wednesday during the Republican debate, clearly executing a general election strategy as his rivals for the GOP nomination are on stage out at the Reagan Library. But what does this tell you about kind of the state of politics generally? That these voters in Michigan -- it's fascinating to me that the Republicans and the Democrats both are basically playing to the same exact audience while the head of the UAW is withholding the endorsement from Joe Biden.

I support you. But then you look at his record when he was in office and he clashed a lot with labor unions over his federal appointees and over his general policies.
