That is according to an American official.Now, according to the United Nations' command, the man was on tour of a joint security area when he crossed the military demarcation line, right on the border. We'll get a map at some point to show you where it is. Right on the border between North and South Korean, the Demilitarized Zone. He crossed the border into North Korean territory, it is believed, when he was taken into custody. We have team coverage. We're joined from the State Department, from the White House. We have our military analyst available. First, though, let's go to CNN's Will Ripley, who has been to North Korea so many times. Will, give us a sense of what happened.",

      "sentences": "Well, it's a very interesting location, John, because Panmunjom is basically a series of buildings that straddle the border between North and South Korea, in an area known as the DMZ, the Demilitarized Zone. Half the buildings in the North, half the buildings in the South.It's like a tourist attraction. There are gift shops on the North Korean side and the South Korean side. You can get souvenirs. People go and, yes, they see armed soldiers and sniper towers and there are still mines in the woods, so it can be a pretty dangerous area. But a lot of people cross through without incident every single day that it's open. And it's open for much of the year on the South Korean side, although the pandemic obviously, you know, has thrown a wrench in some of that, and certainly it does on the North as well. So, this would have been a pretty routine type of, you know, tour showing these service members This is what North Korea looks like. They're standing very close to North Korea. But it certainly doesn't happen - or it doesn't frequently happen that somebody would actually step out of their group and actually take that walk across the military demarcation line. It's the line that President Trump crossed when he technically became the first sitting U.S. president to cross into North Korean soil when he was having some impromptu discussions with Kim Jong-un at the DMZ. And this - if indeed this is a service member who has attempted to defect to North Korea, John, it actually wouldn't be the first time. We know of at least six U.S. service men who have defected to North Korea. But the last time it happened was more than 40 years ago, back in 1982. It's a very different time now. North Korea is a nuclear-armed nation. They've been conducting lots of launches, trying to get the attention of the United States through their missile testing and the Biden administration has not reached out at all. But now, John, interestingly, this American in North Korean custody may be an opportunity for the North Koreans to engage that they did not have until this person apparently decided to make those steps across the demarcation line into North Korea.",

So I -- from the North Korean side, I can tell you, it's a bit of a distance.You might have to -- if you were trying to get over there in a matter of seconds, you might have to do a little bit of a jog to get across. Maybe it would take you five or 10 seconds if you're walking briskly. But it's not a very long distance. It's not a very difficult thing to cross. As you can see in the video there, those blue buildings. There's a nice gap in the middle and somebody could just walk right through if that's what they wanted to do. But very few people do that. And, obviously, when North Koreans attempt to do the crossing, sometimes they're even fired at by other North Korean soldiers. There have actually been incidents of bullets flying in this area with North Korean defectors. Obviously, we don't believe that there were any shots fired in this case of somebody actually walking from South to North, but it's pretty rare, as I said, a service member, it hasn't happened in decades.",

If you reflect back on the Trump administration, there was pretty regular contact between U.S. officials and North Korean officials as they were setting up those summit between President Trump and Kim Jong-un.So, we know that there are ways for the U.S. to send the signals, to send contacts to North Korea. But our understanding is that those haven't been hot channels that have been active over the course of the last few years, with U.S. officials saying they haven't received substantive responses from the North Korean side as they have reached out to engage, saying that there would be no preconditions. They wouldn't be asking North Korea to do anything to partake in initial conversations. But the North Koreans just haven't done so. And even in this incident, we're still waiting to learn more details. You know, all we know right now is that according to the U.N. command, which preserves the stability of the Korean peninsula, this American crossed over the demarcation line from South Korea to North Korea, and did so without authorization. So, we're waiting to learn a little bit more about what that means. You know, was the person aggressively crossing over. As we have heard from experts, and I myself have been to the area, it's pretty hard to cross over in an accidental way because these tours are not done to be provocative. These tours are done to show off what the United Nations has been able to do, to maintain stability between South Korea and North Korea. So, we're waiting to hear a little bit more about just how all of this went down. But we should note that there are not, before this incident, any known Americans who were detained by North Korea at this time. The last Americans who were released from North Korea were released in 2018, three Americans, and then, of course, after that we saw that there were multiple summits between President Trump and Kim Jong-un, which obviously didn't deliver any results on denuclearization, but it was the first time that we saw such high-level engagement between the two sides. BERMAN: Kylie Atwood, let me just ask and put a fine point on it because there is still so much we don't know. Were do not know at this point if this U.S. soldier willingly, decisively, walked across the border, on purpose, or whether it was some kind of accident, correct?",

He could actually be at one of North Korea's empty old Soviet chic I call them hotels. In fact, that's where the Americans that we interviewed during our first trip to North Korea back in 2014 were being held. They're held in the hotel as charges are potentially compiled against them.In this case, I don't know clearly what North Korea would charge this American with, if he would - if there would even be a trial, or if they would assess that this is some sort of a - you know, in the past they'd use words like mental case to talk about people that crossed into North Korea and asked for refuge, particularly Americans. It's not something that happens very often. But the North Koreans, certainly it's not something that they - that they welcome or something that they encourage. They don't want people illegally crossing into their country and creating a burden financially for them in terms of providing food, medical care, and any other kind of things that this - that this person will now need while in North Korean custody. The North Koreans will, you know, they'll have a bill. And when the United States wants that person handed back over, the North Koreans will present the bill and say, well first you've got to pay what's due because they have very limited resources. But the conditions will be probably isolation. You know, no television, no radio. Maybe some books in Korean. I'm not even sure if they'd be in English. Sitting in kind of a plain room. If he ends up going to a prison, it's going to be - it's basically going to feel like this own private prison where he only sees the guards that are in charge of keeping tabs on him. They keep American and western prisoners in these kind of isolation prisons where they go out and for eight hours a day they move rocks around in - you know, in a yard, or they dig holes or they do some sort of manual labor, eight hours a day, six days a week. They get three square meals a day. Certainly very different conditions for an American detained in North Korean, John, than would be for a North Korean who had to go to one of the nation's infamous and notorious labor camps.",

It happened, as you noted, just shy of 24 hours after that attack, at 2:00 here in the morning local time when a local military official announced that the city was under assault. And we saw that very clearly with our own eyes from our hotel. We saw those red tracers being fired up into the sky, hundreds of them. We saw Ukrainian spotlights around the area of the port looking for drones in the sky. We heard the air defenses going off and we saw what appeared to be a drone or something else on fire streaking behind us. And then we heard, Sara, that there were at least four to six caliber missiles, these Russian cruise missiles, fired from the Black Sea heading towards Odessa. And we heard some very large impacts. You just played one of them. That was shot from our photojournalist Scott McWhinnie from our window. Extremely loud. So loud that it set off a car alarm on our street. Now, the Ukrainians say that those missiles were intercepted and destroyed, but they certainly made an impact.
