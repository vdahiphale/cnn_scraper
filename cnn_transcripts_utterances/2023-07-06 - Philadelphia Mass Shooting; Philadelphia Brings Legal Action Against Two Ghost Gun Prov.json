At the time of the arrest, police say, the firearms found in his possession, an AR-style weapon and handgun, both were ghost guns. A ghost gun is a weapon that doesn't have any markings and is not traceable. In the past three years, ghost guns confiscations in Philadelphia have increased 300 percent. And now the City of Philadelphia is suing the two largest suppliers of the ghost guns.Joining me now to discuss this, Former Deputy director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe. Thank you so much for being here. Do you think that the city's lawsuit could have a real impact on trying to get ghost guns off the streets?",

So, they are almost designed, and in many cases, specifically marketed to people who cannot pass the federal firearms background systems process.So, they're -- this is a literally a product that was developed and is now marketed to evade the law, to evade normal handgun safety regulations that we all know and accept as a part of Second Amendment exercise in this country.

Struggles with mental health, isolation, deep-seeded grievances against other populations. Here you have, apparently, this man made all kinds of statements about who he felt was responsible for the crime on streets, which he was allegedly going out to help solve. And of course, an obsession with firearms possession and ownership.Here's a guy who has a prior firearms conviction, probably couldn't qualify to purchase a firearm and yet he's posting how Joe Biden is trying to get rid of his access to firearms. So, these sorts of mental health issues, grievances, they are frequently the fuel that drives mass shooters to believe that a mass shooting or an act of violence is the only option for them, and that seems like what's happened in this case. We'll of course find out more as the case goes forward, but a very common story here.",

And also, it just kind of shows you what brought them to this point, which I had to learn something from that process. So, we will find out more as that investigation goes on.

The 3rd Assault Brigade granted us access to the POWs and two of their soldiers were in the room for the interview. The POWs will soon be transferred to Ukrainian intelligence. They didn't appear to be under duress and agreed to share their stories. Slava, also serving time for drugs said condition in the trenches were grim. Food was scarce. We didn't have medical kits, he says. His commanders took all the painkillers to get high, he recalled, and as a result, issued nonsensical orders. Morale was terrible. Sergei was wounded by a grenade before surrendering to Ukrainian troops. He was a contract soldier, not a convict. He completed his six-month contract in Kherson and went home. But when he hesitated to sign another contract, a military prosecutor gave him a choice, prison or back to the front. He ended up outside Bakhmut, under constant Ukrainian fire, discipline collapsed. The officers fled. All illusions were shattered. It was very different from what I saw on T.V., a parallel reality, says Sergei. I felt fear, pain, and disappointment in my commanders. A law passed last year in Russia, imposed sentences of three to 10 years for soldiers who surrender voluntarily. If he returns home in a prisoner exchange, Anton may end up again back in a Russia prison. Ben Wedeman, CNN, Eastern Ukraine. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The cause of the crash is under investigation. And a state of emergency has been declared in Southern Peru after the Ubinas volcano erupted on Tuesday. Experts say, ash from the explosion went about three miles up in the air, you see that extraordinary video there, and that additional eruptions could result in ash fall around the entire region.
