MAYNARD:  So, they issued the initial evacuation orders about two hours before we left for the crossing and we saw hundreds of people rushing out of their -- I was going to say houses. They're not houses. Of course, these people have been displaced many times. But they were leaving their very temporary shelters, their makeshift tents, their tarpaulin shelters, gathering their belongings together, going in cars, some of them walking, some of them going on a cart with donkeys and rushing out. And it was very distressing to see them leaving so urgently because that -- this -- for some of them, this is the fifth, sixth, seventh time they'd done that in in the last six months.",

And Gaza's health ministry said in a statement, now, particularly after the Sunday attack, there is no hospital in Rafah with enough capacity to take this number of killed and injured, causing confusion amongst ambulance teams on where to transfer them. Give us a layout of what hospitals remain, what don't, anywhere nearby these places that are, you know, under IDF attack. DR. MAYNARD:  So, Rafah is a small town. It has a population of 100,000 to 200,000 people normally. It has two hospitals, one government hospital and a larger hospital, which normally has a capacity of about 60 beds. And a small hospital called the Kuwaiti Hospital, which has been in the news a lot in the last few days, which has a capacity normally of 15, one, five beds. So, they have very limited beds there. They've got a bigger hospital, between Rafah and Khan Younis, called the European Gaza Hospital, which I've worked in a lot over the years, which is surrounded by the Israeli ground forces, so it's very difficult for patients to get to that. So, effectively, there are no hospitals for these patients to go to. There are some field hospitals that have been set up, but the number of acute beds available to take these patients is very, very few.",

I want to ask you this, because you saw in Jeremy Diamond's report there, they saw the weapons. They were described as slightly less huge and powerful, perhaps to try to mitigate civilian damage. These are American-made weapons. But from a doctor's point of view, particularly as he said, Jeremy, in a densely populated zone, a light weapon -- a light bomb or heavy bomb is going to create a huge amount of civilian destruction. What do you -- what can you say about the weapons that are used? DR. MAYNARD:  So, Gaza's got a population of 2.2 million. It is the most densely populated place in the world. I was there last May operating on -- I'm a cancer surgeon. I was operating on cancer patients as part of the MAP program. And it was the last big bombardment before October the 7th, beginning of May. And I was stuck there. They closed the borders and we had to be evacuated eventually. But I witnessed for four days, this nonstop bombardment. And it was an incredible demonstration of how precise the bombing can be when the Israeli defense force want to do that. They were targeting specific rooms in buildings, specific floors, and there was collateral damage, but minimal collateral damage at that time. So, I've witnessed firsthand how precise their targeting can be. Move forward to post-October the 7th, I was there over Christmas and New Year, and I witnessed -- I watched the indiscriminate bombing of large. populations in the surrounding camps in Deir al Balah, where I was staying for two weeks. So, I've witnessed two extremes. I've seen how precision -- how precise their targeting can be, and I've seen how indiscriminate it can be. And there's no doubt in my mind that what we've seen since October the 7th is indiscriminate killing of large population civilian -- of large population civilians.",

MAYNARD:  So, when I was there for two weeks over Christmas and New Year, we saw a huge amount of trauma, and that was really major blast injuries from bombs affecting the abdomen and the chest with severe shrapnel injuries. We spent the whole time operating on major chest injuries, major abdominal injuries with the local surgeons. My most recent trip, from which I returned just three weeks ago, we saw a different pattern of illnesses. We did see some blast injuries, but the amount of bombings were much less. But what we did see and what kept us really busy in the operating theatre were the problems with malnutrition. And we highlighted this when were there over Christmas and New Year and it's got much, much worse. We know the IPC has designated Northern Gaza as a famine area. The malnutrition in Middle Gaza and Southern Gaza is now extreme. And we saw the consequences of that. And it's not just that they're losing weight, but they become immunosuppressed if they're malnourished, and they don't heal. So, we saw many patients who'd had surgery for war injuries, for blast injuries, for gunshot wounds, whose wounds were falling to pieces. And their internal organ repairs, the bowel repairs, the liver repairs, the pancreas repairs, they were all disintegrating, falling to pieces. And the consequences of that are devastating. And I had patients -- I'll talk about two patients in particular, 16-year- old Tala (ph) and 18-year-old Lama (ph), both young ladies, both of whom had blast injuries from bombs, both of whom had major surgery to repair, both of whom was severely malnourished before they came, and both of whom died under our care as a direct result of malnutrition. So, the effects of malnutrition now going to cause far, far more excess deaths than we have seen so far.",

People in Afghanistan at that time, as you very well know, were coming out of years of the Taliban being in charge and during the Taliban's reign, prior to the U.S. and the allies' invasion, music was banned. So, there were instruments being burned on the streets, records were contraband, CDs were contraband, cassette tapes were contraband, any musical instruments were contraband. So, all of that stuff if, you got caught with them, would get destroyed, burned, and you may get in trouble during the rule of the Taliban prior to the ally invasion. And so, there was a lot of pent up demAnd desire for people to engage with music again, and when they were able to, in Afghanistan, \"Afghan Star\" eventually was developed as a show very similar to \"American Idol\" or \"The Voice,\" which I'm a coach on. And people were able to vote on their favorite singer. They were so engaged. It really captured the attention of the nation. And it was quite a remarkable show.

But what I find is interesting, and I've gotten to speak with Saad since we made the podcast, is that even though the Taliban's back in charge it's hard to put the genie back in the bottle once people have access to music and access to all of this entertainment, they find a way to get to it, especially with the internet and mobile devices and all these other things. Music is not dead in Afghanistan right now, even though the Taliban is back in charge.

Inflation -- the inflation rate fell almost as much as it's ever fallen. And for the -- really the first time in modern memory, there was no big recession when inflation was falling that much. I think what everybody's trying to wrap their head around now, as we're finishing out this year and going into next year, is the beneficial things that we experience, the healing of the supply chain, the return of labor force participation and workers going back to into their jobs. Is that going to continue or are we back to the traditional tradeoff between employment and inflation? I -- for me, I still think there is some benefit that's coming down the pipe, if only because those improvements take some time to work their way through the economy.

And the people that I know on the Federal Open Market Committee, it's not -- elections are not the subject of the FOMC decisions. It is absolutely the economy and looking at unemployment and inflation and trying to fulfill what the law requires us to do. If you look at the economic research, as I say, it's quite clear across countries and across time, even in the United States, that where administrations put their thumb on the scale and try to order around the monetary policy decisions, the economic outcomes are worse. That's how the Fed and the other central banks around the world move to this independence position. It's not to say the president appoints and the Senate confirms members to the board of governors, the chair and the other governors, so that there is oversight, but it just -- it's a bad idea for economic performance if a sitting administration is in the business of the Fed telling them how they want the monetary policy to be conducted, it's just not a good idea. And you can look in episodes of U.S. history where that happens, it's problematic, it leads to higher inflation and more persistent inflation if you do that.",

Iwas publicly a little critical because I thought it was overly precise. I don't think that inflation is a kind of a noisy series. So, could you really hit 2.0 percent? How would you know if it was 2.1 percent? That said, it's important to center our expectations in both in markets and in businesses around some number. And once you commit to a target, I think it's extremely important that you remain committed to that target. So, you've had some people publicly saying, oh, well, this seems difficult. Let's just declare that the target was 3.2 percent and then we won. I don't think you can do that. You got to do your job before you can go looking for a new job.

Partly over time, longer trends, demographic trends, the aging of the workforce, labor forceparticipation, and then the short run, COVID, things went crazy. We've never seen anything like that. Now, we've rebounded to look something more like normal, but we still are grappling with these issues of working from home and hybrid work. And as you raise, the gig economy. I'm struck by the resilience on the job market. The strongest part of the economy, by far, is the strength of the job market. Beyond what we even would have predicted. Before there was ever was COVID, they were making projections of what would be labor force participation in 2024, and we're above what they thought it would be here before COVID ever came. So, that's the strongest part. And the weakest part, everyone knows, is that the price level is higher and inflation got well up above what were comfortable with. And so, we're just still trying to grapple with these issues. It's not just in the labor market where some weird things happened, it's also in different sectors of the economy. We had a recession that was driven by a bunch of industries that we normally think of as being recession proof, like services and healthcare and things like that. And now, as we come out of COVID, those services are, in a way, booming back and housing, consumer durables, the kind of cyclical industries that normally make up the bread and butter of the business cycle are in a way not in the driver's seat.

And you have really seen post-COVID, a rebound of that entrepreneurial spirit, let's call it, of the American economy. I think that's been a big part of why the growth rate has been higher. But there's no question that there's -- it's not paradise and there are definitely, in both industries, geographies, and individual people who are hurting.

There's two parts of the housing problem, that is with the Fedhas a 2 percent inflation target, but it's important to remember that didn't mean that the price in the inflation of everything was 2 percent. Before there was COVID, housing was about 3.5 percent, services were about 2.5 percent, and physical goods were about minus 1 percent. And combined, that was -- it got us to two percent. We then go through a strange period of COVID. All of those inflation rates go way up. And what we've seen is goods inflation back down to something like minus 1 percent as it was before. Services still elevated but approaching the levels they were before. And the big outlier has been housing inflation, as you raise. And it's down from its peaks, but it's still well elevated compared to where it was pre-COVID. And I've been saying, I think if we don't get that inflation rate back down to something like what it was before, we're going to have a hard time getting to 2 percent. Now, there's a mechanical way in which market rents flow through with a lag into the official measures of inflation. And it hasn't done that as fast as we thought it would. I'm still optimistic that it's going to, but there's one in the mechanical. But then there's the deeper issue, which it sounded like is kind of the premise of your question, which if you raise rates a lot in a short period of time, and you had basically 0 percent interest rates for a long period, people got mortgages very low, and now mortgage rates are much higher. And so, there is an -- it's not just demand that goes down when you raise the interest rate, it's also a bunch of people say, well, I don't want to sell my house because I have a cheap mortgage and if I move to a new house, I'm going to have an expensive mortgage. So, I'm going to just wait. And you have kind of seen over an extended period the willingness of existing homeowners to put their houses on the market having a strange impact on prices and on supply in the housing market. So, the Fed is having to balance that out a little bit as well.",
