We've just obtained new video, of the two Israeli women, who were released, taken to a medical center, in Tel Aviv, tonight. They are 79-year-old Nurit Cooper, whom you can see here, and 85-year-old Yocheved Lifshitz. Both were kidnapped, along with their husbands, from -- with their husbands, from the kibbutz, Nir Oz, near Gaza, on that deadly day. Their husbands, I should note, were not released, tonight, and instead do still remain captives, of Hamas. These two women were released, we are told, to the Red Cross, at the Rafah Crossing. That's between Egypt and Gaza. This happened just in the last several hours. And this news comes three days, after the release of Judith and Natalie Raanan. That was last Friday. And now, they are expected to be back on their way, to the United States, this week. Over 200 hostages do still remain, in Gaza, tonight. A number that we do know includes American citizens. CNN has now learned that the White House, meantime, in the background of all of this, is quietly urging Israel, to delay its invasion of Gaza, in order to buy more time, to potentially get more hostages out. The White House has been extremely careful with how they've been talking about this, in recent days. That much was evident, as President Biden, today, as he was speaking with reporters about this, quickly corrected himself, after the mere mention of a ceasefire. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

What we were told about sources, how this all came down is there were some behind-the-scenes negotiating, happening between the Egyptians, and the Qataris. That's what sources told us. Nurit Cooper and Yocheved Lifshitz are now in a medical center. They are undergoing check-ups, obviously, to make sure that they are OK. That's something that we saw happen, with Judith and Natalie Raanan, when they were released, last Friday. Their family members are waiting for them, we are told.

Certainly, Hamas would like to see a delay, a ceasefire, altogether. They are very eager to get fuel supplies in there. There's a lot of humanitarian organizations, who obviously would like to see a ceasefire. They want to get more relief supplies, coming over the Rafah border.

But we believe the best way to do that is to keep the pressure up on Hamas. This terrorist organization isn't suddenly going to become humanitarian, and release hostages, because it's the right thing to do. They're going to release hostages, because they're under pressure. And so, we believe, upgrading the pressure, on Hamas, that's the Military pressure, that's the diplomatic pressure, on their allies and supporters, abroad, that's the right way to get people out of this.

And it was said, of course, the fuel is going to generators, in hospitals, to help save lives. And yet, Hamas, at gunpoint, stole a large proportion of that fuel. And then, we presume it was diverted to their Military machine.

Israel refuses to go back to the sort of reality, of 6 AM, on October 7th, where we live next to this terrorist enclave, and they can inflict this sort of deadly horrific, gruesome violence, that they inflicted upon us. We refuse to live that way anymore. We will destroy Hamas' Military machine. And in so doing, not only do we better protect our own people, and safeguard their security, but I believe we create opportunities, for a better reality, for the people of Gaza who, for 16 years, have lived under Hamas rule, which has only brought them hardship, and suffering, and impoverishment.",

I mean, first of all, we were surprised, intelligence didn't get in time, that Hamas was going to launch this brutal, murderous attack that they did, on October 7th. I mean, they massacred us, because we weren't prepared. And there wasn't the warning. Second, we have to ask, why is it that the fence that we'd spent so much time, building, and the technology and so forth, which was supposed to be an impassable barrier, that they passed it so quickly, and relatively easily? And thirdly, is the question of why did it take us so long, to clear out those terrorists, who infiltrated into Israel? And it's true there were a lot of them, over 1,000. But still, it took us days, as you will recall, for us, to clear out our own sovereign territory, from Hamas terrorists, who were roaming and killing, and keeping people hostage, and so forth. So, for all these reasons, and more, we need to have serious investigations. Ultimately, we have to learn from our mistakes. And the only way you learn from the mistakes, is by studying exactly what happened. And there will be lessons learned. But to be fair, I think the focus, today, has to be, on winning this war. We didn't want this war. It was forced upon us. But having been put in this situation, we will win it. We'll win it on our terms.
