Here in the U.S., the fight for control of the House of Representatives, 19 races still not call nearly one week after the midterm elections. We're following the latest vote counts. And on the world stage, a critical face-to-face meeting between President Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping lasting more than three hours, both leaders laying out their positions as tensions flare over trade, Taiwan and Russia. We begin in Washington this hour. Serious political jockeying is under way to determine who will lead the parties in both the House and the Senate. But before all that, Democrats have a big to-do list for these final weeks of the current lame-duck Congress. And CNN's Jessica Dean joins us from Capitol Hill. Jessica, what are Democrats hoping to accomplish before the new Congress is sworn in?",

      "sentences": "Right.So, Ana, they have got this tight little time frame in between now and when that new Congress is sworn in, in January. They're hoping to make the most of it. They have got a pretty packed to-do list. The first thing at the top of the list is funding the government. The current government funding runs out on December 16. So they have got to figure out how they want to do that. There's also questions within there. Will that include funding for Ukraine? Will that include COVID-19 money? The Democrats certainly want to get, but maybe a harder thing to get put into this. And do they just want to do what's known as a continuing resolution, which would just kind of kick the can down the road until January or when the new Congress is in? Or do they actually want to pass a full new government funding bill? And that is kind of the question that we are watching. Also, what about the debt limit? Will they try to raise it? There have been some questions about that. But it appears, at this moment in time, there probably isn't the support or even the appetite to do that, unless it's absolutely necessary. So that's something to certainly keep our eyes on. There's also the National Defense Authorization Act. That is the bill that really sets the agenda and funds the Department of Defense. So that's very important. They want to get that done. And then there's codifying same-sex marriage. You will remember, this came up back in September before the midterms. They tried to get a vote then. The support just wasn't quite there. They're confident that they have it now. I will let you listen to Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. He was on CNN this morning, earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY):  We didn't have it. We need 60. So you need 10 Republicans. We didn't have it. And so instead of just having a show vote, where we would lose, because I believe in getting things done is the most important thing, I said, I will wait. And now we will go back to our caucuses and see where we're at. But it's one of the things. It's along with debt ceiling, and we have to fund the government. That's probably the most important thing.",

LEE, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Ana, open and candid is how President Biden describe this conversation that, as you said, lasted more than three hours. And the two leaders had a big list of issues to discuss, particularly, given that this was their first in person meeting since President Biden took office, and given also that this comes at a real low point in U.S. Chinese relations. Among the issues that they discussed include, of course, Taiwan, human rights, the ongoing war in Ukraine, North Korea's ongoing provocations, and the issue of climate change as well. And Taiwan, of course, was one of the most highly anticipated topics. And what President Biden said on this issue is that he said he emphasized to Xi that the U.S.' policy on this issue hasn't changed, that they continue to support the One China policy. He also told reporters afterwards that he doesn't think there is a need for a new cold war and that he also doesn't see any imminent threat of an attack from China on Taiwan. So, clearly, this was an effort by the president to try to take the temperature down on an issue that has been so contentious for these two countries.",

GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, \"THE GREAT U.S.-CHINA TECH WAR\":  Yes, that's really the big issue. And President Biden's comments were sort of neutral. But we have seen some very provocative behavior on the part of the Chinese military. And it's not just Taiwan, of course. It's India, Japan, the Philippines, and also these very dangerous intercepts in international airspace. On May 26, the Chinese almost brought down an Australian patrol aircraft in international airspace. That could have created the dangerous spiral leading to a conflict.",

Now, over 2,000 years of Chinese statecraft, that means that Biden is very much subservient. It's like the vassals going to the great Celestial Court in China.

The two others, one in good condition, the other one in critical condition, it's not quite clear they were on the football team. But everybody we have talked to here says they too were on the football team here. We know that Jones came to the attention of the authorities here at UVA in the last several months. They were doing a threat assessment of him. During that threat assessment, they discovered that, in 2021, there was a concealed weapons charge against him. And then also during that threat assessment, somebody had complained or told police that Jones had said that he had a gun. It is not -- it is forbidden for students to have guns here on the UVA campus. Also, during that threat assessment, they discovered that there was a hazing incident that Jones was involved in. In all three of these incidents, though, the gun, for instance, there was never a threat involved. The hazing incident, it was never really defined. And then the 2021 charge of a concealed weapon, it's not clear that they found anything other than that there was a charge and that he never disclosed it. That alone would have probably gotten him kicked out of school for not reporting that charge.
