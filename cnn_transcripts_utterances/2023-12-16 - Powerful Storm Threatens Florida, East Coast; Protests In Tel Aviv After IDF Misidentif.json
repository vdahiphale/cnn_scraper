Now, right now, we don't really have too much out there. Most of the moisture is still well over the warm waters, but that's going to change as we head into the afternoon.All of that rain is going to begin to spread across the state of Florida and it's really going to be pretty much a deluge most of the day today. So, if you were kind of hoping for a few breaks, it's going to be very early this morning and that's about it. Because by the time we get to this evening, that low pressure system starts to slide up the East Coast. The main focus for tomorrow really being Georgia and into the Carolinas. Then, from there, that low pressure system will continue up the eastern seaboard. So, by late Sunday, the Delmarva region and Mid- Atlantic, that's where the focus is going to be. By Monday morning, if you have any travel plans or maybe you still have to go to work, it is going to be a very soggy commute first thing Monday for much of the Northeast. Very heavy rain. Flooding is going to be the top concern with this storm. You're talking widespread three to five inches, but also coastal flooding, coastal erosion are going to be big concerns up and down the East Coast. That heavy rain continues. So, again, even for areas of the Northeast, you're still also looking at that three to five-inch range of rainfall totals. Flooding concerns, three different days, three different regions. Today, the main focus is going to be across Florida. By tomorrow, you're talking more of the Carolina coast into the Mid-Atlantic. And then, by Monday, the main concern is really going to be areas of the Northeast. Also, talking winds, you're looking at a lot of these winds up around that 30 to even 60 mile per hour range. That could lead to trees and power lines coming down as well.",

And those coalition partners are completely opposed to any Palestinian state.In fact, they want to annex the West Bank and to, you know, further destroy Palestinian statehood. And so, that's why I think he's coming out and saying, no, there's not going to be the Palestinian Authority government in Gaza, even though I don't think there's any real good alternative in the long run. But I think, you know, the good news from Israel is that more moderate centrist parties, including, including Benny Gantz, who is one of Netanyahu's partners in the war cabinet. They are picking up support at the same time that Bibi is losing support. And so, I think there is some hope that at some point when you next have an election in Israel that a more modern government will come to power will realize that it has to provide a more positive outlet for Palestinian aspirations, so that Palestinians can aspire to their own state instead of, you know, having Hamas continue to launch these horrific attacks on Israel.",

And second, they have to try to limit Palestinian civilian casualties,which is very difficult because Hamas uses civilians as human shields. And, of course, third, they have to try to liberate all the hostages that Hamas continues to hold. Now, of course, there was some good news, you know, a few weeks ago on the hostage front when more than 100 hostages were released during the course of a one-week pause in the fighting, but there just has not been a lot of success for Israel in terms of trying to liberate hostages with its own forces, with commando raids or what have you.

There are a lot of things going on at once adrenaline is pumping and all of these soldiers, they are going through various degrees of stress. And when they see something like this, this is a very unusual event, they're used to certain things happening. They used to everybody around them, besides their comrades being hostile.

And what is supposed to happen is they are supposed to have had the training to recognize these kinds of issues, to recognize when hostages are coming forward especially in a situation like this. So, one of the things that the IDF will most likely do is review the kind of training procedures that they have for close combat situations like this, especially when there are hostages involved. It sounds like the unit involved was not a special operations unit. If that turns out to be the case, then, you know, that does show there is a you know some need for training at this level of the IDF. If it is a special operations unit then it calls into question a whole series of other things that would need to be looked at. But this is one of the most serious situations, Amara, and it is a, you know, a key indicator that there is an absolute need for soldiers to kind of pull back when situations like that occur, especially, when there is a white flag involved.
