Sources telling CNN that Special Counsel Robert Hur is not expected to bring charges.Hur was appointed in January after classified documents from Biden's time as vice president were found at his private office and home.

And today, multiple sources telling us that they do not expect criminal charges to be filed in this investigation.But right now, the special counsel, Robert Hur, and his team, they are working to compile a very detailed report about exactly what they did in the course of this probe. We've learned from multiple sources that they have been fastidious, going to witnesses once, twice, going back again. And re-trotting a lot of the ground that they had already covered, leading some lawyers for witnesses to even complain about just how tedious this investigation has been. So we expect this very detailed report to come in the coming months. We have learned that investigators who are on this team have told some people that they expect this to all be wrapped up by the end of the year, but that deadline could slide. Now, of course, if there are no charges brought in this case, that is likely to draw some criticism from the President's Republican adversaries. But a key part of this case is the fact that once these classified materials were found, the president's team alerted the National Archives and they did return the materials that they were required to.",

Yesterday, the IDF raided Al-Shifa, claiming Hamas has been using tunnels beneath it as a command center.And this just in to CNN NEWS CENTRAL, Israel saying it has found an operational tunnel shaft inside the hospital complex.

What is the significance of this finding? What do you make of it? COL. LIAM COLLINS, U.S. ARMY (RET.): Yes, I mean what this shows is something that Israel has known and most likely U.S. intelligence has known and that's Hamas, right? They don't follow the international humanitarian law. They use hospitals, schools, churches, right, things like this for their own protection in turn what would otherwise be unlawful military targets into lawful military targets. Israel has no desire to go into this hospital, but they're forced to go in there, because that's where Hamas is set up either in the vicinity inside of and used for their protection and put their own citizens at risk.",

I mean, obviously, Hamas has no real desire to release any of these hostages. They didn't attempt to do that in the three weeks leading up to the ground war.And so it complicates it, but it - I think it's - it isn't a surprise that unfortunately that at least some of them have died and it won't be the last one. I think what's more telling is where this one turned up and that's right next to a hospital that if anything if they're trying to keep these hostages, they should not have - that's probably where they have a command center, obviously.",

They want to minimize civilian casualties as they've attempted to do throughout. Just like they did before the invasion into northern Gaza, right, it took three weeks to try to get everybody out of there.So it's a good indicator that they're going to expand into that area next. And remember it's not all of southern Gaza, they're going to at least at this point but expanding into that, that's what it would indicate. BROWN: You talk about minimizing civilian deaths. The Palestinian ministry of health, which is Hamas-controlled, says that - I believe the last number was more than 11,000 civilians who have died so far in Gaza. A top EU diplomat has urged Israel not to be \"consumed by rage.\" Of course, we should note this all started with the October 7th attack by Hamas on Israel.

But by and large they're following those laws.If you look, Hamas is the one that isn't primarily, right, hiding in and amongst the population, putting them at grave risk.

They're going in there, conducting this operation in Gaza to eliminate the Hamas threat, right, distinction, right? They're trying to distinguish between combatants and noncombatants, which is hard to do when Hamas is hiding amongst them, but they're trying to displace the civilians and still trying to distinct them.Again, proportionality is where the debate is and no doubt people will come in after and try to do that. But that's a challenge, right? They're trying to minimize what type of munition, what they're doing.
