But you see it there on the screen, he's not happy about the cost of the cookies that he eats.Cookie Monster's gripe got the attention of the White House, which responded, quote, \"As it turns out, C is not just for cookie. It's also for consumers getting ripped off.\" Shrinkflation is just one of the pocketbook issues that could find its way into the State of the Union address on Thursday. Today, the White House is announcing a new strike force tasked with cracking down on price gouging and everything from groceries to prescription drugs is on the list. Arlette Saenz joins us now from the White House. Arlette, talk about this task force.",

President Biden actually just a short while ago tried to claim to reporters that he has been leading in the past five polls that have been released, saying that the news media doesn't pay attention to the polls where he's ahead.But if you take a look at our CNN average of the polls of polls, it's found that there's no clear leader in this race with 48 percent supporting Trump and 46 percent supporting Biden in a hypothetical head to head matchup. Now, the campaign has long said that it's still very early in this campaign to be fretting about polls, but there is anxiety amongst some Democrats about whether President Biden will be able to pull this off come November.",

I want to start, Anna, with you about the idea of what the White House, as we gear up for the State of the Union later this week, is clearly trying to focus on hit the areas where voters are feeling it the least -- when I say it, it's the economy getting better. I know you are working on a lot of congressional races, many of which are in, not just swing districts, but swing districts in swing states.

Particularly, when you see the kind of poll numbers that we've been seeing, not just now, but really since he's been president. And this disconnection between what the macroeconomic indicators say and how people are actually feeling.So, as the president who's overseeing the economy, not talking about it is nuts. And certainly he has a lot of really important accomplishments to talk about. But I would also just say is that if you look at the 2022 election and think about July when inflation was at its highest and gas prices were $5, $6 a gallon, it turned out that election wasn't about inflation. It turned out if you ask people why they voted Democratic, they voted Democratic because of abortion and because of democracy. And if you voted Republican, it was immigration and crime and also to some degree inflation. And so, I also think we should not overthink this, right? And really think about what are people actually voting on in 2020 to -- sorry, in 2024 going back in time -- what are they voting on in 2024? And is it actually going to be about the economy? Because it wasn't in 2022 and it wasn't in 2023 and it wasn't in New York three where Democrats just want a big win.",

Dodger Superstar, Steve Garvey, is looking to break through. The big question voters are deciding today is whether the general election will feature two Democrats or one. That's because California has a so-called jungle primary. Meaning, the top two candidates will advance to the general election in November, regardless of their party and with more than $71 million being spent on ads. The race is the most expensive political contest of the year besides the presidential election. Our Stephanie Elam is standing by in Santa Ana, California. Stephanie?",

And Adam Schiff, by far, has amassed the largest war chest to go about the battle of getting these ads out there and to win.He says he's still going to fight like he's the underdog. And just for comparison purposes, in 2018, for Senator Feinstein's re-election, that was a $4.2 million spend. And if you look at '22 and Senator Alex Padilla went back to get his first full term as senator from California, that cost just over $6 million. So you look at that over $71 million number and it's a massive number here. Also, what's interesting here is that you've got the fact that whoever those first two candidates are, they are the ones who are going to go ahead to head in November. So that's why today's election for Senate is so important. Will it be two dims against each other? Or will it be a Democrat versus a Republican taking a look at the baseball star Steve Garvey? That's what a lot of people are waiting to see if that will happen. But keep in mind, here in California, Democrats outnumber Republicans two to one. So it tends to be a blue state, so that's something that people are interested in. I should also note, Dana, that it's noteworthy with all that money being spent on ads, not $1 of that has been from an ad spent by Steve Garvey. Not one.",
