We heard from the Pentagon and the Pentagon is now warning of consequences if China goes ahead and provides lethal support to Russia and its ongoing war in Ukraine. Now China has pushed back multiple times on that allegation. But since the beginning of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, we've seen both sides edge ever closely together.

Now, we know of several Palestinians that were killed according to Palestinian authorities. Six of them have been claimed by militant groups, including from Hamas and Islamic Jihad saying two of their commanders were killed. But it's likely based off of the ages of at least three of the victims as well as eyewitnesses that some bystanders were killed as well. Some videos we're seeing which I should warn are graphic show what appears to be some men running away down the street before at least one of them is shot and falls down. CNN does not know the condition of the man and the Israeli military says they're looking into the incident to see what happened before the clip begins. Then there's the sheer number of injuries, more than 100, most of them from live ammunition, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, one of the most violent days in the West Bank in years. Now this is also likely the result of the time of this raid, middle of the day when the market in the Old City of Nablus are busy. And then just more people out in the street. We can see from the videos of the ensuing street clashes of young Palestinian throwing things at the Israeli military vehicles, just the number of people out there.
