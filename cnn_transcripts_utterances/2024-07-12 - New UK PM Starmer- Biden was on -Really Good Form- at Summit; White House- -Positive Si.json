Tech shares tumbling on Thursday as investors digesting the latest inflation report and U.S. futures right now more or less unchanged, but with a positive bias. Right, so the U.S. President says he's the best candidate to and best qualified together and his own party though remains divided and nothing Joe Biden said that his high profile news conference Thursday night appeared to change the calculus of his re-election campaign, that a growing number of Democrats believe he will lose to Donald Trump in November. Mr. Biden's every word is now being scrutinized since his debate debacle in Atlanta two weeks ago. And he made some notable verbal gas -- including mixing up the vice president and his Republican opponents. Listen in. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He gave a strong defense. He said, look, we went through all these different foreign policy issues at high speed. And he was on top of them. He got them he was there in the detail.

Donald Trump responded to all bands social media by saying, hey, you know, thank you, Victor. Yes, we need to end this war as soon as possible no more people need to die. So that's everything we kind of need to know president or maybe President Trump, again, if he gets re-elected as president.

It's pretty grim to watch, frankly, the municipal office in Gaza City has also said that it is trying to deliver water to the people who are still living in those areas. And obviously they are having great difficulty. The IDF says that look, they went into this area. The neighborhood they're referring to in particular is called Tel al-Hawa. And they said that they found a weapons production workshop, they found cash and their words terrorists that pose a threat were eliminated. Now, you mentioned the evacuation orders. They've been in effect since Sunday, affecting about a quarter of a million people. And there are still tens of thousands or so who are on the move right now. And yeah, you have people who, you know, complain about having to walk for very long periods of time to try to find any place that might be safe, and many of them have children as well. And obviously, food and water is not readily available. One woman who spoke to our CNN stringer on the ground said that her family slept outside for three days, without water. Others are simply exhausted from having to move all the time, from hunger, from thirst and with the indignity of all this. 176 year old man, who by the way, hasn't had any fresh food in six months said that he would rather die in his own home with some shred of dignity, then experience the indignities that may lie elsewhere in Gaza where obviously resources are quite scarce. Everyone is desperate for this war to end. But when we talk about a potential ceasefire agreement, it's not entirely clear how close we might be? Two sources told my colleague Alex Marquardt, that there was good progress in Doha made yesterday, but there were still tough issues to resolve. Now the negotiations move to Cairo. And we've just gotten some reporting earlier today from Reuters, as suggesting that the Israelis have discussed the possibility of withdrawing from the border between Gaza and Egypt, if there was some kind of electronic monitoring system in place to make sure that there weren't tunnels or smuggling taking place in that area. But the Israeli Prime Minister's Office, though, very quickly came out with a statement in response to that reporting and called it absolute fake news. The prime minister yesterday gave a speech he accused Hamas of making demands that contradict the plans on the table. But of course, he's been accused of moving the goalposts as well, even after a Hamas concession last weekend, forgoing their insistence that any ceasefire they agree to would be a permanent one. Now, President Biden was asked about this, as well at his lengthy press conference yesterday. And when it comes to the ceasefire talks, he said this, listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The question did it change any minds among anxious Democrats nervous about his decision to run for re- election. Talking to Democrats after the president's news conference, it is unclear that it did. But one thing was notable. The president spoke with far less defiance and combativeness about his decision to stay in. He said he needed to work to allay the concerns of Democratic voters. And he even said that he was open to his delegates supporting someone else should they choose to do that? But he said again and again, he wants to finish the job. He said he is not worried about his legacy, but he wants to continue working on the accomplishments of his first term. But did this change any minds there is reason to believe at least in the early hours after the news conference that it may not have. We're also learning that Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Former President Barack Obama are playing a role behind the scenes in the future of this democratic presidential campaign. We have learned that Obama and Pelosi have had conversations this week about where to take the party. Of course, many Democrats are asking them to step in to try and send some type of a signal to the White House. These Democrats, of course, are the ones that would like to see the president step aside. But the President for his part has many supporters as well, the Congressional Black Caucus, labor unions and other key pieces of his coalition. So as we end this historic week in Washington, the central question remains the same. Will President Biden keep running for the presidency now less than four months from Election Day? He says he will. But all eyes certainly on the White House today now that NATO Summit is over. Nancy Pelosi, of course said she wishes everyone would wait until that time.

This is a celebration of Indian culture of heritage of history. That wedding venue today is a recreation of a holy city in India. They're rebuilding a city on the Ganges as the wedding venue with hundreds of artisans and craftsmen and chefs who all are there to show their pride in India. But of course that's that.

So hopefully you can stay and hopefully from my perspective, England can win it. As you say it's going to be a massive day for football because we've got the Euro final England and Spain. We then have the final of Copa America which is between Argentina and Colombia. Argentina going through a third consecutive tournaments win. And we're showing you these two guys Lionel Messi, I'm sure you know. Lamine Yamal perhaps you don't but he is a rapidly up and coming superstar.
