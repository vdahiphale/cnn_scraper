With less than 48 hours before the Iowa caucuses, we're just getting highly anticipated final \"Des Moines Register\" poll. Any political junky knows how important this poll is. CNN's Jeff Zeleny is in Des Moines with the results of the poll known for its accuracy. Jeff, what do you have? Do we have the numbers yet?",

      "sentences": "We do, Jim, and every campaign is watching this \"Des Moines Register\" Iowa poll, which does have a historical pretty good average of showing what will happen on Monday night. It certainly shows the trajectory of campaigns. And there is news in this. Donald Trump is still leading this field quite dramatically at 48 percent in this poll, which is down slightly from last month. But second place now is Nikki Haley. She's vaulted over Florida governor Ron DeSantis who's at 16 percent in this poll.So, let's go through the numbers again. Donald Trump, 48; Nikki Haley, 20; and Ron DeSantis at 16 percent. So going into the final hours of this caucus campaign here, this is so important certainly for Haley because it shows that she has some movement here in Iowa, as well as, of course, as we've seen in New Hampshire. But Donald Trump still in overwhelming lead in this race, slightly below the 50 percent mark. He was at 51 percent just a month ago, but that's basically within the margin of error. So he leads dramatically. The question is, will all of these supporters be able to turn out Monday night? I've covered seven Iowa caucuses. I cannot recall one with this much uncertainty where weather is a wild card. Do these supporters who respond to polls actually make it to the caucuses? That's why I would add a bit of caution to these numbers, but that's where this race sits right now, Jim. ACOSTA: And, Jeff, as you know, as you've covered some of the Iowa caucuses, and I've covered some but not as many as you. Iowans are hardy folk. So they're going to get out there. Whether these numbers are suppressed somewhat, you're absolutely right. That could absolutely be the case. And I just want to have you walk us through this one more time, Jeff, because I -- forgive me, if I'm -- I don't want to over dramatize things or hype this or anything like that, but the fact Nikki Haley has surpassed Ron DeSantis, is that correct? Is that what we're hearing right now? The significance of that?",

And, Ron, you're hearing Jeff Zeleny read off these numbers, and we don't want to have this skate by too quickly. If we can show the viewers at home these numbers one more time. There you have Donald Trump at 48 percent, Nikki Haley at 20 percent. She has passed Ron DeSantis, according to this \"Des Moines Register\" poll. Ron DeSantis at 16 percent, Vivek Ramaswamy, not much of a factor here at 8 percent. But, Ron Brownstein, Donald Trump, I mean, there's also -- there's a story line about Nikki Haley versus Ron DeSantis and, of course, we can talk about that. But what Jeff Zeleny was talking about a few moments ago, this poll showing Donald Trump so far ahead, a former president now leading the Republican Party with all the legal questions hanging over him being cast as a threat to democracy by the sitting president, Joe Biden who defeated him, this is a significant poll. And if Donald Trump can replicate this on Monday, that is a significant moment because it is really going to make him by and large the front-runner in this field and somebody who is on his way to perhaps crushing the competition and getting to the nomination.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, you know, Jim, like Haley and DeSantis themselves, you can lose track of the big picture here by focusing solely on their competition for what will be a very distant second place. I mean, if Haley does come in second ahead of DeSantis, his campaign would really have no rationale for continuing, given how much he's invested in Iowa.It's not clear to me even with this lead in the poll, that she will do so because she's drawing on the voters or the most alienated from the Trump era Republican Party, and they may be the least likely to show up, you know, on very difficult conditions. But the larger point is that neither of them have really found -- had they been unable or unwilling to make an argument that makes them a serious threat to Trump. I mean, that is -- that is the big point here, that what they're doing is not working. I mean, if you look at where they are spending their money on television, I believe the two of them are now approaching $40 million in negative ads against each other compared to $1 million in ads against Trump. And you have Haley somewhat dialed up her criticism of Trump at the CNN debate a couple nights ago but has reverted back to her very valued judgment-freeway of talking about him. Chaos follows him rightly or wrongly. This would be a good result for her. It would show that she has filled the space DeSantis left open by trying to run to Trump's right. But ultimately I think as you are suggesting, it suggests -- it says to her as clearly as to DeSantis that if they are going to make this a race, they have to put forward a more persuasive and probably more pointed case against the front- runner than they're willing to risk so far.",

They are splitting the vote.But, Jim, as we take a deeper look into these numbers here, also some interesting findings here, 68 percent of respondents of this poll say their minds are made up, 25 percent say they can still be persuaded. And this really reflects our conversations with voters on the ground here in Iowa. They are trying to make up their minds. If they're not with the former president and they're considering Haley or DeSantis, they are really trying to weigh this. I ran into several voters on Friday who attended -- on Thursday, excuse me, who attended both events, Haley and DeSantis, who are trying to weigh their options. What this poll can do is show that Haley has a bit of juice here and that sometimes affects people's minds. But one other number from this poll, Jim, that we are just defining, we're reading it along with everyone else here, 82 percent of Trump supporters are locked in. They say their minds are made up. Only 64 percent of DeSantis supporters and 63 percent of Haley supporters say they are locked in. What that speaks to is commitment, enthusiasm, energy. All of those things are three essential ingredients to the turnout and organization for the Monday night showing here particularly with the weather. So, those numbers certainly important, Jim.",

Jeff Zeleny, before we go to break, she has said just in recent days if I'm not mistaken, she's just not going to do that. She has said along the lines of people have said I could attack him a whole lot more than I am right now, I'm just not going to do that.",

She sharpened a tone a little bit, but certainly not to the degree of Chris Christie or other things. But, Jim, one more number from this poll as we've been reading this alongside you here this evening. The extremely enthusiastic support is a very interesting finding.Forty-nine percent of Trump supporters say they're extremely enthusiastic, 23 percent of DeSantis supporters they are extremely enthusiastic. Only 9 percent of Haley supporters say they are extremely enthusiastic. So, those -- you know, perhaps get to the center of who is going to get in their car on Monday night and find their caucus location, scrape off the windshield and drive there. So, without a doubt the bottom line in all this Trump still has the commanding lead in this race without question. He's dipped slightly below 50 but that's within the margin. But Haley is clearly in the hunt for second place. What this does not guarantee is organization, and DeSantis still has an edge on that. So, this certainly informs our thinking but Monday is still important for the race for second place. But the race for the first one is Trump's clearly to lose right now, and it doesn't seem like he's going to -- Jim.",

I mean, we'll see happens on Monday, obviously, but he sort of gone wire to wire here as the leader.I mean, obviously, Haley's movement across the course of the primary is probably the most interesting story line. And I think, you know, DeSantis has essentially said numerous times that he expects to win in Iowa, that he sort of has to win Iowa. So, you know, for him this is -- really feel like Monday is a do or die moment. It's just hard to see another path for him. Haley obviously has a convincing case about her standing in New Hampshire, and then we go to her home state of South Carolina. Obviously, Trump heavily favored there, too, but, you know, she can make a case having been the governor of South Carolina. Hard to see a path for DeSantis.

If you're going to raise your hand and say you're still going to support you're running against even if he's convicted of a felony for trying to overthrow the government.
