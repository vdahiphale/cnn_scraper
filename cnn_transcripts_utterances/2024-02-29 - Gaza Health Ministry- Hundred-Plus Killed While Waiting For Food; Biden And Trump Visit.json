The markets are not moving in any great direction, in any great importance, so we'll pull them to one side, because we've got two big stories over the course of the hour that we will show you. A desperate struggle for food that's turned ugly. The Gaza Ministry of Health says more than a hundred people have been killed. The chaos after Israeli forces opened fire on a crowd waiting for food. And current President Biden and former President Trump are both at the US- Mexico border over the course of the hour, where immigration is the central issue in the race for the White House. We will be with them both as and when they speak publicly. We are live in New York. It is Thursday, February 29th. Leap Day, I'll be leaping all over. I'm Richard Quest, and of course, on a Leap Day as elsewhere, I mean business. A very good day to you. An extremely busy hour. We're probably going to go backwards and forwards between the two big stories that we are following, so I'll set them out and you'll know where we're going. But don't be surprised if we suddenly take a quick turn in a different direction. For instance, two presidents visiting two flashpoints on the southern US border in its crisis in Texas. President Biden is in Brownsville whilst hundreds of kilometers away, the former President Donald Trump, is at Eagle Pass. You can see them both on the map and both men are promising voters that they will crack down on illegal border crossings, which is a major election issue. They are both due to speak over the course of the hour. When we see it happen, we'll bring it to you. We just want you to know that this is going on whilst we deal with our other top story of the day, the tragic events that have taken place in Gaza. Now, there is anger and uncertainty following Israeli forces opening fire at a food distribution site and aid site in Gaza City. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza, more than a hundred people were killed. CNN is unable to independently confirm that number. The Israeli military and eyewitnesses are giving contradictory accounts of what happens, but there does seem to be one point of agreement, an Israeli official has said to CNN, their troops did use live fire on people near in a truck after the soldiers felt threatened by the crowd. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REAR ADM. DANIEL HAGARI, ISRAEL'S CHIEF MILITARY SPOKESPERSON:   The tanks that were there to secure the convoy sees the Gazans being trampled and cautiously tries to disperse the mob with a few warning shots. When the hundreds became thousands and things got out of hand, the tank commander decided to retreat to avoid harm to the thousands of Gazans that were there. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, we thought that today was going to be marked,in particular by the fact that we have now hit 30,000 people having been killed in Gaza since the beginning of this war, but perhaps it will be this incident that will be remembered in the course of this war, and that is because we are seeing quite a bit of international reaction, including from the United States, talking about the severity of this incident, urging the Israeli military to investigate this incident. And just because it is one of the deadliest single incidents that we have seen when you talk about a hundred-plus people who were killed in this one incident, 700-plus who were injured, this is quite a moment. And it is also a moment not only because of the number of casualties, but because of what it says about the state of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and in northern Gaza, in particular, and that's because, you know, as you said, if you -- even if you take out the Israeli gunfire in this situation, which people on the ground, say actually caused this stampede, caused the drivers of these trucks to run over so many people as they fled for their lives, even when you take all of that away, what you are left with is hundreds of people swarming these aid trucks climbing on top of them to grab what they could because of the desperate situation in which they find themselves. For weeks now, we've been reporting on the fact that in Northern Gaza, people are surviving by eating animal feed, they are surviving by eating leaves or soupy mixtures made with dirty water that are served at soup kitchens. And there's no question that there are high numbers of people in Northern Gaza who are skipping meals regularly. And now the World Food Programme is saying that more than half a million people are effectively on the brink of a full-blown famine inside of Gaza. That's because so little aid has been able to get into Northern Gaza.",

The media here simply does not cover it in the same way as we might on CNN. And you know, today is a perfect example. We were watching the Israeli evening news and it was only at the end of a day of story that there were you know, a few seconds dedicated to the situation with his aid convoy. We should also note that there have been dozens of Israelis protesting at the Kerem Shalom border crossing between Israel and Gaza for weeks now at times successfully preventing aid trucks from getting into Gaza, because they believe that these aid trucks are ultimately going straight to Hamas and they want to put pressure on Gaza's civilian and Hamas' population to release the hostages. So there is certainly still overwhelming support for this war where there has been some debate is over exactly how to proceed in these negotiations, how much to prioritize destroying Hamas, versus how much to prioritize securing a ceasefire to release the hostages.",

And as the president will tell it, that was at the urging of former President Donald Trump. Donald Trump, who has made clear that he doesn't want Republican to essentially hand President Biden and Democrats a so- called win when it comes to the border. So the sort of inaction and the lack of action from Republicans is really the frame that we are hearing President Biden and Democrats really lean into, and certainly something that we are expected to hear from President Biden when he speaks this afternoon in Brownsville. He is there, of course, to meet with law enforcement, to meet with local officials and Border Patrol agents and try to get a better sense of the situation down there. But you're right, that all of this is very much politics, and the fact that we have both of these dueling visits taking place at the same time is a pretty remarkable scene that we're about to see play out here, and a markedly different position that the president actually finds himself in now. You know, in the past, he had been so much on the defense and when we talk to White House officials and campaign officials, they say they very much see this as a rare opportunity and a rare opening to go on the offense against Republicans on this issue.",

These are, let me tell you, what we're looking at. These are Donald Trump's -- he is in a tent where he is being briefed by the Texas National Guard. He is then going to walk along the border fence. Oh, and there's Governor Abbott who you can see next to him in the chair. So he is getting a full border briefing before they'll go outside and look at the border. So what's -- I mean, he was president and things weren't that brilliant then at the border.

And if you look at polling, that is also what people believe. First of all, the recent polling numbers coming out of Gallup show that immigration is the number one issue for American voters. The other part of this is if you look at who handles immigration better, in almost every single poll, Donald Trump is believed to have done so. This has been an issue that he has been hammering home since 2015 using divisive, often racist, and fear-stoking rhetoric, to encourage people to vote for him saying that he's the only one that can protect them and people believe that messaging, Richard. Despite what you say, it is true. The fact that he didn't finish the wall, the fact that Mexico didn't pay for it, all of that is true. However, Donald Trump has projected that he is better at fixing immigration than Joe Biden. That's why when you hear MJ talking about, they have spent so much time, Biden's administration on the defense, this is the first time we're really seeing them use and think on the offense and going after Donald Trump.",

This is what he cares about is perception and messaging, and this is a perfect made for television place to be. Remember, Eagle Pass is not a place where most of the migrants are crossing, it is the political epicenter of this feud between Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who is with him as you said, who has also endorsed him and the Biden administration over who controls border security.

He believes immigrants help lower inflation with their modest consumption habits. We learned this from Gary Tuchman last year. Do you remember?

It's not -- the situation on the ground is not secure enough. There's constant fighting. The roads are bombed. Because of the fighting between Israel and Hamas, and so that aid can't get where it needs to be. So that needs to be fixed in an immediate term. And then for longer term to really get the amount of aid in that is needed you really do well have to have a pause in the fighting and it does seem like that that really is in the works.

I know from my conversations with Trump senioradvisers, they do expect him to walk through what he believes were, you know, good points that he did or good policies he had while he was in office and compare that with Biden's record. But you're also going to hear him highlight what they call impact stories. And that's how the Trump campaign is framing this. They want to share stories of migrants who have crossed the border then committed alleged crimes here in the United States. You're going to hear him walk through a series of those, similar to what we've heard from him on the campaign trail. But I think the big picture here, and just to take a step back, Richard, is it the politics of all this. There's a reason Donald Trump is at the border and that's because he sees immigration and specifically the border as Biden's most vulnerable issue heading into November. And so he's going to play on a lot of the fears that some Americans have about people crossing the border and try to really use the same type of fearmongering he used to propel them into the White House back in 2016.",

He does not go into exactly what you mentioned, which is the importance of legal immigration, of having immigrants in this country, and of course getting into h1b visas and all of that. I won't get into the wonkiness of it, but he's focusing on the rhetoric that he knows energizes Americans and mainly actually angers them.
