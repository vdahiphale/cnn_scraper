Charges relating to the theft of more than $4.5 million that he allegedly stole from his boss, his friend Shohei Ohtani, the massively, popular face of baseball right now.The story emerged when investigators noticed Ohtani's name on wire transfers to a bookie in Orange County, California. Now, Ippei Mizuhara, the interpreter, came out and said, Ohtani lent me the money to pay off my own gambling debts. Ohtani's people came out and said, no way. This money was stolen and they say they handed it over to the authorities. Now, we are told, as I say, that this interpreter is negotiating a plea deal. I spoke to his lawyer. He said no comment at this time. Now, this raised eyebrows, obviously, because anything to do with gambling in sport is a problem. And also, this bookie had been going around telling people that Ohtani was his client. That bookie's lawyer told me that was just a marketing ploy. He never had any contact with Ohtani at all. But there were also questions as to how would this interpreter have actually managed to take this money without Ohtani knowing? Well, according to those sources who spoke to 'The New York Times\", Mizuhara changed the settings on Ohtani's bank account so he didn't get alert when money came out of his account. Now, Ohtani himself, he came out and gave a very strident press conference a couple of weeks ago in which he called his former friend a gambler, a thief, and a liar. And now, with this report of this alleged negotiation, it does seem that this cloud has moved completely away from Ohtani. In the meantime, Jim, he's been doing what he does best. Playing very, very well at baseball. So, it doesn't seem to have gotten inside his head. He has had a great start to his career at the Dodgers here in Los Angeles, which is good. I mean, $700 million they're paying him. And I will note that I was at his first game of the league season here at Dodger Stadium, the fans of the Dodgers never doubted him one bit. Jim.",
