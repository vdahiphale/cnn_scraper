Van Gogh`s \"The Starry Night,\" Vermeer`s \"Girl with a Pearl Earring,\" Botticelli`s \"The birth of Venus,\" or Da Vinci`s \"Mona Lisa.\" Mona Lisa, ding, ding, an Italian handyman stolen from the French Museum in 1911. Newspapers around the world published pictures of it and a two-year police hunt for the now famous painting ensued. Question for you, what`s more important art or the right to eat healthy, sustainable food? That`s a question environmental activists in Paris posed after they threw pumpkin soup at the Mona Lisa, one of the most famous paintings in the world. Here`s CNN`s Michael Holmes with more details on what happened at the Louvre Museum and the methods some folks used to bring attention to a cause. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over): The crowd gasps as two activists throw soup at one of the most famous works of art in the world. But it would be the Mona Lisa, painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 16th Century, who would have the last laugh. Her mysterious untouched by the stunt --",

      "sentences": "It`s disgusting to treat art that`s really valuable for the history of humankind that way.HOLMES (voice-over): Museums around the world are on guard after a series of similar attacks on famous works of art, whether its throwing soup at a Van Gogh; smearing paint on the casing of the Degas sculpture; or hurling oil at a painting by Gustav Klimt. It`s all for shock value: a tactic used by climate or anti-oil groups to get attention. But to many people, it`s a baffling, if not infuriating disruption. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): I really don`t see the link. I`m not shocked for the Mona Lisa. I`m not worried for her, because she`s ultra-protected. But then I don`t see the link with food, other than the fact that the Mona Lisa is internationally recognized. So we`ll definitely hear about this. HOLMES (voice-over): The Mona Lisa has survived the centuries. It`s been stolen, attacked with acid, had objects thrown at it. So a dowsing of soup and a canned message by activists only puts the spotlight back on it. A masterclass in capturing the public`s attention, something with which no gimmick or cheap trick can compare. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
