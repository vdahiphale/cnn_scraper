Of course, it is U.S. officials however that really secured the deal that did all of the behind the scenes negotiations over the course of the last many months to try to make this come to fruition. We should know that this was not the outcome of that U.S. officials went into those conversations with Russia aiming to achieve. They wanted to get both Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner home. We reported over the summer that they actually put a proposal on the table with the Russians that included both of those Americans in exchange for a deal that included Viktor Bout, who, of course, was released today. But it's clear that the Russians are treating Paul Whelan differently. You can sense that because President Biden said today very clearly, this was not a choice that the Biden administration had. They really only had an option to do this, you know, one for one swap that came to fruition today. Now the question will be, what can the United States do to secure Paul Whelan's release? They are celebrating Britney Griner's return here. But Viktor Bout was really the person that the Russians wanted released. And we heard today from David Whelan, Paul Whelan's brother, saying that this was the right choice for the administration to make, to secure the release of Britney Griner.

You know, first and foremost, he was celebrating this, a victory, finally getting Brittney Griner out of Russia. He said she should be home within the next 24 hours. But yes, a big part of the speech was also addressing the issue of Paul Whelan and making clear that he is still top of mind for him. But the U.S. will continue to try to do everything it can to get him out. At one point he said, we have not forgotten about Paul Whelan. But I think this sort of goes to the very, very complicated dynamics at play now as the U.S. tries to secure Paul Whelan's release as well. You know, what we know is that, in recent weeks, the Russians had made clear to the West that Paul Whelan was not going to be an acceptable part of this deal, that really Brittney Griner was the only person that could be a part of the deal. We're told that in recent days President Biden himself personally signed off to accept this deal but that that was a very difficult decision for the president and a difficult decision for him to accept, even as he ultimately knew that this was the right thing to do. You know, the White House has gotten so much pressure in recent months to get a deal, to get Brittney Griner out of Russia. And now that that has happened, you can certainly expect that pressure is going to ramp up more and focus on Paul Whelan, because he is now the person who has been left behind. Administration officials are trying to explain this morning why they felt like they simply did not have a choice but to accept the only deal that the Russians were simply putting on the table.",

As we understood it, over the last few months, there remain channels of communication open between U.S. and Russian officials but Russians made this difficult with this frustrating series of conversations. It became evident more recently that the U.S. felt that Russia was willing to move forward with this one-for-one.

The merchant of death, the phraseyou used there, was the title of a book detailing extensively of his arms dealing around Africa and other conflicts in the '90s and early 2000s. He also often was associated with a film starring Nicolas Cage called, \"Lord of War,\" a fictitious adaptation of that book, \"The Merchant of Death,\" showing a man trafficking arms around the world. That added to his sense of notoriety. This was a man who made it clear he was not guilty of the arms and trafficking he was not accused of, although there were multiple U.N. investigations and analysts who brought forward what they said was evidence that he was. I have seen home videos of him at various conflict areas in Africa. He always said, I'm just a tradesmen, I'm just a pilot, I'm just moving materiel around war zones. I'm not  the arms dealer people make me out to be. At the same time, you know, you have to try and reconcile his claims of being essentially a nobody pilot to the outsize importance that he had for Russia, the effort they put to stop him being extradited from Bangkok to the United States after a sting operation by U.S. agents, who were posing as Colombian terrorists and got him to agree on camera, it seems, secret camera to sell them weaponry, which could have been used to kill Americans. That extradition lied to him having the lengthy sentence in the States. Even now, they continue to diplomacy to get him back at a time when relations between Moscow and Washington are at the worst they have been, potentially, you could say, for decades. A man of massive importance. Some might say he has gained this notoriety and outsized relevance to Russia's intelligence and defense community and perhaps now at this time it's an important moment for Vladimir Putin to show to those people he is relying upon in the war in Ukraine that they are genuinely not left behind, that Russia will do anything it can to get its important figures like Viktor Bout back as well. But there is the outstanding theory that, in his past, Viktor Bout knew people who were close to Vladimir Putin when they all served together in various conflict zones, potentially in Africa, also something he denies as well. A man whose past has never really been clearly elucidated but it is of massive value to Moscow, a value which the Biden administration was able to use to get back Ms. Griner, a woman of enormous importance to many in the United States.",

Yes, it is this outsized difference between that which Ms. Griner was accused of, carrying an incredibly small amount of cannabis oil, a wrongdoing, I think is the phrase the Biden administration used to describe it, which still left an often very intolerant justice system of Russia, where convictions are almost guaranteed to some degree. They left her in a penal colony in Mordovia, versus Viktor Bout, who was accused of a career history of staggering arms dealing in multiple conflicts, all of which he denied, that led him through a lawful process of extradition to be tried in the United States and that held a U.S. jail facility which, in some emails I exchanged with him, he was not actually finding that uncomfortable. So a remarkable disparity between the crimes he was accused of, how he was treated by the United States and the crimes accused -- that Ms. Griner was accused of and how she ended up in a penal colony in Mordovia of stark conditions.",

So obviously the next batch that we are going to see will be of the reasons why they decided that they actually could not function and feel safe in the royal family, living in Britain. So in all likelihood, that's where the revelations will be concentrated. But it is a striking, intimate portrayal. We've never had this type of access to figures in the royal family before. There is a scene where Meghan is in a turban, in a bathrobe, in a bathroom, with no makeup on, clearly very emotional and upset. Prince Harry talks about his concerns dating and why it was difficult for him. They talk about their first kiss, their first date, staying in a tent together. It's really an unusual amount of insight. In terms of the bombshells or revelations, there is definitely targeted criticism of the British media in particular and the royal correspondents. They argue they're an extension of the PR arm of the palace, which, working alongside Max Foster and others, I can tell you it's not the case from my experience. That is something which has been picked up on. But I would say, overall, it is what you could have expected. It is a very well produced Netflix documentary.

His was -- he denies this -- but he is believed to be an arms dealer, one of the biggest in the world, selling arms to terrorist organizations, et cetera. He was also believed -- and he denies this -- that he was somehow connected to intelligence and security services in Russia.

It's a little more complicated than that but the long story short is that facing yet another impeachment vote, it was the third time in less than two years that Castillo was facing an impeachment vote in Congress. He decided to throw the dice. When he saw that nobody was following him, it was pretty clear that this action did not pay out. He is being presented in front of a judge at this very hour to hear the charges. Yesterday the attorney general of Peru presented in a statement that he would be charged with rebellion, among all of their charges. This brings to an end a little bit over 18 months of really chaotic presidency. Castillo lasted 18 months, he had to go through five different government cabinet reshuffles. He had myriad investigations looking at himself personally and members of his family. I was reading a column on Peruvian press this morning with an op-ed, saying that the former president just had enough of the scrutiny and was trying to do this botched coup (ph), tried to dismiss congress, which is something we might have seen working 10, 20, 30 years ago in Latin America. But not this time.",

The man was reportedly convicted of waging war against God and hanged on Thursday morning. The Taliban have conducted their first public execution since taking over in Afghanistan last year. The group says it was against a man charged with murdering another man and then stealing his cell phone and bike. Executions and other violent punishments were common when the Taliban was last in power from 1996 to 2001. More than 1,000 employees of \"The New York Times\" are staging a historic 24 hour strike. This comes after \"Times\" management and the union representing journalists failed to reach a deal for higher wages. The newspaper says it will rely on its non-unionized international staffers to fill the void. The world's largest active volcano has been spewing fountains of lava high into the air. The eruption is creating major concerns on the Big Island. Lava from Mauna Loa is inching toward a road connecting the east and west side of the island. That's not stopping curious people from getting up close and personal. David Culver is in Hawaii. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID CULVER, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Seemingly photogenic from every angle, there is a striking beauty to Mauna Loa's eruption, especially as captured by photographer C.J. Kale. C.J. KALE, PHOTOGRAPHER:  Volcanoes are different every single day, every single time you go. It's always different. CULVER (voice-over):  C.J. is driving us to his picture perfect spot at 4:00 in the morning. The best view, he believes, the rising sun greeting the glowing lava.
