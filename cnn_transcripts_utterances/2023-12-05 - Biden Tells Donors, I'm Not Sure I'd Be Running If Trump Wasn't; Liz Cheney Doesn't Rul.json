She's now 78 and celebrating this milestone and she turns 79 next week. A nice early happy birthday to her.

Tonight, what you might call the law of political physics, every action has its equal opposite reaction. President Joe Biden has now essentially confirmed that he's running for one reason or rather because of one man and one man only, Donald Trump. Those remarks came at an off-camera fundraiser in Boston, and they are jaw-dropping if only for their clarity and their simplicity. If Trump wasn't running, he says, I'm not sure I'd be running, but we can't let him win. The Biden campaign was caught off guard, according to sources. Yikes was how one top campaign adviser reacted when he learned what Biden had said. Now, the remarks are sure to create some headaches in the days ahead and to renew some conversations that are ongoing about President Biden's age. Moments ago, Trump himself tried to turn Biden's admission to his own advantage.

Obviously, there are Israelis who were victims of what happened October 7th, who might be in disagreement with what Netanyahu and the IDF are doing. That doesn't make them any less victims of October 7th. And, you know, when Madeleine Albright, the Secretary of State, you know, really put rape as a weapon of war on the map during the wars in Yugoslavia and Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, there really wasn't a pushback about well does that mean that you are there for taking the side of this faction in the war or that faction of the war. But because there is unfortunately a lot of animus towards Israel, this does come up unfortunately. I would also like to point out and there is a lot of criticism coming from the U.S. obviously about how Israel is waging this war. One of the main reasons that there are so many civilian deaths, I mean, there is a lot to criticize about the IDF, as I said, but one of the main reasons is Hamas hides within the civilian population of Gaza.
