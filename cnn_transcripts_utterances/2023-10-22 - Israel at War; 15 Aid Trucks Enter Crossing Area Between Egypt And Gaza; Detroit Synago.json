We want to welcome our viewers here in the United States and around the world. We begin with our special coverage with the quickly escalating developments in both Israel and Gaza. And warning: some of what you're about to see is graphic. Israel Defense Forces now confirm that their groups clashed with Hamas fighters inside Gaza today, marking just the second time Israeli forces have admitted to operating in the enclave since the Hamas terror attack took place some two weeks ago. It is yet another bloody day in central Gaza where a new barrage of Israeli air strikes hit targets overnight. Israel also launched -- launching a rare aerial attack at a mosque in the West Bank. The IDF says it thwarted an imminent terror attack from inside the mosque. But the Palestinian Authority calls it a dangerous escalation. The IDF is vowing to increase its aerial bombardment of Gaza just ahead of a potential ground incursion by Israel against Hamas in Gaza. This is the grim reality for so many in the Gaza Strip. These are the lifeless bodies of a toddler and three children killed in overnight strikes -- air strikes. Their parents have written the children's names on their legs to identify them. With the bloodshed and humanitarian crisis right now clearly growing, much more needed relief appears to be on its way into Southern Gaza. 15 aid trucks from Egypt are being inspected right now in the Rafah border crossing area just one day after the first convoy of about 20 trucks was allowed into Gaza. For more on all the late breaking developments in the Middle East, I want to go to CNN's Matthew Chance. He's joining us live from northern Israel. Matthey we're learning of a clash today first of all between Israeli and Hamas forces inside Gaza. What appears to be one of the first skirmishes on the ground between the two sides since the war broke out some two weeks ago. So what are you hearing? What's the latest?",

I mean this isn't necessarily the start of the much-anticipated ground invasion of the Gaza Strip by Israeli forces where tens of thousands of troops have gathered near the frontier with Gaza in preparation for that.But clearly, Israel has been conducting sort of, you know -- pinpoint operations into the Gaza Strip to try and collect evidence of the whereabouts for instance of the 200 or more hostages believed to still be held by Hamas inside Gaza. And this was I think the first time we've heard about there was an actual confrontation on the ground between Hamas fighters in Gaza and Israeli forces going in. The Israeli military say at least one soldier was killed and a few others injured as well in that confrontation. But it just gives you a small indication of how difficult it is going to be and how bloody it's going to be as well if and when that ground invasion takes place. Gaza is an extraordinarily difficult place to rein -- to occupy. It's got narrow streets. It's got, you know, flattened concrete buildings everywhere to provide all sorts of cover for snipers. Don't forget the network of tunnels that runs underneath it as well which Hamas and other militant groups know very well, and of course, dug themselves for their use. That poses a massive threat to Israeli forces. And what we've seen today is a very early indication of that, Wolf.",

Hezbollah, of course, the Iranian-backed militia inside southern Lebanon.Hundreds of thousands of Israelis have essentially been displaced from their homes because of the threat of Hezbollah attack. That threat, according to the IDF, has been growing over the past week or so with more rocket attacks aimed at the Israeli border and cross border attacks, drones flying in the skies above Kiryat Shmona, even penetrations by militants from inside Lebanon, either Hezbollah or Palestinian militia factions coming across the border and carrying out attacks inside Israel as well. They've been responded to, of course, by the Israeli Defense Forces but what Israelis say -- what Israeli government says is that their patience won't last forever. And if there is, you know, sufficient escalation on the part of the Lebanese side, on the part of Hezbollah, they will strike back in force.

He just said he's speaking with the Israelis and we heard from Secretary of State Antony Blinken earlier today who essentially said that is a decision that Israel has to make.The U.S. certainly doesn't want to be seen telling Israel what to do. But Wolf, what I've been told by two different sources is that the Biden administration has been pressing the Israelis to allow for a bit more time to allow for progress on both the hostages and on the humanitarian aid to get into Gaza. We have seen today aid successfully getting into Gaza. We've also seen on Friday those two American hostages who were released. There's still some 200 hostages that the U.S. and many other countries desperately want to get out that Qatar is working on with Hamas to try to negotiate their release. So these sources are telling me that the Biden administration would like more time before Israel launches that ground invasion into Gaza. Now, the Israelis are saying that the Biden administration is not pressing for that. But it is clear, as Priscilla was just mentioning that while the U.S. is showing ore really speaking to their full- throated support for Israel, both militarily and politically, there are major concerns about that aid for Gazans and about getting those hostages out, Wolf.",

Wolf, we've seen a series of attacks against U.S. forces, against U.S. interests over the past week in Iraq and elsewhere. As recently as Friday, we saw a rocket attack near Baghdad airport that was targeting a U.S. diplomatic facility. So now the State Department is telling Americans not to go. They are announcing that non-essential personnel, family members can leave Baghdad. Iraq is home to a number of proxy groups that are backed by Iran.

He was in Afghanistan.And so that this does is tell Americans around the world to be on alert. And Wolf what I really It speaks to is a lot more anger that is being directed these days at the American government and as a result at American citizens because of the support for Israel. Since the horrific attacks by Hamas on October 7th, the U.S. has said that they will stand, of course, with Israel. And now we're hearing about billions of dollars in aid that the Biden administration is asking for to give Israel more military aid. And that has resulted in a real spike in anger against the U.S. and against its citizens.

The war we're in is not a war with the Palestinian people. It's a war with Hamas. Israel is in a war with Hamas who did and started this and that's what we're focused on. But to be clear, it's imperative that we provide the ability for those suffering, those Palestinians who are down south and in Gaza get the ability to be able to live as well as they can under the circumstances.

It's about the destruction of the state of Israel. And as President Biden have said and the vice president have said, we stand by Israel to help eliminate that threat to Israel. What comes next will take a lot of work among our allies, among the Gulf countries to try to figure out how that is going to sustain. I think you know, I think the president has articulated this. I don't think anyone believes that Israel will occupy Gaza. But they're going to have to try to figure this out. And it's clearly not something that there's a game plan for this. As you know, President Abbas in the West Bank, he hates Hamas. So the combination of this complication is -- first things first.

Those candidates will try to make their pitch to conference. They'll answer questions from their members. They'll do that one by one, and we'll see how that ultimately goes.And Tuesday morning is the significant vote. Behind closed doors, Republicans will have a secret ballot leadership election. That means a majority of their conference will vote to nominate the next speaker candidate. That person -- it will be a secret ballot election. It's unclear exactly who's the front-runner and who might emerge here, but we'll see how close that person who gets the nomination is to the magic number on the House floor, 217 votes to be elected speaker. This is challenging for any Republican candidate because in the nearly divided house, with only 221 Republicans, Democrats are going to vote for Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader, that means that person, the candidate, the Republican nominee must limit defections in the ranks. And it's unclear if any of them will be able to do that after we've seen Republicans going after each other after McCarthy was pushed out, unable to get behind anyone, unable to do the nation's business, and much business is waiting given aid to Israel, calls for aid to Ukraine, avoiding a government shutdown by mid-November. None of it can be dealt with. The Republican agenda is completely stalled amid this GOP leadership infighting. Can they get it resolved this coming week? That remains a huge question, but a possibility it could still be unresolved and slip into another week if they can't get their act together behind a nominee. Manu Raju, Capitol Hill.

Here is what she told Jake Tapper when asked what a second Donald Trump term would look like. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LIZ CHENEY (R-WY), FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE: He cannot be the next president, because if he is, all of the things that he attempted to do but was stopped from doing by responsible people around him at the Department of Justice, at the White House counsel's office, all of those things he will do. There will be no guardrails, and everyone has been warned. I think Donald Trump is the single most dangerous threat we face. I imagine there will be a number of other candidates in the race.",

This is going to be almost an impossible order for he Israeli troops to succeed in carrying out.Beyond that, there will be a lot of civilian casualties. The infrastructure will take a beating. We've seen this in previous urban battles in Fallujah in 2004 and Mosul in 2017. And so, this is an exceedingly tough mission. I'm afraid that the Israeli government has given its defense forces a mission that they can't succeed in carrying out. At least to the full benefit of what the Israeli government wants, which is the destruction of Hamas and its military capabilities.
