The special counsel did not recommend criminal charges, which is a win, of course, for the president, but the prosecutor said that was partly because a jury could potentially see him as a, quote, well- meaning, elderly man with a poor memory, and that assessment will likely cause some political damage. In a hastily called news conference, President Biden insisted his memory is fine, and angrily pushed back on part of the report that said he had trouble remembering when his son, Beau, had died. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN: In addition, I know there's some attention paid to some language in the report about my recollection of events. There's even reference that I don't remember when my son died. How in the hell dare he raise that? Frankly, when I was asked the question, I thought to myself, it wasn't any of their damn business.

And Robert Hur found that he shared some of that information with a ghostwriter for his memoir that was published that year.

The report notes that in an interview last October with investigators, the president couldn't remember key things, such as when his vice presidency ended and when his son Beau died. The special counsel noted key differences between how President Biden dealt with this investigation and how Donald Trump handled the investigation of classified documents that were found at his Florida home. Biden cooperated with investigators, and he invited the FBI to come and search his homes and office. Trump not only refused to comply with a subpoena to return documents, but he also allegedly obstructed the investigation by trying to hide documents from the FBI and telling witnesses to lie.

The official ruling is likely weeks away, but based on their questioning, the justices seem inclined to overturn the Colorado Supreme Court's decision to disqualify Trump from running for office due to his role in the insurrection, despite spending very little time analyzing Trump's actions on January 6th. CNN's Paula Reid explains.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In one of the most anticipated Supreme Court cases of the year, the justices signaling they will side with Donald Trump on the question of whether he's eligible for the 2024 ballot. The former president did not attend Thursday's arguments. Most justices didn't address his role in the January 6th insurrection, instead focusing on legal arguments around the 14th Amendment. Trump's lawyer, Jonathan Mitchell, an experienced Supreme Court advocate, argued Trump isn't covered by the so-called insurrectionist ban. JONATHAN MITCHELL, TRUMP'S LAWYER: A ruling from this court that affirms the decision below would not only violate term limits, but take away the votes of potentially tens of millions of Americans. REID (voice-over): And argued January 6th was not even an insurrection. Only one justice asked about whether it was.

CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS, U.S. SUPREME COURT: That seems to be a position that is at war with the whole thrust of the 14th Amendment and very ahistorical.

They had gone into the state's caucuses in a very strong position. He was really the only player in Nevada, and that's because Nikki Haley, his one remaining rival, was not on the ballot. She instead participated in the state's primary earlier in the week, but still a great opportunity for Donald Trump to tout his victory and also try to use some of his more general election rhetoric. Now, his win in Nevada really capped off a great day for the former president. One, his campaign advisers argued is his best day of the year so far. We saw earlier on Thursday the Supreme Court make arguments that seemed that they were likely to side with Donald Trump's lawyers in the case regarding whether he is allowed to remain on Colorado's presidential ballot. It also comes after special counsel Robert Hur released a report on President Joe Biden saying that he had willfully retained classified documents and mishandled those documents. Donald Trump notably did not bring up that report during his remarks on Thursday, but something that he had really talked about all day leading up to his appearance in Nevada. And then, of course, the big win on Thursday, both in Nevada but also winning the Virgin Islands Caucuses as well. Now, he really did use his remarks on Thursday to pivot to more of a general election strategy, and as part of that, he talked about winning in November. He said that if they can win this state, if they can win Nevada, they can easily win the general election. Take a listen to what he said.",

Melissa Bell in Paris, thank you so much for joining us and analyzing that interview for us.A new commander is taking charge of Ukraine's war effort after President Volodymyr Zelenskyy sacked his top general. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi was fired on Thursday in the biggest military shake-up since the start of Russia's invasion. The general is extremely popular in Ukraine, but he disagreed with Mr. Zelensky over mobilization plans and other issues. He's been replaced by General Oleksandr Syrskyi, who's been in charge of Ukraine's land forces up until this point. Some frontline troops tell CNN they're not thrilled by this decision. Dozens of Ukrainian troops who fought in the brutal battle for the city of Mariupol are finally going home. Moscow says Ukraine and Russia conducted a prisoner swap on Thursday, exchanging about 100 troops from each side. Kyiv says most of its returning troops held out at the besieged Azovstal steel plant for weeks before surrendering in May 2022. President Zelenskyy says Ukraine is working to get every captured soldier back home. Two hospitals in Gaza have reportedly come under attack by Israeli forces. A journalist at al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City says an Israeli airstrike hit a room at the hospital and killed at least five people. To the south, doctors at the main medical complex in Khan Younis say one of their colleagues was seriously wounded by Israeli sniper fire while in the operating room. The IDF says it does not target medical facilities, but will attack Hamas fighters wherever they are. Meanwhile, Lebanese state media is reporting that at least three people were killed Thursday in an Israeli drone strike on a car in southern Lebanon. The Israel Defence Forces tell CNN it was targeting a Hezbollah commander believed to be involved in a number of rocket launches on northern Israel earlier on in the day. Hezbollah has not said whether one of its commanders was killed in that Israeli strike. However, the militant group announced late Thursday that it had conducted more rocket launches on an Israeli air base in response. And while all that is happening, U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday gave his sharpest public rebuke to date of Israel's military conduct in Gaza. So for more on that, let's chat with Elliott. Elliott, what did the president say and how much of a shift does this mark in the tone from America?",

And it's not just the U.S. that's concerned. Egypt is also concerned. It's just the other side of the border there. It is concerned that a big ground operation by Israel could in some way lead to hundreds, maybe thousands, of Palestinians streaming over the border onto its territory, something that it doesn't want either. So a lot of concerns, and I think these comments from Biden, express the frustration and also the pressure that he's under from many different sides.",
