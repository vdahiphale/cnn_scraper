One of the deadliest attacks against civilians since the conflict began. This as vital aid from the United States is increasingly in doubt. Something that has left the U.S. president \"worried.\" And once again, the U.S. is in state of political chaos all on its own put making. For the first time in history, a party has fired its own speaker right in the middle of a congressional term. The ousting of Kevin McCarthy is just the latest evidence of deep divisions and turmoil in the Republican Party. The race to find his replacement is on. Now, the remember, the House also needs to reach an agreement by mid-November to fund the government or risk a shutdown. And speaking of chaos, let's not forget that the likely Republican nominee for president is currently facing four criminal trials. Well, tonight, we'll dig into all of this. But first, Christiane just sat down with former secretary of state and first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton. She asked her about the house speaker debacle, including the Democrat's role in this.

Last month marked two years since Taliban began effectively outlawing female education. Girls are not allowed to go to school from sixth grade onwards and are barred from universities. But a clandestine network of brave women have set up secret classrooms across that country in direct defiance of that ban. Correspondent Salma Abdelaziz has this report. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover):  You are witnessing a courageous act of rebellion. Young girls gathered to learn in a secret classroom. To the Taliban, they are criminals defying a ban on female education, but these students say they're determined to continue their schooling no matter the cost. Two of them told us why. I've told myself that even if the Taliban arrest me, I will stand up and tell them I don't want to be kept at home, she says, I just want to learn, and that is not a crime. CNN was granted access to this underground classroom on the condition we conceal the identity of the students and staff and keep the location hidden. But allowing our cameras in comes at extraordinary risks. Around 30 students huddled into this little room to learn everything from science to math to tailoring and drawing. Mariam (ph), not her real name, is their teacher. Here is with us every second we're inside the school, she says, but there's a power stronger than fear, our hope for the future. This is one of nine secret schools that educate more than 400 girls across eight Afghan provinces. It is operated by a clandestine network called SRAK. Families find the program through word of mouth and demand is growing. It was founded by this woman, Parasto Hakim. She says because of her activism, she was recently forced to flee Afghanistan. But in the summer of 2021, as Kabul fell to the Taliban, she tells us she anticipated the ban on female education and got to work. PARASTO HAKIM, FOUNDER OF SRAK SCHOOLS' NETWORK:  So, we were watching some documentaries. I was looking at Afghan woman sitting up in jails and like hide in underground places. ABDELAZIZ (voiceover):  Inspired in part by Christiane Amanpour's 1996 CNN documentary, Battle for Afghanistan, Hakim began to follow the example of women set nearly 25 years ago.",

The school is like a light for me, she says. It is like a road for me that I can see happiness and sunrise at the end of it. It is also a life line. Rates of child marriage, underage labor and reported suicides have increased since the ban on female education, according to the U.N. And countless girls confined to their homes are suffering from anxiety and depression. Fatima (ph) was among them. It felt just like being a prisoner, she says. Like a prisoner who is only allowed to eat and drink but not allowed to do anything else. With the support of her family, she discovered the school and found her passion. She wants to be a famous fashion designer. I want my future to be a bright one, she says. I don't want to be behind a mask forever. I want to be able to show my real face.

And remember, back when John Boehner left thespeakership, McCarthy was next in line, the Republicans said, you're not going to be speaker because we don't trust you. But what also created a kind of simmering anger by Democrats about Kevin McCarthy was that he turned against them after January 6th. He voted after the chaos that occurred that the election had been stolen. He discredited the January 6th Committee and blocked a further investigation. And if you're looking at this even from a pragmatic standpoint, if Democrats had stepped in to save McCarthy, the odds are that McCarthy would have turned even more radical. He would have said, oh, my god, I don't want this to happen again. So, I'm going to have to give even more to the Matt Gaetz wing of Republican Party. Now, it's undeniable that the choices that are out there now are worse than McCarthy. We have Jim Jordan. When he left, John Boehner referred to Jim Jordan as a legislative terrorist. We have Steve Scalise who has been a part of the leadership for some time. A more sympathetic figure in some ways but self-described as David Duke, the KKK leader, without the baggage. So, we're not likely to see somebody who is going to reach out to Democrats. But Kevin McCarthy wouldn't have done that otherwise.",

I want to get back to the first question, and that is, you know, something you wrote 10 years ago identifying a party that you've never seen the likes before. And you said it goes back prior to that.

Yascha Mounk has built his acclaimed scholarly career on being one ofthe first to warn of the risks right-wing populous pose to American democracy. But now, in his latest book, he's warning that many on left and center are also stuck in a trap, obsessed with group identity. So, let's get straight into it. Yasha Mounk joins me from Baltimore, Maryland. Not every day we have two back-to-back political scientists on the program. Good to see you, Yasha, and congratulations on the book. So, for those who haven't read it, can you explain to us what the identity trap is? YASCHA MOUNK, AUTHOR, \"THE IDENTITY TRAP\":  Yes. So, you know, like your previous guest, Norm Ornstein, I like to say I'm a democracy crisis hipster. I was worried about the crisis of democracy before it was cool. And I remained very concerned about these dangerous far-right populous who are now in control of the Republican Party. At the Same time, as somebody who is a professor, who is a member of many mainstream institutions in the United States, I've been really struck by an ideological transformation on my side of the political spectrum, on the political left. There's a new set of ideas about race and gender and sexual orientation. And the way we should treat each other, the role that our belonging in particular groups would play, that has become very prominent over the course of the last decade. I think that these ideas are alluring for understandable reasons. They claim that they are best equipped to allow us to do away with the genuine injustices that persist in our societies. But I think they're ultimately a trap. The trap because, as we've seen, they've made it much harder for progressive institutions to sow the important missions, because of a kind of a melt-downs in these organizations that these norms have inspired. It's a trap because in many of our schools and universities in the United States now, paradox (ph) has started to think that they should teach students to think of themselves primarily as racial beings. They're splitting these children up into different racial groups, which I think is going to increase zero-sum conflict between groups rather than make us emphasize the ways in which we can politically cooperate. Now, I think it's a political trap as well. Because actually, there are many polls now which show that these ideas are pushing some people into the arms of dangerous extremists like Donald Trump. According to one recent analysis by \"The New York Times,\" about 10 percent of Republican voters now are predominantly young, predominantly nonwhite, predominantly quite left leaning on social issues but so worried about what we call wokeness that they intending to vote for Donald Trump. So, I actually think understanding these ideas and learning how to push back against them in a principled way and fighting this former far-right populism onto separate endeavors, we need to both (INAUDIBLE) at the same time",

Now, it's worth noting that the mother of the child and the principal were all black in this case. What is this incident tell you about broader trends in America?

As you were saying, the principal inthis case is a black woman who's a progressive and who thought that it is her duty to teach children to think of themselves as racial beings. We see now many schools around the country, particularly elite private schools and places like New York City and Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles, start to separate children into distinct racial groups in third grade, in second grade, in first grade. With teachers coming in, telling kids, if you're black, you go to that classroom or if you're Latino you go to that classroom, if you're Asian American, you go to that classroom, if you're white go to this classroom here. The purpose of this is to allow them to fight back, to organize, to have solidarity. But I think it is encouraging the kind of zero-sum ethnic conflict, which always ends up profiting the right.

But most importantly, I think it's a fool's choice to say that you should either fight against far-right extremism and populism or against some of these trends on the left. These ideas have become so influential on the left because after Donald Trump's elections it became impossible to criticize them without being accused of being a traitor, of running interference for him, because people are genuinely, and for good reasons, scared of Donald Trump. But today, the hold of these ideas have over many mainstream institutions is the biggest gift to Donald Trump, makes it much easier for him to win elections in 2024. According to polls, I don't share this opinion myself, but according to polls, more Americans think that the Democratic party is too extreme than think that the Republican Party is too extreme.

But the other solution I would point to is a good old-fashioned universal wealth estate. We should be doing something to help all poor children in a place like the United States.

And one thing Sam's parents said to me frequently when I was recording my \"New Yorker\" article was that, you know, Sam seems so intellectually sort of precocious, they spent a lot of time and energy trying to make sure that he had adequate intellectual stimulation. So, they sought out special math classes, they -- you know, they sent him to a special math summer camp in high school that you had to do a big really difficult test to get into.
