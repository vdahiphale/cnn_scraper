The charges include assault with a dangerous weapon, reckless operation of a motor vehicle, destruction of federal property and trespassing.

And for that reason, I'm going to take you over here. They evacuated that hotel, the Hay Adams Hotel on the corner of H and 16th street here, briefly. The FBI searched the truck. They found no explosives in the vehicle. So, people were then allowed to go back into the Hay Adams Hotel. This suspect, again identified as Sai Varshith Kandula, 19 years old, charged with threatening to kill, kidnap or harm a president, assault with a dangerous weapon, destruction of federal property, and other charges. He is expected to appear in court a little bit later today. They found inside the truck, we can tell you, a flag with what appeared to be a swastika on it, a black backpack and a roll of duct tape.

But the judge is saying that Trump cannot post any material that he receives from prosecutors. That could include witness statements, grand jury testimony, can't post any of that on social media. Now, the hearing today is called at the request of the prosecutors who wanted the judge to make this clear to Trump, because they say Trump has had an extensive history of making sort of alarming statements, inflammatory statements on his social media pages. So, they wanted the judge to address the former president one-on-one, so he can ask any questions, if he has them, and that Trump can also learn what the consequences are if he violates this court order. They essentially want to make sure there's no confusion moving forward in this case. And we also may learn the trial date. The judge asked both sides to come together and propose when they want this trial to go in February or March of next year, because the judge saying this will be the middle of the presidential election season, and the judge wanting to make sure that there are no excuses about why Trump can or cannot appear when this trial date is set.

Now, it is this other lawsuit has been held up on appeal. It's now up to the judge to decide what to do there, saying that if this suit does move forward, she wants to use the comments that Trump made just a few weeks ago to show that he is not remorseful, that in showing that he had some malice here in order to get more in terms of punitive damages, because those damages are meant to punish the person for whatever they are found liable of.

We've seen in this case that Trump's comments have already put people at risk. He's kind of threatened the judge, and his follow could potentially put them at risk. So, that's why they want to be very careful about what he can and can't do. This is direct, personal notice. If now something shows up on Truth Social, they will know that he was properly informed.

He's not never-Trump, and he's not Trump- lite.Now, Youngkin has previously said he would not run, and his people are sort of throwing cold water on this, this morning. Nevertheless, The Wall Street Journal is also reporting this morning that a growing list of Republican candidates are running or considering running, saying, quote, it's a sign that prospective candidates don't think Donald Trump has the contest locked up, and they view Florida Governor Ron DeSantis as a flawed lead challenger to the former president. CNN's Jeff Zeleny, who travels the country covering this election, is with us now. I don't want to focus on the Youngkin thing exactly here, Jeff, because his people are throwing cold water on it.

We certainly are not in the end. So, yes, candidates will still get in the race.And as my good friend, John McCormick, at The Wall Street Journal reports today, others are indeed going to get in the race. Mike Pence, the former vice president, is likely to get in, in June. Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is likely to get in even sooner than that. And the list goes on and on. As for Glenn Youngkin, the Virginia governor, he certainly won a surprising and impressive victory back in Virginia in 2021. And he remains, I'm told, a lot of donors and other top Republicans want him to keep an open mind on this. The reality is, though, he has a one term as governor of Virginia, and he is not actively considering this at this time unless it would be a plan B, unless it would be at the end of this year. If things sort of go south with Donald Trump, Governor DeSantis and others, then maybe he would jump in. But let's take a look at a tweet from one of his senior advisers to just set the record straight on what Governor Youngkin is thinking. He says this Governor Youngkin is focused on Virginia. Anyone who anonymously, excuse me, says otherwise probably isn't as close to the governor as they want to think. So beyond all that, let's focus on the people who are in this race. And what this also speaks to is Governor Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor, we're expecting him to formally get in tomorrow or in the coming days. He is not as strong as Republicans once thought. He's getting into this race in a far weaker position. That is why so many others are thinking about also joining this contest, John.",
