And according to the Dossier Center, a fully equipped cosmetology suite with a massage table and high-end beauty equipment. CHANCE (on camera): Now the Kremlin disputes the Dossier Center's findings telling CNN that President Putin neither owns nor uses a railway car like the one described. But in the aftermath of a recent armed rebellion here in Russia, in which Putin's authority was threatened, the focus on his isolated existence is higher than ever. CHANCE (voice over): And the idea of Putin being pampered as he travels incognito by armored train underlines how strangely cloistered the Kremlin leader has become, even paranoid and besieged according to his former speechwriter. Why is it do you think that Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin has spent such large sums of money planning and constructing this armored presidential train?",

Just a couple of weeks ago, there was an armed uprising, of course in Russia.

It really doesn't matter whether or not this ridiculous meeting happened or not. And by the way, we don't have any confirmation except from Mr. Peskov who is well-known for not stating the truth.But it doesn't matter. It is the message that Putin and the Kremlin want to get out. So there is, I think, great concern in the Kremlin, and certainly with Putin himself, that Prigozhin actually might have gotten a grip or somehow found a good niche for himself inside of the Russian population. Remember the themes that he was talking about? My boys are being killed, they don't have enough guns and ammo, regardless of the fact that he was using them as cannon fodder. That's something that the Russian people care about. We saw that, you know, two decades ago, when the Grozny and the Chechen situation was going down, and the mothers of those killed servicemen started to protest in the streets and it was a serious problem. So they've got to do something about that. And what they do is they say, look, Putin was basically acting as dad between the Ministry of Defense and Prigozhin, and it's all going to be okay, because now he's in control. But that doesn't mean that his elite isn't watching this carefully. And what have they learned? Well, they've learned that you can basically have a military attack almost on Moscow and get away with it and not get immediately killed. And indeed, if it is true, get a meeting with Putin. So I think it depends on which audience you're looking at, to get an idea as to what message is being transmitted.",

They have a great capability of patrolling and monitoring the northern oceans that lead in and out of northern Russia. It's a good force, well-led, very operationally savvy. But truthfully, the fact that they have stayed independent throughout the history of NATO, and then suddenly they want to become members, and they are now joined or they will be joining, I'm sure, it just shows how Mr. Putin's political objectives of further dividing NATO has really fallen apart along with his other military and political objectives.

They said: \"An indefinite continuance is unnecessary and will inject additional delay in this case, and is contrary to the public interest.\" They are flagging the idea that, you know, small delays like this will add up to longer delays. The special counsel already indicated that they want a speedy trial. They believe it is in the public interest to have a speedy trial. Of course, we know, Anderson that Donald Trump and his co-defendant, Walt Nauta appear to not want that. The former president is, of course, running for office again and it appears that his strategy is one we've seen before, which is to delay, delay, delay and perhaps delay beyond the 2024 election.

Right? I mean, he -- again, yes, he only appears on Fox News or friendly media. He doesn't come on CNN. But somehow it's the media's fault. Well, I'll tell you the truth. It's actually Ron DeSantis' fault because he made a decision -- I think this is largely the issue. He made a decision early on that he was going to try to be a younger version of Donald Trump. Actually, I mean, tactically, it's probably not a bad decision to make, except that Donald Trump is running again, and nobody can out- Trump, Donald Trump, and so it was a bad tactical decision, and I think he's waiting and hoping that Donald Trump is indicted and indicted again, or he is convicted and, and people sit back and say, okay, well, who's the new Trump?

He tried to run to the right of Donald Trump, when there's a big space to the moderate center of Donald Trump. He ran away from his natural constituency, and now he's failing.

People want to know where he stands on. You know, when he signed the abortion ban in Florida, for instance, kind of did it in the dead of night.

I can't remember at least in my life, anytime, an almost guaranteed frontrunner or a significantly talked about frontrunner, as early as Ron DeSantis was has ever advanced to end up being that person. I mean, you think back, you know, the early days of Governor Bush, Governor Scott Walker, that's the nature of it, and he was built up far too much, far too fast.

In 1955, Rosa Parks was arrested in Montgomery, Alabama for refusing to sit in the back of the bus and give up her seat to a white passenger. Her act of extraordinary courage and defiance led to the Montgomery bus boycott and is known as one of the earliest starting points of the civil rights movement.Nearly a year later, Supreme Court ruled the city's bus segregation laws were legal and unconstitutional. By comparison, Mr. Santos is awaiting trial on criminal fraud charges. He's pleaded not guilty to a 13-count indictment that includes allegations of misusing campaign funds and lying about his personal finances on a House disclosure form. He's also admitted to lying about his resume and family background. The first term congressman's thirstiness is unquenched, however, and he claims he will be seeking re-election. So, let's take a look at the numbers, shall we? Our Senior Data Reporter Harry Enten is here. So, what does the data show us about how Mr. Santos is polling? HARRY ENTEN, CNN Senior Data Reporter: What the hell is wrong with him? Can I just say that? I mean, my goodness gracious.
