Let's discuss the Obama factor and more with all of our political experts. Alex Thompson, this was an event that follows her event yesterday with Liz Cheney in Ripon, Wisconsin. That was designed to reach out, I think, towards disaffected Republicans. This was a bit more of her wheelhouse. There's labor support in the building. How are things looking for her in Michigan?",

And we've seen the community over and over again, specifically the uncommitted vote, call out where President Biden is as well as Vice President Harris on this issue.And I think that at this point when we've seen a press conference earlier today or briefing earlier today where we heard from Joe Biden, who specifically said that or alluded to Netanyahu possibly, you know, trying to shift the scales when it comes to this election, utilizing his own power in what's going on in Israel and Gaza, I think that at this point there has to be especially a concern in Michigan because you have such a large population of Arab voters. But in addition to that we've seen this really affect younger voters and their preferences as well. So, I think that the meetings that she's having matters, but she also has to take a very clear stance on what will happen, how the U.S. will continue to move forward.

CROWAt the same time, there does need to be a greater level of coordination by Israel. I mean, we are trying, we are sending emissaries over, we are attempting to figure out what their strategy is. There has to be more information by Israel because they exist, they live under the U.S. security umbrella, make no mistake about this. I mean, they have their own military, they have their own air force. But, ultimately, it's the U.S. security umbrella that makes a lot of that possible. And if there is a wider regional conflict, the risk of us being pulled into that conflict is extremely high. So, I again will call for Israel, as the president and the administration has repeatedly, to coordinate more closely with us.",

They have a first ladies exhibit there and in the dark, I speak with one of the curators about that because they have all of the inaugural gowns that every first lady has warned to their husband's inauguration. There's no talks in there. Obviously, but there certainly could be. They came close to being prepared for that during the election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, the idea that Bill Clinton might take that role. But it's an open question of what it would look like. What I really learned that was interesting and you'll hear this on Sunday night when, when the documentary airs, is a lot of experts who have studied the role of first spouse said that they actually think if Doug Emhoff is in that role, that he will feel fulfill a more traditional view of what that looks like, than Melania Trump would, if she returns to the White House. There were real questions about whether or not she would move back into the White House if Donald Trump does win, or if she would remain in New York City. So, big questions of what this could look like. Either way, it's a fascinating look at this position and just how much its changed and also how antiquated its still very much is.",

She would sit in on cabinet meeting and they -- they establish a weekly lunch where they talked about policy, not just catching up with one another. And so I think the emphasis in the influence that you see, whoever is occupying that role has on the president of the United States is really an interesting look. And it often gets overlooked.
