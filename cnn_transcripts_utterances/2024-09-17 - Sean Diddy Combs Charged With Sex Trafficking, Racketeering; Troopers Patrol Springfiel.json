This happening after former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Senator J.D. Vance, spread baseless claims. Coming up, I'll speak with a Haitian-American business owner in Springfield.Plus, battleground blitz, Trump and Harris on the trail. And right now, Harris' running mate, Tim Walz, is in Georgia. One of the big electoral prizes, though, will be North Carolina. Ahead, I'll speak with the chair of that state's Democratic Party about their strategy there. And Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announces his own state's investigation into the apparent Trump assassination attempt. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL):  We'll see how it was that this guy was able to burrow himself in the bushes for apparently 12 hours and how that came to happen. And I don't have the answer to that. Perhaps our investigation will be able to do. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Right now, Sean Diddy Combs is in federal court and an indictment against him was just unsealed. Combs is charged with racketeering and sex trafficking. He was arrested last night in New York and CNN's Kara Scannell is outside the courthouse for us. Also with me, CNN's Josh Campbell and CNN Senior Legal Analyst Elie Honig. But, Kara, let me go to you first. What are you expecting to hear this morning?",

      "sentences": "Well, that's right, Jim. So, Sean Diddy Combs is in the courthouse behind me. This indictment has just been unsealed and Combs has been charged with three federal counts, one count of racketeering conspiracy, one count of sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion, and the transportation to engage in prostitution, so three federal charges.And what prosecutors lay out in this 14-page indictment is what they say is a persistent and pervasive pattern of abuse toward women and other individuals. They go on to describe in this indictment. They say that comes had manipulated women to perform sexual acts on him and other commercial sex workers who are men. He said that they alleged that Combs had drugged these women to engage in these sexual acts. And he controlled their careers and their finances as his way to manipulate them. Now, according to this indictment, this mirrors some of the allegations that we heard in some of the civil lawsuits, including this allegation that comes that have what's called a freak out party. And in these parties is when he would allegedly drug some of these women and have them perform sex acts with prostitutes and record this at times. So, that's one of these allegations in this. And prosecutors say, according to the indictment that when they executed those search warrants on Diddy's homes in Miami and Los Angeles, they uncovered some of the elements of these freak out parties, including, they said, drugs and 1,000 bottles of baby oil and lubricant. They also said that they uncovered a cache of weapons. That was another way that they said that Diddy was able to allegedly coerce some of these women and to keep people around him silent. Now, this indictment only charges Diddy, but it does say that he was facilitated in these crimes by intermediaries who helped him cover this up, including security, household staff and other employees. But Diddy is the only one charge today. Now, we're waiting for him to have an appearance before the judge. That has not yet been set. But he will go before the judge today where he will face these charges. Now, his lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, on his way into court this morning, spoke to reporters saying that Diddy will plead not guilty and he will fight to get him released. Here's what he said.

      "sentences": "Yes, Jim. So, first of all, this is a federal indictment. It's been filed in the Southern District of New York, which covers Manhattan and the Bronx and some of the northern counties. So, this will be a federal prosecution.Generally, federal prosecutions carry higher penalties, higher potential sentences than state prosecutions. And as I'll get to in a moment, that is certainly the case here. So, this is a three-count indictment against Sean Combs. Now, count one charges racketeering conspiracy. and the indictment alleges that Sean Combs, along with others who are not charged, but others, ran an enterprise, an operation, essentially a business, that engaged in a series of crimes. Here, those crimes relate to sex trafficking. In fact, the indictment names the racketeering enterprise the Combs Enterprise. That's the title that they gave the enterprise. So, that's count one. Now count two is charges sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, meaning that Sean Combs participated in transporting women across state lines for illegal sexual purposes by force or by threats or by intimidation. That is an extraordinarily serious charge. For the prosecution can prove that, the minimum sentence there if they convict Sean Combs on that is 15 years and the maximum is life, 15 year minimum sentence. And then count three charges transportation of another individual to engage in prostitution. It's sort of a lesser included of count two. So, we've got a three-count indictment, racketeering, sex trafficking by force, and then interstate transportation for the purpose of prostitution. It's a very serious indictment. These charges are extremely serious. The Southern District of New York does cases like this. They do cases against powerful, famous individuals all the time. And soon, Sean Combs will be in court and he will certainly plead not guilty to this. And then we'll be underway with the proceedings.",

      "sentences": "There was indeed. And you know, it's interesting, we've been reporting all along based on those original allegations, which law enforcement sources tell us actually spurred this investigation. He was accused of obviously serious crimes, including sex trafficking, including drugging women. And now we're seeing federal investigators actually bring criminal charges.What they allege in this indictment is that, you know, we're all familiar with Sean Combs' media enterprise, but they're essentially saying that his enterprise existed for his own sexual gratification. And you had all of these staff members that were there essentially assisting him in this effort to include members of the security team, members of his household staff, other employees. And as we look through this indictment again that was just unsealed, I want to read you one portion, which lays out this slew of allegations. They say in this indictment that members and associates of the Combs Enterprise engaged in and attempted to engage in among either activities, sex trafficking, forced labor, interstate transportation for purposes of prostitution, coercion and enticement to engage in prostitution, narcotics offenses, kidnapping, arson, bribery and obstruction of justice. So, just a litany of charges there. Of course, Combs himself has said all along that he is not guilty. His attorney indicated that he is planning to fight these charges. But you go back and look, this is really interesting, Jim, at how Sean Combs originally responded to these civil suits whenever they came out, they essentially went after the women who were making these allegations. At one point saying, you know, at least one of them was someone who was just looking for a quick payday. That all changed when CNN broke exclusively that footage of Sean Combs in a hotel here in Los Angeles physically assaulting his former girlfriend. And then we saw his tone start to change a little bit. He came out with, you know, an apology. Again, that stands in stark contrast to how aggressive his team was towards these women. And all behind the scenes, it's important to note that there's this agency that may not be a household name, but it's HSI, Homeland Security Investigations. It's an arm of the Department of Homeland Security. They specialize in human trafficking. They looked at these allegations and indicated there is a federal crime that's been committed here, and now we're seeing this indictment, they allege multiple crimes.",

They are willing to continue to terrorize this community because they prefer a conversation that is in the like, you know, vein of immigration that is somewhere approximating immigration because they feel like that's safer territory for them.
