Just a short time from now Trump ally and former Attorney John Eastman will be the first of 18 defendants arraigned on charges stemming from the 2020 fake electoral scheme.Also President Biden making an urgent new push to appeal to black voters. He set to deliver a speech later this hour aimed at reversing a lack of enthusiasm among this critical voting bloc. We're going to bring that speech to you live that's coming up this hour. But let's begin with all the developments involving John Eastman, the architect of Donald Trump's bid to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election. And that's set to be or he's set to be arraigned for this alleged role in devising what's being described as a fake electoral scheme. Eastman is the first of 18 Trump allies to be arraigned there on charges including conspiracy and forgery. CNN senior investigative correspondent Kyung Lah is joining us from Phoenix right now where all of this is unfolding. Kyung, what's the latest?",

What is expected is the very first of the 18 charged in this indictment to appear. John Eastman, the former Trump attorney, the person who is known in this indictment as the alleged craftsman, the architect of this multistate fake electoral scheme. He is expected to appear here in Arizona. It is the very first of the 18 charged in the state indictment to appear here in court.It will be a standard arraignment where the charges will be read and he will be booked. There will be a mugshot taken we're told from the Sheriff's Department. This case involves a scheme in 2020 where people gathered, 11 of them here in the state of Arizona and said that it was Donald Trump who won the state of Arizona. It was not, Joe Biden won. And then they submitted that document. And so this indictment is around that moment. So there are 11, who were in that room in 2020. Those 11 are familiar state names from the head of the state GOP to two state senators. But it is this second group, the seven who are on this page, including Rudy Giuliani, who here in the state of Arizona, they're still trying to serve those papers, who are known nationally as Trump allies, including Mark Meadows, the White House Chief of Staff. But kicking all this off the very first of the 18 to appear in court, John Eastman. Wolf?",

For more than all of this, and it's an important story, I want to bring in CNN legal analyst Michael Moore, and former Florida judge and Cooley Law School professor Jeff Swartz. Michael, you are the U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, the state where so many of the same Trump aides were indicted for trying to overturn the election results there.

If that is so and his associates are refusing to surrender him, there's a possibility that they're going to add -- they're going to serve a warrant on him in West Palm Beach, and he's going to get booked. And until he agrees to extradition to Arizona, he's going to be jailed. And the question is going to be how long he wants to stay jailed rather than surrender himself in Arizona. So it could be very interesting to see Mr. Giuliani being booked into a jail and residing there for a period of time. My understanding is he's in financial difficulties. So the chance of making a bond are pretty slim.",

And essentially, the string they used to tie it up unraveled on the stand as it related particularly to this telephone call that he said he thought he knew what was discussed. And therefore when confronted with other facts, he did not.And I think to what you've seen is sort of he's been maybe playing the Eddie Haskell a little bit going forward in this case. He's been very calm, and everything has seemed normal. And then suddenly, the defense brings out these podcasts, these comments that he's made. They catch him and have trues and complete untruths, as they have presented the defense. And that's when you have a critical witness, like you'd have with Mr. Cohen. That is just a devastating blow to a case. I had a trial where a judge actually stopped the case and said, I'm not letting the government proceed, because I don't believe the witness. We're not at that point. But it was not a good day, certainly for the case. And I think that you'll see Monday, you'll see some very specific points delve into by the defense, there'll be an effort to try to rehabilitate him. But this lack of credibility and the damage that was done to him I think will likely stick in the jurors mind and I think increases the chances of perhaps a, you know, a mistrial or, you know, a hung jury in the case. So it's just -- it was just not a good day for the state.",

Thank you very much.We're following other breaking news as well. Right now the world's number one golfer Scottie Scheffler teed off less than an hour or so ago over at the PGA Championship in Louisville, Kentucky, after he was arrested earlier in the morning and actually charged with a felony. The crowd by the way, gave Scheffler a round of applause when he showed up. He also just released a statement writing among other things, quote, it was a very chaotic situation understandably so, considering the tragic accident that had occurred earlier. And there was a big misunderstanding of what I thought I was being asked to do, close quote. ESPN is reporting that Scheffler tried to maneuver around a fatal crash scene by driving on a median near the entrance to the Valhalla Golf Club. Police say they told him to stop but Scheffler continued to drive toward the golf club. He now faces four charges including a felony count of second degree assault on a police officer. His attorney says Scheffler will be cooperating. We also just learned that Louisville police are reviewing body cameras from officers of the scene and will make a statement later today. We'll watch for that. Editorial director of Golf Digest, Max Adler, is joining us right now and CNN senior law enforcement analyst Charles Ramsey is joining us as well. Max, first of all, what do you make of Scottie? Scheffler's arrest?",

But the bottom line is this, a sporting event is not more important than the investigation of a fatal traffic accident or a homicide.And so there's a reason why police officers block off that area. There's forensic evidence that has to be collected. There's all kinds of things that take place during a fatal traffic accident and taking it upon yourself to try to drive around is not the way to do it to walk up, explain who you are, the officers can escort you in a way in which you don't at all interrupt what's going on at the crime scene. Now, having said that, fortunately, it looks like they have body worn camera footage, that's going to tell us the story as to what took place because the most important charge, of course, is the assault charge.",

You know, at golf tournaments, it's normal for all players who have assigned courtesy vehicles from the tournament that are clearly marked to expect a certain amount of a different treatment as they're entering the traffic congested golf tournaments.As far as Scottie's reputation in the golf world, it's sterling. As I said, he's been on this great run of winning, known as a very wholesome, good guy, definitely a rule follower. Just had the birth of his first child, the specter of which overhung him possibly missing the Masters or this PGA Championship. You know, all to say that his image is crystal clear so far.

Did officers direct him to do that? Was he told to stop that he failed to stop? There's something about an officer perhaps grabbing him by the arm. If so what was his reaction, his response to that? In other words, they'll try to dissect that film to find out exactly what took place.But again, and I think it's important to emphasize I understand he's a big time pro golfer. He's not is more important than the investigation of a fatal traffic accident, or homicide or any other crime. You have to wait until you're instructed to go around or through a crime scene and an officer will direct you so you do not disturb any potential forensic evidence that's there. I mean, that's just the way it is. It's unfortunate, but it's reality.",

He talked about them celebrating life at that festival and saying that they were murdered by Hamas and their bodies taken to Gaza. The families of these hostages were notified before Admiral Hagari made this announcement. Obviously, for some of them, they knew that their loved ones had been had been killed. Shani Louk for example, there was a video of her on October 7th that showed her body in the back of a pickup truck with militants surrounding her, some of them on top of her. Her body was facedown and partially undressed. It was weeks later that the Israeli government said that they had actually found a remnant of her skull, which, in their minds, according to forensic experts, prove that she was dead that she could not have survived losing that part of her skull. So she has been known to her family to be dead since late October. This now brings the total number of hostages, Wolf, still held in Gaza or, sorry, the total number of hostages who have been announced dead now to 41 hostages. We know that the bodies of 128 were still being, forgive me, 128 hostages both dead and alive have been held in Gaza. So this takes three away from that. So 125 hostages both alive and dead still remaining in Gaza, 41 have now been announced dead. Wolf?",
