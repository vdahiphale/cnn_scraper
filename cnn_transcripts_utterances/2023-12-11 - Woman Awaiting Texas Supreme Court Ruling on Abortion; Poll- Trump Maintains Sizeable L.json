It hasn't helped that their counteroffensive hasn't gone according to plan. And they're fighting over whether you call it a stalemate or not now at this point, but there's internal division even among Ukrainians, and Zelenskyy himself, his popularity has gone down.

They would like to move on. Ukrainians would like to move on, too, but they can't move on because they had this genocidal invader occupying about 20 percent of their country and trying to take the rest of it. So they have no choice but to keep fighting. And I think -- to me, I wrote I'm ashamed that there are so many Americans who want to betray our Ukrainian allies, just as there were so many in 1941 who wanted to betray Great Britain as it was battling the Nazis. I think we have to stay the course. And it's true the Ukrainian offensive did not generate as many gains as been hoped this summer, and the war is to some extent is stalemate. But it's not destined to stay a stalemate. If they don't provide Ukraine the ammunition it needs, the Russians can break through.

The poll itself, when you dig in, I was trying to compare it to the October poll, what's changed? Clearly, Trump still with a very sizable lead. What stood out to you about where things stand in the race here? STEPHEN GRUBER-MILLER, POLITICS AND STATE HOUSE REPORTER FOR \"THE DES MOINES REGISTER\":  Yes, as we've seen some candidates drop out of the race, we've really just seen Trump's lead widen over his opponents. What we see now is for the first time, he has a majority support among likely Republican caucus goers in Iowa. Before, he was in the 40s; now he's above 50 percent. That's significant. We also see the battle for second place continuing with Ron DeSantis, at 19, like you said, and Nikki Haley at 16. This doesn't represent a whole lot of movement for either of them and it comes after DeSantis in particular has some big endorsements from Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds, and a lot of other leading state figures. So they still have some room to grow here. They need to grow to catch Trump. Traditionally, Iowa caucus goers decided really late in the game, so that might benefit a challenger. But in this poll, we see that 70 percent of Trump supporters already have their minds made up, whereas for DeSantis, it is only about 30 percent and just a little more than that for Nikki Haley. So the Trump supporters seem to be locked in. One other stat that I would note is among new caucus goers, people who have not caucused before, Trump has a five to one lead over DeSantis, 63 percent support among first time caucus goers to DeSantis' 12. HARLOW;  How do you explain that, Stephen? GRUBER-MILLER:  Yes, so I mean, part of what can make the caucuses unpredictable is candidates who are able to bring in a large number of new first time caucus goers. You'd think of Barack Obama or Bernie Sanders who rode a wave of momentum from people who hadn't gone to the caucus process before, they hadn't traditionally participated. In this case, like I said, Trump has a commanding lead among those people who haven't gone out of their way to go to a caucus on a Monday night before. So you know, if the other candidates' theory of the race is that they're going to bring in new people and expand the electorate to cut into the base that Trump has, what we're seeing is the opposite.",

Is there one that stands out to you right now? GRUBER-MILLER:  You know, they've all got their strengths, right? I mean, DeSantis has had a lot of people in Iowa with never back down. He's got a lot of people knocking doors. They've collected a lot of data from Iowans and they've made relationships over the last few months. Nikki Haley just got a big endorsement from Americans for Prosperity Action. So they have dozens of door knockers and about 10 paid staffers around the state who are doing work on her behalf.
