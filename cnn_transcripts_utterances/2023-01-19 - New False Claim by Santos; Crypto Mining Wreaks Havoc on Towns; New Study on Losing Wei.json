No laughing matter, by the way.But this morning it appears George Santos has been caught in yet another lie. He has claimed, right, that his mother was in the south tower on 9/11. That has been reported for a while. Even, you know, it's on his campaign website. Here's the problem. Immigration records apparently show that that is not actually the case. She wasn't even in the U.S. On a 2003 form seen by CNN, the mother indicated that she hadn't been to America since 1999. She also filed paperwork in Brazil in 2001, just months before 9/11, saying that her Green Card had been stolen. It's in addition to, really, a long list of lies from the newly elected congressman. So, let's discuss now. CNN political commentators Scott Jennings and Alyssa Farah Griffin. They are both here. I'm sure they don't want to get close to this issue with a ten - with a ten foot pole.",

I'd say he's a bit of a con artist. But - well, he's like the gift that keeps giving in terms of like, it's kind of funny sometimes. It's very serious.From a national security perspective, this guy is ripe for adversaries to exploit. Like, Scott and I, when we were going into government, they - we go through the SF-86 (ph) process. They look into who you lived with. They talk to old roommates, all your old employers, to know that you're not somebody who could be blackmailed or subject to corruption. We don't do that with elected officials.

NARULAsays, yes, it works, some says it doesn't - some say it doesn't. A lot of the research has been done in animals and it's been sort of short term. So the question is, is this something sustainable over the long term. But, there are a couple different types of intermittent fasting programs. You do the 16/8, with that daily intermittent fasting, which is probably the most common. You restrict eating from say maybe 11:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. and then you have that 12, 18 hour period where you're not eating at all. Some people do alternate days. So they fast one day, eat the next day. And some do like a 5/2, where they eat five days and then not two. And there's some data suggests this helps the cells regenerate. It helps you go into a state of ketosis where you break down fat. So, there definitely may be something to it for sure.",
