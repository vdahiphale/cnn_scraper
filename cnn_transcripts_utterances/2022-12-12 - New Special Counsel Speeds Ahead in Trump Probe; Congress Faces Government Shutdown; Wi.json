One of the quotes was the fact they found a guy who has been in Europe for the past several years without his brain marinating in the soup of January 6th coverage, that's a good thing. They also think if there were to be a case brought against Donald Trump, it would be very hard to prove in court.Of course, there's still a risk involved with any investigation that's ongoing, but the entire landscape here is a bit different than the Mueller investigation.",

Over the weekend, aides that I'm talking to say that they did make a little more progress, but the key sticking points still remain and they still have not agreed to how much money to spend next year. They're about $25 billion apart. That, obviously, a significant amount of money. For the government, that's a little bit less significant of an amount of money. But they are still working through those differences. That leaves them really with two choices at the end of the day. Once they get past Friday, they have about another week to negotiate if they pass that short-term spending bill. Then they can either keep funding levels at what they were last year, that is less desirable from the White House because of inflation, because of other factors, they want more flexibility in terms of how they deal with spending next year. They're going to continue to try and pass an omnibus. That, of course, would set new funding levels for the next year. But there is a long, long way to go.

But we do know from all accounts everyone who has seen her says she's doing incredibly well. Roger Carstens, who is the special envoy for hostage affairs here at the State Department, he traveled with her back to the United States. And when she got on the plane, he described her as incredibly energetic. He said, hey, you can sit over there, take your time, and she immediately said, no, I've been, you know, talking to no one in Russia, I want to talk to people. She introduced herself to everyone in the crew on that plane and he said that she spoke for about 12 of the 16 hours on the flight home.So, she is still undergoing these medical checks. We don't have a definitive estimation as to how long that will check. But by all accounts she's doing incredibly well. And then the other thing that we should note is that we are continuing to ask questions of the Biden administration in terms of how they're going to get home Paul Whelan. That's that other American who's still wrongfully detained in Russia going on four years now. And we just heard from Roger Carstens this morning on ABC who said that the Biden administration is meeting today. U.S. officials meeting today to discuss next steps in the strategy to bring home Whelan. And he also told our colleague Dana Bash over the weekend that there's always cards that the U.S. can put on the table. Now, the question is, what kind of cards will Russia accept here to get Paul Whelan home because they weren't able to get him home as a part of this prisoner swap that brought home Griner. But rest assured, he said to Paul Whelan, who he spoke with on Friday, that the U.S. government is really doing everything that they can and this is an ongoing productive effort for them. Guys.",

Well, still ahead, the Treasury secretary predicts that 2023 will bring some relief on inflation. That's good news. You're hearing that from a lot of folks. That, however, will not change the holiday shopping prices many Americans are seeing right now.",
