An individual aboard a scooter randomly opening fire on people in two New York City boroughs, shooting and killing at least one individual. When you plot them out on a map you can see how really kind of close they are together here. A total of five separate shootings here. Several of them in Queens and then at least one there in a neighborhood in Brooklyn.Five scenes, four people shot, one of them unfortunately did not survive. He has only been identified as an 87-year-old man who was shot in the back. Rushed to the hospital but that's where he died. Another individual did survive however they're currently listed in critical condition after being shot in the face. Investigators saying that the suspect so far only identified as a 25- year-old Hispanic man, used a nine-millimeter pistol that you can see in some of the images that had been released by investigators. Not only the scooter that he was allegedly riding but also that weapon. And if you look closely Jim, you could see that extended magazine that investigators have recovered right now. This is what police have been able to say when it comes to a possible motive. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Again, a 25-year-old Hispanic man, he's had at least one NYPD run in with the law before, but again investigators still don't know what would have potentially motivated him to do what he allegedly did -- Jim.",

The ammunition that they used to call them 155-millimeter weapons. This is a war relating to munitions, and they are running out of that ammunition and we're low on it. And so what I finally did, I took the recommendation of the Defense Department to, not permanently, but to allow for in this transition period where we have more 155 weapons, these shells for the Ukrainians, to provide them with something that has a very low dud rate. It's about -- I think it's 1.50, which is the least likely to be blown. And it's not used in civilian areas. They're trying to get through those trenches and stop those tanks from rolling. And so it was not an easy decision, and we're not signatories to that agreement, but I -- it took me a while to be convinced to do it.

There has been four million rounds of artillery that have been lobbed by both -- by two million by both sides across the frontline. There is a significant percentage of those munitions that are already unexploded on the battlefield. These cluster bomblets that do not explode will add to that mounting number of duds and the danger into the future. The immediate effect of the cluster bomb is, as said by the two senators, it is awesome. These are extremely explosive, extremely effective munitions for what they are intended to do. The residual is of enormous concern to all of us, and the major point here, if we want to talk about morality, we should keep in mind who started this war, why this war continues. It is prudent, it is the Russians that invaded Ukraine, that have launched this horrific war, and continue to pursue it, not only on the front line, but every day Russia immorally is attacking civilians in virtually every city of Ukraine.

Now that this war is underway, when it terminates, there is a high probability that Ukraine will once again put forth a solicitation to join NATO.

When all of this was said and done it may be that we will want to put in place more safeguards, more rails, if you will, to make it clear that no administration should ever be using the federal -- the power of the federal government to go after their political opponents. Clearly Biden has not done that. Clearly Trump did. And if guardrails are necessary, then that should be our work, not just, as Mr. Jordan is doing, using the committee as a weapon.

California Governor Gavin Newsom's office said it will not fight a ruling recommending parole for the 73-year- old, putting her one step closer to being released from prison. Van Houten was convicted in 1971 for her role in the brutal killings of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca in their home. She was originally sentenced to death, but that sentence was commuted to life in prison after the death penalty was overturned in California.With me now is Van Houten's attorney, Nancy Tetreault. Nancy, thanks very much for being with us. Have you talked to Van Houten? What is her reaction to this news? Is it your expectation as it is being reported that your client is probably going to be paroled and be allowed to leave prison? NANCY TETREAULT, LESLIE VAN HOUTEN'S ATTORNEY: She is for sure going to be leaving prison on parole, probably within the next couple of weeks. What happened procedurally is that board granted her parole in 2020. She has been in front of the California -- the parole board, it was about 21 times starting in 1982, denied all the 21 times. In 2016, she got her first grant of parole. She had five consecutive parole grants by the board, all of them reversed by the governor. The governor did reverse this grant of parole, but we prevailed in the California court of appeal. The court of appeal found that there was no evidence, not even a modicum of evidence, supporting the governor's finding that she presents a current risk of danger. And truly, she does not. She's had decades of therapy. She's had decades of rehabilitative programming. She has accepted full responsibility for her part in the LaBianca murders. She has expressed genuine remorse, all of the things that are necessary for a finding of parole suitability. What the governor has done is, the governor -- the court of appeal vacated the governor's reversal, reinstated the board's grant of parole. The governor then have the right to call on the California Supreme Court to reverse the court of appeal. He has declined to do that. So that means the grant of parole has been reinstated, yes.",

They were all convicted, they were all sentenced to death.And you're correct that in California, the California Supreme Court in \"People versus Anderson\" reversed the death penalty under cruel and unusual punishment grounds. So all of those sentences were commuted. However, Leslie's sentence was -- conviction was reversed by the court of appeal. It found that actually her attorney rendered ineffective assistance of counsel, so she -- her conviction was reversed, and that's unrelated to the death penalty reversal. So she was tried a second time, hung jury. Tried a third time, convicted and given a sentence of an indeterminate life sentence of 25 years to life. So when you have an indeterminate life sentence, due process requires that you're given a meaningful opportunity at parole. And so those that say she should remain in prison, maybe that's how they feel, but that's not what the law says. And after 22 tries, the parole board finally said yes, you meet the standard.

But beyond that, she spent decades trying to figure out the causative factors and she finally was able to explain it to the board and the court of appeals' satisfaction. And part of that is accepting full responsibility. And she accepts responsibility for both murders and actually everything that happened when she was a member of the Manson cult. And with that, accepting responsibility is a difficult thing for prisoners to accept because with that, you have to feel the guilt, and she does. She says -- she said her word, I have heard her say that she wakes up every day feeling remorse and guilt, and it's genuine and the board found that to be true. So yes.",

Critics say it's a mistake that will cost the lives of many innocent civilians.And joining me to talk about this is CNN military analyst and retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton. Colonel Leighton, I mean, do you -- why do you think the Biden administration took this course? Why cluster munitions? Why not other types of munitions that haven't been banned by a hundred other countries? Why go into this kind of a thicket in trying to help the Ukrainians out? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, I think the primary reason, Jim, is that our defense industrial base has not kept up with the standard munitions that the Ukrainians are using, up until this point for the most part in their effort against the Russians. So what you have is a defense industrial base that can't keep pace with the demand. The fact that it can't keep pace with the demand means that once the Ukrainians run out of the munitions that they have, they're going to have to ask for other munitions and cluster munitions was one of their asks, and the United States has finally agreed to provide them under some pretty rigid conditions. But nonetheless, they are cluster munitions and there is the risk that they could potentially hurt civilians, especially if they're found as unexploded ordnance on the field.",

So the difference is somewhere between 2.5 to three percent for the American ones, and some were up to 30 to 40 percent for the Russian cluster munitions. So there is a vast difference between the types of ordnance that either side uses. However, it is very true that in Afghanistan, for example, we use cluster munitions and those cluster munitions did fall into the hands at times of children in Afghanistan, and they exploded, and of course, killed and injured many of them and that is a problem even with low dud -- supposedly low dud rates, it's a huge issue.",

But because it's not there, and the administration has resisted providing the ATACMS which has a longer range than the HIMARS, for example, that then gives you a situation where if you need something quickly, and they don't have the training yet, cluster munitions are basically your only other alternative at this point.

I know you follow this so closely, and anybody who has this issue in their family must have been very heartened by this.This week, the FDA granted full approval to Leqembi, the first medicine proven to slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease.

That said, we also have to be very careful about stating what this drug is and isn't. This is not a cure for Alzheimer's, it is not to be used for people with moderate or severe Alzheimer's. It's only for people with mild early onset Alzheimer's, early in the course of their illness. And also, this medication has a lot of side effects, including brain bleeding and brain swelling. Thirteen percent of patients in the clinical trial actually got brain bleeding and swelling. It's also an infusion, it's given one dose every two weeks and patients need frequent MRI scans of the brain to look for brain swelling and bleeding. And so I think a lot of patients probably are not going to be interested in this medication at this time, but I think it will be a really good option for some, and I'm really glad to be able to provide patients and caregivers this option.",
