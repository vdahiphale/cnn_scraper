Michigan is one of most states that relies on the FBI to conduct those background checks.In this case, on the facts that we know from the reporting about this man, the arrest for felony gun possession, had they convicted him of felony gun possession might have prevented him from ever legally purchasing a firearm again. It looks like they pled that charge down to a misdemeanor, and a misdemeanor conviction is not enough to prohibit you from buying a firearm. It looks like, there was a term in his probation that he was not allowed to have guns while he was on probation. But as you mentioned, he completed that term of probation. So essentially, after that date, he could as mentally disturbed as he might have been as angry and, you know, rage filled as he might have been, he could walk into any federally licensed firearms dealer and purchase another gun.",

The kids they live, they hang out outside, they go to concerts, there's theaters or sports, there's classrooms themselves. What colleges and universities are doing are they're trying to fortify places where people congregate, whether it's a classroom or a dorm situation.But you're always going to have vulnerabilities just given the size of this. And this university obviously has main streets going through it, it has bicycles, it has - it's a mini city. And that's the challenge at this stage. And we will learn whether there were vulnerabilities that could have been closed by the university that may have minimized the harm. But someone held that someone determined to get into one of these will likely be able to get into one of one of these buildings. And that is a challenge. I don't mean to be pessimistic about it. But what that means is then what we have to do is work on what the response capacity can be. And I think you saw a pretty, sort of near perfect response in terms of the surge of resources. I did think with kids, you know, this is generation lockdown. K through 12, they are now in college and it's following them.

Well, maybe we'll get an answer or maybe we won't. The other question we should be asking is how, how does this happen? How does it happen 60 or so times this year alone? And the answer is because we have 120 guns in this country for every 100 people. We have more than double the number of the second most gun-soaked country on Earth, which is Yemen, not someplace I think we should be comparing ourselves to. Every lawful gun owner in this country of which I am one, I carried a gun every day for 21 years on the job. I own a firearm, every lawful gun owners should be standing up and saying enough is enough.

But when you talk to people who are preparing to thinking about running against Donald Trump, which is what it is right now. There seems to be a dividing line between those who are willing to say, we are in an aggressive full-throated way, we have to move on beyond this man, Donald Trump and those who are kind of dancing around it. And I'm already hearing for some who are in the first camp saying, you know, OK, she talks about the heels, which is a great memorable line. She talks about bullies, which is another memorable line, but neglects to talk about her former boss, who could easily be put in that category.

How she handled the fallout of that Charleston, devastating Charleston shooting.I think the only thing we see in that video, in terms of the U.N. ambassador is maybe a picture or a video of her in that role at the United Nations. But I think the bigger question in terms of how she actually approaches this is, we've seen too many of these Republicans kind of criticize Trump obliquely, but not actually want to do it directly. And she clearly seems to fall in that lane so far. And when you look at her statements over just the last year, I mean, from January 16, or insurrection, saying that, you know, the Trump let us down. We shouldn't have followed him. We shouldn't follow him again. To then saying, that she would not run if he ran and that she would support him to now running herself, you know, it's not really clear where Nikki Haley actually stands.
