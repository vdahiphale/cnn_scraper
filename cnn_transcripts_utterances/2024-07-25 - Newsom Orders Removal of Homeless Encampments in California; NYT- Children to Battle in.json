And they see proof that when there are beds offered that people very eagerly accept that. So they're talking about this issue of just simple supply and demand.Now, big city mayors across California came out in support of Newsom today with a statement, but also emphasizing the need for housing solutions. And one of those big city mayors is Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, who put out her own statement pushing back a little bit, saying that strategies that just move people along from one neighborhood to the next and giving citations instead of housing do not work. And so she called on Governor Newsom to continue collaborating on strategies that do work -- Boris.",

Of course, from her sister company, HBO, a drama supposedly inspired by the Murdoch's feuding. \"The New York Times\" reports Murdoch's four children are in court over who will eventually control News Corp, his $19 billion empire.The family feud pits Murdoch and his eldest son, Lachlan, against the three other siblings, James, Elizabeth, and Prudence, his eldest child. Joining me now is one of the reporters who broke this story, \"New York Times\" writer at large, Jim Rutenberg. All right, Jim, why are the three siblings going up against Lachlan and Rupert? JIM RUTENBERG, WRITER AT LARGE, THE NEW YORK TIMES: Well, thanks for having me. And I just would say it's really why is Rupert going against the three siblings, because this is Rupert Murdoch changing what's called an irrevocable family trust that when he dies would give his four children, the three you mentioned, and his son, Lachlan, who currently runs the company, shared say in its future. Rupert has made his designated heir Lachlan Murdoch, and he wants Lachlan to have full control and block out his three siblings.",

What part of what, according to the court records that we've obtained, we see here is that Rupert Murdoch is basically arguing what he's doing, he's allowed to do only if it benefits all the heirs, including these three siblings. And he's saying that if it were to happen, that they would move aside their brother Lachlan and take over the company, those three are more politically moderate than Lachlan is understood to be.Perhaps they would change the political orientation of Fox and the rest of the company, and that would affect the value, potentially. So what he's saying he's doing is protecting the value of the trust for all involved, including these three, against their own instincts, which he would say were the wrong instincts.",

The first time it's happening outside a stadium and along a river, six kilometers of the Seine that have been entirely locked down. The advantage, say Parisian authorities, is that it means that it's going to have the crowd ever watching an opening ceremony.Some 325,000 people will line the banks of the River Seine. The disadvantage, of course, is that presents a much greater security challenge. It's taken 45,000 policemen, 18,000 soldiers to ensure that this huge perimeter is safe. 20,000 Parisians who live in the flats that overlook this river had to have their identity papers checked and their security details checked as well to ensure that this would happen safely. So huge its ambition, but huge also in the security operation that's taken place. Still, Parisian authorities say that they're ready -- Boris.

Lots of speculation about what then happens beyond the athletes making their way down the River Seine. There's been a great deal of speculation about some of the artists that might take place in that -- might take part in that opening ceremony. Celine Dion, Lady Gaga have been spotted in and around Paris. For now, Parisian authorities are saying very tight-lipped, Boris, just saying that they expect it to be spectacular. We spoke to the mayor of Paris earlier who said, look, Paris belongs to the world and tomorrow's opening ceremony will be a joy for the whole world to watch -- Boris.",

Democratic Congresswoman Jennifer Wexton of Virginia used a new artificial intelligence-generated model of her own voice to communicate. Wexton last year was diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy, a condition that has robbed her of the ability to speak fully.That, though, has not stopped her from having a voice in Congress. Here's that historic moment. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REP. JENNIFER WEXTON (D-VA): I used to be one of those people who hated the sound of my voice. When my ads came on TV, I would cringe and change the channel. But you truly don't know what you've got till it's gone, because hearing the new AI of my old voice for the first time was music to my ears. It was the most beautiful thing I had ever heard, and I cried tears of joy. I'm not going to sugarcoat the difficulties that I've faced the past year. But what has brought me a renewed sense of determination is the opportunity to use this unique platform to try to help others. The supportive messages I've received have been overwhelming, especially from those facing similar speaking or movement challenges who see someone like me, who just happens to be in the spotlight, persevere in the same ways that they are.
