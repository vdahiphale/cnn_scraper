So no matter how small or how big your vehicle is, it certainly runs the risk of getting stuck. And that's what we heard from the Erie County Executive overnight saying that even their own first responders are getting stuck in this. I will say that its visibility slightly better. For example, from our vantage point, we can see a little bit more than what we were able to see yesterday. But really that doesn't mean much because these winds have been relentless all nights. Our hotel, you could hear those windows rattling all night.I have to tell you, though, this is what the biggest concern right now, according to officials here in Buffalo and Erie County are the hundreds of vehicles that authority say were stranded overnight. These are people that apparently disregarded for one reason or another the driving ban that was put in place almost 24 hours ago. So what authorities have been doing all night, basically going to those vehicles and making sure that there isn't anybody there. However, authorities did say that they believe that there would be rescues happening overnight. But, look, even their own first responders, like I said, are getting stuck in this. So the huge -- the most important message that we're hearing from authorities is shelter in place. Whether you're in your home, even if you don't have power, you're cold, the interior -- cold interior of your house is still much safer than being stuck in this. And if you're in a vehicle, stay in that vehicle, just run it every 10 minutes for heat purposes, make sure that exhaust pipe is clear. And if you can flag a first responder that's passing by, do so or call their non-emergency number because they do expect again those rescues to continue well into the morning and these conditions again that wind is going to be the hardest part today. My face, it feels like just 1,000 needles. So it really is an extremely dangerous morning out there. And folks, according to authorities, they should resist that urge to head out this morning because travel, it's still impossible in and around buffalo. Martin, Whitney?",

The good news is, we are going to finally start to see a lot of this cold air begin to recede in the coming days. But today, we still have that cold in place.Take a look at all the areas that you see here highlighted by the wind chill warnings and wind chill advisories. Still a very wide spread area. Again, it goes still from the Dakotas all the way down across portions of Florida. Again, it's not just the cold temperatures, but it's also the wind. Buffalo sustained wind of 32 miles per hour right now, but it's gusting to 56. So you take that temperature they have. You factor in that wind. And if you were outside any exposed skin that you have, is going to be dealing with that wind chill. Cleveland 25 miles per hour, Detroit around 30. Even some of these Northeastern cities also starting to see those winds tick up around that 15 to 25 mile per hour range. When you mix the wind with the snow, you end up getting blizzard conditions. So that's why you still have a pretty significant amount of blizzard warnings out even though in some of these places. It's not necessarily that any new snow is coming down. It's just picking up all of that snow that's fallen in the last 24 hours and blowing it down reducing the visibility even more. We do have some snow. Most of the snow today is going to be limited to the Great Lakes region where you've got that lake effect enhancement across portions of Michigan, areas of upstate New York, as well as Ohio. Most of these areas likely to just pick up an extra 2 to 6 inches of snow. But a couple of the spots here where you see that pink color especially around Buffalo, still not out of the question to pick up another 1 to 2 feet of snow total. Temperature is still pretty cold today. The high today in Minneapolis only 4 degrees. 13 for the high today in Chicago, even Atlanta will not reach the freezing point today. But I have good news. Warmer temperatures are on the way, just not today. We will finally start to see the vast majority of the country dealing with warm temperatures once we get to about mid next week. And then it's likely going to stay that way for at least the latter half of the week. And for Christmas, while we do still have a couple of snow showers across areas of the Midwest for tomorrow, a lot of the other areas while cold guys, we'll be dealing with some sunshine.",

If you know older people in the cold and if they're alone, check on them to see how they're doing.Also, alcohol and caffeine, it can hurt your body's ability to deal with the cold. So be careful with caffeine and be careful with alcohol. Don't drink too much. Also, when it's cold inside, if you're heat isn't working well, do not use generators, do not use any kind of stove top or anything like that in order to stay warm. That can actually be a real fire hazard and can really be a problem. Also if you find yourself catching a cold in the cold, there's a reason for that. Recent research looked at the nose. The nose is the first line of defense against germs, and what the researchers found is that cells that line the nose, that are designed to fight off those germs, they just -- they don't work so well in the cold. They kind of suffer in the cold, and that's one of the reasons why we do catch colds in the cold. Whitney, Martin?",

The Ukrainian military says that two Russian missiles struck the city of Kramatorsk in the Donetsk region. The city's mayor says that two schools, a dozen apartment buildings and three private homes were damaged there.This latest fighting, of course, comes on the heels of Ukrainian President Zelenskyy's historic visit, that is to Washington to thank the U.S. for its support, and, of course, he wants to ask for more. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT, UKRAINE (through translator): Your support is crucial, not just to stand in such fight, but to get to the turning point to win on the battlefield.

But when President Zelenskyy spoke to the Congress, he made it very clear, that this is a fight that is going to continue because if it didn't continue, Ukraine would cease to exist. And I think, you know, from a political perspective as well as a military perspective, he did an excellent job in getting that point across.

The problem is, it's interpreted as a signal -- as being a signal of wavering and of not being a fully committed entity and providing aid to Ukraine. So, there's kind of a fine line.
