It doesn't change the fact that four gruesome murders took place in the seemingly safe town in this rural college community.But now that there has been an arrest, we've heard from people who feel such relief. A business owner came by the police department to drop off a gift. He said this community has been impacted emotionally. Everyone has been on edge. But it has also impacted the economy. He is a business owner and his employees are students, as are most of the businesses in this town. Other businesses have been impacted, where students have left because they don't feel safe. So they have been studying virtually and so many people are hoping this community comes together when students come back to class in the next couple of weeks. In terms of the Moscow Police Department there has been a lot of criticism over the last seven weeks because they did not release hardly any information. And any time we would ask why, they said they wanted to protect the integrity of the investigation. There were no leaks from this small department and they kept all of their information close. They say they are glad they did that. The police chief said he wouldn't change a thing and he is receiving apologies now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And a lot of experts say that's an underestimate.The CDC said up to 40 percent of people who had COVID eventually developed long-term symptoms. It's a big issue. Most people who died from long COVID were white, older and male. Unvaccinated people who became infected may have a higher risk of developing long COVID that can last weeks, months and even years after the initial infection and can sometimes go away and come back. Long COVID can cause difficulty in things like breathing, concentration, chest pain, depression and digestion issues. For more I am joined by Dr. Scott Miscovich, a national consultant for COVID-19 testing and the president and CEO of Premier Medical Group USA. Good to see you, Doctor. Let's talk about this long COVID. The CDC said up to 30 percent of people who get COVID have long-term symptoms, which is a huge number of people. What concerns you most about long COVID and is enough being done to research it? DR. SCOTT MISCOVICH, FAMILY PHYSICIAN AND NATIONAL CONSULTANT:  First, with long COVID-19, the single most important thing we are concerned about is we have not identified any real treatment. When you get COVID-19, you start developing long COVID. We almost have to pick and spot the treatments for the different conditions that you have. And the big three are clearly now the fatigue, the shortness of breath and the brain fog. And they are different and each one has a different treatment. So that is the biggest single problem that we have right now. The second issue is trying to get care and trying to fight through the red tape that the insurance companies and even the government puts into play to access care, because what you do for checking lungs versus checking the brain, it's quite intensive to go into rehabilitative therapy. What we would like is to have a treatment we could initiate early on so people don't go on to have this long COVID-19. But these are going to take a year and that doesn't help us right away.",

That is called a recombinant variant.

We will see another major vaccinebeing produced. And my prediction is by the end of second quarter we might see something called a quadrivalent vaccine, where they put multiple different strains to try to cover -- similar to what we do with the flu. And in the fall we will definitely be seeing a major push in the country for COVID and flu vaccines. But right now we are holding our breath.
