It falls just 12 days after the DNC and 56 days before the election. And CNN has now learned next week, President Biden will make his first formal appearance with Harris since passing the baton to her.CNN's Isaac Dovere is leading us off this morning. Isaac, we're now showing the campaign stops happening today and tomorrow. Those are on the screen right beside you. Trump's in Montana tonight, while Harris is going to be in Phoenix. What more can we expect to hear from her in the coming hours after that wild press conference that Donald Trump had yesterday? EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER:  Well, look, Sara, the way that Kamala Harris has tended to deal with what Trump has said about her is to kind of shove it to the side and focus on what she's saying. I think we're going to see more of that. Of course, this week is about the introduction of Tim Walz as the running mate and her first tour of a lot of these battleground states as the president nominee here. And so we're going to continue to see that introduction of Kamala Harris, that introduction of Tim Walz. Remember, Walz has been her running mate for all of three days now. She has been a presidential candidate for all of, I think, we're up to 18 days. So, that is where it's going to be, talking about who they are and why they think that they have a case to make to Americans about, things like personal freedoms, abortion, economics and what it is that they are offering that's different from Donald Trump.",

When he left in 2005, the questions that have come up in this past couple of days since he got in, courtesy of the Trump campaign, have been about whether he left knowing that his unit was going to be deployed to Iraq. His retirement came before the unit was officially notified of being deployed to Iraq, but there was some question of whether he had a sense that that was coming. He was also running for Congress at the time.But going back to that campaign in 2005, when he was elected in 2006, people in his unit and others were raising questions then of whether it had been a decision to avoid service in Iraq. [07:05:01] And the K-File reporting that we have says that he had a statement then in 2005 that said, I'm proud of the 24 years I served our country in the Army National Guard. There is a code of honor among those who have served, and normally, that's this type of partisan political attack comes only from one who's never worn a uniform. And he goes on to say, when you dishonor a veteran, you dishonor all soldiers and veterans. You owe an apology to all those who serve honorably. That should be said is very similar to what he and the campaign, really, the campaign on his behalf, have been saying over the last few days. And, of course, we're looking at this with Senator Vance making the attacks as someone who served as a Marine himself, and Donald Trump who got a deferment from ever serving in Vietnam.",
