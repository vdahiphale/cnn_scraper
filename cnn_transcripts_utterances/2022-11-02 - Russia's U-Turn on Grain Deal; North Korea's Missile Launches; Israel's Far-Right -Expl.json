A potential catastrophe avoided as Russia rejoins Ukraine's grain export deal. Then, North Korea launches the greatest number of short-range missiles in a day. And for the first time, one lands close to South Korean waters. And Benjamin Netanyahu is on track for a crucial comeback in Israel as partial election results suggest he could lead the country's most right wing government ever. Well, Russia has rejoined the deal that will allow critical grain shipments to safely leave Ukrainian ports. It comes just days after Moscow announced it was suspending its participation, accusing Ukraine of attacking a city in occupied Crimea. But after negotiations with Turkish leaders, Russia has changed its mind. Ukraine's president is thanking Turkey to help salvage that agreement. World leaders are welcoming Russia's change of course. U.S. ambassador to the U.N. saying Russia was convinced it can't stand in the way of feeding the entire world. In the meantime, the battle for the occupied Ukrainian city of Kherson is escalating. Ukrainian officials say they have struck an important target of Russian air defense system close to the stadium. Russian troops are preparing new defensive positions around the city, and pressing civilians to leave. Russia is facing the inside its own borders although it's unclear by who. Reports show a man preparing in planting explosives on a Russian helicopter on a base inside the country. There's no confirmation that Ukraine carried out the attack, although reportedly that sabotage very quickly. Our Nic Robertson joins us now from Kramatorsk in eastern Ukraine. Nic, good to have you with us covering all these developments. You are, of course, in Kramatorsk, where Russia has stepped up its offensive, albeit with conscripts who are poorly armed. Just how much impact are they having there on the frontlines?",

      "sentences": "Well, what seems to happen is when Russia pushes more troops into the front line, and thatseems to be what's happening here, the front line about 20 miles from here stretches sort of vaguely, roughly north-south. On the southern part of that, Russians have stepped up their shelling. Having additional forces there, it gives them the opportunity to increase their shelling, increase the shooting. However poorly equipped the recruits are, they've got a gun, they've got a trigger, they've got bullets is the way the Ukrainian military sees the situation. But I think significantly on the front line, not far from here, the Russians have opened up a sort of third hot zone, if you will. There are towns like bomb went where Russia's been putting a lot of pressure for a long time on that town. Other key places along the line -- but they've opened up a new hot zone like that as well. So, that really for Ukrainian forces is drawing their attention, the heavy fire, the additional hot spot on the front line and it reinforces the understanding -- conversely, of course, on the front line north of here, it's Ukraine that's been able to take some of the ground. So it's not a simple picture, but one here at least, or Russia has significantly over the past 24 hours or so stepped up its attacks.",

      "sentences": "It's very obviously sabotage. It appears to be two Russian helicopters that are damaged. The impression it creates is that there aresaboteurs who can penetrate Russian air bases. And I think we've seen potentially similar examples of this in Crimea, where Ukraine didn't say what hand it had, but one Russian planes fighter jets in that time were actually destroyed on air bases inside Crimea. Was it drones? Was it missiles or some sort? Or was it sabotage on the ground? There seems to be an increase in the ability of saboteurs, whoever they are, Ukrainian or just anti-Russian government, the gap in military complexes where perhaps the securities lax, because they don't feel that they're so close to Ukrainian territory that they're not in danger. And they're able to not only -- sabotage, but filmed it and go public with it very quickly. So, it's not only -- it's not only a message about destroying these helicopters, but it's an implication that other Russian bases will be vulnerable.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, exactly. We'll be on the lookout for more video like that.Nic Robertson for us in Kramatorsk, thanks to you and your team. Well, the U.S. is accusing North Korea of secretly shipping a significant number of artillery shells to Russia to use in its war on Ukraine. U.S. officials say North Korea is trying to hide the shipments, making it look like they're being sent to countries in the Middle East or North Africa. The U.S. has not provided evidence supporting those allegations. Benjamin Netanyahu appears to be on the brink of leaving the most right wing government in the history of Israel. With 86 percent of the votes counted in Tuesday's election, his Likud party and its allies are projected to win enough seats in the Knesset to secure a majority. If that holds, the former prime minister would return to office for a record sixth term despite his ongoing corruption trial. I want to get more now from CNN's Hadas Gold. He joins us from Jerusalem. Good to see you again, Hadas. So, this huge surge in support for the far- right. What's behind this push to the right, and how is this expected to play and government? How much influence will that half?",

Pyongyang found 23 short-range missiles yesterday. That's according to South Korean officials, the greatest number of missiles ever launched in a day. One missile landed close to South Korea's territorial borders. South Korea responded by launching three missiles off its own. For the global reaction and much more on this, I want to bring in CNN's Will Ripley. Good to have you with us, Will. So, almost two dozen missiles detected Wednesday, the most volatile situation we've seen in recent years. What do we know about the missiles that were launched this time? What is Kim Jong-un's objective?",

So far, it's been surface to air missiles, short- range ballistic missiles, and even missiles that Japan describes as having an irregular trajectory, which could mean tactical nuclear weapons with the ability to turn midflight, making them almost impossible to shoot down. Kim Jong-un's objective, well, he knows he can get away with this right now. The eyes of the world are pointed elsewhere.

Will Ripley for us, thanks so much for that report.Well, the Brazilian President Bolsonaro has stopped short of contesting the election runoff he just lost, his supporters are suppressing frustration and in some cases, disputing the results. In Sao Paulo, crowd prompted a headquarters prompting police to fire tear gas to disperse demonstrators. Bolsonaro signaled that he will cooperate with the transfer of power. How does the politically divide public move forward? CNN's Paula Newton reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA NEWTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Supporters of President Jair Bolsonaro were at the streets for the third day and in some cases, they were violent yet again. Now, federal officials are ordering military police to use force when they need to clear the demonstrations. That is why you continue to see sporadic events, you will see her gas being used. You will see water cannons. Having said, that protesters by large have been moved to the side, they have not actually been moved off the protest sites. For that reason these protests keep popping up. Having said that, all of this is motivated by the fact that Bolsonaro gave what was a terse and vague statement, he did concede that he had lost the election. All he said was that he will follow law and follow this process of transfer of power. Protesters that we spoke to said that they have the green light to stay out on the streets for as long as it takes, they are still waiting for him to decide whether or not he will accept those results. Now, having said that, that makes an already tense transfer of power much more contentious here in Brazil, a time when it does not need it. President-elect Lula Da Silva continuing to do -- take meetings and meet with international leaders, and now working for Brazil's environmental policy, as that environmental conference comes up in Egypt. Through all of this, investors are keeping a wary eye on Brazil. They do want this economy to try and restart itself, especially when it comes to the issues, the entrenched issues of poverty and inequality. Paula Newton, CNN, Sao Paulo, Brazil. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
