This happened early this morning around 7Now, police tell us that there was a woman who appeared to be sleeping on the subway car. The subway car was not moving at the time. And then the suspect approached her, lit her on fire, apparently using a lighter. That's what we learned during the press conference just a short while ago. The woman immediately caught -- caught fire. She was engulfed in flames and officers that were patrolling the station at that hour were able to respond and put out the flames. They were unfortunately not able to save her. EMS responded to the scene and the woman was pronounced dead at the scene. Now, police really just were able to give a lot of detail, thanks in part to the cameras that were in the subway car. This is a relatively new thing here in New York City, Jessica, that we have nearly full subway cover when it comes to surveillance cameras. That was how they were able to get very good, clear images of the suspect, which they then arrested several hours later. One very important detail which the law enforcement officials went into is that they were able to disseminate those images through the media and the press, and then they got a tip from three young New Yorkers. The police commissioner said that they were high school age, who saw the man and reported it to the police. They were able to make an arrest and he is now in custody. I want you to take a listen to the police officials just describing this incident earlier this morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Officials were pretty scant with details. They were still working to ID the victim, frankly, with the suspect, all they could say is that he had arrived in 2018 from Guatemala. That was about all we got. What more are you learning? MILLER: When they took the suspect into custody, he basically self- identifies. They did not find any, as I am told from my sources, they didn't find any ID on him. So they're going by his statement as to what his name was, what his date of birth was when he arrived in this country where he came from. Of course, they'll be running fingerprints and other records to see if they can confirm that ID, including where he's been staying, and to document all that background. But right now, they're not able to speak as to whether he has any prior record, any prior record of violence or violations on the subway, because all they know about him, at least at this moment, is what he's told them.",

And we were deprived of that video during the investigation, I was a part of, the push to get those cameras in every station, in every subway car makes a real difference. And here's the other irony here, which is the police commissioner we saw speaking, Jessica Tisch, before she was police commissioner and sanitation commissioner and commissioner of Internet for the city, she spearheaded NYPD technology as the deputy commissioner there. She was the one who introduced the body cameras to the street, which were critical today, the ability to transmit information to 36,000 phones that police officers were carrying, including images, which was instrumental today, pushing NYPD social media. So as she comes around to her new role as police commissioner, she's literally reaping the benefits of her own hard work from years ago.",

He suggested that he would sit down early in his presidency with Russian President Vladimir Putin to try to solve the Ukraine War, something that, of course, he has been saying he would do for months. He also talked about seizing control of the Panama Canal, though he offered no clues to as to how he intended to do that. And he also pushed back on this, this criticism that we've seen from Democrats in recent days that Elon Musk, his powerful billionaire ally, is somehow serving as a de facto president. And Trump said that he is just someone who's very smart and working very closely with the president- elect on policy as they get ready for this new White House. One thing he also did was he gave a really strong show of support for some of his more controversial picks for his cabinet, for example, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Donald Trump stood by him and said that he in fact, he echoed some of the vaccine skepticism around vaccines and autism that RFK Jr. has helped spread throughout the country and really causing a headache for the medical community. Also, a show of support for Pete Hegseth, his defense secretary pick, and to Tulsi his choice for director of national intelligence. Take a listen to what he had to say about these people, and also the crowd reaction for these individuals as well. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: But to get wokeness out of our military and restore the unquestioned strength and fighting spirit of the American armed forces, I have appointed Pete Hegseth to be our next secretary of defense.

The goal of their deportation policy and program will be to terrorize entire communities of immigrants, and quite frankly, non-immigrants, many of whom are here legally. And so what will be the consequences of these actions that now they are admitting to planning to execute very shortly? Communities will be scared now to engage in public services, to include ER facilities, scared to send their children to school, scared to go to use public transportation, and perhaps most importantly, scared to work with law enforcement when they themselves have knowledge of a crime. And anyone who knows an ounce about law enforcement knows that that is law enforcements bread and butter. That's how they track down criminals. That's how they solve cases when people in communities have knowledge of crime. So look, this is not moral, what they are proposing. But I also have to say that it is not a political winner.

We don't always get the cooperation with the host governments. That one would think, even for cases where there are valid removal orders against them. But the case of the grandmother who is in the country unlawfully and may be working -- I mean, I think that's where you use some discretion. But again, if they pick up people in a raid and they find people of high priority and others who are in the country unlawfully, are they just simply supposed to ignore them? And we've frankly, we've had a problem at this in this country because too many people have, you know, have claimed asylum and they're really not legitimate -- legitimate asylum cases. I mean, they're economic migrants, they're poor, but they're not asylum cases. And that system has been abused. And I think it's long past time that Congress cleaned that up and deal with those folks, those folks who arrived most recently unlawfully should also be high priorities for deportations.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Well, the German authorities have now acknowledged they did indeed receive a warning from Saudi Arabia about this individual that is now being held as the suspect in this Christmas market car ramming. That individual has been named as Taleb Al-Abdulmohsen, a 50-year-old man, a doctor, a psychiatrist who was originally from Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia. He is anti-Islam. He describes himself as an Islamophobe and has often posted on social media, you know, very aggressive messages against Islam. He called himself the most aggressive critic of Islam in history. He has been warning repeatedly on social media that Germany is trying to Islamize Europe, posting conspiracy theories and things like that. You can see the marketplace behind me has still been sealed off with these police cordons everywhere, as forensic teams scour through the debris of that attack, picking up any evidence they can. Of course, while cleaning the streets, to be frank of the blood that has been left on the pavement as a result of so many casualties.

Poultry farms are also in danger. Fifty-one poultry farms in the state of California just this fall have tested positive for bird flu. And we spoke to a chicken farmer in San Diego who said that he hasn't yet been impacted. But if one of his chickens gets sick, he will have to euthanize the entire flock. So, major concerns there. In terms of human to human transmission of this strain of the bird flu, that has not yet happened. And officials are reiterating that the risk to the public is very low.

I first just want to ask you if you're concerned about this outbreak and what your level of concern might be. DR. PETER HOTEZ, BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE PROFESSOR: Yeah, my -- my level of concern is -- is significant. I don't want to be alarmist. The good news is we've not had person to person transmission. So it looks like all of the human cases and there's been about 60 to 70 human cases have either been contracted from cattle, predominantly in California or from poultry in Washington state and Colorado for the other half. But one thing we know is that it only takes a single mutation in the virus to facilitate better transmission between people. So it's something that we're watching very closely.",

So you can at least take that off the table.It doesn't protect you against H5N1, but at least you'll know that if you are feeling sick, its less likely to be seasonal influenza. And, of course, keeping up with your COVID immunizations. And then remember that a number of dairy herds now have H5N1 in the milk, as of December, or first week of December, the USDA is implementing mandatory testing, but drinking pasteurized milk, not raw milk, is going to be very important. And then same with poultry products, whether it's eggs or chicken, you want to be able to heat that at the specified temperature or higher. So not -- no undercooked chicken or eggs either.",

The U.S. government has recently announced that they're going to try to stockpile around 10 million doses of H5N1 vaccine by the first quarter or the spring of, of next year. Right now, they're not immunizing people at occupational risk, such as dairy farm -- farm workers. They have started that in Finland.
