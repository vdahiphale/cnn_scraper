Joining me now is UNICEF spokesperson Ricardo Pires. Ricardo, thanks so much for coming on. We know the executive director of UNICEF spoke to the U.N. Security Council this week in part calling for a ceasefire and especially for the protection of children. That being said, at this moment, it does not appear a ceasefire is happening in the immediate future. So what can you do to help those civilians who need the help that you're trying to give?",

      "sentences": "-- less 25 days for children.We have reportedly over 3.6 thousand children killed since the beginning of this conflict, 7,000 at least reportedly injured. So that's an average of over 420 children either killed or injured every day. So what we're trying to call for, or what we are appealing for is an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. So these numbers can hold. Let's imagine, for example, if we get a three-day pause, we're saving nearly 1,000 children already or more. So for now, that's what UNICEF is doing. We're calling for a ceasefire. We're calling for the immediate release of hostages as well that are being held in Gaza. And on the ground, our colleagues, our brave colleagues who are still staying and delivering are trying to support the best way we can. But the truth is the situation is very desperate. Supplies are getting in and they're not sufficient. Whatever is happening on the ground with children, they are not safe. There is no safe place for them to stay. And for UNICEF, unless we have that space to work to operate, to distribute our supplies, to have the logistics aligned with our partners on the ground and the corridors open, not only in Rafah, but other corridors as well. It becomes very difficult to deliver for children and the real cost of this war will be measured in children's lives.",

Some of them who've seen their houses collapsed, their parents being killed, so they're traumatized, they're scared.And they need support. They need to feel like the world is somewhat engaging and trying to take them out of this hell situation that they live right now. UNICEF managed to get 34 trucks into Gaza, which is a very small number compared to the needs. It's a small drop in the ocean. Obviously, it's good to have supplies getting in. It's good to have clean water getting in, some food, some medical supplies and hygiene kits, so they don't have -- children don't drink contaminated water and are exposed to waterborne diseases, but it's not enough. It's very little compared to the needs on the ground.",

So it's a whole generation being threatened by conflict and violence. And again, UNICEF is calling for that humanitarian ceasefire and for the release of all the hostages.

And then also hearing from the prosecutors that they do not intend to seek the death penalty in this case.Now, he was arraigned today. It was supposed to happen two weeks ago, but the judge allowed him time to find legal counsel. However, that didn't happen. So he was given public defenders today, because the judge said that she wants to continue to get this court case moving along. Obviously, this was one of the biggest mysteries is who killed Tupac Shakur. And law enforcement officials saying they've put enough together to say that they do believe that it was Davis, also pointing to his own statement, saying that he was actually there in that white Cadillac just over 27 years ago that pulled up next to the vehicle that Tupac Shakur was in. He was shot four times and died six days later. It's interesting to note that the other three people in that Cadillac have already passed on. But what law enforcement officials say is they do believe that he was the one calling the shots. That Davis was calling the shots that led to this tracking down of Tupac Shakur and then ultimately to his shooting. So this is just the beginning of it. The next time that we'll see any proceedings in this, that we possibly could see Davis in court, is on November 7th. But obviously, things getting started here. And one of the biggest mysteries in hip hop and in rap, who killed Tupac Shakur law enforcement saying they know who that person is. And they do believe that it is the man who also goes by Keefe D.",

They're serious and they're showing up on one of the world's most highly traffic websites where millions of Americans get their news every day.Donie O'Sullivan joins us now. And, Donie, a reporting that all of this came after Microsoft laid off journalists and started having AI do their work. DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right. Look, I mean, msn.com, a lot of people will remember it. Might be surprised that, you know, it is still a huge massive homepage for so many people. It's because, you know, when you buy a new PC, a new laptop, oftentimes even phones or tablets now, it comes with that Windows Microsoft software loaded up onto it already. And as a result, people have a some form of Microsoft homepage. Now on those home pages, they put news and a lot of times news from credible major news organizations, including CNN. And up until 2018, Microsoft said it had 800, 800 editors working first around the world kind of curating this experience to make sure that misinformation wasn't making its way onto these home pages that are viewed by hundreds of millions of millions of people. But what we have learned through speaking to people who have been laid off by Microsoft and others familiar with what is going on at the company is that they have basically replaced most, if not all of their editors, with artificial intelligence. And what we've seen observing this as we've reported on this over the past few months is all these a lot of incredibly, just factually false stories, including a lot of stories about President Biden supposedly falling asleep at a memorial. A minute silence for the Maui wildfire victims to some just really hyper partisan stories and -- that are attacking as it happens, Democrats and President Biden. But then also kind of random stories, for instance, saying that a politician in California resigned over a scandal, which just didn't happen at all. One other was in obituary for a former NBA player who died expectedly, and this obituary that seemed to be created using AI call this NBA player useless. So all these things are happening.
