It seemed like this was America first and the rest of the world a very much second.LESLIE VINJAMURI, HEAD OF U.S. AND AMERICAS PROGRAMME, CHATHAM HOUSE: It really was and it wasn't so much about, you know, America matters more than the rest the world, it was just a complete absence of talking about the rest of the world for so long. There was, you know, two thirds of the way and he turns to Russia and China. There's a word on global challenges. But so much of this was really about unifying America. Making sure that manufacturing comes back to America, about the dignity of work. And it was about a certain kind of America. And also, it was about middle class Americans, working Americans, ensuring that they capture the gains of their productivity, of their own work, that they are free. He has that moment where he says, you know, you need to be able to compete. You need to be able to cross the road if the person across the road offers you a better salary. So, we're taking away the restrictions that have made it harder for you to thrive or taxing corporations or taxing billionaires. So, it really was, as you said, it really wasn't about the rest the world. But there was some acknowledgements that America is going to really focus on itself and rebuild. In part, in order to contribute to those big global challenges.",

He demonstrated high energy. He seemed really together and confident. And he was signaling, you know, let us get the job done, let me finish what I've done. So, he outlines all the things that he's done to invest in infrastructure, to invest in semiconductor chips, bringing that production back home, keeping America safe, keeping America competitive. But the job is not.And so, this is a president who wants the American people to come together to support him, to finish that job. Those bipartisan bills that many of which -- and it was amazing actually, given how divided America is to listen to that list of bipartisan legislation that has actually passed. Not something we think about. And then he also then turn to democracy. And he said, you know, democracy should not be a partisan issue, our democracy is not broken. Thinking back to January 6th, that's a big statement, in a very deeply divided and polarized United States. But really, it was a very positive speech also not just energized but very positive. And I think this is really critical for a president who wants to bring people on board, bringing working class Americans, bringing white working-class Americans as well as a racially diverse set of Americans on board. Very difficult things to do. In the Republican Party, as we, know has been very good about trying to peel off of some of those constituencies that have been core to the Democrats in the past and aren't anymore. So, this is a president that seeking to have a broad church follow him.",

You can have a robust democracy and all be behind that in terms of every member of the political establishment. But that you'll always have this push and pull and this robust exchange with the opposition. It was almost confused at points, because Biden did list these bipartisan achievements. But then there were a couple of digs, and Kevin McCarthy behind him looked uncomfortable, at points.

They're claiming disinformation, that, you know, our borders are not secure. That there's violence, that far more people are dying of fentanyl overdoses then the president has let on. And we will undoubtedly see the division now come out.And I think, you know, you make a very interesting point, that really in a healthy robust democracy, you need contestation, you need it to be safe to disagree. And there's a sense in the United States that we've gone past that point. And so, this is a president that's really is trying to rein it back in. One idea that stands behind this nation in setting the American nation apart from all others -- I think there's a little bit of fiction there, but a very important point, and again, designed to bring everybody together and unify them, a very high bar today.",

This is what we have assessed could be her name from what we're hearing from intelligence agencies. And even from Dennis Rodman when he went to visit Kim Jong-un in North Korea. So, that's how little we know.We assume she's about nine, ten years old. This is the fourth public appearance that we've seen her at as far as we know. And so what this is doing is obviously putting the speculation into overdrive as to whether or not this is an official coming out, an official sign that she is going to be the successor. Now, we have heard some experts say that they believe that there was a good chance the fact that at such a young age, she is being brought out into such significant events, military events. I mean, the first time she was seen back in November of last year, was for the launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile. So, it was a significant event in itself. And of course now, we are seeing the 75th anniversary of the creation, the foundation of the Korea Peoples Army, the military in North Korea. And we've seen a couple of days of events like this where the military is front and center. So, we have been visiting the military barracks, which state-run media showed pictures of today -- this Wednesday. Just a day earlier, we understand from state run media that Kim Jong-un had had a meeting aboard the leaders, of the military leaders, saying that he wanted war readiness to be improved. He wanted more military drills. And that had to be increased. And potentially, in a matter of hours, we could see a significant military parade in Pyongyang itself. Now I say potentially, because until it happens, we simply don't know for sure.",

As the numbers sadly continue to climb, as far as the death toll is concerned, and what was this massive earthquake some 50 odd hours ago. Tens of thousands injured, many of those are, you know, children, many kids have lost their lives in this. Thousands, injured and sadly died in this, according to UNICEF.There are pockets of hope, this is one of, them this is the scene that we've been outside now for some 24 hours. There's a family that the rescue workers here have heard knocking. Now they've been in touch with them. And certainly, know that they've been alive now for some time, what, 50 odd hours. And you can only imagine the condition this gentleman his two sons are in. But there is a sense that they're very close to extracting that family from this site here in Kahramanmaras. Part of what we are seeing across this region is an in pouring of support from the international community. More than 70 countries sending support. I came in with the UAE for example. They brought in heavy lifting gear, they brought in search and rescue personnel and a field hospital, which is being established about 100 kilometers from here, very, very close to the epicenter. And what happened, and where the greatest needs are. But countries around the world really throwing their weight behind both Turkey and Syria. Let's get more on that.

As you laid out, they're at least 70 nations, 14 international organizations pledging support for Turkey and Syria.At the stage, the support being offered to Turkey is somewhat more robust than that being offered to Syria. And there is concern of, of course prior to Monday's earthquake, Syria, and this particular region in the northwest of the country was already in such dire need. More than 4 million people they're dependent on humanitarian assistance. So, there is a real sense of urgency there as well. Particularly, of course, with the harsh weather conditions, as your team has been experiencing a Turkey. So, there is significant concern. But as you mentioned, we're seeing search and rescue teams arriving in Turkey from across the globe to support in that rescued effort. And of course, each and every minute counts here. We are also seeing humanitarian assistance in the form of financial aid, in the form of medical support, blankets, food, arriving from across the globe. But there is that significant concern still around the situation in northwestern Syria. We've learned now from the United Nation that the actual crossing from Turkey into Syria is moving difficult to get across, because of destruction caused by the earthquakes. So, there is concerns there. but talks are ongoing to create some sort of way for that aid to get to those most in need in Syria -- Becky.",

China rejected an opportunity to have a call, a very high-level call between Austin and his counterpart. This is important for a number of regions. First, Austin, as well President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Anthony Blinken have called on the importance of diplomacy and communication, especially during a time of heightened tension with the competition between the U.S. and China. But it's also noteworthy because in China's first statement at the acknowledge responsibility for the balloon, they also called for diplomacy to handle the heightened tensions.

This on, the back of U.S. President Joe Biden's State of the Union address. In that address, the U.S. president addressed China, saying the United States is seeking competition not conflict with China. He did not directly mention the balloon, but he did imply and mention the balloon in the following He said, quote, if China threatens our sovereignty we'd like to protect our country, and we did.Of, course the Chinese balloon prompted a political uproar in the United States and also China and the United States. It prompted America's chief diplomat to cancel his planned February visit to Beijing. And today, we heard from the ministry of foreign affairs a direct response to Mr. Biden speech. Let's bring it up for you from the ministry of foreign affairs spokeswoman, Mao Ning, who said, quote: We oppose the U.S. smearing China under the banner of competition and restricting China's legitimate rights to develop in so far to exacerbate the global supply chain. She goes on to say: China will handle Sino U.S. relations based on the principles of mutual respect, peaceful cooperation, and win-win cooperation, while resolutely defend our sovereignty, security, and development interests, unquote. Since the U.S. military shot down the Chinese balloon, we know that the rhetoric that we've heard from China has parted increasingly and China right here are holding the line that it was serving its own sovereignty.
