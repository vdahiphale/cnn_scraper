The prime minister's office says that should happen in the coming days and as Netanyahu insists, the Israeli military is preparing to enter Rafah.U.S. officials say separate talks with Israel about what happens next in Rafah could take place as soon as Monday. They were supposed to happen earlier this week but Netanyahu called them off after the U.S. refused to block a U.N. resolution, calling for a ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages. And Israel hasn't set a date for the Rafah operation to begin. There are more than 1 million Palestinians taking refuge in Rafah. Officials have said they plan to evacuate civilians before starting a ground offensive. Meanwhile, Israel has been conducting strikes in Rafah for weeks. On Friday, a Rafah hospital official told CNN that 14 Palestinians were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a house. Among them, four women and seven children. Israel's defense minister says Israel will also defend itself outside of Gaza. Yoav Gallant says the IDF will pursue Hezbollah anywhere and everywhere, including in Beirut, in Damascus. This comes after Israeli airstrikes near Aleppo killed dozens of people, including five Hezbollah fighters. CNN's Melissa Bell has more on the strikes in Syria and in Lebanon. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

What we've been hearing from Israeli officials and specifically from Yoav Gallant, the Israeli defense minister, is that Israel intends far more aggressively than it had before to pursue Hezbollah, where it needs to, not just in southern Lebanon but beyond. Yoav Gallant saying that it is time that Israel strange changed its strategy. Now what we understand from American officials is that that had been made plain to them when he visited Washington earlier this week. The United States extremely worried about what this may mean with Hezbollah, presenting a far more formidable foe they believe than does Hamas. It comes this ratcheting up of tension, violence along Israel's northernmost border, as there is some hope now for the hostage talks and their resumption. We've heard from Benjamin Netanyahu that he is now going to be sending a delegation of Israeli officials back to Qatar and Egypt to resume those indirect talks in the hope that the remaining more than 130 Israeli hostages still in Hamas' hands might be released.

There are mounting obstacles both on the inspection process and also on the distribution of aid within Gaza. And really since the beginning, since October 7 and after the really horrific attacks by Hamas and others on Israelis, aid has been used as a weapon of war. It's being used to pressure, to punish the civilian population. And the most significant obstacle that we're seeing on the distribution of aid is lack of safety, problems with what's called the deconfliction process. So that's allowing humanitarian convoys to travel through the Strip safely. We're seeing aid being systematically denied to the north of Gaza, where some 300,000 people are now in the most catastrophic stages of hunger. They might already be facing famine. So Gisha is leading a coalition of organizations in Israel. And we're basically calling on Israel's high court to order the Israeli government, the prime minister, the defense minister, the army to enable all access of humanitarian aid. That includes equipment, that includes staff; we're calling on them even to open more crossings, land crossings between Israel and Gaza and to take on their responsibility as an occupying power.",

There's not enough medicine, medical equipment, staff in the hospitals. The health system is on the verge of collapse. Actually, most of the hospitals aren't functioning. You only have about 10 hospitals out of 36 partially functioning, right now. To meet the devastating claim or the devastating reality of famine, you're going to need a multi-sector response. It's not just about food, it's about water, it's about medical equipment, it's about staff. It's about providing medical services to children who are already suffering from severe malnutrition. So these claims that Hamas is stealing the aid, look, of course, there are problems with people taking aid. That's a phenomenon that's known around the world. But what we're looking at is really a simple numbers issue, it's math. It's basic math. What we've seen is that, in the last six months, the amount of aid that has come in is barely scratching the surface of what would come in in a normal month.

You'll find details on how you can help at a special section of our website, cnn.com/impact.The Israeli military has acknowledged it shot two Palestinian men in Gaza, then buried their bodies with a bulldozer. The admission came after news outlet Al Jazeera published heavily edited video that says it shows the incident. And we have to warn you, this video is disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRUNHUBER (voice-over): So here, you can see one man walking along a beach. Al Jazeera reports that this man and another were waving what appeared to be white clothes. At one point, the man raises his hands in the air. Later, he falls to the ground apparently after being shot. The video then cuts to a scene where an Israeli bulldozer is burying two bodies in sand and debris. It's not clear if these are the bodies of the two men shown earlier. Al Jazeera says they are. The Israeli military says the video shows two separate incidents. And here is their statement. \"The first incident occurred in the southern part of the corridor after the suspect did not respond to a warning shot. The force fired to his direction and he was shot and slightly wounded.\" The IDF says that man was released after receiving medical treatment and being questioned. Regarding the second incident, the IDF says, \"Two suspects with bags on their backs, observed our forces and approached them in a suspicious manner. After not responding to a warning shot, the forces conducted live fire toward them as a result of which they were killed. \"The bodies were moved from the area using the documented tool out of fear of there being explosives on the suspects and risk to the forces.\" CNN has asked Al Jazeera for an unedited copy of the video. Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is still trying to get the prosecutor kicked off the case in his Georgia election subversion trial. His legal team appealed the ruling allowing Fulton County district attorney Fani Willis to stay on the case. Trump and several co-defendants asked the Georgia Court of Appeals to overturn the decision. They also want the entire Fulton County DA's office to be disqualified. At an event Friday evening, Willis appeared to have referenced the judge's warning about her previous comments on race, stemming from a speech she made at a church earlier this year. Now those comments, she said, her then lead prosecutor was being targeted because he's a Black man. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The group is asking people to adopt an egg to pay for the cost of incubation and raising the chicks before they return to the wild. Some experts say rearing new healthy birds is the key to the survival of the penguins that once thrived in South Africa.",

By 2035, according to scientists and with the endangered status, it really is important that we do everything we can to protect the species.HOLMES (voice-over): Ronnis Daniels says the African penguin population has less than 10,000 breeding pairs left. That's down from a total population of 1 million African penguins about a century ago. One of their biggest threats is commercial fishing, which has depleted foods sources like sardines and anchovies that penguins eat. The organizations says it takes four months to raise a healthy chick from an egg. And any help this Easter, in the spirit of the holiday, could hopefully breathe new life into a struggling species -- Michael Holmes, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

In the men's Sweet 16, Friday, number one, Houston fell to number four, Duke 54-51.After Houston's star guard suffered an injury. Meanwhile both Purdue and Tennessee have secured their Elite Eight spots. And number 11, North Carolina State, advances by knocking out number two Marquette. That sends the Wolf Pack men to their first Elite Eight since 1986 while the women's team will advance after their win over Stanford. For more on this, I'm joined by CNN sports analyst Christine Brennan. She's also a sports columnist for \"USA Today.\" So Christine, after last night, South Carolina still the team to beat?",

The officials, the athletic directors, I wouldn't look at their phones. It's very rare that they'd be playing at the exact same time as the men's and women's tournament. And yes, the men went on and beat Marquette, big upset. And North Carolina State's men's team won the ACC tournament, kept beating teams that they -- everyone thought they'd lose to. They've won eight games in a row now in the postseason, counting the ACC tournament. And in the North Carolina State, women upset Stanford and that's a bit of a surprise because Stanford, it was the number two seed.

My goodness, it wasn't happening even five years ago. And Iowa is the number one seed. They've got a tough match up against Colorado, a big strong team. Could be, could be a challenge for Iowa. I always got to -- Caitlin Clark, has been, of course, we would presume play well. The supporting cast, her teammates have to step up from what they did the other day. And right before that game, so Caitlin Clark obviously, the big name, the star of the basketball season, men's or women's this year. But right before that game, LSU, the defending national champion, will be playing against UCLA. So you've got these two blockbuster games back-to-back, LSU against UCLA. And as soon as that ends in Iowa and Colorado. And if in fact Iowa and LSU were to win those two games, then they would play each other Monday night. So it would be a rematch of the national championship last year. But it wouldn't even make it to the Final Four. It would only be in the Elite Eight if, in fact, Iowa and LSU win, one of them will be knocked out before the Final Four.",

That's a tough roster to crack. Great, great stars.But Caitlin Clark has been invited to the training camp, which is the same weekend as the women's Final Four. So Iowa's playing, she won't be at the training camp. If Iowa were to lose the next two games, one of the next two games, then Caitlin Clark would be at that training camp for the Olympic team, the only collegiate player to be invited. There's another option. There's the fun 3-on-3 tournament, started in Tokyo. U.S. won the first gold in Tokyo at the Olympics in 2021. Caitlin Clark would be a natural for that. And that's going to be picturesque, with the Eiffel Tower in the background, Place de la Concorde. That's where that that fun tournament will be, the 3-on-3 basketball. So yes, there are a couple of options to see more of Caitlin Clark because, as we know, we can't see enough of her right now. And I think the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee and USA Basketball would like to see Caitlin Clark representing U.S. in Paris. We'll see how it all plays out.",
