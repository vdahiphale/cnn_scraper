The debt ceiling already 31 point 4 trillion.Including in that, a range of conservative policy priorities and cuts across the board and domestic programs, including adding a plan to block President Biden's loan forgiveness program initiative that rescinding new funding for the Internal Revenue Service as part of the Democrats Inflation Reduction Act that was enacted last Congress. It would also boost new -- provide new work requirements for social safety net programs like Medicaid. But even as including some of those provisions intended to appease conservatives, some conservatives are not there yet.

Now the question of sustainability, durability of that position, is I think one that's kind of up in the air right now. As Manu mentioned, Democratic leaders in the House and Senate very much in line, spoke to the President by phone earlier this week, rank and file up to this point, have maintained their position behind the White House.

This all comes just two weeks after a special counsel in that state released a report that uncovered new evidence in Glossip's case and suggested that his murder conviction should be vacated. CNN's Brynn Gingras is always is with us on the story. And Brynn, what was the evidence uncovered in Glossip's case? BRYNN GINRAS, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Jake, a lot of that evidence is from a box that was finally given to the defense team for Richard Glossip from the prosecutor's office. And in that box, there was just a lot of paperwork that talked about Justin Sneed, the person that you just pointed out who actually killed Barry Van Treese, the boss of Sneed and Glossip in this murder decades ago. Some of that included Justin Sneed actually wanting to recant his testimony to his -- asking about it at least, to his attorney and other was a psychiatrist saying Justin Sneed had bipolar disorder that was never been brought to the defense's attention. So just questionable things that the defense attorney for Richard Glossip thought the courts should look at a little bit closer and at the very least, let there be another hearing regarding all of this new evidence. But of course, as you just laid out there, the criminal court of appeals in Oklahoma and a five zero decision said no, it wasn't sufficient evidence to vacate this conviction or at least stay this execution. And now, time is running out quite honestly for Richard Glossip. His execution date is May 18. There -- this is a case that has just grown internationally. A lot of people would like to see a change in this ruling, not just his defense attorneys, but also the attorney general mentioned it and actually asked the criminal court of appeals to bring this case to the lower courts. In response to that the attorney general, who is a Republican and my ad in the state of Oklahoma, said in a statement, \"I am not willing to allow an execution to proceed despite so many doubts, ensuring the integrity of the death penalty demands complete certainty. I will thoroughly review the ruling and consider what steps should be taken to ensure justice.\" I asked his office what does that mean, and they said they're still trying to review that.

So there's no reason to believe that witness at all.So we've got a person who is the only one that has said Richard Glossip had anything to do with this, is now, you know, an admitted liar, and the court won't see through that and allow a new trial. So we will be filing a writ in the United States Supreme Court, and we probably take action in other courts as well. We cannot allow this. I'm with the Attorney General in this. He's a very courageous man to take the steps that he's taken. And when he says he can't allow this to stand, well, you know, I can't either, and we won't.",

He says he's not willing to let the execution proceed with so many doubts. Can the Oklahoma legislature do anything to help? Is there a role for Governor Stitt, perhaps? KEVIN MCDUGLE (R), OKLAHOMA STATE REPRESENTATIVE: There is, absolutely. And we are going to fight and make sure we're not putting a guy to death that doesn't deserve death. Governor Stitt, we're going to ask him to give a 60-day stay. That'll give us a little bit more time. The Court of Criminal Appeals stated state law is the reason why they couldn't go along with the Attorney General. So we're now looking at adding a paragraph in the post-conviction relief law in Oklahoma here in the next five to 10 days, getting that through and signed by the governor. So if we can make that change and send it right back to the Court of Criminal Appeals and see if they can make another decision.",

At 07:45 a.m., a military jet dropped a bomb on the building where they'd gathered, according to witnesses. Minutes later an MI-35 attack helicopter mowed down survivors and continued to circle for the next 15 minutes, firing at anyone who moved. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): We heard a boom. I hit the ground and there was a huge cloud of smoke. I got up and realized my daughter was missing. COREN (voice-over): As the wounded screamed for help, this man searched among the dead and injured for his three-year-old daughter and his parents. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): It was a killing field. There were people scattered everywhere. A woman with burst intestines died in front of me. I was shaking.

With fears of more aerial attacks, villagers quickly gathered the bodies for cremation. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Burn. Burn. Burn. We are trying to burn the flesh of the dead. COREN (voice-over): The day's final death toll, according to the National Unity government, 186 people killed, the deadliest attack since the junta seized power in a coup more than two years ago. The military confirmed the bombings, saying they were targeting rebel forces who've been fighting Myanmar's military government. But CNN has interviewed over half a dozen eyewitnesses of last week's attack who say the target was civilians. This man lost 30 relatives, including young nieces and nephews. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I don't know why they targeted a place full of pregnant women, children and the elderly. The military are not human. They are more savage than animals.
