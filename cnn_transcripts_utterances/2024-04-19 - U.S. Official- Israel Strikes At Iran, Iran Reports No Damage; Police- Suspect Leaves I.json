This is what we know right now. And Iranian official says its air defenses intercepted three drones near an army base in central Iran. Iranian commander reports no damage was done and state media saying all nuclear sites are secure. Israel, meanwhile, isn't commenting but a U.S. official says Israel carried out the attack. Iran appears to be downplaying it even though its leaders had repeatedly warned Israel would face a severe and immediate response if it launched any attack on Israel.

KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, listen, the first U.S. official that we have heard from since these strikes occurred overnight was Secretary of State Antony Blinken. But he did not even directly acknowledge or directly confirm that those strikes had occurred, he would only say that there are reports. And he said that the U.S. was not involved in any, quote, during -- in any offensive operations. That's something that the U.S. wants to make sure so that they avoid U.S. involvement in this ongoing back and forth between Israel and Iran. He went on to say that the U.S. is focused on deescalation. And they will continue to be focused on deescalation by not commenting on what occurred overnight. He's almost embodying that commitment, not trying to pour more fuel on the fire that has been this back and forth between Iran and Israel. He did however, come out and very clearly say that the G7 stands with Israel and the defense of Israel, particularly after what he called the unprecedented attack from Iran with hundreds of drones against Israel last weekend.

They're not sure which but certainly armed and was then holed up inside the embassy. Then a huge police operation is still underway now. There's a big part of the Paris Metro that has been closed down. Well, we understand the very latest that the man has now left the embassy and he's in police custody. And they're trying to figure out who he is, how he got into the embassy in the first place and what he might have been hoping to achieve. But this is a city remember, Eleni, that is right now in high alert. It has been for several years and years now as a result of the terror threat of last few years. But the 3,000 military personnel that patrol the streets of France were doubled after the Moscow attacks of last month. So you see them much more. It is a city that is -- as its -- is at its highest level of alert. And so the police and military response was extremely quick. In fact, it is one of the elite police units that had just seen as soon as news of this emerged, but the man now has been removed from the consulate and we wait to hear more about exactly what his intentions were really.",

Here you see pictures of the former president arriving just a short time ago at the courthouse. On Thursday, Donald Trump's attorneys used up all of their, a lot of challenges for the initial jury. We will see how that plays out. They will of course have a couple of other strikes when it comes to the alternates as we move into that phase later today. We're also learning that hearing about just what prosecutors can say in terms of Donald Trump's legal history during the trial. That should happen later today.

He talks about that gag order a source of contentions for him. We know that a judge is going to be having a hearing next week bringing up issues that the prosecution has had saying that Trump has violated that gag order about 10 times. So we do expect that happened to Tuesday. But before any of that can happen, of course we need to find those or that they need to find those other alternates afford this case. We know that there's 22 jurors that are going to be brought in who have to go through that 42 questionnaire and determine whether or not they can be fair and impartial when it comes to being seated as an alternate on this jury. We know that, like you said, Trump's attorneys and also the Prosecution have used up all their strikes. But when it comes to alternates, each side has two more strikes per alternate. So more than they do, actually first seating the original 12 jurors. So we do expect that to happen actually before the lunch break. And then after the lunch break, we might get into what is called a Sandoval hearing. You just mentioned that there essentially, that is basically going to determine what sort of legal paths prosecutors can get into if Donald Trump actually takes the stand as a witness. We know in court filings, prosecutors said they want to bring up the civil fraud trial. They want to bring up the defamation trial with E. Jean Carroll, the verdicts in those. So the judge will have to determine what in his past can actually be questioned if he takes the stand. So there is a busy day in court today. And then of course, if this all happens, and is completed, that's right, on Monday, we might actually have opening statements for this historic trial.

We actually have footage of people who appear like they're backpacking through the mountains, which is what they're doing, but they're doing that so that they can get voting machines to some of these more remote communities and make sure that voters there have the opportunity to cast their ballot. Back in 2019 was record turnout here in India, 67 percent. And given some of the contentious issues at play in this election as the popular but controversial Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks a rare third consecutive term which would put him in office by the end of that term for a total of 15 years. He's already been in power for a decade. There are a lot of people expected to turn out. He has many supporters. And he also has a fair number of detractors, particularly those who are part of the Muslim minority here in India. You're talking about more than 200 million people, many of whom say they are marginalized under Modi's Hindu first government.

You're talking about youth unemployment between young people ages 20 to 24, more than 44 percent as of last year, Eleni. So a lot of issues on the ballot. This is phase one of a seven phase electoral process that will happen over the next six weeks. And they will wrap it all up on the first of June.

And it hasn'tfundamentally changed its attitude and its behavior. There was only one brief moment. And that was during the Obama administration. In fact, Biden was vice president then, when they negotiated the Iran nuclear deal. And for a brief moment, before Trump and Netanyahu pulled it out and dismantled that, there was a lot of tension in the region. And that was a brief moment where Iran's behavior on a number of fronts had been mitigated by this JCPOA, which no longer exists. So as you're probably seeing, and of course, I'm not an economic or an oil expert, our prices of oil going up. And guess who's the primary beneficiary of that, we'll obviously, the oil producers. But most certainly, Putin, who exports his oil, not through that area. And therefore sitting back, you know, just rubbing his hands with delight, that he can keep reaping the benefits of the West and the Middle East and all this disruption. I mean, the bottom line is there needs to be a diplomacy and negotiations to end the conflict in the Middle East and to find a political solution to Israel's conflict with the Palestinians, that's number one. And number two, which is kind of going through Congress right now, better late than never, to try to make sure Russia doesn't win in Ukraine, and try to provide Ukraine with the defensive weapons that it needs. So there's a lot going on.

Plus, Eleni, we have to remember that we are entering a U.S. election year. It's in Biden's advantage that oil prices stay at a lower range. So choking supply isn't necessarily going to be great. In terms of the Strait of Hormuz at Energy Intelligence, we expect that if we do get a blockage of the Strait, and you have 18.5 million barrels a day of crude and products combined, passing through that strait, we might see oil prices spike 250. That's a kind of, you know, extreme situation. Again, personally, I think it's very unlikely that that happens, mainly because we believe that China would not allow Iran to take that route, it would hurt Chinese interests in the economy.

Court resuming a short time ago, Donald Trump is in the courtroom and is seated there. A full 12 person jury and one alternate were finalized on Thursday. Ahead of today's session in court, the former President stopped by the cameras on his way into the courtroom, to reiterate some familiar grievances. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Thank you very much. As you know, I've been saying for a long while, this is a rigged trial. It's coming from the White House. They have White House, DOJ people in the trial in the D.A.'s office, representing the D.A. because he's probably not smart enough to represent himself as a guy got elected using Trump. And you're not supposed to do that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

David Weinstein is joining me now. He's a former state prosecutor, former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, who's also been following this case closely along with us. David, good to see you. So as we see these prospective jurors come in, we know the judge is saying he plans to have six alternate, so that would leave five slots this morning. Although it's clear, the judge did say he could change that number. Already one of those potential jurors has been excused. Talking about her anxiety, she said she was concerned as the trial went on. And as more people could know who she is a part of the jury that she may not be able to be completely fair and emotional. And that concerns her. This made me immediately think of what happened with a juror who was excused yesterday after raising similar concerns that her identity was a little too easy to track down. How much of a hurdle do you think that could be as they look to see these additional alternate jurors?",

And certainly anything that's going todistract a potential juror from concentrating on what's going on in the courtroom, or is going to make them feel like they have to succumb to external pressures are going to make people disqualified from serving as a juror on this panel. You want people who will be able to listen to what takes place in the courtroom. We can't have people throw away their biases that occur outside of the courtroom, we just need to know about them. So I think it's just going to make the process take a little bit longer. I know everybody is in a hurry to get started. Everyone wants to start the case on Monday, but they're going to have to get at least six alternates because who knows what's going to happen over the course of the next six weeks or so. And you need to have people ready and able to replace the jurors if one of them is excused.",

That's not going to be dealt with until Tuesday. But the rest of the world does not have a gag order here. And there are concerns about comments that are already out there, questioning the impartiality of the jury.

It would seem everybody's also understanding being very careful, though, with this process, even if it's moving quickly, because let's say there is a conviction and then an appeal, there is a chance to look back at the jury selection process.

There are I'm sure and have been jurors that the defense wanted, that they weren't able to keep on. They've expressed their concerns about that. That might be one small piece of an appeal. But it's going to depend upon whether or not the evidence that's submitted is overwhelming. And up to now I haven't seen anything that really jumps out that screams, oh, this is going to be a do over from the get go. The judge is keeping a pretty good handle on this. So, so far, it's moved a lot faster than all of us have expected. But I don't think anybody has done anything that's going to keep this one from going forward or that this phase of the trial is going to call for a reversal.",
