The front runner, using her given name Nimarata, and making false claims about her immigrant parents.

But as for Trump today, he won't be on the trail or in a courtroomlike he's been in previous weeks. Instead, he'll be in Palm Beach, Florida, attending the funeral of his mother-in-law, who passed away last week. The judge in E. Jean Carroll's defamation case against Trump refused to delay that trial to let Trump attend the funeral. This case will decide how much money Trump owes Carroll for defaming her. He has already been found to have sexually assaulted her. A reality that Senator Mitt Romney, who was once the GOP standard bearer himself, told CNN, he just doesn't understand. He told our Manu Raju, quote: I think a lot of people in this country are out of touch with reality and will accept anything Donald Trump tells them, Romney said. He went on, quote, you had a jury that said that Donald Trump raped a woman, and that doesn't seem to be moving the needle. There's lots of things about today's electorate that I have a hard time understanding. Joining us now is CNN reporter Alayna Treene, who covers Trumps campaign for us. Alayna, good morning. It's always wonderful to see you. Let's start with those comments. They were in response to some of the Iowa entrance polls as well. It showed that a majority of Iowa caucusgoers don't believe that Joe Biden was legitimately elected. I mean, this really shows how the Republican Party has changed. No?",

It's always been known that Donald Trump had a very loyal fan base that he could speak to directly on social media, that hears him directly and all of these rallies. But I think the interesting thing with this election as well is that a lot of that base has grown. I mean, a ton of Republicans really are rallying around Donald Trump. And I think that when an Iowa is a clear case of just how strong and loyal a lot of these voters are to Donald Trump, right?",

It's a primary. There's more people able to vote in this, you know, you have Republicans but also independents, being able to vote in this.And this is something that I know from my conversations with Donald Trump's campaign and his advisers that they are worried about, about the types of people voting in New Hampshire that are very different than what they had -- what they saw in Iowa. And so their ground game strategy is obviously different. And, of course, Nikki Haley does very well with moderate. She does very well with independents. And I do think that these types of attacks do you play differently in state like New Hampshire, and that's why you're seeing Donald Trump more fervently than ever escalate his attacks on Nikki Haley, really trying to do whatever he can in these final days to undercut her before Tuesday's primary and its also why I think you're seeing Nikki Haley, you know, she spent so much time in New Hampshire, far more time than she had in Iowa. And so, this is really I think a different state, a different type of voting bloc where the voters may not respond to these attacks, as well as they may have another states.",

He's long been a Republican donor, tried to be a player in these presidential primaries. He told \"The Financial Times\" yesterday that he's waiting to give her a nice sum of money until after New Hampshire. He told the paper, quote, if she doesn't get traction in New Hampshire, you don't throw money down a rat hole. That is a striking quote. But it does seem to lay out the stakes for Haley.",

I think a lot of people will agree with that statement that if she cannot pull it off in New Hampshire, that its going to be very difficult for her to keep up her momentum as she heads into Nevada and South Carolina. And I think a lot of the candidates also recognize that as well. Iknow that the former president and his team, just from my conversations with his campaign, recognize that it Haley does not do well in New Hampshire. She doesn't win New Hampshire, really, they believe that its only a matter of time until other candidates begin to drop out as well. Of course, those are all predictions we have to see what happens, but there's a lot riding on this. Donald Trump had such a massive when in Iowa, the points the way that he led -- it really was a dominating force for him and what his campaign wanted to do. They wanted to win by big enough margins that they think they could want them the momentum of other candidates. And so, I think a lot really is riding on New Hampshire. We also know that Donald Trump and his campaign believed that by mid- March would be able to have enough delegates for him to essentially be the presumptive Republican nominee, even though the convention is not until July. And I think a lot is riding on New Hampshire to see if they're actually able to do that.",

So, some concern about that, but I don't think were going to hear any updates, frankly, unless something unexpected happens or she actually leaves hospital, I'm sure we'll get an update on that, but I think people will miss her.
