A global investigation underway at this hour as law enforcement are working to learn more about the motive and the actions of the man behind what appears to be a second assassination attempt on Donald Trump. All of this unfolding on Sunday while the former president was playing golf at his club in Florida. A Secret Service agent spotted a rifle barrel poking through a fence a few 100 meters away from where Trump was then playing. The agent fired shots at the suspect, a witness telling police the man got into a vehicle and fled, and shortly after, the local sheriff's office detained a driver on an interstate highway. The man in custody, Ryan Wesley Routh had criticized Trump on social media. Interestingly, he also spent time in Ukraine. And recently wrote about other global hot spots, including Afghanistan and Taiwan in a self- published book. A source telling CNN a federal court will require Routh to undergo a mental health assessment before any possible criminal proceedings. Separately, the Palm Beach County Sheriff explaining the challenges that come with protecting the former president, especially in a sprawling outdoor environment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He said that the 58-year-old did not get off any rounds. That is very important here.

It was an intense interest, really bordering on an obsession, though, actually, all of his efforts to help Ukraine seem to have been frustrated. According to his book, he went to Ukraine initially to try and volunteer himself. He said he was willing to die for this country, but he was deemed, he said, too old and he lacked any military experience. So, he then turned his hand to trying to recruit other foreign fighters. He, at one point, according to his book, set up a sort of military recruitment office in Kyiv that that was apparently eventually, sort of dispersed by police. He then tried to target Afghan soldiers fleeing the Taliban to try to bring them in to join with the Ukrainian forces. That doesn't seem to have worked either, and there are two main offices within the Ukrainian military that handle foreign volunteers. Both of them have told CNN that he had nothing to do with them. One of them, in particular, with the land forces, saying that he did actually try to contact them a number of times, but calling his ideas delusional. So, look, I think it was clear that he was frustrated with this from some of his comments, including in his book. And it's also clear from this clip with an interview he did with Newsweek Romania, that he was transferring some of that frustration back onto U.S. politicians. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The sheriff yesterday of Palm Beach County said, you know, if it had been a president, we would have surrounded the perimeter with resources. But former presidents and candidates don't get that same level. It boils down to a resource question. Look, the Secret Service has 3600 agents. They have 1600 uniformed people who do the screening and guard the White House perimeter. They've got 2000 support employees. So, when you say, you know, a head count of 9000 it sounds like a lot, but when it boils down to it, it's 3600 people for the entire country across seven days a week, three shifts, add in vacation and sick. It's not that big a number. So, what they've been doing. And we learned this in the Pennsylvania issue was they've been relying on local law enforcement to be their backfill. But in the case of Palm Beach, if they had surrounded this golf course, that would have been Palm Beach County, West Palm Beach Police Department, the State Highway Patrol. It would have been a giant draw on resources for an unscheduled event with a person who you know is there regularly.

You can see that if he is, if he -- we know that he was putting he's finishing up the on the fifth hole, which means that the Secret Service detail was likely at or near the green on the sixth hole, because they stay one hole ahead of him, clearing the area. And it is in that transition from where the sixth hole ends to where the T boxes are for the seventh hole, which is basically at the very bottom of that map that you're showing right now. That is likely where this shooter decided to set up, because those T boxes are so close to the fence line. It would provide a pretty good -- a pretty good line of sight. And also, think about it, the T box is a place where, as a shooter, you could be pretty confident that your target is going to be confined to a pretty small area and also standing still for some period of time. So, you know, those are the sorts of -- those are the ways that snipers think about acquiring a target. And in a place like a golf course, you're going to have numerous opportunities for those sorts of lines of sight and moments of vulnerability.",

Now, you know,a lot of people will say, oh, it was a crazy plan. It would never have worked. Nevertheless, this is someone who thought through it. He armed himself not only with the rifle, but with protective implements that he thought would give him a better chance to get his shot off before he started taking fire. There were ceramic plates. They've been described as ceramic tiles, but not exactly the same thing, ceramic plates that are designed to stop rifle fire, specifically from impacting you when you're deployed with a Kevlar vest or something like that. And he's got those hanging from the shooting position there, right near the fence. He's got the GoPro stuck to the fence in an effort to memorialize what he's doing, which we know from so many mass shootings, is very important to many of these folks. So yeah, he's thought through this. He was probably there for some period of time, enough time to enable him to hang that stuff where he wanted to place it, and literally lying in wait for his target, who in this case was a Former President of the United States. It's really shocking, and really should cause a lot of people, most importantly, the Secret Service, to really rethink how they're thinking about the threats that are posed to the president these days, former president.",

This incident happening on Sunday afternoon while the former president was playing golf at his club in Florida. A Secret Service agent who was a couple of holes ahead of the former president spotted a rifle barrel poking through a fence. This was just a few 100 meters away from where Trump was playing at the time. There is now a man in custody, Ryan Wesley Routh, who had criticized Donald Trump on social media. Also spent time in Ukraine, where he was hoping to fight, but ultimately did not. Thomas Verni is a Former NYPD Detective and joins me now live from New York. Good to have you with me today. You spent so many years as a detective for the NYPD as we're looking at the clues that we currently have and the situation as it were in terms of the perimeter and the protection that was there.

That first assassination attempt on the former president at a rally there, when we look at the where we're at, you mentioned this country is a washing gun. That is a fact. There are a number of people who are likely unstable, who may have access too, firearms. Again, we don't know in this case. Important to note, we haven't even had the first initial court appearance yet.

I mean, there have been instances where people have lost, you know, 30, 40, 50-year relationships, friendships with people because of politics. It's just -- it's kind of ridiculous. You know, I believe, as a registered Democrat and as someone who's in law enforcement, I think the Democrats could be doing a better job as well, to be honest, to present better choices for us to choose from. The Republican Party can absolutely be doing better choices. I was kind of hoping John Kasich might throw his hat back in the race.
