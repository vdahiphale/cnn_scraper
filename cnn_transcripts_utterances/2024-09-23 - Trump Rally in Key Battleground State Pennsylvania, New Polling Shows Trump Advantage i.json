Now, of course, the vice president has visited the border as vice president, she's also done so as California senator and the attorney general. And sources tell me that no final decision has been made yet on this potential stop, but it is certainly significant because it is telling of the campaign see in the issue of border security continuing to crop up as a top issue among voters. [20:05:14] And if she were to go, she would go at a time when border crossings are low, the lowest they've been since 2020. Of course, the administration has citing executive action over the summer for the plummeting of those border crossings and it would give her the opportunity to talk about that in battleground Arizona, where again, as you mentioned, former President Donald Trump continues to hold a lead in those polls. So, this would be a notable stop if she were to make it, still significant though, that she's going to Arizona when the polling is so tight.",

However, he has talked about the last debate that he had with Vice President Harris, complaining about how the moderators treated him. He also said that Vice President Harris, he felt was terrible at the debate. He also criticized Vice President Harris' interview with Oprah that took place the past few days as well, noting that he and Oprah used to be close. But earlier in the day, former President Trump actually made a rare off-the-record stop when it comes to a grocery store and he actually paid for a woman's groceries at the store in front of cameras, really making it an opportunity to comment on the state of inflation in this particular country at this moment. Before that, he also held a roundtable with farmers and he was using that opportunity to talk about his ambitious tariff plans at one point, actually threatening the company, John Deere, saying that he would put 200 percent tariffs on, \"Everything that you want to sell into the United States,\" if the company moves production to Mexico.

Those polls looked good for Kamala Harris.And indeed, if you take an average across those three states, Kamala Harris has a small advantage, a two-point advantage. You look across those sunbelt battleground states, though I think there are a lot of Democrats saying in oh, these polls, they're too good for Trump, blah, blah, blah. The bottom line is, even when you average across all the polls, not just polls that come out today, you look across the sun sunbelt battleground states -- Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina, on average, Donald Trump is ahead by a point and a half. And I think this speaks to a larger issue that the Harris campaign has, which is she seems to be doing worse than Joe Biden did four years ago in states in which the Democratic coalition is highly reliant on voters of color. So, in North Carolina and Georgia, that would be African-Americans, out in Arizona, that would be Hispanics. She is behind his pace on with those particular voters. She's holding her own with White voters. And I think that's in large part why she is holding her own in the Great Lakes up in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, because the Democratic coalition is wider.

There were a lot of very smart professional people who decided to stay away because they knew there was trouble coming. Whoever Robinson is able to bring on if anybody now, wouldn't be the A Team, they'd probably be the Q, R, or S Team. And it doesn't matter because the race is over. What does matter is whether or not now this is going to have an impact on the presidential race and it certainly will have an impact to down ballot for the counsel of states and there's a targeted congressional seat in North Carolina, one as well.

The lead is within the margin of error, meaning no clear leader.Tensions surrounding the election could be felt today during a public meeting of the Georgia Election Board. Two members of the Republican controlled board defended their controversial new rule for requiring election officials to hand count the number of ballots cast on election day. A lot of election officials, Republicans and Democrats, say it could inject chaos into tabulating the results on the day. One Republican said of the lone Democrat on the board, you are creating a conspiracy based off an assumption.

She's also the author of a new children's book, her third, \"Stacey Speaks Up,\" which goes on sale tomorrow. Does this new polling concern you in Georgia? STACEY ABRAMS (D), FORMER GEORGIA GOVERNOR CANDIDATE: Not at all. Georgia is a purple state, meaning, this is a competitive state, and the lead is going to swap back and forth depending on how you model the voters. The winner will be the one who takes the time to cultivate voters, to turn those voters out, and to explain how their lives will be made better. And that is what Kamala Harris is doing every time she comes to Georgia.
