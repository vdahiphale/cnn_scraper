Tonight, President Biden reassures the U.S. andthe world the banking system is safe after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. And Biden moves on to a critical meeting with the United Kingdom and Australia. We'll explain their plans to stand up to China. Plus, how a serial sex offender was allowed to serve in one of Britain's most elite armed police unit for years. That, CNN's special investigation. But first, tonight, rest assured the U.S. banking system is safe. President Joe Biden delivering that message today to calm fears after the second largest banking collapse in U.S. history. But shock waves are still rattling investors right around the world. U.S. regulators took emergency steps after Silicon Valley Bank collapsed due to a run on deposits. They're guaranteeing depositors funds insured and uninsured amounts. They also closed a second bank on the brink of collapse. Mr. Biden says more protections are coming. Have a listen.

So, I mean, here's what they're doing, they're promising depositors or the Silicon Valley Bank and that second bank that collapsed, Signature Bank, depositors are going to be made whole, even above that $250,000 deposit insurance limit. And i think that they're basically, they're trying to prevent future bank runs before they even get started. And President Biden, he's trying to make clear, you know, two points, one, to the public, your money is safe. But two, that this is a rescue of depositors, it's not a rescue of the industry executives, It's not a rescue of the stockholders and the bond holders who have -- or getting wiped out here. But to your point, there is a lot of debate over whether or not this is enough. Because U.S. stock market actually is taking all of this in stride after some pretty significant losses late last week on this very concern. We've seen markets bounce back today, but what's interesting is that regional banks are not bouncing back. They fell sharply on Thursday and Friday, and they're falling again today, despite this new federal intervention. We've seen shares of First Republic Bank and Comerica and a number of other major regional banks. They're down 40 percent, 50 percent, 60 percent. I think the messages from the market is basically that, this may not be enough.

You bumped into somebody at a memorial, and her husband is fighting in the battle for Bakhmut, for example. I mean, the Ukrainians quite literally have a lot of skin in this game, they say that they are killing many Russian soldiers. They claim that the Russian tactic is to send waves of kind of prisoners, ex-prisoners who have been drafted into the Wagner Group. They send them first, many of those soldiers get killed. And then there is such a wave of soldiers that kind of dig in, and that this has this human waves have succeeded in pushing the Ukrainians back somewhat. The Ukrainian president has argued that the loss of Bakhmut could potentially open a road for the Russians deeper into Ukrainian territory. I do find that a little hard to imagine, being here in eastern Ukraine, seeing the sheer numbers of Ukrainian troops on the ground, hearing the thud of artillery and the distance from where I'm standing right now.

That's the same state in Mexico where four tourists were kidnapped recently. And so, they have to drive through Tamaulipas, Mexico, to get to Nuevo Leon.

Sky News reported they have been sending sexually suggestive messages to her. As yet no police officer has faced any consequences for failing to stop Carrick for so many years, the U.K.'s Police watchdog has now reopened a review into the handling of Carrick's case despite previously saying they had no cause to investigate. And the force continues to struggle to prove it can keep women safe and hold its officers to account. CNN reached out to the Met Police for this investigation, and they referred us to their existing statements on Carrick. They said they would not be commenting further while there are ongoing government reviews into the handling of his case. And since Carrick's sentencing, more potential victims have come forward to police. Meanwhile, the Center for Women's Justice told CNN that some of Carrick's victims are now considering a class action lawsuit against the Met Police.

It marks the end of a week long political meeting that saw Xi further consolidate his power and drive home how China needs to fortify itself against America's campaign to contain the country. Less than a day after his speech, U.S. President Joe Biden hosting British and Australian leaders to discuss details of the new AUKUS defense pact that's seen as a bid to counter China in the Pacific. China's new Foreign Minister, Qin Gang, has accused Washington of plotting an Asia Pacific version of NATO and called America's China strategy a reckless gamble. But Li Keqiang tried striking a more conciliatory tone in his first press conference as Premier, China's number two official. Lee said U.S. and China decoupling is hype, pointing out that trade between the two countries reached a record high last year. One of Xi's most trusted proteges, Li is the former Shanghai party boss that oversaw the city's brutal two-month COVID lockdown last spring. He tried downplaying Beijing's crackdown on tech and private businesses, calling on officials to support private sector growth. But Li steps into premiership with a tough road ahead, the economy still battered after three years of tough COVID restrictions, U.S. sanctions, and deteriorating diplomatic relations with the West. But China's economic and political powers are growing elsewhere. Beijing hosted talks between Saudi Arabia and Iran that led to a breakthrough, the two nations agreed to bury the hatchet and restore ties. It's a geopolitical wind amid growing concerns about Beijing's deepening ties with Russia and refusal to call the conflict in Ukraine an invasion. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

At the same time, we have to be honest here the first subs won't arrive in Australia and -- for another 10 years and they won't be -- get the new subs for another 15 years. So, it's really more about the symbolism than it is about the subs. And we have to see this in the context of a region that is mobilizing to respond to what has been termed as the greatest military buildup in human history by the Chinese government, an expansion of their nuclear arsenal, an expansion of their conventional forces, an expansion of their territorial ambitions, and their menacing of Taiwan. And we have South Korea reacting to that, Japan is doubling its defense budget over the next five years, and Australia is also getting into the game.

It's kind of like saying I am rubber, you are glue, anything you say, bounces off me and sticks to you. So, I'm not surprised by that line of rhetoric.

He's a 62-year-old revered former player as well. He was the Golden Boot winner, the leading scorer at the Mexico 1986 World Cup, then he becomes a very successful broadcaster. He'd been taken off air following those tweets you referenced, which criticized the British government's controversial new migration policy. During his playing careers, with Leicester City spurs and Barcelona reacting on Monday by saying he's delighted to have navigated his way through this. He thanked all his colleagues, including the many former professional footballers that came out in support of him what he called her a remarkable show of solidarity. He did have this tweet, though, and it really does resonate. It caught our eye certainly. \"A final thought,\" Lineker tweeting, \"however difficult the last few days have been, it simply doesn't compare to having to flee your home from persecution, or war to seek refuge in a land far away. It's heartwarming to have seen the empathy towards their plight from so many of you. We remain a country of predominantly tolerant, welcoming, generous people as well.\" I do want to get to the BBC's Director General Tim Davie, I want to elaborate a little bit more. We played that clip that you just had. And this is really significant because he announced a review of the BBC social media guidance would be led now by an independent expert, acknowledging the existing guidance had caused potential confusion. He added \"Gary is a valued part of the BBC. And I know how much the BBC means to Gary, I look forward to him presenting our coverage this coming weekend.\" That was the heart of this issue really, Isa, that Lineker is a freelance broadcaster for the BBC. Therefore, he's not bound by the same guidelines as staffers there at the corporation. I expect to see him back hosting for the BBC when Man City take on Burnley on Saturday in England's F.A.

I'm April Havlin haven't, and I direct House of Hope International. We work in Nicaragua, Honduras, and Bolivia. Last year, we were celebrating My Freedom Day and we were scheduled to speak in several public schools near the home where we work with adolescent girls coming out of trafficking. And so, we went into the school and my coworker, who is a human trafficking survivor, told her story to the girls. And then I explained to them what trafficking is. And I told them that was a trap. One little girl came forward and she said, oh, my sister's already gotten caught in this trap. And it was really heartbreaking to hear her realize what her sister had been going through and what was the reality of her sister's life. And that brought about two young women moving into our home. One who was the older sister of, one of the girls that was there on My Freedom Day, and another was a girl who'd been kicked out of the school because she was being prostituted out. My Freedom Day was the absolute catalyst that brought out that event. And now our focus has been visiting brothels, and street corners, and places where the women would be in prostitution where we could talk to them. But most of those women had been trafficked a number of years ago, but we had never had an opportunity before My Freedom Day to reach out to little girls in school. And so we have, within the last several months, uncovered a large group, at least 16 underage girls, elementary and middle school girls that are being trafficked. They were identified because of one girl that was a friend of one of the girls who came into our home because of My Freedom Day. But we're speaking in that school this year on My Freedom Day. So, there may be many more than the 16 that we've identified. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
