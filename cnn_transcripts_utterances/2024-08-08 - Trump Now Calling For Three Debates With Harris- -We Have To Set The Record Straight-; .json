Kamala Harris has done pretty much everything right, for the last few weeks, and including the stunning choice of Tim Walz, and the way that's played out. I'd be careful, if I were her and her team, to not too quickly say no to debates. I think this is something that's happened with lot of candidates, who are doing well. They get overconfident. They seem to recede and play it safe, and then the public starts to feel a little bit queasy. I think she should say, sure, I'll do three debates.

NATASHA ALFORD, SENIOR CORRESPONDENT, THEGRIO, AUTHOR, \"AMERICAN NEGRA\": You could feel the desperation in that press conference, today. I mean, the hyperbole, the exaggeration. There was fear- mongering, almost to scare American voters into thinking that they again have to vote for him, in order to save the country. But I think he doesn't know where to place her. Because she's a prosecutor. I think the strengths that so many things -- so many people like about her are her personality. Some of the things are intangible. It's charisma, it's the joy, right? Who would have thought that her being a person, who could be both serious and funny, would work in her favor?

And so, there's a breach inside the campaign. He's upset with the two campaign heads, right now. He's trying to figure out if he should go back to the 2016 version of his campaign. And a result of all this, he's in great rumination and frustration inside of Mar-a-Lago. And that's why he called that press conference. He went -- he went around, and he basically said, OK, I'm going to show all of you guys how it's done. I'm the Alpha big dog. You guys are dummies. I have this very big brain. And so, I'm going to go out to the press and spew garbage for 90 minutes. And I can guarantee you. When he walked off that podium, he thought he did great, and they told him he did great. But it was like a lot of unhinged mania. And I think it reminds people of what his presidency was like between 2017 and 2021. And so, that's why he's not campaigning.

Our CNN's Senior Crime and Justice Reporter, Katelyn Polantz, is following all of the breaking news, has been reading through this filing. And Katelyn, what just stands out, right off the bat?

They need more time even to plan out what the next steps will be. That's three weeks away. And Kaitlan, one of the things to remember here is there is not going to be a trial before the election, in this federal case, against Donald Trump. That has long been known since the Supreme Court decided, almost 40 days ago, on this presidential immunity decision. And then on top of that, within the Justice Department, they are very well-aware that once we're into September, there can't be overt investigative activity that's taking place. That's a department policy. And then, on top of that, there's a question of whether there will be any substantive or consequential court hearings, when those would be able to take place. Would they happen in September and October? A lot of this is going to ultimately be up to the judge. But we were expecting a filing, laying out the plans, from the Justice Department, tomorrow, a hearing, next Friday. That does not appear to be where the Justice Department wants things to be going. And we'll have to see what Judge Tanya Chutkan does next. The Trump team, of course, is very happy with the idea that delays are what is in court, right now, before the judge.",

It's another piece of uncharted territory, of how much they're actually going to be able to do in September, October. But I think the other issue is the Supreme Court decision on immunity is an extraordinarily broad decision. And it's wrong in many respects, in my view. One respect in which it's wrong is that it's too simplistic in its assessment of how the Executive branch works. And I think within the Justice Department, you have a lot of components that have responsibility for protecting the Executive branch, but also prosecuting criminals. And before Jack Smith plunges ahead with whatever his view of how to interpret that immunity decision is, the rest of the department has to come to agreement. COLLINS: Yes.",

I think this was a mistake, in 2020. Trump was the cause of many Republicans not casting early ballots, because he insisted they would be fraudulently abused by the Democrats. Well, in 2020, why weren't his lawyers in court, in August, September, October, trying to stop all this vote harvesting, all this illicit activity?

Because this is, the worst fears of every Secret Service agent, as you're putting together a security plan, came to reality at that moment. When you know about the breakdown in communication, the breakdown in roles and responsibilities.Now knowing that there was 40 seconds, there was a gap of 40 seconds from the moment that an officer went onto the roof, to when the shots started getting, going down-range towards the former President, that is eternity in law enforcement, to try to prevent that action from happening. What we did not hear were calls on the radio, notify the Secret Service, pull the former President off the stage. There was a lot of things we didn't hear, in terms of communication in action. Why? Because it wasn't coordinated beforehand. Those officers, clearly, from this video that we're seeing, did not understand their role and responsibility on that day. They were acting as they would normally act, in a patrol situation, not a protective mission.",
