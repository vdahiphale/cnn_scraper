Those include allegations of fraud related to filing for unemployment benefits, misusing campaign funds and lying about his personal finances on official filings.Santos was released on a $500,000 bond. He's set to appear in court again at the end of June. And the judge ordered him to surrender his passport and he'll now need to get permission if he wants to travel outside of New York or D.C. CNN's Brynn Gingras, she's been following this for us. She joins us now. Brynn, George Santos, he goes -- he's taken into custody. He appears before the judge. He comes out and he is definitely not staying quiet amid these charges that he is now facing.",

GEORGE SANTOS (R-NY): This is the beginning of the ability for me to address and defend myself. We have an indictment. We have all - we have the information that the government wants to come after me on. And I'm going to comply. I've been complying throughout this entire process. I have no desire not to comply at this point. They've been gracious in there. Now I'm going to have to go and fight to defend myself. The reality is, is, it's a witch hunt. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Just before midnight it will officially expire, along with several pandemic-related measures. So, what changes will you see? No more free Covid testing for most of us. Now, most patients will have to share the cost with their insurance companies. Certain treatments, which have been covered by Medicare and Medicaid enrollees will now have an out of pocket cost. Vaccines, however, will continue to be free for people with insurance. And, for those without insurance, Pfizer and Moderna say the vaccine commercial price will likely be between $82 and $130 per dose. Dr. Tom Inglesby is the director of the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. He is with us this morning to sort through all of these changes. I want to start with this. There is a lot - there was a lot of consternation as we look back because that -- hindsight is 20/20, when it comes to some of the measures that were taken by the CDC, some of the things we were told, like you can wear any mask. It doesn't matter what you put on your face. And then that changed over time. What do you see? Was there damage done by the CDC during this whole pandemic era? DR. TOM INGLESBY, DIRECTOR, JOHNS HOPKINS CENTER FOR HEALTH SECURITY: Well, good morning, Sara. Thanks for having me. I think, looking back over the last few years, we now see that while CDC has been a national treasure and has gotten us through many, many outbreaks, epidemics, and really is the envy of public health agencies around the world, CDC didn't have all that it needed to be able to respond to Covid. And so it exposed some of the challenges CDC has in gathering data quickly from around the country. It exposed the fact that CDC doesn't have enough operational people in the field or connections at times for state and local officials. And so I think CDC has really been thinking through and planning a lot of changes since last summer. Director Walensky really deserves a lot of credit for that. But they're going to need the help of Congress to really get the authorities and the budget flexibility they need to be able to respond to Covid-like events in the future.",

The country has relied on CDC for technical guidance. Doctors and nurses look to CDC for scientific advice when new diseases arise. And just doing that job well is going to be very important. And I think they have been - really changed their practices a lot since Covid as they began to respond to monkeypox, for example. I think they need more -- hiring authorities from Congress, the ability to contract with the private sector more quickly. Some of these things they can only get through new legislation.So, I think they're going to do what they can internally and already have started to change this large organization over time, over the last ten months, but they're going to really need a lot of help from Congress to be able to do it as efficiently as possible to have the budget they need. I mean here's an example. They have - their budget is divided into 160 lines which cannot be moved one to the other. So, if you're the director, imagine yourself in a business trying to move your budget around to respond to crisis. They can't do that. Congress could fix that. And I really hope they do.",

Health officials in Gaza say at least 25 people have died since the air strikes began Tuesday. Palestine militants have retaliated, reportedly firing more than 500 rockets towards Israel.There's also some new developments in Pakistan we need to tell you about. The country's supreme court has just ordered the release now of former Prime Minister Imran Khan. He's been detained since he was arrested on Tuesday on corruption charges. Charges that he denies. His arrest, though, has sparked violent protests across the country. In Islamabad, for example, nearly 200 people were arrested in demonstrations that resulted in widespread damage. And in Malaysia, quite a surprise for some local police when they found two brothers, just six and three years old, behind the wheel of a car following a late night crash. They were alone in the car, their parents still at home. The father was asleep. The six-year-old made it about a mile and a half before losing control of the car and crashing into a lamp post. Look at this little guy. No one was seriously hurt, thankfully. This is why I'm able to have this face. Police say the boys took the car because they apparently wanted to head to the store to buy a toy car, John.",

This equipment gives Ukrainian forces a new, longer range strike capability in advance of an expected counteroffensive against Russian forces. The news comes as Ukraine's military says that its troops have conducted what they call effective counter attacks in the Bakhmut area. That city in the east that has seen fierce fighting for 11 months now. According to Kyiv, Russian troops have already been pushed back as much as two kilometers in some areas.CNN's Nick Paton Walsh is in the Zaporizhzhia region. Nick, Ukraine has been asking for missiles with a longer range for some time. It seems that they are finally getting it. What kind of a difference could this make?",

      "sentences": "Yes, it does appear they already have them. They've been asking the U.S. to supply the ATACMS, with its 185-mile range, but these U.K. Storm Shadows have 150 mile range, which essentially brings much of the Crimean peninsula, occupied by Russia, possibly even some part of Russia's border areas, although it's clear as part of this donation they will not be striking inside Russian territory proper before the 2014 reestablishing of borders by Russia's occupation. It does potentially allow Ukraine to be more targeting of key Russian military infrastructure in those occupied areas.And I wonder if this announcement is perhaps coming out, to be clear, that it's a U.K. donation allowing them to have this greater effective range, so there's no confusion as to whether the U.S. had, for example, secretly supplied some extra capability. It does potentially change the precision and depth that Ukraine can exercise into occupied areas. But also, too, it's important to point out, we've seen sabotage. We've seen drones attacking some of these areas in seems over the past weeks, too. So, a clear sign, I think, of the United Kingdom often wanting to be the first to supply tanks or seeing the most pioneering in terms of what it's willing to give Ukraine. Does that put greater pressure on the United States to add to the inventory? We'll have to wait and see. But it again puts emphasis on when this counteroffensive may begin or we may see it publicly. We're hearing today too from Russia's mercenary head, Yevgeny Prigozhin, that his forces are losing grounds in parts of Bakhmut, having to withdraw into that city center he says because of Ukrainian counter offensive. And he goes on, after days, frankly, of railing against the mismanagement of the war by the Kremlin's top brass, he goes on to warn, this potentially could lead Ukraine to push all the way through and make a decisive strike inside occupied areas. On top of that too ahead of this counter counteroffensive, president -- former President Donald Trump's comments yesterday refusing to say he wants Ukraine to win the war. That's going to focus a lot of minds here as to how vital this summer is and how western support isn't a guarantee forever. Back to you.",
