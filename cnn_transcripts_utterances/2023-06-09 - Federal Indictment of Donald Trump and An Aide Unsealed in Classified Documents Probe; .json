This is the very activity and action that he went after Hillary Clinton on. As you said, he talked in his 2015 2016 campaign so much about locking her up. Here is a quote from November of 2016 about Hillary Clinton.He said, her current scandals and controversies will continue throughout her presidency and will make it honestly look bad. It's going to virtually make it impossible for her to govern. Well, the same standard applies right here. I think it's really important for people to understand now that we know what we are talking about, this is a different situation. But it still shocks me, Anderson. I talked with Republicans across the country. And many are still standing by him. There's a cult of personality behind Donald Trump that will continue to stay with him. And even the more information they have, they will continue to say. Because they feel this is an unequal distribution of justice. But as we heard Jack Smith say quite plainly, there is one rule of law in this country, and it applies equally to everyone. And Donald Trump is finding that out.",

This is a whole new level of hypocrisy. And when that hypocrisy infects national defense secrets -- by the way, these national defense secrets they don't change. It's not like every week there is a new plan to -- you know whether it's war in Iran or something like that being planned. They stay on the shelf.
