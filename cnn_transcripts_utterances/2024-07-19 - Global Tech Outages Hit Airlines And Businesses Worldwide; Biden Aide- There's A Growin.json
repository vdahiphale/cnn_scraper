So in terms of a global IT outage, not a hack, not a cybersecurity breach, this is the biggest in terms of flight disruption we've ever seen. The good news is some of the airports who were really badly affected, like Amsterdam's Schiphol, have managed to restart some of their systems. The same goes for a Spanish network from airports, AENA. And you can hear it, the flights taking off. I hope you can still hear me.

Those dynamics will not exist in November. I think the Trump campaign, appears to me, to be focusing on low propensity voters to try to make up that 81,000 vote gap that made the difference in 2020. And that's a very different and unique mathematical strategy. We'll have to see obviously in November, if that actually pans out for them. The speech was long. It was way, way too long. I thought he started off very strong in the first 25 minutes. And I even tweeted, I said, oh, wow, this is the best speech he's ever given. And then towards the half of it, I said, oh, crap.

I've only seen, I think, one or two national polls that showcase Vice President Harris potentially performs a point or two better than the president. And that's mathematically within the margin of error. So by all intents and purposes, it's like she doesn't really perform better than the president at all. And so I think from a Republican perspective, whomever the candidate is, you know, that Apple (ph) research and negative campaigning will focus exclusively on that person. But I got to tell you something, there are a lot of democratic voters who voted for President Biden. Now, I personally think the president should get out, but I'm not a Democrat. Those voters want the president to stand this race. And I think it's a bit rich for these wealthy donors, the democratic leadership to attempt to usurp the will of their voters for somebody else. I mean, that is just not the way, you know, democracy works. I mean, Republicans, I'll just quickly say, are excited and energetic about Donald Trump this November.

What's happened is Biden has dropped because concerns about his age after the debate. So Trump is completely beatable. But look what's happening. In the last election, Joe Biden led in the national polls, 100 percent of the time from wire to wire, every single poll of the -- of the country in 2020 had Biden winning.

What is the response now in terms of perhaps once this trial is now over, the real negotiations about any sort of exchange, prisoner exchange can really begin.",

      "sentences": "Well listen, the initial response from the Biden administration is as you would expect withthe President of the United States reiterating that Evan Gershkovich did not commit a crime, saying journalism is not a crime, saying that the U.S. will continue working tirelessly to free Evan Gershkovich, saying that there is no higher priority. The Secretary of State also spoke today, reiterating some of those remarks saying that the State Department's office here, the special envoy for hostage affairs who works on these efforts will continue to do so, does so tirelessly on a daily basis. And there are questions, however, even though this verdict was perhaps expected, this guilty verdict. There are questions about how speedy this trial went along. It was just a number of court appearances for Evan. That is in stark contrast to what we have seen with other cases where it has taken, you know, months even up to a year for there to actually be a verdict. And U.S. officials aren't commenting on background around the record about what a speedy trial could mean for negotiations. But previously, when you talk to U.S. officials they've always said that there really needs to be a verdict in the judicial system of Russia before they can get the wheels actively turning on those political efforts, those negotiations, those conversations to secure the release of an American who's wrongfully detained in Russia. We saw that with Brittney Griner. We've seen that with other cases. So it could be hopeful that this went along quite quickly. The other question mark here, as many folks will recognize, is the fact that there is the presidential election here in November. And their questions as to if Russia would want to hold off on any negotiations to see what happens in those elections. The Secretary of State was actually asked about that today and he downplayed the effect that the elections could actually have on negotiations. He said that the negotiations go on both sides, you know, know what they want to be the final game. They reach their conclusions. And he went on to say that he doesn't think that that conclusion is dependent on U.S. elections. I think some others would have questions about that, you know, hanging over this process here. It's been ongoing, of course, for Evan Gershkovich for more than a year now. And, of course, there's Paul Whelan who's another American, who's been wrongfully detained for more than five years in Russia who the U.S. is also trying to release. So those efforts are ongoing, but it's really hard to know just what stage they are at right now.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Well, I mean it's not clear that the fact that this trial sort of ended in a guiltyverdict just three weeks after it formally began necessarily means that there's a fast track towards a hostage exchange or a deal that would see Evan Gershkovich released. I mean, what critics that I've spoken to have said is that, actually, it says a lot more about the sort of politicization of the Russian judicial system. The fact that they didn't have to really weigh the evidence in what would have been a very complex, presumably, and, you know, obviously, a very serious case. They kind of knew what the sentence was going to be, what the verdict was going to be, and how many years they -- you know, they were going to put him away for. And they just sort of cut straight to that as soon as possible. And it does lift an important bureaucratic obstacle that the Russians themselves put in place, which I think is Kylie was saying. You know, they made it quite clear they didn't want to see, or they wouldn't allow a deal, a swap to take place, until a verdict had been reached. That's now sort of beyond that point. So that's a -- that's a good thing. But I do think we have to bear in mind that that deal could take months, if we're talking about a Trump administration deal, if he wins the election, of course, or it could take even years if it happens at all. Remember, Paul Whelan, who is another U.S. citizen, a former U.S. Marine, has been held since 2018, sentenced to 16 years for spying as well. There have been efforts underway for the past six years to try and, you know, organize a prisoner swap with him, and that hasn't happened yet. So, yes, there is a possible route through this with a prisoner swap deal, but that could be a long, long way away yet.",

According to FlightAware, nearly 6,000 flights have been delayed in the U.S. alone. One cybersecurity expert says the outage is set to be the largest in history. The outage is crippling airports across the globe, grounding flights and leaving passengers in limbo. It's also creating disruptions for financial and emergency services.

This wasn'tMicrosoft's problem, but it was the CrowdStrike update that got Microsoft, in some cases, off on the wrong foot. And it doesn't have to be a direct connection either. For example, in some places, the planes were ready to fly, but the systems inside the airport to get people there were not ready to work. So it has really touched so many different fields. The government has been talking about how Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice affected, Social Security affected, package deliveries affected, hospitals affected, banks, retail sales, all sorts of issues out there. So the fact that CrowdStrike now says they fixed the core problem doesn't account for the fact that this is like a leak in your house. You can get the water cut off. But once the water is everywhere, you've got a huge cleanup. And honestly, Bianna, there's a lot of signs that getting through this is going to take several days here because now you have all these people who missed flights, planes aren't where they need to be, crews aren't where they need to be.

So the old joke about, well, have you turned it off and on again? Actually, in this case, if you have a Microsoft computer that's all affected by this update, it really is the best thing to do. You know, there are estimates that this is going to take some days, perhaps even weeks to fully recover from the impact. And not just as Tom was saying there in terms of the backlog, but even just for the machines themselves. And that's because you can't issue that update, you can't roll it back automatically and remotely.

There are -- the very basic things that we ask people to do to protect themselves, their communities, their businesses, they definitely still apply. I think it does ask another question really, which is that CrowdStrike is a market leader, they're so dominant in the third-party cybersecurity market. And it's a bit like the questions we have around big tech dominance in general, the Microsofts, the Metas, the Googles of this world. The bigger they get, the more we trust them to, you know, know what they're doing with their software, to know what they're doing with their engineering.

They've blamed diversity initiatives for everything from the Baltimore bridge collapse to safety issues and airliners. And their latest target is this assassination attempt of the former president. They've blamed both the female Secret Service agents who were on stage with him and also the female director of the Secret Service, Kimberly Cheatle, who's the second woman to hold the job. For the women on stage, they say that they couldn't possibly protect somebody like the former president because they're physically smaller than him. They've claimed that some of them acted unprofessionally in the chaotic aftermath of that. I do have to say I spoke to a former deputy director of the Secret Service and other law enforcement professionals who have all pushed back on that saying that all those agents acted very professionally and courageously. And even Eric Trump, the former president's son, said in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper that these women, specifically the female agents on stage with him, would lay down their lives for him and call them as courageous as they come. Others have, of course, gone after the Secret Service director, Kimberly Cheatle. Now, of course, there are major questions for the Secret Service about how this could have possibly happened. But some in the right-wing media sphere are saying that it's Kimberly Cheatle's fault that she was only hired for the job because she is a woman. They've specifically gone after her initiative to try to get more women into the Secret Service by 2030. But I should note, Cheatle has decades of experience in the Secret Service. She was on Biden's own detail. And then she also led global security for Pepsi, one of the biggest companies in the world. Now, in a statement, the Secret Service has pushed back on these attacks saying, \"It is an insult to the women of our agency to imply that they are unqualified based on gender. Such baseless assertions undermine the professionalism, dedication, and expertise of our workforce.\" I want to note, I spoke to the former deputy director of the Secret Service, Barbara Riggs. And she pushed back on these saying that they are absolutely baseless and outrageous. She said somebody like Kimberly Cheatle does not just get this job as a token. And one thing that was really important that she noted about the importance of diversity in the Secret Service. First of all, women have been in the force since the 1970s. And Barbara Riggs, she pointed out that having a diverse agency is so important because when you're somebody from a different background or a different gender, you see things differently. You can take in, you know, possible threats differently than another agent. And that is exactly what you need when you're trying to protect somebody. Bianna.",
