This is Connect the World.Coming up this hour, America's top diplomat is in Saudi Arabia to strengthen ties amid rapidly shifting Middle Eastern politics. Children are among six people injured in a knife attack in a small alpine town in southeast France. Scenes of widespread flooding along Ukraine's Dnipro river after a dam collapse leads to vast devastation and smoke darkening the skies of northeastern America as wildfires engulfs the region. Finding common ground. In the wake of longstanding policy differences, the top U.S. diplomat says his visit to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia forged a path forward for the two nations in several important areas. He said including a call from both to repatriate 1000s of captured ISIS fighters from camps in northern Syria. Antony Blinken talked at a meeting of the International anti-ISIS coalition in Riyadh a day after sitting down with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Blinken's presence in the kingdom did not deter the crown prince from already a phone call today with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Alex Marquardt is connecting us this hour from Washington. What do you make of what we have just heard, and I just want our viewers to know that Antony Blinken is actually as we speak, holding a news conference. We're listening in, and we will report on that as we get more. Alex.",

MBS has made no bones about thefact that the kingdom is maintaining relations with Russia, and indeed, with Ukraine at this point, and has played a role in mediating the release of hostages, of course, on both sides of that conflict. But it's interesting to note, as you say that this, this visit is likely to have gone some way but not all the way to fixing a relationship that let's remember has -- has been fraught since what, 2018, before that. And during the Trump administration, the relationship could not Alex have been better. It was transactional. That's how Donald Trump as president then wanted it to be, and that suited the Saudis. How important is it for this Biden administration, given that it's got, what 16 months or so left or 18 months or so left, that they really re-establish relations and ensure that they are on a good footing? Because it certainly feels at this point, as if the kingdom has the upper hand.",

It is lost on no one, that the relationship between the crown prince who is of course, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, and President Biden is very sour. We saw that on full display last year when President Biden wouldn't -- he wouldn't even give the Crown Prince a handshake, they had that infamous fist bump. And that was a major effort by the Biden administration to get this relationship back on track because it is so important for the United States. The security and stability of the Middle East really hinges in a large way on Saudi Arabia. The -- they're -- one of the main things that the U.S. and specifically Secretary Blinken has been trying to push with regards to Saudi Arabia right now is the normal -- normalization of ties with Israel. Of course, you have the Abraham Accords that were forged by the Trump administration, a victory for diplomacy that the Biden ministration acknowledges and would like to extend to Saudi Arabia. So there have been talks on that during this visit to Saudi Arabia by Blinken, but the U.S. is certainly realizing that they couldn't marginalize Saudi Arabia in the way that they wanted to. It's certainly they need. They need that security cooperation, because they need Saudi to help with Iran. They need Saudi to help with the war in Yemen, which, of course, you know, Saudi is waging themselves. There's also the fear of China moving into the region. China, of course, just brokered that -- that deal between Iran and Saudi Arabia to re-establish ties. So, the U.S. is now trying to reassert itself and really get this relationship back on track because the intentions that they came into power with, into office with, frankly, did not pan out, Becky.",

      "sentences": "Hi there, Becky, but it is all still quite murky. But it certainly does seem as though theUkrainians have been launching more attacks, possibly probing attacks on Russian forces in the Zaporizhzhia region. And you've already mentioned that the Russians are sort of making a big deal out of this saying that there were several these attacks from four different directions as the Russian Defense Ministry put it, and they say that they managed to beat all of those attacks back saying we destroyed a lot of Ukrainian armor, and that a lot of Ukrainians were killed in all of that as well. Now from the Ukrainian side at this point in time, we don't have any information whatsoever. That's sort of in line with how the Ukrainians have been conducting themselves over the past couple of days. Of course, you'll remember this past weekend, they actually put out a video even saying that they were not going to announce when their big counter offensive will have started, saying their plans need to remain silent. So that certainly seems to be something that the Ukrainians are adhering to. Nevertheless, even from our vantage point here that we have, we can hear a lot of shellings that seems to be going on, a lot of outgoing fire, we're hearing some incoming fire as well. That's something that really went on through the course of pretty much all of last night. So, it certainly does seem as though there's a big uptick in action on the battlefields here in South Ukraine, and also towards Southeastern Ukraine as well. Whether or not this is the big counter offensive or whether or not these are larger scale probing operations, as experts would call them, whether the Ukrainians are trying to see whether they can find holes in Russia's defenses or weak spots in the Russian military's defenses and trying to break through those that at this point is unclear. The Russians, by the way, also saying that they have managed to take out a Western German provided radar for an air defense system as well, that obviously would be a big coup for the Russians. That of course also has not been confirmed by the Ukrainians yet either. Nevertheless, the bottom line seems to be that right now, here on this front, it certainly seems to be becoming one of those real epicenters of the fighting here in Ukraine. But right now, the Ukrainians very much seem to be on the offensive while the Russians of course, we know Becky in this area are very, very well dug in, they have some pretty strong defense positions. So, it's going to be interesting to see what the next couple of days bring from the Ukrainians not hearing much but the Russians really are, are going big on all of this. In fact, even the Defense Minister came out and talked about the fact that the Russians claim that they have repelled these large- scale attacks that they've had over the past hours, Becky.",

This is where the President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority has his residence and his offices, to have them entering Ramallah with more than 100 vehicles, it is quite a significant event. But from the Israeli perspective, it goes to show you the significance of which they saw their target. Now their target was to demolish the home of the man they say was behind those twin bombings in Jerusalem in November that killed two people and injured dozens of others. Those bombings that we have the likes of which Jerusalem and Israel especially had not seen in several years. And so overnight, we're hearing that more than 100 Israeli military vehicles entering Ramallah in order to demolish this home. This was actually on the first floor of an apartment building. So, they didn't demolish the entire building, they demolished from the inside this home and we do see some dramatic footage from the Israeli military of them demolishing this home. And this is something that is really military often does to the homes of suspects or of attackers. They see this as a deterrent. But of course, when they entered Ramallah, they clashed with hundreds of locals who were there, who the IDF says threw things like Molotov cocktails and stones at them. The IDF of saying that they responded with live fire and rubber bullets. We know of at least six people who were injured, some of them with live fire, some of them with rubber bullets, including at least one journalist, a cameraman for the Al Araby television channel. Now footage that we're seeing from him being loaded into stretchers and from people who were there say that he was wearing gear that identified him as a member of the media. It's not clear if it was protective gear. It's not clear if he was wearing a helmet, but he was wearing something that identified him as press. Now, Palestinian health authorities say that he was shot in the head with a rubber bullet, he has a skull fracture, but he is in stable condition. Now I will read you what the IDF said in response to this report. He says they did, the details of the incident are under review. They said the IDF makes every effort to prevent any harm to non-combatants during operational activity and to allow freedom of movement and the press. They also say that this happened in the area of violent and crowded riots. Obviously there's a lot of sensitivity around the Israeli military and the press, of course, after what happened to the very famous Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh. Now in terms of the house and what happened to the house of the suspected bomber, Prime Minister, Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohamed Shtayyeh sounding very defiant saying every house demolished by the occupation he says will be rebuilt.

But if they're not doing that, you know, then the court is the next best option to go, get some clarity. And the other big option we have, by the way, is Congress. You know, Congress, I think generally is aligned now that there needs to be more clear regulation in the U.S. around crypto to protect consumers, but also preserve the innovation potential. And there we've already seen, for instance, Europe has passed comprehensive legislation, the UK is moving there. You know, Singapore is moving there. Hong Kong. Basically, the U.S. is falling behind. And I think Congress recognizes this. We just saw, for instance, a draft bill come out last week from McHenry and Thompson, that starts to clarify this role between the CFTC and the SEC. So, I think we'll get clarity one way or another. It's going to be the courts. It could be the Congress passing the legislation, or it could be, you know, 2024 elections, something changes there that we finally get to that in the U.S. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That's something that Armstrong brought up to me during an interview, but some securities experts, they are pushing back on that logic. I talked to Adam Levitin, he's a Georgetown Law professor. And he called this a -- this argument a head fake. He said, just like how if you get a title for your vehicle, it doesn't mean that your vehicle can also pass an emissions test. He says that the SEC greenlighting an IPO doesn't mean that the company hasn't violated any securities laws. So, we'll see where the courts come down on this but Becky clearly Coinbase and the broader crypto industry, they want clarity they want it from the courts. They want it from politicians they want it from regulators.",

The film has found success in many countries around the world. According to comScore, the film has made $327 million globally but China, the world's second largest box office has contributed a paltry amount. According to Ent data. This is the Chinese box office tracker. In Mainland China, the film made only $2.7 million in its first five days and compare that to Spiderman across the Spider Verse, which brought in nearly $20 million in the first five days of opening. Now some in Mainland China have shared their objections online. One that is in on Maoyan, it's a Chinese Box Office platform, said that the fairy tale that I grew up with has changed beyond recognition unquote. And Chinese state media has encouraged such reactions. In fact, an Op-Ed published right before the film's debut in China, in the Global Times said this quote, the controversy surrounding Disney's forced inclusion of minorities and classic films is not about racism, but its lazy and irresponsible storytelling strategy, unquote. Disney declined to comment. Similar reactions have been found online in South Korea, with one user saying the movie had been quote ruined, along with the hashtag not my Ariel. According to the Korean Film Council in South Korea, the Little Mermaid attracted some 472,000 viewers in its first week and compare that to the nearly 643,000 fans that showed up for the latest Fast and Furious sequel over the same period.
