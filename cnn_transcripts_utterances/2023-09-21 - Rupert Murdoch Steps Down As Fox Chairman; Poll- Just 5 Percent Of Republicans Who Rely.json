Few people have had a bigger impact on American politics in the 21st century than the 92-year-old media mogul.CNN Senior Media Reporter Oliver Darcy is joining me now. Oliver, you've covered all aspects of the media and in Fox. What do we think about this change? Why did this happen now and what impact will him stepping aside have?",

      "sentences": "Yes, this is a big moment, Manu. Rupert Murdoch is one of the most powerful people in the world, and that's because of his media companies. Fox Corporation, which he has been the chairman of, is the parent company of Fox News, and News Corporation is the parent company of papers like the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post, and has a publishing arm.And so, he has been very powerful, not only in the world of media, but also in the world of politics. And this is a big moment, obviously, with the 2024, presidential cycle heating up. Donald Trump set to be on trial next year. It's a big moment in politics. And so Rupert Murdoch is now stepping down. But I think people should be cautious and not jump to the conclusion that that means that the editorial bent of his companies is going to change. I want to read to you actually what he writes in his memo to staffer suggesting that Lachlan Murdoch is actually going to continue the tradition of allowing these companies to be right-wing in nature. He talks about, he says that, there is a battle for the freedom of speech, for the freedom of thought, and he writes that, self-serving bureaucracies are seeking to silence those who question their providence and purpose. Elites have open contempt, he says, for those who are not members of their rarified class. Most of the media is in cahoots with those elites, peddling political narratives rather than pursuing the truth. Of course, Manu, it would be irresponsible for me to read that to you without pointing out that Rupert Murdoch himself talks about people peddling narratives and not the truth when he just paid $787 million to Dominion Voting Systems for knowingly advancing falsehoods about the 2020 election. But there's also a host of other things his networks like Fox News have done. You know, Murdoch was one of the first receivers of the COVID-19 vaccine. His media companies obviously pushed a lot of falsehoods about that. So, his note's a little rich, but he's suggesting that Fox News and the other companies are going to continue, pushing this political worldview.",

You know, Murdoch's still saying he's going to be around and look in a role where he talks or thinks about the big picture day to day.And so, the big question though is what happens when he does pass. And then you have potentially a power struggle because the kids have voting rights with their shares. And so, does Lachlan remain atop these companies as Rupert Murdoch is trying to, you know, install them? Right now, Rupert's basically trying to seat Lachlan Murdoch, who is his chosen heir, on the throne, you know, place the crown on his head and have him in place as the successor. But the question is, when he does pass, and the other kids have voting rights, does Lachlan remain in that seat? And that's yet to be determined.",

Audie, it's really hard to overstate just the impact that Rupert Murdoch has had on our political discourse in this century. AUDIE CORNISH, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I mean, when you think about Fox going back to 1996, this is the start of a really big cable news war, so to speak. Obviously, CNN predated that.

And I understand the concerns of some of my colleagues and what they're asking for and what I have been asking for actually, is that the speaker commits the top line number and that we see the whole puzzle on how all 12 spending bills fit together to achieve the agreed upon top line number.

But I do support with the agreement on the top line spending bills on how we're going to cut our spending and advance our policies to reverse the harm and in which the Americans are suffering. These policies from the Biden, Pelosi, Schumer regime that American people are suffering under that destroying the country, reverse those policies, cut our spending.
