He obviously did not look pleased coming out of that courtroom. I will say (INAUDIBLE) we officer and the bare metal barricades you can see they turned him around.

As part of the allegations, prosecutors said that this was part of aneffort to promote his candidacy by burying negative stories ahead of the election. And now we don't have all the additional details of what else might be included in this, but that is how they outlined it in court. Now in this brief, what was that about 45 minutes arrangements and the former president entered the room. It was so quiet you can hear a pin drop. He walked in. He looked his lips. He was standing. Each of the rows filled with press. There were about 60 members of the press in there. Each row flanked by court security officers. We were not allowed to use any electronic devices that we've all of having been filing out now to report the news. He spoke only a few times. He a plea of not guilty on his own. He also was addressed by the judge who addressed to him some of these threatening statements he made. That was something that prosecutors have raised. They had asked the judge not to impose any kind of gag order but just to raise issues of Trump threatening social media posts. They handed out copies of those posts to the court and to Trump. The judge said that he was not going to impose any kind of gag order. He said it he wouldn't even if he was out right now. But he did warn the former (INAUDIBLE), also, the prosecutors warned their witnesses just tamp down their rhetoric, to reduced what they're saying about the case and the judge warns from both sides.

This essentially just lays out the statutory language, the name the date of each offense, but there is not a lot of detail in what we're seeing at this moment. There do appear to be 34 charges in here. There does not appear to be -- and we're looking at it for the first time. There does not appear to be a conspiracy charge per se. Now, that doesn't mean they can still explain the whole scheme at trial, but it looks like these are charges based on falsifying of business records and then falsifying business records in order to commit or conceal some other crimes.

There's a section called background before that was the introduction and it talks about the Trump organization from approximately June 2015 to 2017. And then it talks about a scheme. They call it \"The Scheme.\" And they call it \"The Catch and Kill Scheme\" to suppress negative information. And then it goes on and gives very detailed facts. There was a Trump Tower meeting at 20 -- in 2015. And then it says a few months later, they tried to suppress a doorman's story. And there's just a lot of information in here that that would love to digest and come back and tell.

And the judge said that, you know, he was concerned about these statements. An attorney for Donald Trump, Todd Blanche, who just came onto the team. He said that Trump was frustrating and that he has not had a chance to address all of these allegations that the prosecution and their witnesses, including Michael Cohen, have gone out and publicly spoken about. But the judge said that he didn't agree that this was justified by frustration, and he said he would warn both sides both the prosecution and Donald Trump to tamp it down their rhetoric.

We had talked about, could there be some unexpected twist here? The answer is no. There is no allegation relating to tax crimes. There's no allegation relating to over or undervaluation of Trump Org. assets. There's no allegation here relating to obstruction of justice or threats.So, this is a hush money-based indictment. Now the indictment itself is bare bones. It just lays out the statutory language, and that's it. But there is a 13-page statement of facts that goes into some detail. It looks like the way we ended up with 34 charges here, is prosecutors have charged each separate business record entry as a count. Each check, each ledger entry, each voucher is its own count. That's how we arrive at 34. It appears and again, the indictment itself gives us very little information really just dates and references to the business record. It appears the actual criminal charges are based on the Stormy Daniels payoff and reimbursement schemes based on the dates here. Because the dates are in 2017. That is when the Trump Org. was reimbursing Michael Cohen, who made the original payments. The way each of these counts is structured -- people should maybe think of it as two levels. Level one here would be a misdemeanor. That is just falsification of business records. If Donald Trump knew or was part of falsification of business records, that is a misdemeanor. Now, level two to each of these counts, is if those records were falsified in connection with some other crime. Now, here's what's interesting to me -- and I'd be interested to get Karen's take on this -- is the indictment doesn't tell us -- and Joe Tacopina was just talking about this. The indictment actually does not say what those other crimes are now. Presumably based on the statement of facts that we have. They relate to campaign finance. But I don't know how unusual it is. I would think that in an indict -- the whole purpose of an indictment is to serve notice to the defendant. So what they say here is falsification of business records, which is a misdemeanor, and they falsified business records 34 times over to commit some other crime. But again, they don't -- the prosecutors don't say what that other crime is.",

And it appears that, you know, out of the public statement that comes with both of those documents, it was falsifying New York business records in order to conceal damaging information and unlawful activity from American voters before and after the 2016 election. So that is where he is laying out a motive that goes with the story that goes with the charges.",

Because I just want to add to what John was saying there because in the -- in court today, one of the prosecutors laid out what this theory was. He said that these falsified business records were done with the intent to commit or conceal another crime. Specifically, he said, to undermine the integrity of the 2016 presidential election and as part of an on lawful effort to promote Trump's candidacy that they were doing these deals to bury some of these stories.Now one of the allegations in this, you know, relates to the Stormy Daniels payment. According to the indictment, David Pecker had reached out to Michael Cohen with knowledge that Stormy Daniels wanted to go public with her story. This was just after the Access Hollywood tape had become public and really was, you know, a shock to the candidacy. It caused a lot of concern within his campaign. Now, according to the indictment, that Trump had wanted Michael Cohen to hold off on paying Stormy Daniels until after the election because he thought that it would not go public and that he would be able to keep it from going public. And it wouldn't matter then unless it came out after the election. So, that's part of what prosecutors are trying to show was Trump's knowledge and intent in trying to disguise this, to hide this story and tying it directly to the campaign. That is one of the issues here. You know, why would he do this? And part of the state law that they could be arguing that they're trying to apply here is that he was trying to promote his candidacy. And so, this would be an effort by the prosecution to show that Trump had knowledge of this payment and that he was tying it directly to the campaign. Of course, that will be up to a jury to decide, Anderson.",
