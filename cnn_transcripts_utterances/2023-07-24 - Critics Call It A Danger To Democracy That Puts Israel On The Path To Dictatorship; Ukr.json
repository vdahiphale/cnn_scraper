Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claims the changes are a necessary response to digital overreach. Angry protesters are gathered outside the Knesset after Israeli lawmakers approved the first part of a sweeping bill that would significantly weaken the power of the Supreme Court. Earlier, police used water canon to push some of the demonstrators back. At least 19 have been arrested, so far. And businesses across the country have closed their doors in protest of the vote. Israel doesn't have a constitution. And the Supreme Court is one of the few checks on government power. Joining me now is Amir Tibon. He's a diplomatic correspondent for \"Haaretz\" newspaper. Welcome to the show. Look, you've described the situation in your country as very, very dangerous. And we've just seen the first votes out of a package of bills passed through Parliament. Opposition, walking out, chanting shame. In a clear message to Netanyahu government, help us understand what happened today and how this lays the ground for wider judicial overhauls.",

So, the bill that was passed today is the first installment of a plan by theNetanyahu government, which is the most right-wing, most religious and most extremist government in Israeli history to completely alter the balance of power between the authorities and the country. What they passed today is now a law, it's no longer a bill, that makes it much more difficult for the Supreme Court of Israel to conduct judicial review over government decisions. It means that appointments made by the government or decisions to remove senior people from the civil service can no longer come under judicial review and be described by the Supreme Court as extremely unreasonable. One question we're asking now in Israel, for example, is will Netanyahu try to use this new reality to fire Israel's attorney general, who is leading the prosecution against the prime minister himself in his own corruption trial? But again, this is just the first installment of a wider plan, and there are several bills that are still waiting to be approved by the government that would take even more powers away from the Supreme Court and remove really the last existing checks and balances that we have in the Israeli system.",

And frankly, we've got live pictures coming through from Jerusalem. We've seen chaotic scenes today. There's anger, there's emotion. This has been going on, as you say, for six months now.

This will be an unprecedented situation in the history of the state of Israel, that because of civil disobedience, the military will lose its readiness for war. And this is a huge concern for the government because the responsibility eventually lies with one man, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He is the one who took the decision today to promote this legislation. Until the very last minute, there were attempts for compromise, to either delay the legislation or moderate its contents. There were a lot of efforts put forward by the President of Israel, Isaac Herzog, who just spoke before the U.S. Congress last week and promised to promote compromise by senior officials in the defense establishment, including Netanyahu's defense minister, to basically raise a red flag of alarm and say, we need compromise here. And Netanyahu rejected those attempts because he was put under a lot of pressure from the far-right elements within his coalition. So, if we see the military losing its readiness for war, Netanyahu will bear responsibility and we're already seeing that a lot of people here in Israel are blaming him for this disintegration of the military, which is one of the most important institutions in Israeli society.",

Something that the government continues to say is that whatever differences that they may have with the Americans over what the Israelis see as very much an internal matter, that the important security relationship, the military relationship, is still very strong between the two countries. Now, we might see that affected if these military reservists and if more soldiers say that they will not serve. That could affect Israel's military readiness, but the Israeli government is asserting that the relationship with the U.S., even if there are disagreements, will stay strong. Now, one thing to keep an eye on is that invitation from Benjamin Netanyahu to come see President Biden in the United States. It's still not clear if it's a formal, proper White House, Washington, D.C. invitation or if it's going to be some sort of other meet-up in the United States, but we'll have to keep an eye on whether that still happens now after this legislation has passed.",

We are in the Transfiguration Cathedral. Church officials have asked us to put these helmets on because of all the work that's going on, all the debris that is falling from the roof. I want to show you this corner of the church. This is where there is the most destruction. This is where we are told that the missile or rocket came plunging through the roof, going down at least two stories that daylight, that sun coming through the roof and really brightening up this otherwise dark cathedral. Over here is the altar. You can see up there those pillars now off to the side. That altar just leaning over and really only staying upright because it's leaning up against the wall. And then farther up is the beautiful dome of this cathedral, all of its windows have been blown out. Below that, the frescoes have also been knocked down. We've seen large sections of the roof also coming down as these workers seek to clear it. They say that will take several weeks, but it could be months or years before this cathedral is fully repaired. The nave goes all the way back there, and in the corner, there was a fire. We're told that a shockwave started an electrical fire. Now, this church was destroyed in 1936 when Stalin was in power. It was rebuilt when Ukraine got independence and now, of course, in a significant state of disrepair. It is attacks like these on civilian infrastructure, on buildings that frankly have nothing to do with this conflict that now has President Zelensky calling for more air defense support from Western allies for what he calls a full-fledged air shield for Ukraine.

As Russia's war on Ukraine continues, President Vladimir Putinhas signed a law raising the minimum -- the maximum age, rather, for Russian military reservists by five years. The age limit depends on rank. For example, for soldiers, sailors, and sergeants, the maximum age increases from 35 to 40 years old. For midshipmen, it goes from 50 to 55. The law also ups the age limit for those in the mobilization reserve. A conservation -- a conversation, rather, over the welfare of the U.S. soldier in North Korean custody has begun. That's according to the deputy commander for the United Nations Command. He says the entire incident is still under investigation. Private Travis King was on a tour of the demilitarized zone when he crossed from South Korea into North. North Korea has fired a suspected ballistic missile which fell into the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea. That is according to the Japanese Coast Guard. Now, this is the latest in a series of launches over the past week as tensions with the U.S. and South Korea rise, Pyongyang fired several cruise missiles over the weekend and ballistic missiles last Wednesday. Protesters in Israel are not vowing, are vowing not to give up. After the most dramatic judicial shakeup in the nation's history earlier, lawmakers approved the first part of a sweeping bill that will significantly weaken the power of the Israeli Supreme Court. Now, it's a move that not only threatens to unleash a political earthquake following months of angry street demonstrations that have deeply divided the country. But it's one that critics say could turn Israel into a dictatorship by giving the prime minister's hard right coalition unlimited authority. Not everyone is against it. On Sunday, thousands of people rallied in support of the judicial overhaul. Spain is in political limbo after no clear winner emerged from Sunday's general election. All parties fell short of the 176 parliamentary seats needed to form a government on their own. The center-right Partido Popular came out on top with 136 seats, while Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's ruling center-left Socialist Party won 122 seats.

The main conservative party fell well short of the majority, as you said, but even adding in a potential ally in the far-right party, whose leader used to be part of the main conservative party, they still didn't get it. So, that's what's the far right has been making advances across Europe, okay, they govern in Italy with hard right Prime Minister Maloney. They are in the government in Finland. There are other examples. But the Spaniards on Sunday seem to be saying, the far-right, not here, not now. So, that opens the door for this coalition building, while the conservative leader is pushing ahead, trying to find some allies, some analysts say that the socialist prime minister might have a better chance of finding a left coalition, because he's already got one, Eleni, in this current term. He's got the contacts, et cetera. But a Socialist Party leader told CNN this day that this time could be more difficult because the nationalist parties in Catalonia, around Barcelona, and in the north of Spain could try to extract a much higher price this time.

Now, Governor Greg Abbott fighting back on Twitter in a thread, saying, in part, quote, \"Texas has a sovereign authority to defend your border under our border, excuse me, under the U.S. Constitution and the Texas Constitution.\" Governor Abbott goes on to blame President Biden for the problems on the border and ends the thread with this, Erica, saying, quote, \"We will see you in court, Mr. President '. So, does this mean that Texas will be defiant on deadline day? We will have to see. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
