When we get these January reports, there's always revisions for the last year as they fine-tune all of these numbers. So it tells you 4.8 million jobs were added last year in a red hot job market. And this. Now the lowest unemployment rate since before the moon landing. The lowest unemployment rate since before the moon landing at 3.4 percent.

      "sentences": "Well, now they're going to keep monitoring this to see which way it goes and whether it floats over other sensitive sites. The Pentagon has already acknowledged that on the path that it has taken over the last several days as they have tracked this, it has gone over several sites. And although they haven't named those sites, we know it was spotting in Montana, where the U.S. has ballistic missile fields. So perhaps that is the sensitive site that the U.S. was concerned about.Interestingly, as you point out, the Chinese foreign minister just put out a statement, a rare Friday night statement, acknowledging that this is, in fact, Chinese equipment. Here is part of that statement. I'll read this to you. The foreign ministry says, it is a civilian airship used for research, mainly meteorological, purposes. Affected by the Westerlies and with limited self-steering capability, the airship deviated from its - far from its planned course. The Chinese side regrets the unintended entry of the airship into U.S. airspace due to force majeure. The foreign ministry then says, they'll be in touch with the U.S. to figure out how to handle this. The question, of course, does the U.S. buy that explanation? The Pentagon was pretty adamant when they came out with information about this balloon, that it was a surveillance balloon. And even if it didn't have capabilities above and beyond Chinese spy satellites circling in low earth orbit, it was clearly still something to worry about. The Pentagon says they've seen this sort of capability in the past. A U.S. official tells CNN, these sorts of balloons have been spotted over Hawaii and Guam in previous years, including during the previous administration. Now, of course, the key question, how to handle this. The military said they're not going to shoot this down, for now. But if they decide that there is a greater risk, that remains an option for them. And then, of course, there is handling this with the diplomatic channels. Bianna, Jim, it is clear the U.S. is angry about this.",

      "sentences": "Well, Jim, it really could not come at a worse time for the United States as they planned this kind of landmark trip by the secretary of state to China. What the U.S. is saying, according to my colleague Kylie Atwood, is that the State Department is considering now how to move forward with that trip and that it's going to be, quote, a very interesting day as the U.S. develops more information about this balloon, whether or not, of course, it was steered there on purpose by the Chinese government, and whether, of course, this poses a very, you know, significant intelligence threat to the United States.Now, for now, all signs point to it not being that big of a counterintelligence risk for the U.S. What we're told is that while China does have some ability to turn on and off the systems within this balloon, it does not necessarily have the ability to steer it and actually get it to a particular location within the United States. It's not like a drone, for example. So, it is plausible, of course, that while this is not simply a weather balloon, as the Chinese government said, and that it is for intelligence gathering purposes, as all of our sources are indicating, that the Chinese did not necessarily put it directly over Montana on purpose. Now, it remains to be seen, of course, whether this is going to actually impact the secretary of state's plans to travel to China, but ultimately the U.S. has been looking for a way to responsibly manage the conflict with China. And right now, of course, with this major kind of incursion into American air space, which is how Republicans are framing it on The Hill. Of course, the Biden administration is going to be under pressure to take some kind of decisive action against this balloon that satisfies the hawks on The Hill who have already been saying that the Biden administration has not been harsh enough on China.

If you look at that bill, it got 100 Democrats to support it. I'm proud to serve on that committee.But let's make no mistake about it, China has a plan to replace us. And they are working at it every day, technologically, militarily, from a trade perspective, diplomatically. And so we have to wake up to that. And as you look at the bipartisan committee, we will be focused on these malign activities that China has engaged in. And then also on the economic side, on how we use our trade in the Indo-Pacific region to isolate China, that all has to be on the table. I really look at this as not a Republican or Democrat issue, it's an American issue. I'm glad we have this select committee set up.",
