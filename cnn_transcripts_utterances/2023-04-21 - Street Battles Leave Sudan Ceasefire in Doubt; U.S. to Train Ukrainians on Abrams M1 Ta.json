Then effective, but no silver bullet. What the U.S. Secretary of Defense is saying about dozens of Abram tanks making their way to Ukraine. And on the eve of Earth Day, CNN is looking at potential solutions for the climate crisis, our Bill Weir has that story for you.

Army sourcestelling CNN, they have launched a ground offensive, deploying on foot for the first time since their week-long battle against a powerful paramilitary force. Many families meanwhile are trapped inside their homes without enough food and water, the fighting clearly far too dangerous for them to risk going outside. Meantime, the World Health Organization says at least 413 people have been killed so far, and thousands more wounded. But now, both the army and the Rapid Support Forces militia have agreed to a truce during the Eid al-Fitr holiday, ending of course, the month of Ramadan. I'm joined now by Nima Elbagir for the very latest, she's being covering the story from day one. And Nima, in addition to the ceasefire, and I'm sure you'll tell me whether from your sources, you believe it's holding or not. I mean, I'm keen to get your thoughts on the number of refugees that have been fleeing Sudan. What's the latest?",

So many in Khartoum woke up to even more intensified fighting, and many outside the capital from Darfur, for instance, have fled to places of safety. Tens of thousands of people, 20,000 at least, have fled from Darfur, we understand into neighboring Chad. And some reports are reaching us that those attempting to similarly flee the capital are being obstructed by armed groups. This all comes as many countries are impatiently trying to find a window to evacuate their nationals. Spain has been the latest evac - - to announce that they are preparing to evacuate, but that the conditions on the ground are not conducive. That comes after the U.S. made similar statements. They're going to be looking really closely, Isa, at what happens over the next 72 hours. I mean, you know, we're going to wait and see. But three ceasefires have not held so far. People are so desperate. They are so wanting this ceasefire to work and to hold, especially as it comes over the Eid al-Fitr holiday, and people already are in such desperate need. Isa.",

Can people leave behind everything they know? You know, Sudan is no stranger to conflict, but Khartoum has always been relative safe haven. It has taken in internally displaced people from all of Sudan's conflict areas as well as neighboring countries, conflict areas, and all of those people will now be on the move.

And for that reason, finally, the Biden administration relented and agreed to send M1A2. But that timeline was many months and perhaps more than a year to get those into the battlefield and into the fight. Just a short time later, the administration changed course and said it's going to send an older version of the tanks that can get there faster, but they wouldn't specify just how quickly. Now, we have a sense of how soon the U.S. can get 31 M1A1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine. The training will begin in the coming weeks, and then it will be a 10-week training course with some 250 Ukrainian troops before they can enter the fight, still weeks and perhaps even a few months, but dramatically faster than the timeline used to be. The top U.S. General said these aren't a magic bullet, and they're not going to magically win the war   for Ukraine. But when you combine it with everything else Ukraine is getting and the anticipated counteroffensive, you get a sense of the kind of power they're getting, the Abrams from the U.S., the Leopard 2 is from Germany and other countries, the Challenger 2s from the U.K. And the maintenance and the repair hubs to make all of that work, Germany and Ukraine saying they'll build a hub for the Leopard 2s nearby in Poland. So it's this push to keep making sure Ukraine has the power and the capabilities they need on the battlefield more than a year into this war at this point. So Isa, it is this unified front you're still seeing and the willingness to keep providing Ukraine with powerful weaponry. And it's worth noting that the Patriot missiles that the U.S. trained Ukrainians on, are also arriving into the fight for air defense. So you see all of this coming together even as the fight grinds on.",

They were too afraid to go and investigate, police were taken to the scene or went to the scene. And as you say, 10 members of the same family, according to police were killed in that hail of bullets, the youngest, a 13-year-old boy, the oldest, a 63-year-old. And it is the latest shooting. There have been several in that province alone and in other parts of the country in recent months. Some of them related to gang violence, others to the violent taxi industry here in South Africa. There have been some movements on the story in recent hours. The police say that two suspects were arrested. They were in fact, taken in, in a manhunt in the hours after that shooting in the early hours. One suspect was killed in that contact with the police, and one got away. Even though, the police leadership here in South Africa says that, it's trying to get a handle on violent crime, the last year saw at least, 25,000 murders in South Africa, a high point of the last few years for sure. And there is a real sense from community members, particularly in poorer areas of this country, that -- where I have been reporting, you know, multiple times over the last few months, that they feel the police won't respond, if they do respond, it will be too late. And many police officers say they just don't have the resources to deal with very organized and very violent crime here.
