The street, though, that this nice nightclub is on is very residential. And so a nightclub undoubtedly stood out there.And at first glance, this fire didn't seem like it would be that major. It was restricted to the lower part of the building. But only later did we realize that there were dozens of construction workers doing renovations on that nightclub who were trapped inside. I spoke to a neighbor in the building just across the way who thought that the fire initially was in her building. She actually climbed out the balcony to try to get to safety. And when she got down, she realized it was the other building. And with the flames and with the smoke, she said it looked like she had arrived in hell. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MCLEAN (voice-over): The camera trembles as neighbors capture the raging fire across the road. Hours later, the human cost becomes tragically apparent as firefighters pull bodies out one by one. All afternoon police, investigators, and exhausted firefighters came and went, wondering what went wrong. All told, at least 29 people were killed. All of them were workers doing renovations on a nightclub housed in the bottom of this 16-story apartment block. The slick masquerade nightclub looks out of place on the ordinary- looking residential street. Seema Sawanja (ph) lives now next door and heard screams when the fire first started. I used to go to the nightclub from time to time, she says. The bar had one entrance and an exit. There's only one way in and one way out.",

The classmate and the boy has now been remanded in custody but he will be questioned by social services rather than the police given the age of the boy in question.It is not clear just yet what exactly the motive is behind this and the police are still trying to establish that. The Finnish Prime Minister who spoke publicly about this particular incident described it as being a deeply shocking and that the authorities are still working to determine the story behind this tragic event. But he also acknowledged that one incident is one incident too many, even in a country like Finland, which is incredibly rarely sees incidents like this compared to other nations in the world, such as the United States. Finland's last school attack or school shooting of this type came in 2008, where a student who was slightly older turned a weapon on his other classmates. This, though, seems to be very much an open case at the moment and a deeply shocking and disturbing one, particularly as children were returning to school after the long Easter holiday break. And I'm sure that there will be more to uncover in this story as the police continue their investigation. Sebastian Shukla, CNN, Berlin. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
