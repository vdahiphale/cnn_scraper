She will be, you know, still playing a role in trying to help local candidates and down ballot candidates. But I think it is clear there's no doubt that President Biden has to work on, sort of, rebuilding his fraying coalition of younger voters, Latino voters, black voters, other voters, progressives, of course. But Donald Trump also has to rebuild his coalition. So, the question is, what does happen to that sliver of voters in the middle? We call them now Nikki Haley voters. We'll see if we still call them that by November, but for now they are and I think that they'll be watching how both sides react here, and I would not be at all surprised if President Biden mentions those Nikki Haley voters by name tomorrow night in the State of the Union.",

That's what Manu Raju was just talking about a few moments ago. Mitch McConnell now endorsing Donald Trump. What do you make of that? ASA HUTCHINSON (R), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Well, it surprises me actually, because he's not going to be running for reelection. There wasn't any motivation. I think it really indicates the draw of the team. We've been on the Republican team all our life. It's hard to switch from that. It's hard to say we're not going to support the nominee of the party. It's very difficult for me as well. And so, it is a surprise that announcement today from Senator McConnell because he's been very, very clear in the past as to holding Donald Trump morally responsible for January 6th and his disagreement with them. So, I don't think that you can overlook that even as you look to the future. I thought Nikki Haley's announcement today was classy.

And so, yes, it's incumbent upon Donald Trump to do his job as a frontrunner and reach out to them. And for example, with Nikki Haley, you would think the obvious thing is that you would reach out. You would say, I know you've got to think about this, but we want you to make a primetime speech during the convention. We value you and negotiate her support. Obviously, she wants to be able to showcase her ideas and make that case at the convention and she should be able to do that. And Donald Trump can bring her in with that kind of outreach, perhaps.",

We all know Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump hate each other. It's mutual. But Mitch McConnell has been a Republican his entire life. His reason of being. His raison d'etre is partisanship, is getting Republicans elected. And what he is signaling with this is, look, I hate the guy, but I'm drinking my medicine because I am a party guy. I think Asa Hutchinson is absolutely right. There's going to be some Republicans who come back home. But you never underestimate Republicans ability to do that. They did that after we heard -- a lot of Republicans did that after we heard Donald Trump on those \"Access Hollywood\" tapes. Some of them will not vote, and some of them will vote for Biden.

If you're a Ukrainian soldier, looking at a wall of Russians coming at you, and having to ration your bullets, today is a bad day because one of the great champions of the United States being strong for our allies, strong for democracy, just went down in defeat today. And you feel more alone and more afraid of the future.If you're in Poland, if you're in Europe, and you're looking at a wall of Russians coming for you, and saying, where's the United States? Today is not a good day. So, from my heart, this is not a good day. From my head, what is Nikki Haley doing? What was that speech? What is she trying to play for? I think three things. Number one, why is she withholding her endorsement? Ron DeSantis, as soon as he got out, endorsed Trump and was belittled and sidelined and made look like an idiot. So, she would be crazy to endorse now. I agree with Ana, she may endorse, but she shouldn't endorse now. Look at what just happened to DeSantis. Number two, dollars. Trump is broke. She is sitting on the biggest donors in American politics. She could be a bank or she could be somebody who closes the bank door. So, she has real power, not voting power now, but dollar power. She knows to use that. And then number three, it is just hard. Remember Hillary Clinton in 2016, to turn your supporters around, even if you want to, you can't do it in a day. So, if you look at Nikki Haley, she's smart to hold her cards, to play her cards, to figure out, can she get this party to do something to keep America from abandoning democracy around the world? I hope she continues to play a constructive role. She's done a good job for her party in the country so far. But this is a bad day for democracy.

Now, he also, I think, needs to make a stronger case for what he is going to do to keep the economy moving in a good direction for people who go into grocery stores and can't pay for their groceries.
