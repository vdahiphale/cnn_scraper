As the day went on, though, they heard noises coming from the same area but it wasn't described as banging. They're not quite sure what it was. Here's how the admiral of the Coast Guard described those sounds. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REAR ADM. JOHN MAUGER, U.S. COAST GUARD:  There is a lot of metal and different objects in the water around this site. That's why it is so important that we've engaged experts from the Navy that understand the science behind noise and can classify or give us better information about what the source of that noise might be.

They put remote operating vehicles to see if they can spot whatever it was that was making that sound and it turned up nothing. So they widened out the search area and are moving more resources in. Another Canadian Coast Guard ship left this morning, the Horizon Arctic, that seems to be carrying the gear from three different U.S. military planes, C-17s, very large cargo planes for the military. That landed here at St. John's and that left very early this morning. And it does take about a day to get there. So the ships on the way with even more gear.

And according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, that allows the vessels to map the sea floor and try to basically send and receive acoustic pulses that can help map the sea floor or detect objects really, really far, deep down in the ocean.And so what we're seeing right now is obviously an effort to figure out where this vessel might be. And it is an all hands on deck effort. A number of agencies, multiple different entities with the Department of Defense, are helping out with this effort, including the Navy, the New York Air National Guard and Transportation Command. And Canadian and U.S. planes are conducting flyovers. This is not just an American effort but an international effort. You have Canadian and American planes. You have a French deep sea diving vessel that is mapping the sea floor, trying to figure out whether they can detect anything. And the Navy has provided a flyaway deep ocean salvage system which is essentially a portable system that can lift large, bulky and heavy objects weighing up to 60,000 pounds off of the ocean floor. That will be necessary if they find the submarine. They're still trying to figure out where exactly it is. And at this point they are employing all these different capabilities to figure out where it is and how they can recover the vessel from such depths once they do find it. We should note that the Navy has also been in touch with the Coast Guard about those banging sounds. The Coast Guard says that they're trying to employ Navy experts to try to figure out what those might be, because the Navy has that scientific expertise to figure out what they might be and where they might be coming from, Sara.",

How come they can't communicate? Was the electrical flooded and prevented any kind of signaling to take place again? And then where are all the buoys and so forth that are attached to the sub? They're supposed to come up. They're supposed to come up with the sub. But they haven't come up without the sub, either, that we know about. So where is the sub? Is it there? Is it midwater? Is it at the surface?

Prosecutors say they want the whole thing, including exhibits, in part because it shows how Trump dealt with allegations of sexual misconduct ahead of the 2020 election. The key issue in this case are his payments that prosecutors say were made to silence Stormy Daniels and then the crime, they say, was the cover-up, falsifying business records. They're also subpoenaing the Trump Organization for more information. They want these emails between any employees of the Trump Organization and the White House from January 20, 2017, Inauguration Day, through the end of that year. That time period is crucial because that is when these reimbursement checks were made. They want to establish how much -- or how involved Trump was when he was at the White House in his personal business. And they've also asked for any severance and non-disclosure agreements between the Trump Organization and a number of people, including Hope Hicks and Ivanka Trump and they want emails between Trump's longtime assistant and Melania Trump, his wife.

The other subpoenas, the subpoenas about the documents and the subpoenas about emails and communications while he was at the White House, I think those are more likely to be important and may, in fact, go to Trump's arguments that the case should be moved to federal court since we're now talking about things that happened during his time as president.",

And so part of the Stormy Daniels issue is he's paying hush money to cover it up. So I actually think it is quite relevant if they want to establish this is how he deals with these kinds of allegations. That's why they're looking for it. On the communications with White House staff, he might have slightly better arguments that there's something federal or presidential with that. But when you have Melania communicating with her aide or her scheduling assistant, it's hard to imagine there's something privileged about that. And while it may have the atmospheric of seeming more presidential, I don't think it will be a basis for him to move to federal court. That's a pretty untested situation.",

Prosecutors say he leaked this information, first by accessing it on classified systems with sensitive information and then copying it down and posting notes of it online and then taking pictures of documents and posting those online. Prosecutors say his posting of information lasted just under 1.5 years from January of 2022 to April of this year. In terms of the information with which he's being charged with leaking, prosecutors say and the indictment says that we looked at last week for the first time that some of these documents contain sensitive and classified information about the war in Ukraine, including troop movements and the provisions of equipment.
