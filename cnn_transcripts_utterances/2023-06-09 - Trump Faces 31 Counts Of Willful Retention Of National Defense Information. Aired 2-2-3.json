That's what he wants you to think.So, when you read the penalty sheet that comes in any federal indictment, this is where the gravity of this comes clear to you. Counts one through 31, willful detention of National Defense Information. Each one of those counts a potential maximum 10 years in prison. That's 310 years in prison. Count number 32, conspiracy to obstruct justice. Maximum term of imprisonment 20 years. Count 33, withholding a document or record. Maximum term of imprisonment 20 years. Count 34, corruptly concealing a document or record. Maximum term of imprisonment 20 years. Count 35, concealing a document in a federal investigation. Maximum term imprisonment, 20 years. Scheme to conceal. Maximum term imprisonment, five years. False statements or representation. Maximum term of imprisonment, five years. So, those are the 37 counts against Donald Trump.

In the past, his aides have said, you know, he felt they were his or he declassified them, so they were his to take or you know they were mostly mementos. They weren't, you know, serious documents. And that's why he wants to keep them.I think what these instances though, especially if him sort of showing documents to other people, waving them around, talking about them, it shows a certain amount of hubris. I mean, it shows somebody who wanted to take sort of the spoils of his one-term presidency with him, and to be able to brag about them when he left.",

REID: It's clearly incredibly significant. We knew that when a judge allowed attorney client privilege to be pierced, you know, they needed an exception here. So, they needed to convince a judge that Evan Corcoran's advice had been used potentially in furtherance of a crime. I mean that's a -- that's a pretty significant thing for a judge to allow. And from our reporting, we learned a little bit about the kinds of information that he had in his notes. We knew that the former president had asked if there were any other options besides a subpoena 1-- cooperating with the subpoena. Now, some folks on the former president's legal team argued to us that look, he was just trying to get some good legal advice. But clearly, based on the facts here in this indictment, what Evan Corcoran and this other attorney provided, shows that it was much more than that.

A judge who had ordered the former president to turn over all of these documents that he had no right to continue to hold.

And they're going to have to testify about what -- generally what these are. But, you know, if you really -- if you want to make sure the American public is paying attention and knows how serious this is, I think the challenge here will be for the Justice Department to at least declassify some of these documents so that everybody can see it. And you know, that's always the struggle with these cases. It's one reason why very rarely do they even bring these cases in in court. They try -- they struggle with the idea of, well, these things are so sensitive that we can't bring it to court because we can't declassify it. And so, the challenge here will be for the Justice Department to decide. Are there some of these documents, what is it, 30 something documents that they cite here, that they believe they can bring down the classification?

It may be that they were just completely incorrect that they cannot -- clearly, they could bring a case without Walt Nauta.
