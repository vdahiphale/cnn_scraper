One of them is always straight on the sun. So, they had all the infrastructure in place precisely for something like this on the right spot at the right time. But what they're telling me also is that the fact that the attention is in Mexico is allowing people outside the United States, which is one of the places where science grows -- and there's some other TV network doing something here -- that for the local, for the Mexican students, this is also an opportunity to see that they have the infrastructure in place to become scientists, to be interested in science. So, they are also hopeful that this is going to raise awareness and more people want to be scientists and, you know, have the opportunity. But as I said, something else they did here in Torreon, if we can walk this way so we could move away from the local station. They are providing the glasses for free for people who forgot or didn't get the glasses on time. People can -- as you can see just come here and they can share it so that everybody can share on the experience. Now, unfortunately, the cloud cover is still a little thick. It's not that easy to see the sun. But like I said, once you look up, you put the glasses on, you see the bright yellow disk, the clouds move on and you're starting to see the moon creeping in.

It's hard to study.And so, when we get that temporary blackout where, wow, now, it's cooled off for us to look at, that's when you can study that corona. And it wasn't until just a few years ago that science realized -- but this is another thing that I didn't realize. Did you know what we have shot a probe into the sun? Well, this is a couple years ago. I'm looking through my notes. You know, what this guy is called, it is the Parker Solar Probe. It's named after Eugene Parker who witnessed solar storms, and this was a time when they'd have these solar flares and then odd behavior on earth with telegraphs and whatnot. And he said, boy, if we could send a probe up there and measure what's happening in the corona. So, in 2018, NASA launched the Parker Solar Probe. It is the fastest man-made object ever created. It moved 430,000 miles per hour towards the sun. It has 4.5-inch heat shield on it where the front of it is 1,300 degrees Celsius. That's off the charts hot and the back of it is room temperature.
