The Supreme Court clearing the way for House Democrats to get a hold of his tax returns as federal judges appear likely to rule against Trump in the Mar-a-Lago documents case.Plus, Putin's reality check -- facing pressure at home, low morale among his troops. And Russian president now agreeing to meet with soldiers' mothers. It's a crucial moment, how his people turning on him. And he lives next to the house where four Idaho college students were found stabbed to death. Hear how he describes what he saw at the house before the murders. He'll be my guest. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, Trump losing two major legal battles. One that has literally been waged for years imploding before the former president's eyes today. This was a big blow to Trump for the Supreme Court. The court clearing the way for House committee to get Trump's tax returns. Now this is the same committee that you may remember has been in an all-out war with Trump over his tax returns, since 2019 they've been trying to get him. And today, they succeed. Trump doing all he can to keep those records secret with excuse after excuse for years. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The committee only has until January 3rd before the Republicans take over the House and the committee, almost certainly ending the investigation. And you've got all the holidays literally every second counts on this one. Well, now the second major blow to Trump today. This from a panel of federal appeals court judges expressing skepticism at Trump's arguments in the Mar-a-Lago case. A panel of judges all appointed by Republicans, two of whom were appointed by Trump himself, not buying Trump's argument that the government violated his rights when it searched Mar-a-Lago for classified documents. The judge is appearing to agree with the Justice Department that the special master review of the documents, which was ordered of course by a lower court, is not necessary. Because federal investigators didn't take anything they shouldn't have taken. The chief judge on the panel pushing back at Trump's lawyer, saying, and I'll quote him, the entire premise of the exercise of this extraordinary kind of jurisdiction would be that the seizure itself is unlawful. And if you can't establish that, then what are we even doing here? Right? Like they didn't establish that, so they're in the courtroom. All right. Evan Perez has been following all the court proceedings today. He's out front in Washington. So, Evan, look, these are significant events. And I want to start with the Supreme Court, right, the court -- the Supreme Court ruling on Trump's taxes, right, with all those judges he put on there, and this not going his way.

And so, they say that they want to see whether there is any legislation that they can propose.

So, now, as promised, I want to go to the Democratic Congressman Lloyd Doggett, a member of the Ways and Means Committee which has been trying to get Trump's tax returns since 2019. So, Congressman, here you are, the day has come, victory from a Supreme Court with Trump's judges on it coming saying, you know what, hand those tax returns over to your committee. Let's start with the most basic question. When do you expect to get the documents? REP. LLOYD DOGGETT (D-TX):  I'm hoping we will get them by next week. This is an important victory for accountability, and it's true that the efforts have gone on for three years on the lawsuit. I actually made the first motion to get these tax returns on February 3rd, 2017. So we're coming up on almost five years that we've been trying to get this.",

It will never be powerful enough to stop the billions of good people in this world.And I've seen all of the love and support through social media, through you guys, through everybody, just showing this amazing togetherness. And if there is a message that I would love to send, it's regarding that togetherness. I would want everyone to overcome that hate. I would want everyone to be understanding and loving. That's what we should be. One single bullet is not going to be powerful enough to stop that.",

One of the things that we have to keep in mind about the population here in Russia is that when all of this began on February 24th of this year, many of them were told this isn't going to take a very long time, only professional soldiers are going to take part in all of this.Then the battlefield losses started mounting, and then you had this big mobilization. And, you know, a lot of people aren't seeing very much headway since that mobilization has started as well. And there certainly are a lot of people, especially the mothers of those who are being mobilized but also the wives who are saying, look, they really are demanding of the Russian president that their relatives need to be treated better. Here's what we're finding out. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (voice-over):  Stark images from what many believe to be the second strongest military in the world. This video posted on social media purports to show new Russian recruits camped out in the snow and cold with little more than tarps for shelter, some trying to warm up by fires. CNN cannot independently verify its authenticity, but those posting it say the soldiers even had to buy their own food to survive. Problems during training, problems on the battlefield. These recruits vent their anger at the Russian military. RUSSIAN RECRUIT (through translator):  We were abandoned without equipment, without everything. Where are the tanks? Where are the armored personnel carriers? Come on, bring it, or I'll come for you!",

The city announcing that it will require negative PCR COVID tests just to enter the supermarket or to get on public transportation. This is unbelievable.China is reporting around 28,000 cases tonight, which in terms of cases, is nearly the highest number in the entire pandemic for China. The communist government is also reporting several deaths from COVID, and, that for the first time in nearly six months. As the draconian lockdown rules tonight reach new record levels, some are taking desperate measures. Selina Wang is OUTFRONT from Beijing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (SCREAMING) SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The piercing cries of a grieving daughter. She nails and cries by her mother, who lays motionless on the ground, still wearing her mask. Her mother jumped to her death from the 12th floor of their apartment building, their compound, under lockdown in the northern region of Inner Mongolia, after two COVID cases were reported. In this widely shared audio recording, the daughter's heard banging on the tall barricades that block residents inside. She pleads, \"Open the gate, open the gate, I'm begging you, please.\" She's eventually allowed to rush to her mother's side. Neighbors filmed the tragedy from their windows. Audio messages capture their desperate pleas to building management to be allowed to comfort the daughter. COVID enforcers and police surround the body. Local police said, the 55-year-old woman suffered from anxiety disorders. A later statement from police blamed managers of the loft building for their slow response. In the eastern province of Shandong, a group of COVID enforcers in hazmat suits drag a resident out into the streets. To people hold the man down while others kick and punch him. Another woman is thrown to the ground. Many cases of brutality from COVID workers have not been held accountable, sparking outrage in China. But this time, police, without giving a motive for the attack, detained seven COVID workers involved in the beating. In Hubei province, just outside of Beijing, a desperate father steps out of his car, holding a knife. He tells the authorities his baby son has been out of baby formula for a long time during lockdown. He gets back in the car and drives right through the COVID barrier. Moments later, police arrived. They escort him, handcuffed, towards a large group of policemen. They surround him. One policeman sprays him down with disinfectant. He's arrested all because he needed to feed his baby. After outrage on Chinese social media, local police released a statement saying the man had been fined only a hundred yen or less $15 and that his child milk powder problem had been resolved. These scenes of suffering and tragedy adding to rage over the growing human and mental health toll of Chinese brute force COVID restrictions. In the southern metropolis of Guangzhou, residents locked down for weeks rushed to the streets, pushing, kicking down red barriers and metal gates trapping them in buildings. Protesters cheering and shouting, demanding that they want to eat, they want to be unsealed, as people struggle to get enough food, essentials and medical care and lockdown. Beijing recently announced incremental changes to COVID restrictions but set the country is sticking to its zero COVID policy. And for people who've lost their loved ones in lockdown, these changes are all too little or too late. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
