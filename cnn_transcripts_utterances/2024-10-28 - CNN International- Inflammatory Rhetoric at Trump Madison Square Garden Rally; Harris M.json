Just ahead, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris start making their final pitch to U.S. voters. On Sunday, Trump and his supporters intensified their attacks on migrants and Harris herself, while the Vice President sought out younger voters.And another round of Gaza Ceasefire talks begins in Doha, but for the people of Gaza, the nightmare continues with more Israeli strikes over the weekend. And we take a look at a dramatic election result in Japan that has plunged the country into political uncertainty. Just one week and one day until the U.S. picks its next president and then two candidates, their closing messages could not be more different. On Sunday night, Donald Trump held a major rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City. It featured speakers who used inflammatory rhetoric, including one who called Kamala Harris the anti-Christ and another who referred to Puerto Rico as a floating island of garbage. The Trump campaign leader disavowed that remark. Now, for his part, Trump again, portrayed illegal immigrants as violent criminals who have invaded the country in what some say is one of the darkest closing messages in U.S. political history. Here is just a small sample. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We will put these vicious and blood thirsty criminals in jail. We'll kick them the hell out of our country as fast as possible. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And of course, this was all done in battleground Pennsylvania that is crucial to their strategy to win those 270 Electoral College votes when paired also with Wisconsin and Michigan.Now the vice president, you're seeing images there, she stopped at a Puerto Rican restaurant while she was there. This was pre planned. This was before those comments at the former president's rally in New York City. But it was something that the campaign immediately cited on or as soon as those comments happened, saying that the vice president was outlining her vision for Puerto Rico while in Pennsylvania. And it's critical here to note that Pennsylvania has a really big Latino population, but more importantly, as well, a Puerto Rican population, so that is why there was a focus yesterday on trying to shore up support there. Now, to the surprise of the campaign, Bad Bunny had posted on his Instagram a clip of the vice president explaining her policies for Puerto Rico. Now I'm told that the Harris campaign had been in touch with Bad Bunny's team over the last several months to try to get him to lend his support to the vice president's plan for Puerto Rico, but they were surprised to see him do it yesterday, and that, of course, is important, because Bad Bunny holds incredible influence over the Latina vote and the Puerto Rican vote. He is a superstar and one that they had again hoped would endorse her. Now this is not quite an endorsement, but it is support, so they were very much celebrating that publicly and privately. But in addition to all of that, the focus yesterday and in the days to come is throwing up black support. If you look at polling, the vice president has been grappling with some waning enthusiasm among black voters, especially young black men. And part of that, or part of trying to make up for that, is the vice president going on multiple platforms to speak directly to them. That includes a podcast from Former NFL Player Shannon Sharp that was released today. Take a listen to that interview. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I've seen some people talking about how some of those extreme statements detracted from the former president's economic message.And as you said, the campaign disavowed the remark about Puerto Rico. But that was at an event that was held by the former president. Everyone there supported him, and he is trading in his own extreme rhetoric on immigration. I think what has happened is that his message -- there's been an evolution since 2016 then he was playing these anti-immigrant lines. He thought that was the way to whip up his most loyal supporters, and it was proven right. This election he's going to step further. He's linking that with an economic argument. So, he says, for example, unfortunately, that legal Haitian migrants to Ohio taking resources from Americans make it impossible for them to have a good life. He talked about after the hurricane in North Carolina again, falsely, that Kamala Harris had given away all the aid money to illegal migrants. He's arguing to Americans that the problems they have economically, the cost of groceries, perhaps difficulties in finding high paying jobs are because of what he calls an immigrant invasion. Blaming outsiders for economic problems is a classic trope of authoritarian right-wing leaders throughout history. So, I think the campaign believes that not only does this get Trump's most loyal voters out on November the 5th, it may also help to activate people who share his views but don't necessarily habitually turn up to vote in general elections so he can expand his electorate.",

I do want to read just a snippet of what you wrote on cnn.com in an article entitled \"Trump unveils the most extreme closing argument in modern presidential history\". You wrote much of Trump's speech brimmed with falsehoods and exaggerations. It was exactly the kind of rhetoric that the Harris campaign believes could prompt moderate voters and disaffected Republicans to choose the vice president.But it also represents a bet from the Republican nominee that he can drive out a huge base turnout and activate voters who don't normally cast ballots but who agree with his hard-line politics. Steven, I mean, we've seen time and time again that Trump with his inflammatory comments. It hasn't been a huge political liability for him, but you just heard there from Priscilla Alvarez reporting. Now you have a Puerto Rican super star, like Bad Bunny, who has what, 45 million followers on Instagram. Now he is signaling support for Harris after these comments disparaging Puerto Rico. Do you think what Trump did last night, along with his allies, could turn into a liability?",

      "sentences": "Well, you can tell the Harris campaign thinks so in some respects, because she has returned to this argument in recent weeks that Trump is an extremist. She's been willing to address questions about whether he is a fascist. Former -- President Joe Biden, his former campaign, he talked a lot about how Trump was a threat to democracy.And that message was slightly down played by Harris when she took over the nomination. I think what the theory is, is that if Trump alienates small numbers of voters, that could still be quite important in some of these swing states, where the result could be decided by tens of thousands of votes, Pennsylvania being an example. There's also this group of voters, Republicans who don't like Trump, who voted in their tens of thousands for Former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley in the primary election for the Republican nomination. If Harris can get some of those voters, she could also play down Trump's margins in areas where his strongest in states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. That's why you saw Former Republican Representative Liz Cheney out on the campaign trail warning about the dangers of Trump with Harris in recent weeks. So, a lot of this what's going on now is not necessarily trying to change the mind of Trump voters, but for holding up Trump's comments, and Harris is now saying Trump's extremism isn't just dangerous, it could cause economic effects which could hurt everyday Americans. So, she's also got her own linkage between the extremism Trump and economic argument mirroring Trump's argument, and that's what I think the campaign is trying to do in the final days. It's all about shifting a few 1000 votes in what they expect to be a very close race.",

But a source says no significant progress is expected until after a winner is declared in the U.S. election on November 5th. This as the United Nations issues a stark warning about the dire situation in Northern Gaza, saying the entire population there, the entire population is at risk of dying.Israel is vowing to keep up its nearly month-long assault around the Jabaliya Refugee Camp in North Gaza for at least a few more weeks. Separately, Gaza's civil defense says several people were killed in an Israeli strike on a school near Gaza City, where hundreds of displaced families were sheltering. Israel says it targeted a Hamas control center in the compound. Meanwhile, Iran is vowing what it calls an appropriate response to Israel strikes over the weekend, but says it does not seek a wider war with Israel. Let's bring in CNN's Jeremy Diamond now, who is joining us from Jerusalem. Jeremy, obviously, the fighting is still raging.

In fact, the expectation is that we will have to wait until after the U.S. Presidential Election next week before there's any kind of real progress on this. But as these negotiations restart, the Egyptians have now put forward a new ceasefire proposal that is kind of looking to break the mould with the main proposals that have been on the table for months on end. And that is, instead of looking for some kind of a grand -- you know three phase deal that would ultimately lead to an end of the war in Gaza. They are now talking about something far more limited in scale. A two- day ceasefire that would see the release of four Israeli hostages in exchange for an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners. And the goal isn't just to do a two-day ceasefire. It's also to allow for negotiations then to happen over the course of ten days in order to try and reach a permanent ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. It's not clear how tenable that idea actually is, but it is being discussed by the Egyptians, the Americans as well as the Israelis. And part of this is also aimed at trying to understand a little bit better who is actually able to negotiate on Hamas's behalf, and to what extent are they open to ceasefire negotiations at this point, following the killing of Hamas Leader Yahya Sinwar and a number of other senior leaders in Hamas.",

Egypt proposing this two-day Gaza ceasefire, just two days for a small exchange of hostages and prisoners. H.A. HELLYER, MIDDLE EAST STUDIES SCHOLOR, CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE: Thank you very much for having me on the program. There are a few things here. First of all, it's not a ceasefire proposal. We're talking about a pause in hostilities. It's not -- it shouldn't be framed as a ceasefire proposal, because the Israelis have made it very clear that they're not interested in a ceasefire proposal. They're talking about a pause and hostility so they can get hostages out. A ceasefire would mean that we're looking at a permanent cessation of hostilities and moving on to the day after. The Israelis have made it very clear that the day after will include a permanent presence of Israeli forces on the ground in Gaza. They've already assigned somebody, a major general, I believe, to manage quote, unquote, the civilian population in Gaza itself. There's legislation currently in the Knesset that looks at banning contact with UNRWA, the UN agency that would be -- that's usually responsible for civilian humanitarian needs and others in the Gaza Strip. So that -- you know the idea that we're moving towards some sort of a negotiation where political settlement is actually on the table. It's not on the table. It's not being discussed. The Israelis have made it very clear they do not intend to leave Gaza, whether -- you know in the next few weeks, the next few months, or, frankly, in the next few years, on the country, there's even talk about resettling Gaza from senior ministers of the Israeli cabinet.",

I don't happen to agree with that analysis, but I think that that's the perspective that they hold, and that they would see it in their interest to remove any restrictions on Netanyahu in terms of moving forward, which I think is why Netanyahu favors a return of Trump to the White House. So, it might mean, quote, unquote, the war ends. But I also question this type of framing of the war ending. From the Israelis point of view, I think the war is over when it comes to Gaza, I think this is already the day after scenario. We're already in it. There will be no return of the PA, the Palestinian Authority, to Gaza. There will be a permanent presence of Israeli troops on the ground. Gaza is being separated into several different zones. As I said, there's a suggestion of resettling, particularly the north of Gaza, by Israeli ministers of state. So, I'm not sure that -- you know the idea of ending the war is really on anybody's mind, because I think that, from the Israelis perspective, this is now going to be the post war scenario.

Pennsylvania's archery deer season is now open. This range a place to shoot targets and adjust your gear. Rifle season is a month away, and at this stop, Pesce is no nonsense. Just a few shots to help him adjust the site. Two more to let a visitor get a feel for the 30 odd six steer rifle. Conservative in every way. No wasted shots or time, everything by the book. Not a fan of surprises. Yet, Pesce is voting for Kamala Harris because he is even less of a fan of Donald Trump.",

That's how many the Republican National Committee says they're involved in this year, and not without controversy, because they filed cases challenging nearly every element of the election process, mail- in voting, signature matching, ballot deadlines, the certification procedures for after the election is over.They've also filed cases involving the voter rolls, poll watchers, and for the very first time, they have targeted overseas voting by military service members and expats who live abroad. So just in the past week, the Republicans secured a major victory in a case in Mississippi that's obviously not a swing state, and the ruling won't kick in right away. But this could help the GOP in other states, that case was about the deadline for when mail ballots need to arrive in order to get counted. A conservative federal appeals court ruled that the ballots must arrive by Election Day. They cannot be postmarked by Election Day. That was a rare win for the GOP. But also, in just the last few days, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court rejected their lawsuit that tried to end ballot curing that's when voters whose mail ballots are rejected are given a chance to fix the problem and get their vote counted. So of course, Amara, this dizzying array of litigation comes while the man at the top of the Republican ticket, Donald Trump, has been spreading lies about many of these same election procedures. And he has already baselessly questioned the legitimacy of the results before we've even reached November.",
