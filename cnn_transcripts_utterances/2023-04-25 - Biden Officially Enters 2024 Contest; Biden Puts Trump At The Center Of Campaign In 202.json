The president officially enters the 2024 campaign. His opening video makes clear, he expects to stare down Donald Trump in a general election rematch. The president's message now, mirrors his message back then.(PLAYING VIDEO OF PRESIDENT BIDEN'S CAMPAIGN AD) Plus, Nikki Haley tries to change the Republican Party's conversation about abortion. Her message calls for more compassion and where she delivered that speech highlights the Republican Party struggle in purple places that decide the electoral map. And today, Donald Trump on trial. Jury selection kicks off in a civil case over whether the former president defamed a writer who accuses him of rape. Up first though, the president's four more years bet. This morning, Joe Biden making formal another run at the Oval Office. The method a 6 am video release. The first two images you see in that video flashes of violence from one of the country's darkest days. That announcement video calls back to his 2020 campaign launched four years ago on this very day. The insurrection now swaps in for Charlottesville, back then. The cemetery leaves no doubt. Biden sees the stakes and the threat is very much the same. That his singular mission is to deny Donald Trump a chance to fundamentally alter the DNA of the United States. (PLAYING VIDEO OF PRESIDENT BIDEN'S CAMPAIGN AD) The video makes clear the assumption at the heart of team Biden's operating theory that the 2020 formula should work again in 2024. And that making Trump and his remake of the Republican Party the defining issue will push Biden hopes to the periphery concerns about his age or doubts about his stewardship of the economy. Let's begin at the White House and go live now to CNN's Arlette Saenz. Arlette, president made an official, he made the tradition if you will of the same day as four years ago. Now what?",

      "sentences": "Yes, John. President Biden formally announced his reelection bid, really trying to draw on those same themes from that 2020 campaign. As he argued the battle for the soul of the nation is not yet complete, and he needs Americans to let him finish the job with another term in office.President Biden released that three-and-a-half-minute video a bit earlier today, where he also warned that Americans freedoms are facing threats by what he has described as MAGA extremism. You saw the imagery in that video from the insurrection on January 6. He also tried to highlight efforts to limit access to abortion an issue that has really been a galvanizing force for Democrats during the midterms, and around all of these abortion fights around the country. Additionally, in that video, he specifically included images of two men that he could face off against in a general election matchup, and that is former President Donald Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who has yet to formally entered the 2024 campaign. But ultimately, President Biden is hoping that voters will side with his record. Looking at his achievements, when it comes to infrastructure and climate change, and also efforts to restore American relations around the world. Now, advisors say that because President Biden is entering the campaign, it doesn't necessarily mean we're going to immediately see him on the campaign trail. They believe that one of his selling points is trying -- having him do the job of president. And so, he's not expected to be holding these large-scale rallies right away that's similar to the tactic taken by President Obama. But in just a short while within the next hour, we will be seeing him speak to a union group as he tries to highlight labor ties as he's trying to make this case. So once again, get another term in office in the next year and a half.",

And we know from his camp, that they wanted to think about how to make this announcement while showing that he is still president, that he's above the fray of the congressional Republicans and the things happening on the Hill.

She spoke about her personal experience; her husband being adopted.She also talked about having challenges conceiving her own children. And those are two of the main central reasons that she said she's pro- life. She says not because the Republican Party told her to, it's because of those personal decisions that she made.

We ask questions because there's a big policy debate going on.The governor of North Dakota just signed a law banning a six-week ban that has no rape or no incest exception, it does have an exception for the life of the mother. The Florida governor, potential candidate, likely candidate Ron DeSantis, just signed six weeks from her own state. Senator Lindsey Graham has proposed a 15-week federal ban.

Some people do actually want that. So former Vice President Mike Pence is out there, kind of ahead of the curve. You know, the most, some would say extreme position, the most-clear position. Others would say in terms of how much she wants to protect the life and her view. But one person we have not heard about this one Republican is Donald Trump. He knows that the abortion politics are very -- the primary politics aren't the same as a general politics. So, we will see if she's able to navigate this here. But she does say that she has something that no other candidates do. She's a woman. She's given birth. She knows how this to a message this. So, it's a high wire act for her but a very interesting message. I think that she has been doing on the campaign trail, but obviously was giving a full speech on this to get some attention.",
