Why did it get so contentious in that briefing last night? What's going on here from your perspective? SEN. PETE RICKETTS (R-NE): Well, I think one of the things, of course, these are very high-stakes negotiations. And so, there's a lot on the line here. So, I think temperatures are rising. I think we have to remain calm and cool. You know, at the end of the day, divided government, which means there has to be a negotiation here. And frankly, we've been talking about this in September, the President put it in his supplemental package. So, he brought the border in here. The Speaker has been very clear about what he needs to see with regard to the border, we've got to have some policy changes. That's what we as Republicans in the Senate want to see. So, this negotiation just has to get on to be able to move forward on the supplemental package.",

Frankly, I don't know how Leader Schumer expects anybody to vote for the supplemental, and we haven't even seen in text (ph), but like, we're not just going to vote on something we don't know what we're voting on. That's just crazy. That's not going to fly. But hopefully it does send the message to Democrats that we have divided government, there's going to have to be a negotiation, that this is important for everybody. There's broad agreement on support for Ukraine, Israel, Indo-Pacific, we got to get something on the border.
