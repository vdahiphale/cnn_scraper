And the judge is having an issue with that, the pleading the Fifth. But there was even more today because there were texts that were shown to the jury, about on March 17th, that Ethan was at home alone and he was saying, \"I feel the house is haunted. The bowls are flying. There's a demon. When are you going to call me back? Can you text me back.\" Well, Jennifer was riding her horse at that moment. And there's been a ruling the judge made that alcohol will not come into this trial. Because the parents did drink. There were alcohol bottles found in the house. But the jury is not to know that. But the prosecution wanted a text that Jennifer sent to James around this time. Listen to this argument right here. Because alcohol is going to come into this trial. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That he will not say anything to incriminate himself because there's an appeal on his sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. It's the harshest punishment in Michigan. And his brand-new appellate attorneys are going to fight to get it decreased. So, the judge says, if we know already he's going to plead the Fifth, I'm not going to allow you to put him on the stand. So it appears as though that's how it goes right now. We'll see what happens. Boris, I've seen before that the defendant convicted is brought to the courthouse. The jury goes out of the room. He is put on the stand to see exactly what he will say when he's on the stand, out of the presence of the jury. But remember, Ethan and his mother, they haven't seen each other in two years.

And there has been a lot of work to help them understand that we're working very closely with the NTSB, through the investigation, making sure that we're putting forward recommendations to make sure this never happens again. Working with the FAA very closely to make sure that there is continued oversight, greater oversight in terms of getting these aircraft certified in the first place but also in the production lines. So, the follow-through here with the FAA and the NTSB in recommendations coming out of this investigation is very important, and an important part of feeling confident about getting back on a Boeing aircraft. The people at Boeing, the engineers and the maintenance people, those are all wonderful people. And the problem here has been in the C- suite.
