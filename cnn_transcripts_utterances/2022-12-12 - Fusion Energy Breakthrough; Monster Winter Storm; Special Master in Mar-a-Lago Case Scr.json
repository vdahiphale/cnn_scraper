Then that puts you on better footing than Congress right now. If lawmakers can't hash out a spending deal in the next five days or so, brace for a government shutdown. Today, some signs Democrats and Republicans are easing off their game of chicken. We will tell you where the talks stand. And we're tracking dangerous weather bearing down on millions of people right now; 16 states are under alert. We have the latest forecast. Plus, nuclear scientists just made a huge breakthrough that brings us one step closer to the Holy Grail of clean energy. We will explain. First to Washington, where time is running out to avert a government shutdown. And CNN's Jessica Dean joins us from Capitol Hill. Jessica, what are the sticking points right now? And what are the chances this all gets sorted out before that Friday deadline?",

      "sentences": "Well, there's a lot of layers here, Ana, so let me just walk you through this week. What we do know is, over the weekend, the negotiations, we're told,inched closer to some resolution, but they are still billions of dollars apart on the top-line number. And what that means is, just what's the number that they're going to spend? What is the number going to be? Republicans and Democrats still very far apart on that? You mentioned the funding deadline for this Friday. They have another option, though. They could pass a short-term funding bill that would give them a little more time before this year runs out. And that is generally the consensus we're getting from everyone, is that that is the most likely scenario, and that it is very unlikely that there will be a government shutdown. So that is the good news, at this point, very unlikely there will be a government shutdown on Friday. They will most likely pass the short-term funding bill, which then gets us to the next layer of all of this. What do they do after that? What we know is that the top negotiators on the committees, both Republican and Democrat, want a deal. We know that Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer want a deal. Nancy Pelosi wants a deal. They want to do this full funding package. It's the most robust and easiest, most efficient way to fund the government. If they can't get that done -- and they really have until, say, December 23, so not that much time -- if they can't get that done, then they could do another kind of short-term funding bill and kick the can down the road. The wrinkle there is, remember, in January, that is when Republicans will take over the House. So, right now, Democrats still have all levers of government in their hands. They would like to get this done. Also, if they are able to pass this funding package, they will be able to change the funding of the government to kind of suit their priorities. That's something that's been very important to them. If they don't do that, if they just do another short-term or a continuing -- what's called a continuing resolution, but it's just a continuation of what already exists, then it really sets the government funding at these same levels, which is something that's not appealing to a lot of people involved in this process. So, Ana, again, all of that information is to say the bottom line is they are inching ever closer. We don't expect a government shutdown on Friday, but we do expect them to try to give themselves a little more time with a short-term funding bill to try to get this larger package done before the end of the year.",

We're tracking high-profile moves from the new special counsel leading the federal probes tied to former President Trump. And he could start picking up the pace, because, today, a major hurdle for the Justice Department has been removed. That third-party review of documents seized from Mar-a-Lago was officially scrapped. Our senior crime and justice correspondent, Katelyn Polantz, is in Washington, and CNN senior legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Elie Honig is here with us in New York.

      "sentences": "Yes, Ana, he has been busy.This is exactly what you would expect to see out of an investigation that is aggressive and fast-moving. And, let's remember, Jack Smith has only been special counsel for three weeks and change. And, in that time, we have seen a real flurry of activity, starting in the grand jury. We have seen grand jury testimony. We haven't seen the testimony, but we know that Pat, Cipollone Stephen Miller, other key Trump White House aides have gone into the grand jury and testified. Now, most of that was already in the works when Jack Smith took over, but he certainly did not hit the brakes. We also are seeing an expanding financial investigation. We know now there's been a subpoena on the Save America PAC and other Trump- affiliated entities. We also know -- Katelyn Polantz just talked to us about the motion on the special master. Now, we know that, just days after Jack Smith took over, DOJ told the judge that special counsel Jack Smith is already read up on those legal issues. So, clearly, he is a quick study. And, finally, Ana, last week, we saw that DOJ under Jack Smith asked the judge, Judge Beryl Howell, on the Mar-a-Lago case to hold Donald Trump's legal team in contempt of court. Now, that was probably a step too far. The judge said, no, that's not necessary now. You all need to work this out yourself. But we have seen a lot of activity, Ana. And, as you said, he's doing this all from a hospital in Europe. Apparently, he had some sort of bike accident. So, apparently, he moves quickly.",

First of all, Robert Mueller had one job. It was to investigate alleged interference by Russia in the 2016 presidential election. Now, that's a big job, a lot of different tentacles, but it was all under one heading. Jack Smith has been given two jobs, two very distinct jobs, to investigate January 6 and the Mar-a-Lago documents. Those are completely separate conduct. Really, the only thing they have in common is this guy, Donald Trump. Now, there also are differences in the way that they're going about their investigation. So, we now know from Katelyn's new reporting and the team that Jack Smith has about 20 prosecutors working on the January 6 piece of the case. That's more prosecutors than Robert Mueller had -- ever had. We also know that Jack Smith has been adding new resources from within DOJ, whereas Robert Mueller sort of set himself up on an island separate from DOJ. And we know Jack Smith has been integrating on the fly. This investigation has continued. Robert Mueller really had to start from square one. So there are very different investigative and procedural postures here.",

      "sentences": "Special counsel does not have magical superpowers. In fact, the primary superpower a special counsel has is, they're federal prosecutors.There's a little bit of difference, though, in the level of independence that they have. So here's out of the special counsel regulations. First of all, the special counsel is not subject to the day-to-day supervision of the attorney general. They have to notify the A.G. of significant events. Certainly, that would include an indictment. And, really importantly, the attorney general, Merrick Garland, can overrule the special counsel, but he has to give the special counsel's recommendation great weight, meaning he has to sort of defer, but not necessarily give way to, the special counsel. Now, this is really important. If that happens, if Jack Smith says, I want to indict and Merrick Garland says no, or vice versa, that has to be reported to Congress, maybe not right away. But if that happens, we will know it. The other thing is, it's hard to fire a special counsel, can only be for misconduct or other good cause. And, ultimately, a special counsel has to file a written a report with the A.G., which the A.G. can then give over to Congress or make public. We all remember the Mueller report. Someday, we may see a Jack Smith report.",

And, remember, DOJ's argument here is that there was a specific plan in place prior to January 6 to storm the Capitol and attempt to overturn the election, in other words, the very basis of the seditious conspiracy charge. However, only two of five defendants in that trial were convicted of that charge. Prosecutors struggled to overcome testimony from several civilian defendants, including other members of the Oath Keepers, who repeatedly said there was no explicit plan to storm the Capitol on January 6, 2021. All four defendants in this second phase have pleaded not guilty. Opening statements are set to begin in the next few minutes, Ana.",

And judges really questioned whether that charge is applicable to these riot-related prosecutions. As DOJ moves through these cases, and, in general, any cases, they always want the maximum weight of the law behind them. That helps them get valuable information from defendants. It sometimes helps them obtain a plea deal if they can say, look, you might face 20 years, 30 years behind bars. So, Ana, they really need as much power as possible when they are moving through these cases. And if the appeals court decides that this charge doesn't work here, that's taking away an option to pursue a pretty heavy charge, one that in this specific case can carry a maximum sentence of 20 years, Ana.",
