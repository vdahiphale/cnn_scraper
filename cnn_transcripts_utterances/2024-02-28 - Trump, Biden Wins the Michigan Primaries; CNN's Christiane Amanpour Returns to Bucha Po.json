Both Donald Trump and Joe Biden have won their party's primaries decisively, pushing them closer to a November rematch but with vulnerabilities on display.Although President Biden raked in around 80 percent of the Democratic vote, a key voting bloc selected uncommitted on the party ballot to protest the Biden administration's support for Israel in Gaza. The U.S. President did not mention them in his victory statement. And while Trump notched a solid victory over Republican rival Nikki Haley, she still netted about a quarter of the vote, which indicates they're still a sizable group of Republicans either firmly opposed to him or yet to be convinced he's the right candidate. But the Trump camp is already looking ahead to the general election, saying that if he wins Michigan in November, he wins the whole thing. Here's CNN's Kristen Holmes in West Palm Beach, Florida. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT): Former President Trump's win in the state of Michigan, not really a surprise. They didn't really have to campaign there. He only went there three times since announcing his candidacy back in 2022. And in fact, he wasn't even there on primary night. He instead just called into a GOP watch party. But what is important about this race is that they are looking for clues to inform them about a potential rematch against President Joe Biden. So part of what they are doing is looking at the data. Who came out to vote? Who didn't come out to vote? And one of the sectors they're really looking at is union households, because Donald Trump and his team believe they can drive a wedge between Joe Biden and one of his core voting blocs, which is organized labor. We saw Donald Trump twice in Michigan, really trying to reach out to these workers. At one point, just about a week ago, he was saying that the migrant crisis was going to affect jobs in Michigan. Then back in September, when he visited a non-union shop during the auto worker strike, he lamented Joe Biden's electric vehicle mandate, saying essentially that it was going to hurt these autoworkers' jobs. Now, since then, we have seen the United Auto Workers endorse Biden. Donald Trump has lashed out at the president of the United Auto Workers. He's also tried to court the Teamsters. He went for a meeting in Washington, D.C., which was mixed results. There were a lot of rank-and-file members who were very happy to be talking to the former president. But we also heard from one executive board member who called him a scab and an insurrectionist and someone who was anti-union. So clearly, this might be somewhat of a battle.

In each of the last three Democratic presidential primaries, there's been an uncommitted vote that's exceeded 20,000. So the Listen to Michigan campaign in setting its goal at 10,000 was already establishing kind of an artificially low bar. 48,000, which is the most recent number I've seen who voted uncommitted, is non-trivial, certainly.But Biden did win the state in 2020 by about 154,000, plus the actual percentage of uncommitted this year actually equals out to about the same who voted uncommitted in 2012, even though the numbers look inflated because overall turnout is higher. I think a certain fraction of uncommitted vote will also turn out for Biden in November. This is just symbolism. So I do think that these defections are a concern for Biden. But Biden's prospects in Michigan and similar states, I believe, are going to hinge much more on wider demographics.",

I think the main issue of who wins Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan comes down to who appeals to large, pivotal constituencies, blue collar workers, suburban women, etc. That's where general elections are won and lost. And so I do think that Biden administration and Trump's campaign at the same time has to keep their eye on the ball here and they need to focus on sort of what is most likely to drive the vote.",

And for them, Haley is almost a protest vote of their own.But it's not enough to make this race competitive. And momentum is likely to push some of Trump's vote totals even higher in Super Tuesday states where the composition of the voting base is much more MAGA. Haley's clearly hoping that Trump's legal challenges will catch up to him. This is a concern for Trump. We saw it in South Carolina as well, that there's a certain fraction that is just a holdout.

It was states where there's a strong independence streak and then in South Carolina where it was her home state.But, you know, she's put up a fight for Donald Trump. I think a lot of people, especially Democrats, are going to respect that. But at the end of the day, I'm not sure how much she has achieved, except insofar as she's proven that there never was sort of a sizable anti-Trump vote in the Republican Party. There was always this theory that voters wanted the Trump light, that they wanted Trump without the drama. I think that they wanted Trump specifically and they wanted Trump ultra. None of that's changed. So we're headed toward, you know, a Joe Biden versus Donald Trump rematch. Not many Americans are enthusiastic about it, but that's the reality.",

It doesn't seem that the United States has seen it yet because the U.S. still insisting that until such time as it sees a concrete plan to protect the civilian population and that would enable them to get to areas where they would have shelter, where they would have aid, medicines and the like, until such time as they see that, they are cautioning against an Israeli ground operation. But it's important to note that Israel is determined to go into Rafah even if these truce talks, which would see Israeli hostages freed in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. Israel says that even if that comes into effect, whether it's President Biden's Monday assertion or at a later date, that Israel will go into Rafah anyway. And the reason for that is that Israel says that it needs to destroy Hamas militarily. There are four Hamas battalions in Rafah. It needs to destroy those to prevent Hamas making good on its promise to carry out October the 7th terrorist attacks again in future. And as a result, that is why it must go into Rafah. Now, we heard from Daniel Hagari, the chief international spokesman for the IDF, telling CNN that this evacuation of the population needs to happen, needs to be with the right conditions, adding that we will make those conditions occur if we act and talking about safe zones where Palestinians would be able to receive food, medicines, shelter and the like. So there are still concerns about that operation taking place and still hopes that that truce can come into effect, which would at the very least forestall the ground operation in Rafah. And during that truce, there could be talks about the potential end to the war between Israel and Hamas. Rosemary.",
