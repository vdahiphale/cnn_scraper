Look at this. We got a 50-50 Senate right now between Democrats and Republicans with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking that tie. So, any one seat, any one seat shift could make all the difference in the world.So, what are some key states that we're watching? Here are some key Senate races that we're watching. Look, we got Wisconsin, we got Georgia, we got Pennsylvania, we got Nevada, we got Arizona. Not on here, also my favorite state, the place where I went to college, New Hampshire is another state that we're watching. Let's dive in, dive in again an understanding of one of these key states. We're going to be looking at the Keystone State, Pennsylvania, the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Take a look at how tight the polling is there right now. The choice for Pennsylvania Senate, it's within the margin of error. Democrat John Fetterman at 47%, Mehmet Oz at 47%. This race has been tightening this entire last few months. And to give you an understanding of how important the Pennsylvania Senate race is to Democrats' chance of maintaining control, if Mehmet Oz wins the Republican, they have just an 18% chance of holding on to the chamber. if John Fetterman, the Democrat, wins, look at this, the Democrats' chances jump all the way up to 70%. So, Pennsylvania, a really key state. Back to you, Alisyn.",
