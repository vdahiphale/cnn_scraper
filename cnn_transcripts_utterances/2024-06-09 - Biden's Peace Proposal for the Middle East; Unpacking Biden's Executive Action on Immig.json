And that has the real potential to bring down this government, which is the last thing this prime minister wants to do, given the political uncertainty and his legal vulnerability.What I think is so interesting about the last couple of days, though, in this rate is nothing that happened in this rescue of the four hostages changes any of this. This was a tactical success for Israel. It was impressive what was accomplished, although as others have pointed out, obviously it came at considerable cost in lives. But it doesn't change any of the basics in terms of what is the definition of success in Gaza and how do you make a transition from having militarily reduce the competence or capabilities of Hamas and translating that into something political. Because the last thing Israel, I would assume, wants to see is the reconstitution of Hamas. But in order to prevent that, you've got to have someone else provide security in Gaza and you've got to have somebody else other than Hamas provide political direction, provide an economic environment where people can prosper. So if you don't want Hamas and you don't want Israeli occupation, you need something else presumably with Palestinians and Arabs. But this Israeli government for exactly the reasons you say can't allow that to happen. So what you have is almost putting off, keep pushing off the question of what comes next. ZAKARIA: And what about Hamas? Is there any prospect it would accept the deal?",

But why would Hamas sign onto something where essentially the entire logic of the policy is to eliminate their role in Gaza's future? I don't see that they're prepared to do that. I don't see that they're prepared to give up all the hostages because, again, that gets rid of their principal piece of leverage. So I don't see Hamas as a partner for serious peace talks here.Again, I keep coming back to the same point, Fareed, and I think it's probably one you share, that Israel has done, you know, some real work at degrading Hamas. But you can't beat something with nothing. In order to beat Hamas politically you've got to introduce another element here. The Saudis, the UAE, and the other Arab governments are willing to do it. You're going to need some role for the Palestinian authority. President Biden made it clear that the United States will be a partner, but it needs Israel to pivot to that place but it's unwilling to so I think what we'll likely to see -- sorry to sound so downbeat this morning. I think what we'll likely to see is the war in Gaza continue for some time, albeit at a lower level. You may see more attempts to rescue hostages. It won't -- there's no way to physically get most of the hostages out. It would only come politically. So I think we're looking at probably a long slow grind in Gaza. And as I said before, where you could see increased conflict, intense military operations might be in the north, in Lebanon.",

You had civil wars raging in Central America and the U.S. was deeply involved in what was happening there. It was trying to limit the spread of communism and as a result it was supporting repressive regimes that were driving, you know, hundreds of thousands of people away from the country and away from the violence.And so even from the very beginning, you saw American foreign policy in stark tension with the principles of asylum and the idea that the U.S. legally is going to extend protection to people who have been being persecuted. The consequences of years of kind of neglect and disregard for what the asylum program was supposed to entail meant that by the time you get into the early 2000s and the 2010s, you start to see large numbers of people primarily from Central America showing up at the southern border seeking protection. The U.S., for all of the money it had poured into the border over the years, had never actually anticipated that that many people would show up seeking protection. Legally, they had the right to and the U.S. had the obligation to extend them protections, but there wasn't the infrastructure in place to do it.",

BLITZERthat the asylum system has essentially had to answer for the failures of the wider immigrant mission system. You know, asylum was never designed to be just a vehicle for people to come to the United States for work to reunite with families and so on. It was designed specifically to help people who are persecuted based on their identity. But what's happened in Washington has been that no one is able to kind of span the partisan divide on immigration. As a result, the wider legal immigration system hasn't been updated since the very least 1990. And so you have people who do have very legitimate and urgent reasons to come to the United States, who don't have legal avenues, and so they're taking their chances at the border and we're in this perfect circle.",

But what the election has done is put Mexico in a situation or consolidate the situation that it has been over the last several years of democratic erosion, where socioeconomic rights win a majority, and political and economic rights, that when associates the functional democracy, will probably be eliminated.

But the point I make here is that this is a trend that has been happening for the last 20 years. That every president's approval rating, on average, tends to get lower even under Trump, when the so-called misery index of inflation plus unemployment was so low, his approval ratings were low. So, I think, there's something deep which is going on here where at the surface the economy seems to be doing OK.
