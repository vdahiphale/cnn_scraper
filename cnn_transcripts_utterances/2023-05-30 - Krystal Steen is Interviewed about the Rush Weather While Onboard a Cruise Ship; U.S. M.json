The alleged attack left at least two people injured, that's according to Russia, and also several buildings with minor damage.It comes as Russia launched an attack at the Ukrainian capital overnight. Another attack. One woman was killed and more than a dozen others were injured. Russia has engaged in relentless attacks day and night against Kyiv for the last several days. We're also watching Iowa right now where a new survivor has been rescued from a partially collapsed building in davenport. That brings the number of people pulled from this rubble to nine. City officials are now preparing to demolish the remaining structure. No deaths have been reported. But it is unclear still if any other people remain unaccounted for. The cause for the collapse has yet to be determined. Rahel.",

With all that recession watch, a Dow that is flat, the S&amp;P 500 is up almost 10 percent and the Nasdaq, whose tech stocks have been really going gangbusters. So, you've got stock investors who've already had a pretty good first half of the year here, even with all of these headwinds, like politics in Washington, recession fears, has the Fed gone too far, has the Fed not gone far enough.

Tensions flared when ethnic Serbs tried to force their way into a town hall on Monday but they were blocked as police fired off tear gas. They've been protesting the results of last month's elections which allowed ethnic Albanians to take control of local councils despite a large Serbian majority in that region. Now, this week, two journalists are on trial in Iran, being prosecuted for reporting on the funeral and massive protests after the death of Mahsa Amini this past fall. Iran accuses the two female journalists of, quote, colluding with hostile powers for their coverage of Amini's death. The charges they face could carry the death penalty. We're also learning more about the victims of a fatal boat incident on a northern Italian lake in - on Sunday. Two victims were identified as Italian secret service agents. The houseboat was over capacity when it apparently was hit by a wave and capsized during a birthday celebration. An investigation is underway to see if the captain is culpable for these deaths.

And so just as you're saying, Maximo Altez, he is the lawyer for Joran van der Sloot, he was the attorney from the very beginning, knows him well. And at Challapalca Prison, which is a maximum security prison in a very remote area of Peru, he's telling CNN that Joran was severely beaten. Not just beaten but severely beaten and he is in the medic area of that prison.Well, CNN contacted Peru's National Penitentiary Institute. They are saying he was not beaten, he was not attacked at all. But let's look at a quote from the attorney for Joran van der Sloot. He says that he doesn't believe the beating was related to the upcoming extradition. It may, however, be connected to gang rules inside Challapalca Prison, where he is being held. And, you know, in Peruvian prisons, there are many good things about Peruvian prisons because they really have rehabilitation inside there. But you can wear street clothes. And when I was at Castro Castro Prison, what I saw was that because the street clothes have - they have pockets and they can wear jackets and coats, you can hide weapons. And I saw weapons. And you can really violently attack someone. You know, when you look at Joran van der Sloot, he is a violent offender because he is serving a murder sentence for Stephanie Flores, a young girl in Peru. And I found my notes from being in Peru, and she had lacerations all over her body, there was blood all over the bedroom, the bathroom, the bed. They were at her apartment. She had cranial fractures, hemorrhaging to the brain. So, obviously, this was an extremely violent murder. And now this. And another question is that, since he is high profile, the case is becoming high profile. He was in solitary confinement for a long time in Peru because there was so much high profile aspect tot his. And he was the one that ultimately asked to be in general population. Why was he not in some type of protective custody right now as that paperwork is being done.",

BERMAN: The - no, the three-zero comeback to tie it 3-3 was pretty interesting for a few minutes until the game started last night, in which case it ceased to be interesting at all.
