      "sentences": "OUTFRONT nextTrump wants every day regular people, voters to help him pay half a billion dollars in the next few days. Meanwhile, Trump Org is reportedly building new property in Florida that would cost millions of dollars. So, is Trump really out of cash? Plus, a motion to impeach Biden today rejected by Republicans. Why? Well, they don't have the votes. The Biden impeachment investigation losing more steam tonight. And Oprah Winfrey speaking for the first time tonight about for dramatic way heat loss to Gayle King and Charles Barkley. And you will get the first preview here this hour. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight: Trump turning to voters, asking them to pay his bond, his $464 million bond. He says that it's unfair. So he wants other people, regular Americans, to foot the bill, a whole new definition of other people's money, sending this text message, quote, keep your filthy hands off Trump Tower. Democrats want to seize my properties. And then you see there, the link to donate money. Now, Trump says he does not have enough money to finance the $464 million bond and the clock is ticking. He has just five days to come up with the money or the New York attorney general, Letitia James, is threatening to see some of his most beloved properties. But James tonight making it clear, she says that Trump does have the money. He just doesn't want to fork it over. In a filing tonight, James writes, quote: If Trump were truly unable to secure the bond, quote, they at minimum should have consented to have their real-estate interests held by the Supreme Court to satisfy the judgment. Now, Trump has refused to do this. In fact, what he has said is that the best he could do is $100 million of the $464 million required, which is why this story today caught our attention in \"The Palm Beach Post\". They report that Eric Trump said in a statement today, quote, we look forward to adding this beautiful building two are already amazing property and club, Trump National Golf Club Jupiter. Now, Trump is referring to plans to build a new office complex at the Trump National in Jupiter. And according to \"The Palm Beach Post\", the price tag on this building would be $12 million to $15 million. Now, if that really is the case, this one example just serves to raise the very real questions that are out there. Because Trump cannot say he does not have any more money if there's $15 million here and $15 million there. And who's now how much however there, you get the point. Maybe he's just hoping that nobody looks too hard, that the web of complexity of his businesses is just too opaque to see through, because maybe he just wants people to see only the buildings that he is refusing to put on the line, the ones that made him a brand to America in the open of \"The Apprentice\", the ones that define not just his net worth, but his self-worth. And that is why the very thought that New York could seize Trumps properties is deeply personal to him. I mean, just listen to this. It goes all the way back when we talk about net worth and self-worth. Here is Trump with Connie Chung in an interview in 1990.

OUTFRONT now, Ryan Goodman, our OUTFRONT legal analysts. Also, Stephanie Grisham, the former White House press secretary for then-President Trump, and Jonathan Greenberg, investigative journalist who has covered Trump in his finances for decades. He says that Trump did not tell him the truth when he worked at Forbes about his wealth in an effort to get on the Forbes list of wealthiest Americans. Ryan, let me start with you. So, just the very basics here, Trump says he's got $100 million and by the way, he had -- has pledged as much to E. Jean Carroll in that case. So that would mean a couple of hundred million at least have been put forward, says he doesn't have the remainder, but you've read through the filing from the New York attorney general today when she says, well, you could have gotten backing from insurance companies for little pieces of it as opposed to the whole thing, you could have had assets be held by the Supreme Court.

That would even be in smart in some sense because then at least he chooses the properties. She doesn't use the properties, so she might go after the Mona Lisas and the like.So there are options he had. The other options are trying to at least get closer to the $450 million, $550 million with insurance companies by accumulating it through different companies. But he hasn't seemed to do that at all. So there are other ways in which this is just doesn't make sense. And there's another one as well, which is that he should have probably prepared to lose the case.

You've finished an in-depth analysis of Trump properties here in New York. Those Mona Lisas as they refer to them.And I just I want to show everybody the math that you did. This is the fire sale value. So you're knocking 22, 40 percent off the value of each of these buildings to get to the value on the screen. Seven of these properties here in New York, that gets you just actually to write about the $464 million that he would need. The point that you're making here is that you got to add all of them together to even get there.

First, Ryan in a debate, Hillary Clinton Trump declared bankruptcy six times. \"Washington Post\" fact-checker found that to be true. So this is something he has had no problem doing in the past.

This is because of the New York liberals are doing this to me. This is just a business move to protect myself. I can hear it now. He won't -- he won't like it personally, but I can absolutely see him doing that. And then, you know, Ryan could probably speak to this more, but once he becomes president, I don't know what kinds of things he would have.

But he does say nothing of importance was discussed at those times. Again, though, talking about the importance of the meetings, and that is why maybe 68 percent of Americans think President Biden did act either illegally or unethically in Hunter Biden's business dealings.

And certainly nobody there to give you some perspective was talking about re-establishing Gush Katif or re-establishing any kind of settlements inside Gaza.

But they are politically a very powerful minority at the moment because they have such strong representation in Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition government. She also said, which I think is relevant to this idea, that their ideas, which were traditionally seen as fringe now have a lot more traction because in the aftermath of October 7, you do see a hardening of views in Israel, you do see a shift to the right just as you do many other countries after a massive attack like that, certainly you saw something similar after 9/11 in the U.S., Erin.",

Number one, people understand obesity is a disease. And so, stop blaming yourself for something that's in your brain. Stop shaming yourself and other people for that. And also to explain what the drugs actually do. So I want to -- want to say this because we taped an hour and 14 minutes extra and had to cut that out. And so, it was really important for me -- for people to understand, all the people who are saying that people like myself, and you, Charles, are taking this medicine from other people. We are not because there are, there are Zepbound, there's Mounjaro, there's Wegovy, there's Ozempic. So both companies that we had on produce a medications that are just for obesity. And the reason why obesity and obesity drug and the diabetes drug are called something different is because your insurance pays for the diabetes drugs, if you have diabetes. It does not pay for the weight loss version of that drug. So, nobody's taking drugs away from anybody else or medications away from anybody else because there is specifically an obesity medication. I think if you feel like being in a bigger body is great and you don't want to do anything about that and you feel fine, that is beautiful. I really admire people who really believe that. And I also feel like if you think, if you can work out and workout and I'm like you, Charles, I couldn't work out anymore.
