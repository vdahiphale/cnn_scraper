So, look, I think there are a few things. The first is that I somewhat disagree with my friend and my colleague today about who has the most to lose and the most the gain, and that being Ron DeSantis. And the reason being is because we actually have DeSantis' work product. I mean, Ron DeSantis got molly-whopped in a debate by Andrew Gillum. And he got destroyed by Charlie Crist. and I'm not sure Charlie Crist is anybody's example of what a glowing political candidate should be at this stage in his career. And so, we actually know how he debates and how poorly he debates. For me, it's going to go South Carolina, meaning Tim Scott and Nikki Haley with the most upside. Then Donald Trump even though he's not there, probably having an opportunity to win the debate. And then the third tier is going to be those individuals who actually have some fortitude who stand up against Donald Trump, and those two individuals right now are only Asa Hutchinson and Chris Christie. So, I think those are the three tiers of individuals who have an opportunity to win tomorrow night. And just for the record, Donald Trump's counterprogramming is horrible. I don't think anybody's going to be watching Tucker Carlson on Twitter or X, or whatever it's called now. And I don't think anybody's going to be responsive to his, \"Counterprogramming.\" However, regardless of it, Nikki and Tim who are talented, who do give a vision for the future, politically we disagree but it seems to be healthy for the Republican Party. Even if they have a good night, that -- that's going to be short lived, because at 6:00 a.m., people will be talking about something else. BOLDUAN:  Yes. Kevin, what do you think could equate to a losing night for Donald Trump? I have a hard time seeing what a losing night for Donald Trump is tomorrow night.",

And so, if that happens, right now, we don't have, you know, other than Ron DeSantis, there has not been an alternative emerge.

And he probably should be spending time with Kevin today preparing for the debate, because he really doesn't have any policy depth. And the fact that he is out there hitting a tennis ball shows you that he's not really going to take this seriously tomorrow night, and we're going to see his lack of depth shown through.I think that he's going to be the one who actually the bottom falls out He is going to be the one who is actually the bottom falls out, because right now in most polls he's running third.

It's normal.The Justice Department, we should note, is opposing this motion, and they have until August 30th to reply. But I do think it is the first or one of the illustrations of news organizations looking for transparency. The big one, of course, in these cases will be cameras in the court.

And if you can stream it to the public, people can see in real-time what's actually happening there, I think that might be beneficial to the discourse around those trials.
