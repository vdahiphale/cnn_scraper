After months of political deadlock, U.S. lawmakers appear poised to vote on fresh age for Israel and Ukraine, but could it end up costing House Speaker Mike Johnson his job. And unrest in Georgia after lawmakers approved an early draft of a controversial bill that critics are calling repressive and progression. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, Benjamin Netanyahu was already facing growing calls to resign from many Israelis, fed up with his handling of the war in Gaza. And that was before Iran's unprecedented attack. As CNN's Nic Robertson reports, the pressure on Netanyahu and his government has perhaps never been greater. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): As protesters in Tel Aviv were trying to unseat Israel's prime minister, Saturday, demanding he stop the war in Gaza, allow the release of hostages, Iran was launching attack drones towards them. The two things are not disconnected. Iran appears to think Benjamin Netanyahu is vulnerable, unpopular at home, increasingly alienated from his ironclad ally, America.",

Israel today is the country that is most attacked and most threatened in the world. We have five active fronts as we speak, where Israel's being attacked. Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, where you had 18 soldiers just yesterday, severely wounded from anti-tank missiles and suicide drones. We have the Houthis in Yemen, who are firing still drones and missiles into Israel. And of course, Iran and Iraqi, and Syrian militias.

The first direct unprecedented attack from Iranian territory against the Jewish state of Israel.And the Cabinet is divided because on the one hand, there are people who were almost what were five, six days into this almost, and Israel has yet to retaliate. People are concerned, legitimately, I think that this policy of containment, if not retaliating will only invite Iran to think that it can do this again. On the other hand, there are those within the Cabinet who are listening to what the Americans, and the British, and the French, and other G7 friends of Israel are telling us, which is, don't retaliate. The interception of those missiles and drones was a win, you're able to do it successfully with this new collective regional alliance, which involves the Jordanians and the Saudis and others. That's the big win to show in defiance of Iran that the region stands together, don't escalate things and focus on what you have to do, which is finish up the Gaza Strip. So, Netanyahu is really trying to thread a very difficult needle, I would say, through this whole situation, on the one hand, wrap up the war in Gaza, and the other hand, make sure that Iran learns a lesson, it can't do this again.",

And there is a tenuous relationship today between Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Joe Biden. And this has to do with past grievances and maybe the form of the Israeli coalition and the right-wing bent and the judicial reform. But whatever it is, when you don't have that basic trust, which you need between a prime minister and a president, you need between two governments, especially when facing the magnitude and scope of threats that Israel faces. That's going to be a handicap. And I think that, that contributes to this lack of decisiveness that we're seeing right now in how to respond to retaliate potentially to Iran.

Former U.S. President Donald Trump met with Poland's president in New York on Wednesday. The Trump campaign says the two discussed NATO member states increasing their defense spending and Russia's war on Ukraine. Polish President Andrzej Duda has called for pledges to be increased from 2 percent to 3 percent of a country's GDP.Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has been critical of NATO defense spending. In February, he said he would encourage Russia to do \"whatever the hell they want to any NATO member that doesn't meet spending guidelines on defense.\" Protests erupted for a third night in Georgia's capital over a controversial bill, which many say uses Russian tactics to crack down on free speech as it makes its way through parliament. But even though vocal crowds and the country's own president oppose the bill becoming law, there is not much they can do to stop it. CNN's Sebastian Shukla reports. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEBASTIAN SHUKLA, CNN INTERNATIONAL FIELD PRODUCER (voice-over): Protesters and police clashing on the streets of Georgia's capital Tbilisi. Skirmishes for the second consecutive year against a controversial foreign agents bill, a schism between government and public, mass protests outside the parliament of this former soviet republic and from within. Georgian opposition seeing this bill as more than a smack in the face, the leader of Georgia's ruling political faction, Georgian Dream, being attacked by an opposition MP and a brawl ensuing. Lawmakers have just passed a bill known as \"On transparency of foreign influence\" that would require all organizations that accept funds from outside the country to register as foreign agents or face fines. Approved on first reading by a majority of 83 votes in a parliament of 150, the country's division encapsulated by spontaneous applause and immediate descent. Protesters and the opposition united on their stance that Russia is at play here, even dubbing it the Russian law.",

There is no way to link this bill and the desire to secure Georgia's internal politics with some kind of Russian influence. This is not the case. Russia, Georgia's neighbor who went for a brief war with in 2008, has a similar law on foreign agents and is widely viewed as being a suppression of civil society and press freedom. Georgia's ruling party still aspires to become a full EU member, but the block has described the law as not in line with EU core norms or values. President Salome Zourabichvili has promised to veto it, but the Georgian dream seem prepared to foist the bill on Georgians kicking and screaming. Sebastian Shukla, CNN, Berlin. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This is the \"SS Food Challenge,\" often called the Hunger Games with a social twist. It is also reminiscent of another global rage, Takeshi's Castle, an epic game show from Japan, in which players overcome obstacles to win. While the comparisons are inevitable, the beginnings of \"SS Food Challenge\" are rooted in necessity rather than the sole thrill of it.",
