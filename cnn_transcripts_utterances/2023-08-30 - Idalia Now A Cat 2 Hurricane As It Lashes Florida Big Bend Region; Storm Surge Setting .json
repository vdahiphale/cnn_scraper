The powerful storm came ashore as a category three hurricane, but is now a still extremely dangerous category two. It's ripping through Florida with 105-mile per hour winds.And you can see this reporter from our WFTS affiliate, struggling to stand, at one point getting blown over. This was in Perry, Florida. And as the storm now tracks across the state, the threat along Florida's coast is not over and it's still dire. The storm surge is still rising. Cars and homes are getting covered. And places like St. Pete's Beach, police say that they rescued at least one person from a trailer home community.",

This is something people, in this lifetime, in this area, have never seen in person a storm this strong has not battered the Big Bend area in some 125 years.CNN NEWS CENTRAL anchors John Berman and Sara Sidner are leading our live team coverage they are standing by. John is in Tallahassee where rain has been coming down all morning. And Sara is further south in Crystal River, where the water keeps getting closer and closer inland. The message from officials right now is still hunker down, stay off the road. Officials say that emergency crews are staged and ready to rescue people if needed as soon as it is safe. We also have crews up and down Florida's West Coast, ready to show you Idalia's power and fury like only CNN can. Let's get to CNN's John Berman though who's in Tallahassee. And, John, you've been able to drive through part of the Gulf Coast of Florida. And you've seen some of the preparations underway. Take us to Tallahassee and what it's like there.",

But the area of major concern, even as this hurricane moves inland toward Georgia, still as a hurricane, the major areas of concern are along the Florida Gulf Coast from Tampa all the way up through the Big Bend where they are experiencing historic and devastating storm surge.I want to go right to Bill Weir Steinhatchee, in Florida, you know, not -- he is about an hour and a half from where I am right now driving, but it's a world away in terms of the level of devastation, Bill.

We're taking shelter behind one of these grand trees that are here.But we've seen plenty of this, you know, corrugated steel sheeting tin roofs blowing around, peeling off here. But again, just to sort of level what the locals were telling us. Last night, we went out on a short boat cruise in the calm before the storm with a local captain here who said he was worried that the surge would reach the roofline of the Dockside Grill right there. You can see it, it came up a few feet in inside but nowhere near their worst fears. That gives you some perspective that probably could have been a lot worse in this area. But as far as what's happening further up, even beach, all of that, we don't know yet. It's too soon to tell.",

Please stay safe and please keep us posted over the next several hours as well. Bill describing what he is seeing in Steinhatchee there, a town of 500 to 1,000 people, depending on the time of the year. What they are going through, which is quite bad and still developing right now. Let's go now down to Tampa, obviously, one of the major metropolitan centers of the state of Florida where while the storm did not make a direct hit there, not at all, the storm surge there has been a serious issue. Derek Van Dan is there. Derek, what are you seeing?",

And I can tell it's coming down hard where you are, too. And you're describing this two-prong concern of the storm surge in some areas, and then the freshwater flooding from inland to out.But if I can ask you lean on to your immediate logical expertise for a second about the storm surge, we were just speaking to Bill Weir a moment ago in Steinhatchee, who said at least there, it seems like the surge for now may have crested. They're seeing it back off a little bit and they're seeing a debris line there. Talk to us about how this could work over the next several hours, up and down the Big Bend area, even where you are. Could you see the surge recede some and then come back in again?",

      "sentences": "OK. So that's a great question. And what we got to do is we got to visualize how a hurricane rotates, counterclockwise, OK? And so I am on the eastern side of where that center, of where Idalia made landfall.Where Bill Weir is located, he's likely -- I haven't checked a map, but I believe he would be on the backside of the storm. So the wind direction will be completely opposite to what we're receiving here. And that's important. Let's compare it to Ian, from September of last year. There was a major difference to what happened in Tampa Bay that had the water literally sucked out because of the direction of the wind was pushing offshore here in Tampa, versus the onshore component that brought the surge to Fort Myers Beach. Same thing is happening here. We happen to be in the onshore component of the storm. And that is why we continue to see this push, the surge of water that is coming directly off the Gulf of Mexico. John. BERMAN: Yes, it's a really good explanation, Derek. And if you can, and I can't see you. So I don't know if you're just getting poured on or blown around now or what. So if you need to go let me know. But I'm going to hang on to you --",

      "sentences": "Yes. This is just incredible to think the unfortunate coincidence of this timing, right? We have high tide in Tampa Bay occurred about 2Let me explain what that is. Supermoon is actually when the full moon is at its closest approach to Earth. It's roughly about 18,000 miles closer than it normally would be on its elliptical path around the planet. So what that does is it exaggerates the tug, the pole on the ocean, and it exaggerates the low tides, but it also exaggerates the high tides. And now that we have what is a hurricane that has pushed up all of this water in combination with this high tide and the supermoon, we have the potential here for more surge in the locations that have been onshore component like I was explaining to you a moment ago.",

We started our morning all the way down here where you see those palm trees, perhaps. I think you can see those. That is where we started this morning and it was completely dry.Now, we are more than a football field and a half away. We use football fields here in Florida a lot because everybody knows how big those are, from where the water starts normally. Now, in the -- in the past two hours, we have seen the water rise very quickly. I'm going to take you a little walk around here (inaudible). The Best Western (ph) just take a quick picture of that (inaudible) (technical difficulty) I'm coming back. I'm coming back. Technologically speaking, there are some things we can do and some things we can't (inaudible). But right now, this storm surge is really, really serious. I mean, I see fish. There's like minnows all over the place. All of the flora and fauna, all of the animals. Sometimes you could see some of the sceneries and things that are in the water coming up, because basically, the water is just rising like this and being pushed in by the wind. We are starting to see a little bit of wind come here, but it seems very calm. So for a lot of people don't think, you know, let's go out and check it out. Don't do it. U.S. 19. They're up there. You see those vehicles flashing? So the police they have shut down the road. Why? Because if you look just past it, it is inundated by water. That big huge garbage can there was being pushed around like it was a canoe in the water because the water, you know, lifts up and that is exactly where it is placed. That is literally in the middle of a highway here in Florida. This is why they tell people look, it may seem like things have calmed down, because the winds have, but the storm surge is nowhere near at its height. The storm surge will be at its height here in Crystal River at 4:30 in the afternoon, Eastern Standard Time, which means we have several hours to go before we see this rise. And by the way, it has risen at least five feet, at least from where we were, which is right where the water's edge was. It was completely dry several hours ago. Now, it is inundated with water. I want to now go to and here we're seeing another band of wind, another band of rain coming through, even though these aren't even tropical storm force winds at this point. This just feels like a regular storm during a Florida summer afternoon. But this is definitely from the effects of Hurricane Idalia. Let me now go to Brian Todd, who is joining us now from another part of the west coast of Florida. Brian, tell me where you are and tell me what is happening where you are at this hour.",

Even though that Hurricane Idalia has made landfall, we are getting that collateral damage now. The water is rising. We've already had to do swift water rescue with boat. We've experienced some fires in that area. The electric companies have shut down the power for emergency protective measures to save life preservation because that is paramount, but the worst is yet to come.
