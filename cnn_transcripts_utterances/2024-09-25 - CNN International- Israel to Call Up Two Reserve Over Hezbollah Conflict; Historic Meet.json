Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will take to the podium in the coming hours. It is 09:00 a.m. in New York. It's 05:00 p.m. here in Abu Dhabi in the UAE. I'm Becky Anderson. This is \"Connect the World\". As we monitor what is happening in New York, also making news this hour, Israel intercepts a ballistic missile over Tel Aviv. It's the first time a Hezbollah attack has reached this far, close to the Israeli city. The UAE's Presidential Adviser tells me what he believes went wrong in the United States's strategy towards Israel and the Palestinians. And a new report details the stunning failures by the Secret Service in the first assassination attempt against Donald Trump. Well, World leaders at the United Nations calling for peace in the Middle East. On the ground, a new escalation between Israel and the militant group Hezbollah. Israel says it intercepted this missile as it approached Tel Aviv. This is Hezbollah's deepest strike ever into Israel. The group says it was targeting the Israeli Intelligence Agency Mossad. Israel also firing into Lebanon again today. More than 20 people there were killed. Officials say some half a million people in Lebanon have now left their homes. Some are sharing grim descriptions of remains strewn along the road. Villages in Southern Lebanon have been heading north, and the Israeli military has a warning for them. Don't come back yet. It is not safe. Let's get you to the region with Jomana Karadsheh in Beirut and Nic Robertson, who is in Tel Aviv. Nic, we've known that Hezbollah has missiles capable of reaching Tel Aviv. The graphic that I want to put on the screen now shows the various types and range of its rockets. As I understand it this is the first time a missile of this kind launched by Hezbollah has ever reached close to the city. What do we understand happened?",

There's no exact figure that has been provided by authorities. But as you had mentioned earlier, we are talking about, according to the foreign minister, a number that is approaching nearly half a million people, which, if you put it into context, that's nearly 10 percent of Lebanon's population that has been displaced right now. I mean, you have people in their thousands, Syrians and Lebanese who are trying to cross back into Syria in search of safety into Syria Becky. And you also have, for example, here in Beirut, in the hotel where we are staying at, we have seen an influx of displaced families who have arrived from Southern Lebanon and also from the southern suburbs as well, with nowhere to stay. They are staying in hotels. So, this is definitely a crisis that this country cannot afford to deal with in terms of supporting mass displaced population right now. And then you have the continuing air strikes. The Israeli military saying that they are carrying out extensive strikes that are mostly focused on Southern Lebanon and the eastern Bakar region. They say that they have hit 100 Hezbollah targets, but that was earlier in the day. We've had reports of more strikes since the Israeli military says it has continued or begun striking in -- in Southern Lebanon. So, we expect to get more updates during the day. Lebanese authorities are confirming these areas have seen heavy air strikes today, at least 23 people killed, according to the health ministry, a number that is continuing to rise again by the hour, from what we are seeing dozens more injured. And it's unclear Becky, how many of those who were killed and injured are Hezbollah fighters? How many of them are civilians? But as we have seen in the past few days, there are many women and children, according to Lebanese authorities, among the casualties. And then you talk about the injured. You've got health care, the medical system in this country that was already on its knees before this because of the COVID crisis, the financial and economic crisis. The Beirut Port blast, as you know very well, they have been struggling to deal with the influx of thousands of injured in the past week, and everyone you speak to here, Becky is bracing for what might come next, so much fear and apprehension.",

Now, you know, the world has been focused on, how do you bring about peace? Could there be negotiations, et cetera? And essentially, I think what Zelenskyy is saying is it's not going to happen that Putin is not interested in negotiations and does not, at least at this point, want peace. So, what he's saying is you essentially have to force him. And forcing is short term and long term. And that's where it gets complicated for Zelenskyy. He needs the weapons he would argue. He needs far more weapons than he has. He needs the approval of the United States and some of the other countries, UK and France, although they are farther down the road on this. You need the approval to use long range missiles to hit military targets in Russia. And then longer term, you need to have kind of a psychological diplomatic part of this, which is to show Putin that there is some type of security guarantee for Ukraine that goes way beyond now. Ukraine would like that to mean NATO being members of NATO, but it also could be bilateral security guarantees or commitments by different countries. He already has some of those. And they would make sure that Putin knows that attacking again, let's say the war ends, attacking again will not be possible. It's really, I think it's a very critical point for Zelenskyy, because we can talk about this, but militarily, he has problems within his own country right now, of the Russians moving ahead in Donbass.",

And that's mildly put for Zelenskyy and for Ukraine, because, after all, Donald Trump, you can hear here, is saying enough already. We've given enough, and we're not going to give any more. So, this in addition to the military, diplomatic, economic, et cetera, challenges Zelenskyy has worldwide. He has the election in the United States coming up very soon, like 40 some days.

And the way forward, really, to try and bring this war to a close and to a close that is acceptable for the Ukrainians. One of the things, of course, that we have to see in the backdrop of all of this as President Zelenskyy is there in the United States and at the United Nations, is that right now, it's a really difficult situation for the Ukrainians on many areas of the battlefield. If you look, for instance, in the east of the country, the Russians have been made -- making faster gains than before. They're not very fast gains, but they certainly are faster than before in the east of the country. And in some areas, there, the situation is quite critical for the Ukrainians, where they remain outmanned by far, and still remain outgunned as well, even though they are getting more from their allies than they had been before. The Ukrainians, of course, at the same time launching that incursion into Russian territory, hoping to relieve some of the pressure on those other front lines. And President Zelenskyy has said that all of that is also part of what he calls his victory plan. So essentially, what he's trying to tell the Biden Administration is, look, stick with us for now. Stick with us in the long term, and we will try to bring this war to an acceptable close in the not-too distant future. And I think one of the things that we've really seen over the past couple of days is Volodymyr Zelenskyy trying to put in place, if you will, the building blocks to set all of this up. First on the international stage we saw yesterday in the United Nations Security Council. On the one hand, you already said that. he said, that. He said that Russia can only be forced into peace, as he put it. But he also made very clear that from Ukraine's perspective, and certainly from many nations in the international community as well, that it is the Russians who are in gross violation of the UN Charter, the basis of which is, of course, the territorial integrity of nation. And that's the message that he's going to take the General Assembly and then also to the Biden Administration to say, look hold up international law. Hold up international norms. Stay with Ukraine. Ukraine has a path forward. It's a high stake and very difficult task for the Ukrainian President, and certainly it's going to be something that the Ukrainian nation will have their eyes on as he meets with President Biden. But of course, then also tries to meet with the presidential candidates as well Becky.",

Frankly, is the fact that they interviewed several U.S. Secret Service agents who were involved in the planning, the security planning around Donald Trump's July 13th rally, and not a single one of them could identify who was actually in charge of the rally that day from a security perspective, and who was the ultimate decision maker, telling lawmakers that it was a more collaborative process. But as we know, that collaborative process resulted in several things falling through the cracks, balls being dropped, including no plan to secure that building that ultimately the shooter was able to climb up on the roof of and have a clear line of sight at Donald Trump. And look, this report is the latest in a series of concerning revelations about the security failures around Donald Trump's July 13th rally. Obviously, those have been exacerbated in the wake of the second attempted assassination of the former president, and also this persistent and lingering threat that U.S. intelligence officials say is posed by Iran, who is increasingly planning to ramp up their attacks and their plans to target Donald Trump and people around him.

The findings include the results of an FAA survey of 2100 Boeing workers on the 737 line, and about half said that schedule pressure is still significant, essentially putting speed over quality, which is huge, since this was a quality control failure that led to that door plug incident, one more big finding. Workers said they felt inadequately trained by Boeing to do their jobs, and some said that Boeing was not providing them with the proper tools. The FAA audit found that one worker was using a tool he made himself to check the gaps between certain parts of the airplane. The report says this, this tool is mechanic-made unauthorized, uncalibrated, unmarked, and when asked how other door mechanics take this measurement, that mechanic said they all do the same thing. Now these findings were released by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. And in just a few hours, it will grill the FAA Administrator, Mike Whitaker, saying that the agency has not stayed on top of Boeing.

      "sentences": "Right. So, we know it is still a tropical storm, but it's at the highest possible threshold for that,meaning the sustained winds are at 70 miles per hour, but at 75 it becomes a hurricane. So, we anticipate the storm will become hurricane strength at some point today. There are not one but two different hurricane hunter planes investigating this particular storm to give us back some more data that we will then use to help improve the forecast as it continues to go through the Gulf of Mexico. The Gulf of Mexico is incredibly warm right now. That is fuel for storms like this. That's why we anticipate that it will become not only a hurricane today, but a major hurricane by the time we get to Thursday. The storm is still expected to make landfall late Thursday, local time, in the Big Bend region of Florida, before continuing to move inland. But it's going to be very fast moving as it does so, that means it's going to make it pretty far inland before it really starts to weaken. Areas of South and Central Georgia still could end up seeing hurricane force wind gusts as the system continues to slide through. Storm surge is going to be a big factor, especially pretty much up and down the entire West Coast of the Florida peninsula. The worst of it is going to be in this Big Bend region here, where we could anticipate 10 to 15 feet of storm surge. The winds are also expected to be very high, especially because this will be a Category 3, potentially hurricane at the time of landfall. That means those 100-plus mile per hour winds are going to stretch, not only right there along the ocean itself, but even inland places like Tallahassee, Valdosta, Georgia, could end up having some pretty significant wind gusts. And a lot of this area too is covered with trees. So even some of those wind gusts, say around 60 to 80 miles per hour, that is plenty to bring down some trees and power lines. So, power outages are likely going to be a big problem too. When we talk about rainfall, you can see it's widespread across several of these areas. You're talking four to six inches. But it is not out of the question, especially across Georgia and some areas of Western North Carolina and Eastern Tennessee, where they could pick up 8, 10, if not even as much as 12 inches of rain before it's all said and done. This is why, over the next several days, we have that risk for excessive rainfall and the potential for flooding. And once you get into the higher elevations of the Southern Appalachian Mountains, you could be looking at landslides and mudslides as well. The focus for today or on Wednesday is really going to be these areas here, across portions of Northern Georgia, stretching into western North Carolina, where we have that moderate risk. And then by Thursday, you can see it really starts to spread out. A lot more areas are going to be impacted as a lot of that moisture from Helene really begins to spread inland. We also have a high risk that's a level four out of four, the highest possible category you can get for this flood risk that's going to be an impact across portions of Northeastern Georgia as well as Western North Carolina.",

You and I know, Kylie, there is not only a lot of much criticism of Yahya Sinwar, who is now the head and would be the head in any negotiations for Hamas. But also, criticism of Benjamin Netanyahu, of course, not least by the hostage families themselves, many of whom we say is sacrificing a ceasefire and hostage deal for a coalition that, frankly, will keep him in office. Look realistically, where do these negotiations stand at this point? And what of Washington's involvement? Does it have any plan B at this point? KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, listen, we have been saying that the negotiations have been paused for quite some time. I think it's more realistic to say at this moment, they have hit a dead end. When we see what is happening between Israel and Hezbollah along that Lebanon border, it has made it much more complicated. If not impossible, Becky, U.S. officials say, to drive forth what it is those efforts to bring about an end to the war in Gaza, those ceasefire and hostage negotiations that the U.S. officials have been working feverishly on for months, notably, when I visited the region with the Secretary of State last month, he went to Egypt. He didn't even travel to Israel. Was the first time since October 7th, that he had traveled to the region and not gone to Israel.",
