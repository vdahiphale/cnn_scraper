Israel is promising that a new phase in its war on Hamas is coming just not clear when exactly that will be.Troops have been amassing for days now near the border with Gaza getting ready for unexpected ground operation. Israel pounded the territory again today with airstrikes. Officials say Hamas commander who played a key part in last Saturday's attack was killed. Meantime, while Israel prepares to go into Gaza, hundreds of 1000s of civilians tried to heed the IDF warning to get out. UN officials warned such a large scale evacuation during a siege could lead to a humanitarian disaster.",

You mentioned mortar attacks coming from Hezbollah oppositions in southern Lebanon, over here across the border to Northern Israel with just a short distance from the Lebanese border, now. There was artillery fired by the Israeli forces that are concentrated here now, in preparation for a possible second front opening up.There was also a missile fired or two missiles in fact, according to local Israeli force commanders fired from Syria into northern Israel. And there was an Israeli response to that as well. But -- but none of those exchanges, according to Israeli officials, have reached the point of escalation yet, because what everybody is bracing for is a potential barrage of missiles from the Iranian backed militia Hezbollah militia in Lebanon. Of the sort of kind of situation that we saw you and I and we were back here in 2006, when there was a huge unleashing of Hezbollah rockets into Israeli territory here in the north of the country. The situation is even more precarious now because it's believed that Hezbollah has much more -- much more powerful arsenal than it did. I mean, Israel has new technology as well. It's got the Iron Dome, antimissile system that's enforced up here in northern Israel. It didn't have that in 2006. But nevertheless, it has said Israel, that if the Hezbollah militia does take that step, it will possibly lead to the destruction of Lebanon. So they're sort of being very overt about what -- what their response will be. Add to that, the U.S. carrier group that's off the coast of Israel in the eastern Mediterranean, there's another carrier group heading that way as well. The United States really doubling down on its deterrent, but also doubling down on its firepower, if it is called upon to help Israel to back Israel in a broader sort of regional campaign. We're not there yet. But it's definitely a threat and Israeli forces here in in some considerable numbers in northern Israel, bracing for that threat, Anderson.",

Obviously, I'm not going to ask you what that actually means in terms of what the next phase is going to be. But has Israel called up the number of people it planned to call up or that it needs to call up? Are there plans to call up more people? LT. COLONEL JONATHAN CONRICUS, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES SPOKESPERSON: Yes, hi, thank you. Thank you for having me, again. It is -- the situation around the Gaza Strip is that -- around the Gaza Strip is that it is quite densely packed with hundreds of 1000s of Israeli reserve units that are preparing for various missions. I am not aware of any other plans to call up more reservists. There are additional Israelis that are of course ready and trained to join the combat service. But at this stage, I am not aware of any need for additional personnel. Now actually, the challenge or the focal mission is to have all of those more than 360,000 reservists both in the South and in the north, get their mission ready, equipped, prepared, task forced and ready for whatever the assignments they will have in the future. The IDF dropped leaflets in northern Gaza, telling people to leave the North to go to the zones, zones in the south closer to the Rafah border, to get out of harm's way to the extent that that is possible. I'm wondering if you have monitored movements. And do you have any sense of how many people have actually heeded those warnings?

But that's not an Israeli number. That's what I read in -- in one of the reports. The important thing here to focus on is that we will commence significant Military operations only once we see that the area has -- that civilians have left the area. But it's really important that people in Gaza know, we've been very, very generous. So to say with the time we have given ample warning, more than 25 hours -- 24 hours have passed. And really, I cannot stress more than enough to say now is the time for Gazans to leave. Take your belongings, go south, preserve your life and do not fall into the trap that Hamas is setting up for you. I want to ask and I want to warn people that there's some graphic video that they may see. CNN has been able to geo locate a number of sites. Sorry, I just want to -- I want to make sure I'm getting this correctly here. Yes, five separate videos of large explosions along an evacuation route for civilians to get out of Gaza. The explosions occurred on (inaudible) Street. Do you have any information about these explosions, was it an Israeli airstrike? I've seen videos and we are investigating the matter not only from a perspective of did Israel attack which I can say categorically that we definitely did not intentionally strike anything there. There was no target on that road. There -- a mistake may have happened. We're looking into it. [21:10:00] But I think it is at this hour of the war, when the whole world has seen very clearly what Hamas is and their level, their morality or the lack thereof, I think that every piece of information coming out of the Gaza Strip, especially if it serves Hamas propaganda purposes, should be treated with extreme caution. And we've started to analyze footage coming out of Gaza. I have doubts that these are aerial drone strikes. And I think that people who have experience and knowledge in forensics and visual analysis would be good to look at those pictures and to understand if these were really aerial attacks or perhaps IEDs that were planted.

Our intentions are, of course, to not strike civilians and to minimize the effect on others. I think that we were trying to facilitate this crossing, which unfortunately, didn't succeed. And those talks are ongoing. I think the triangle of Israel, U.S. and Egypt and perhaps a few other countries, the U.N., perhaps are involved. Hopefully that will bring the possibility to take internationals out of Gaza and to safety. The problem with everything related to the Gaza Strip is that Hamas uses every humanitarian gesture and activity for their military purposes. And I do want to remind everybody, that we are in a hostage situation. Hamas is holding more than 120 confirmed Israeli hostages. And we know that anything humanitarian will also, can also be used by Hamas for sinister purposes.

Ford carrier strike group that arrived earlier this week.Again, the administration has made clear these aren't supposed to take part in the fighting in any way. And Israel has made it clear, it doesn't want the US involved in this fight. But the Biden Administration, Israel, and in fact, many other countries are watching this play out and trying to make sure it doesn't spill over into any other countries and escalate into a regional conflict. And that's the point of these carrier strike groups being in the eastern Med. As a message of deterrence to Iran to Iran's proxies -- proxies, like Hezbollah in Lebanon, as well as Iranian backed groups in Syria. That's who this message is pointed at as a warning to stay out of this conflict. And you don't see two carriers in the same area very often.

The fact that you have over 100 hostages mixed in there probably in several different locations, you'd want to get in there fast. Then -- then you have the -- the -- the more -- the more blunt force of large, put together mobile forces with a lot of infantry tech, now I've got to go in, as we've learned in a number of places in Iraq and elsewhere, you got to go into a city fight. Hamas is going to be waiting for them. And in the absolute cynical way, they are using the civilians that they purport to protect as their cover and shield. So they will first of all, try to bloody the Israeli forces. A number of them are reservists and draftees, so not a lot of recent experience in heavy, heavy urban fighting.

And it becomes a real, real, even bigger drum humanitarian nightmare -- nightmare. They're hoping for the press to go, to put pressure on Israel. But I think that were -- Israel after what happened last week, exactly a week ago is hardened. They -- they are -- they're done with Hamas. And that's -- that's part of I think that will lead to a pretty, pretty ferocious fight going in there. They would lose a lot of people in any way, because some loss isn't leaving. And as we've heard, they're not going to let as best they can the Palestinian population out.

They don't have the vehicles, they don't have the equipment, they don't have the trained staff. And then you can imagine the logistics dimension of this as well. Longer roads, damaged roads.
