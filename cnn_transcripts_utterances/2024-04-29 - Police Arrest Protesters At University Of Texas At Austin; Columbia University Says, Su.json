The crisis in Gaza sparking a crisis right here at home that we're covering from every angle live and in depth this hour. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer and this is a Situation Room special report. All right, first, let's go to the University of Texas at Austin. That's where CNN's Ed Lavandera is on the scene for us.

We don't have an exact number so far on the number of arrests that have taken place on this campus, but right now, as the protest group that had set up camp in the South Mall of the university here in Austin, state troopers and local police cleared that crowd out.Now in that bus that you see there in the distance that says, out of service, that's actually one of the buses that was used to bring in state troopers. And now many of these protesters have essentially been chanting at the officers to get off campus and for the better part of about a quarter of a mile through campus here. They are basically trying to get this bus off of campus. Now, the troopers had already cleaned out the campsite. It appears that they were already shutting down operations, but these protesters, in very tense situations here this afternoon, chanting at these officers to get off of the campus. At one point, we heard a number of what have sounded like tear gas canisters that were deployed to disperse the crowd, but that has continued. We've seen a number of students or protesters pepper sprayed here. But this scene continues to move as this bus is essentially going in reverse. It would not the way that it would normally have just driven out of campus. But because of the crowd of people that is surrounding the bus, they are pushing it and forcing it to go in reversible to back its way out of this area of campus where the roads are very tight, very difficult situation. So, the tent situation here continues as we wait to see if this bus full of state troopers is going to be able to safely get off the campus here at this moment. Wolf?",

They did request we go to -- NYPD goes to the various entry points because they were finding that a large number of people who were on the grounds did not attend the school. You're seeing that there are individuals who are not students that are playing a major role in the organizing and some of the disruptive behavior, like we saw at NYU, where bottles and chairs were thrown at the police while they were there. And so our goal is to continue to have the meetings, the conversation and bring people together of various religious and ethnic groups to see how we can play a major role in turning down the temperature so that we can all live in a uniform manner.

And it has become rather tense. At some point, some sort of -- we've seen a number of officers pepper spraying some of the protesters that have been following and essentially forcing one bus full of state troopers to back its way out of out of the area. We had heard a couple of loud explosions where it's not clear if it was just a sound disbursement or if there was any kind of pepper spray or any kind of irritant that was involved in that, I just don't know at this point. But we did see a number of people who were trying to get their eyes treated for something that was sprayed on them. So, some sort of dispersant might have been deployed at some point, but we don't know as this continues to unfold. But here you can see this line of officers that have been trying to keep officers away from this bus. And this is the bus that has brought in many of the other officers that were here that were being used in the crowd control and arresting many of the protesters that had set up the camp in the pro-Palestinian protest that started several hours ago. But we're now well into the disruption here on campus, so four or five hours now that this has continued, and really not exactly clear. Part of the group that was following the officers broke into two parts. One group following the officers and chanting at them to leave the campus, another one went back to the original area where the encampment had been set up. We've lost sight of that, so we don't know exactly what's unfolding in that situation.

Other protesters on campus have thrown rocks, water, and fake blood at Jewish students.

At Columbia, those protesting with the encampment have been in negotiations with the university despite repeatedly violating university's policies and codes of conduct and despite being offered several proposals from the university to try and meet in the middle, these protesters have flat out rejected them. And I think what's so important to note is that one of the proposals that the university offered was to invest in health and education in Gaza, and that included providing support for displaced academics there. And so it makes me wonder if the goal of this movement were really to improve life for Palestinians and Gazans, why on earth are they rejecting that? I wouldn't have rejected that. I think the majority of my Jewish peers wouldn't have rejected that. And it's been made incredibly clear that, you know, this movement functions around shutting things down rather than building things up. They are unwilling to collaborate, and even when they do collaborate, because they've put themselves in a situation in which the university has cowered to this mob, they are rejecting proposals that would help the very people they claim to be advocating for. The hypocrisy I find to be incredibly astounding, but it is really no wonder that this mob of pro-Hamas protesters has rejected these opportunities that are actually trying to help the people of Gaza because that is not their focus.",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, with hundreds, if not thousands of college students, campuses across the country staging these protests that are going on now we thought that some historical context could be helpful here.Now, throughout the 1960s, you had students from Cal Berkeley to Columbia, to Kent State University in Ohio protesting against the Vietnam war. They marched on campus, they occupied buildings. One day in 1969, students at Harvard University pinned to list of demands on the door of the Harvard president's house. And at one point, they led as faculty members, they occupied buildings, including university hall, and led faculty members out the door there. But a big difference between those protests and the -- in the '60s and early '70s and the protests going on now was simply the level of violence, the scale of the violence. The current pro-Palestinian protests have been for the most part, very peaceful, but in the Vietnam era, as you've seen some of these videos, while the protests started peacefully, many of them turned violent. Students barricaded themselves in buildings. They fought with police. In 1968, students at Columbia University and its affiliate Barnard College, they took over several campus buildings and even briefly took the dean hostage before police cracked down on them, sometimes violently. The most infamous this episode though, occurred at Kent State University in Ohio in May of 1970. That's when Ohio National Guard troops opened fire on student protesters. They killed four of them and they injured several others. But maybe, Wolf, a better comparison to what's going on now in the tactics of the current protests -- well, that comparison might have taken place in the 1980s. Students across the country protested on campuses against apartheid in South Africa. They called on schools to divest themselves from companies and groups that supported the apartheid regime in South Africa. That was much like students are doing now, calling on colleges to divest themselves from Israeli companies. And then as now, Wolf, Columbia University at the very center of that movement, Wolf.",

And also some colleges altered or ended military recruiting on campus as a result.Now as for those anti-apartheid protests in the 1980s, they lead Columbia University and many other colleges to divest themselves from doing business with South Africa, and the U.S. government later followed suit, Wolf. So, these protests, you know, you look at what's going on now, a lot of people wondering, can they have a difference in the war and what's going on? We'll see.",
