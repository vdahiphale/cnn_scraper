      "sentences": "Hello, everyone, I'm Kasie Hunt to our viewers watching in the United States and around the world. It is Tuesday, October10, 11 am here in Washington and 6 pm in Israel. And we begin our coverage there Palestinian militants are launching waves of rockets from Gaza today. Projectiles have been seen streaking through the sky. Hamas announced earlier they were warning residents of Ashkelon to leave the city by 5 pm local time. That deadline passed about an hour ago. This is day four of a war triggered by the Hamas invasion and the death toll from that attack keeps climbing as officials recover more victims. We want to warn you some of what you're about to see is disturbing. The Israeli military says more than 900 people were killed when the Palestinian militants stormed into Southern Israel. This has been Israel's response, Gaza is under siege. Israel's military says a blistering air campaign hit more than 200 targets overnight. Israeli forces appear to be staging for what could be a ground operation. And the IDF says it has \"more or less\" secured the border fence with Gaza. But sending troops in is going to be very difficult. Palestinian civilians of course will be caught up in the fighting. Palestinian health officials say more than 700 people have already been killed, and Hamas has hostages. Israel's U.N. Ambassador says the group may be holding up to 150. The militants are threatening to kill them and televise it if airstrikes continue without warning. For the latest CNN's Becky Anderson is live now for us in Tel Aviv. Becky, in the hours since we last spoke. What have you seen unfolding there?",

But what was very clear from the families of those that we weren't listening to today. And this range from a young 23 year old boy who was at the music festival and hasn't been seen since that music festival, of course was raided by attacked by Hamas on Saturday morning at range from this 23 year old -- to a 66 year old grandmother who has disappeared from a Kibbutz on the southern border with Gaza. And her son and her daughter were speaking to us today. And what was made very, very clear from those who were in attendance today is that they want to hear more from the Israeli government. And they want to hear from the U.S. government and their message was very pointedly directed at U.S. President Joe Biden and the U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken. Itay is a 19 year old he's a reservist who was deployed to tackle this attack when he went missing on Saturday morning and his father Rubi spoke earlier have listened to what he said.

Certainly those first hours and what is emerging out of those first sorts of 10, 15 hours is almost I mean, it's unimaginable and it's almost, you can't really get your head around what happened at that music event 260 youngsters slaughtered. What happened at this Kibbutz is along the border. People hiding in their shelters, they're very used to incoming fire there incoming rockets. But they sheltered and 10 hours later, they had basically been traumatized, and terrorized by these militants banging on the windows, murdering people on these Kibbutzes, and then banging on these windows. And eventually getting through to people and taking them back as hostages out to Gaza. So a very frustrated set of families, as I say, U.S. citizens appealing directly to the U.S. administration at this point, but it just sort of, you know, it's part of this wider story here, which is just, I've sort of a vacuum of information, which you can, to a certain extent, understand.

So there's an international community will want to get involved in this to some extent, at the very least in terms of liaising with the Israeli government over exactly that question. Now, the straight answer to that is there is a negotiated settlement or a military settlement to this. Now, Hamas want to have negotiations over the future of the hostages, it has been to their advantage in the past. Last time they grabbed an Israeli soldier, he was eventually exchanged for over 1000 Palestinian prisoners. Now, if they've got 100 plus hostages in Gaza, that ratio looks rather extraordinary. But at the same time, of course, there is this military operation that is ongoing. In terms of airstrikes, it's an all probability going to lead to ground operations that will inevitably jeopardize the safety of the hostages, even if they were not being threatened with execution by Hamas. Hamas would probably take some pressure from potentially Qatar and Egypt that do have lines of communication into the Hamas leadership trying to persuade them that they have gone already very, very far down the route of ISIS type atrocities that international sympathy for the wider Palestinian cause is being undermined. And that they need to be able to recover their position, perhaps morally, if that's at all possible by being less hardline over the hostage issue. And then of course, there is the possibility of a hostage rescue operation. But that, frankly, is impossible in the prevailing military circumstances.",

They're not confident that we're going to have a speaker this week. Right now Steve Scalise still has likely a lead in potentially the majority of the majority, he likely has over a majority of the conference. You see right now, though, that some of the allies of Jim Jordan are asking to even raise that threshold to 217, or almost an outright majority before they'll ever bring that nomination to the floor, the entire House. This would delay a lot of any discussion around passing support for Israel or potentially Ukraine. It's one of the reasons why you actually have a lot of members right now talking about clarifying the role of interim speaker. Does Patrick McHenry as interim speaker actually have authority to move some of this forward? Some would argue that since this was developed in the aftermath of 911, for issues of national security, this would fall under that need some clarification though, right now.",
