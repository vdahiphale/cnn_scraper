Now, Aspartame is one of the most common artificial sweeteners used in drinks and food. It's been FDA-approved for decades. Later this month, the WHO agency is set to release its finding on the carcinogenic effects of the sweetener and how much of it is acceptable to have daily. CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta joins us now with more. And, Sanjay, let's start with how prevalent Aspartame might actually be in our food. What type of products is this usually found in? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, it's probably safe to say that everybody who is watching right now has, at some point or another, had Aspartame. I mean, as you -- as you point out, for over 40 years it's been approved. It's been used in all sorts of different products from beverages, which is the primary sort of product -- diet beverages -- but also things like breakfast cereals, and chewing gum, and cough drops. It's been out there for a long time. It's about 200 times sweeter than typical table sugar, so you can use small amounts. It makes it very easy for these manufacturers to use that to sweeten their products. And again, they've been doing it for a long time. One thing that's going to come out I think in these WHO discussions is this old adage, which is the dose makes the poison, right? Anything in a certain dose could potentially be poisonous or harmful. So how much Aspartame is potentially harmful? That's the real question. The FDA -- as you might imagine, they've analyzed this for years. And where they -- where they came down it and says 50 milligrams per kilogram is what they think is potentially problematic. What does that mean? About 22 cans of diet soda, 116 cups of coffee with two sweetener packets. I'm showing you these numbers because I just want to give you an idea that, again, anything can be problematic in certain doses, but take a look at just how high you'd have to get to be problematic, at least according to the FDA.",

      "sentences": "Yes. So, we'll see, Audie. July 14 is when the WHO is going to issue their formal statement on it and at that point, it will be a recommendation. I mean, there's no mandates or anything that comes from this.But it's interesting the way the WHO has approached this in the past and these types of things in the past is they've listed them in certain categories. So something that is definitively carcinogenic, you know? Certain types of radiation, for example, definitively carcinogenic. Probably carcinogenic is the next thing. Possibly carcinogenic. And to give you some context, cell phone usage was listed by the WHO as being possibly carcinogenic at certain levels and then not classifiable. So, we'll see what they say. Again, that comes out July 14. But it could fall into the category again of possibly carcinogenic, like cell phones, but hopefully, with some added context of, again, what is the dose? The dose makes the poison. How much are we talking about here?",

But for those of us who want to enjoy an occasional soda, are the potential harmful effects of Aspartame more dangerous than, say, the high amount of sugar in regular soda? I guess what I'm asking here is are you actually better off reaching for the diet soda instead of the full- sugar soda? Can sugar substitutes actually help with something like weight loss?",
