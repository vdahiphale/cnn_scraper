Good to have you with us.For the third time in two days, Russia says a military base inside its own country has come under a drone attack. The, Kremlin says Ukraine is responsible. If true, it could mark a dangerous new escalation in the 9.5 month war. The apparent attack this morning happened at an airfield in the Kursk (ph) region, about 90 kilometers from the Ukrainian border. There was a fire at the airfield, it caused the cancellation of classes in nearby schools. Russia says three of its soldiers were killed in an explosion Monday at a base in Ingles (ph), hundreds of kilometers inside Russian territory. That was one of two apparent attacks Monday. Afterwards, Russia launched 70 missiles at Ukraine, with Ukraine claiming it shot down 60. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited troops in the Donbas region and Eastern Ukraine in the country's Armed Forces Day, calling them, quote, \"an outpost of our independence.\" In the midst of the latest fighting, news of a prisoner swap. CNN's Will Ripley has the details and more on those apparent drone strikes inside of Russia. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

This is the result of a negotiation between the Ukrainians and Russians that have been going on for likely quite some time. We expect to learn more details as we head to speak with some of the people who were involved in this. These prisoner swaps have been one of the few bright spots for the families that have endured so much suffering in this unprovoked cruel war that is going on some nine months now. These family members who have been waiting desperately for word about their missing loved ones will be able to actually see them in the coming hours and days. They will be able to share their stories about what happened when they were captured and what their life was like as prisoners of war. Meanwhile, there is new concern that the situation may actually be escalating, with Ukraine launching apparent drone strikes far into Russian territory, even though the  Ukrainians are not claiming responsibility. Russia is blaming Ukraine for these mass explosions caused by Soviet technology jet drones, that have flown, in one, case just 500 miles outside of Moscow, the strategic military base. That is the situation we continue to monitor in northeastern Ukraine -- Will Ripley, CNN, Sumy, Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It's a relief from scenes like this, Bakhmut's Ukrainian field hospital. He's been defending this Ukrainian town from Russia's most intense assault along an 800-mile front. Artillery duels and trench warfare have almost destroyed Bakhmut as Russia throws its army at a bid for victory after months of defeats to the north and south.

But the wait times to do so are somewhere around a 1.5 minute. So people are literally just walking in and walking out right now after they cast their ballot. That is a good thing for the voters. And it is likely due to the fact that, look, more than 1.85 million people voted during the early voting period. There were extremely long lines then, Lynda, because they had to compress it into this five-day schedule because there was a law that was passed last year that shortened the runoff period from nine weeks to four weeks and reduced the number of early voting days.
