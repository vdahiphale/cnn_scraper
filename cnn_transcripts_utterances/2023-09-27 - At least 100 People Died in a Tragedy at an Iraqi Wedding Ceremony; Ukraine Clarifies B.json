At least 100 people have died in a fire in Iraq. Forced to flee, the Armenian government says almost 30,000 people have arrived in the country after being driven out of Nagorno-Karabakh. And a judge in New York finds Donald Trump and his adult sons liable for fraud. We begin with developing news out of Iraq, where a wedding celebration has turned into a tragedy. At least 100 people were killed and 150 others injured after a fire broke out at a wedding hall in the north of the country. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz is following developments here in London. Salma, what are you learning?",

This is a wedding that took place in Northern Iraq in this area called Hamdaniya District, the central town Karakosh, a huge wedding hall where hundreds of people were gathered to celebrate this couple.And within moments, it turned into a nightmare. I've been listening to eyewitness accounts, people describing fireworks going off at a time when the couple were slow dancing in the middle of the hall with, again, hundreds of people gathered around them. Within moments, those fireworks caught fire on the paneling of the building. And that's the key part here is that according to Iraqi State News Agency, that paneling echo band was highly flammable and illegal. It violated the codes of the country, yet somehow it was on that building. And within moments, again, not only did the building catch fire, but parts of the hall actually collapsed, causing those wedding attendees to be trapped in the building, that's why we're hearing from the Iraqi Health Minister, that many of the deaths are due to people being asphyxiated, suffocating, trapped inside this wedding hall. Again, you've mentioned the death toll so far, 100 people dead, 150 people injured, but officials are warning, those are simply estimates. Those numbers could absolutely go up. You can see the devastation. I mean, look at these pictures. It absolutely looks firebombed. And again, to imagine that happened within moments because of this highly-flammable material. Search and rescue efforts are underway. Hospitals across the area in Kurdistan and Nineveh, where this took place, are trying to gather and help the wounded, many of them, of course, suffering from very serious burns and injuries. But this is still unfolding. We still don't understand the full extent of it.",

Armenia and the Red Cross have sent ambulances and medical supplies to help the survivors, but the deadly blast is another strain on already scarce resources.CNN's Scott McLean reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A week after war, ethnic Armenians fleeing the Nagorno-Karabakh region continued to arrive in Armenia. Some shell-shocked, tired, others limping or literally out of gas, but alive. UNKNOWN (through translator): It was horrible. Children were hungry and they were crying. We ran away just to survive. That's all. MCLEAN (voice-over): The journey out of the now war-ravaged territory is extremely slow. Long lineups of cars wind down the switchbacks of the mountainous Lachin corridor. One family told CNN that leaving seems impossible, instead choosing to turn back and try again another day. This comes a week after Azerbaijani troops launched a lightning offensive to regain control over the long-disputed territory. It lasted just 24 hours before the outgunned separatist armed forces agreed to a Russian-brokered ceasefire and to disarm. Nagorno-Karabakh for decades has been an internationally recognized part of Azerbaijan. But populated by 120,000 ethnic Armenians, it has long functioned as a de-facto enclave of Armenia, a fragile gray area that held until war in 2020 and again last week. Thousands have now chosen to flee rather than live under Azerbaijani rule. GAYANE, REFUGEE FROM NAGORNO-KARABAKH (through translator): Can one live with them? No, one cannot. I've just survived. I've been on the road for a day. My children are hungry. MCLEAN (voice-over): An explosion at a gas depot on Monday where people were fueling up before the journey to Armenia wounded hundreds, according to Armenia state news. Straining already packed local hospitals and even field hospitals like this one run by Russia. Even before the blast, getting the injured evacuated was difficult. Now, the International Committee of the Red Cross says there are hundreds of burn victims in urgent need of specialized medical care.",

So the population that we're seeing is, you know, one that has been subjected to hunger. There's been a lot of threatening rhetoric towards the Armenians from the Azerbaijani leadership. And it is only now, after, in the wake of this violence of last week, that we are actually seeing a meaningful discussion of what reintegration actually means.I think it's quite unlikely that any Armenians will remain in Karabakh to be integrated.

It left part of the territory still under Armenian control and with Russian peacekeepers on the ground.What country wants to have another country's soldiers, peacekeepers on their territory? There's been an intention, I think, to complete this victory and the wider global context of Russia's invasion of Ukraine has very much sort of strengthened the territorial integrity norm, and Azerbaijan wants to reassert its sovereignty. There's also a very strong argument, you know, what state would tolerate the existence of armed secessionist forces on its territory. Azerbaijan has become much more important to both Russia in terms of post-Ukraine war connectivity and also to the European Union in terms of its role as an energy supplier and a critical geopolitical geostrategic link in Eurasia.

Azerbaijan's also developed a very close relationship with Israel, and it is also an important trading partner for many E.U. member states, particularly in the southeastern part of Europe, where there are a lot of energy security relationships. And so we've seen, you know, there is a kind of a coalition of interests behind Azerbaijan. Meanwhile, Russia's capacity to exert control enforced security in the Caucasus has dramatically declined. And what we've seen is that Russia's moved from being a patron of the region to a partner for Azerbaijan and Turkey in their approach to reconnecting the region.

There have been a lot of ceasefire incidents, incursions, border clashes and so on in the area of the international border between Armenia and Azerbaijan. And so it's crucial that interstate talks continue. There was a meeting of the two countries' envoys yesterday in Brussels and the two leaders are scheduled to meet in Granada on the 5th of October, very important that talks towards normalization continue.

But it was striking that the Ministry of Defense didn't say anything, they didn't deny his death, and neither did the criminal spokesman Dmitry Peskov when given an opportunity to do so earlier in the day. He simply said, we have no information even from the Ministry of Defense. So that is striking. But look, this is, regardless of what the truth is, a very instructive episode in this war, because this is, as well as being a physical war, a very clear war of narratives. Both sides are filtering information, manipulating even information and I think we have to be really, really careful how we look at this. But it's also clear that if Ukraine killed anywhere near the 34 officers that they say they killed in the strike on the Black Sea Fleet headquarters, that is operationally significant. And I think it's clear also that this is part of this episode that we're in this war, which we need to stay focused on, that Ukraine is increasingly targeting Crimea, as you said, as a logistics hub and trying to prevent Russia from getting free rein over that part of the Black Sea as it continues to try to get its grain out.
