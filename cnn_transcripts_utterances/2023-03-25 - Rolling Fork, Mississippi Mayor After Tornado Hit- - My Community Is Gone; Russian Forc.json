Saying, mom, you're in the danger zone for this tornado.Her and her employees immediately rushed over to an industrial cooler. And as her husband was closing the door, they saw that the roof was gone. She said it was a matter of life or death by the seconds. And that, that cooler. That contraption, that shelter, that save their lives. And that is the only reason she was standing to talk to me today. This is so incredibly hard for the community and for the people who do see this and want to help, it is important to note that emergency management here for the state are saying that they don't want people to self-deploy and to volunteer. That could slow down the process. So, instead if you do want to help, contribute resources, contribute water to the Rolling Fork civic center. That's the way to go. Fred.",

Ivan, Russian forces have suffered heavy losses in this fight. What's your understanding of all that's taken place? IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, I mean, we hear from both sides, so you try to parse it, and try to make sense of it. But the fact of the matter is that for more than seven months, the Russian military and Russian mercenaries have tried to conquer this small southeastern Ukrainian city and the Ukrainians supporting defense and resources and have succeeded in holding onto a city that has now become kind of a symbolic, deadly grudge match between these two warring armies.

Harder to judge, the enormous sacrifice Ukrainians have made in their costly defense of this embattled city. But while Russia's efforts have slowed, they haven't stalled. Ukraine claims the area has been hit with more than 200 strikes in the last day alone. And Russia is sending in backup to compensate for the growing losses of Wagner private mercenaries, with Russian airborne troops now playing a greater role in the fighting around Bakhmut, according to the Ukrainian military. ANDRIY BABYCHEV, SERVICEMAN OF UKRAINE'S 93rd BRIGADE (through translator): I want to say that the situation in the south is not improved, in such a way we can talk about some kind of victory or anything like that.

But it completely missed the streaming boom, the rise of Netflix.And in 2010, the company filed for bankruptcy, that final store in Bend Oregon, I think we're going to have to go check out Bend Oregon, get some tips from them.
