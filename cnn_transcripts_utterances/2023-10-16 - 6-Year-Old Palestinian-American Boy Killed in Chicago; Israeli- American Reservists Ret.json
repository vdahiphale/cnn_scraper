We have not seen, heard any explosion, and now it seems like the sirens are down. So it would seem whatever it was either intercepted at a greater distance or it's done. Oh, that was an interception. So, it just took a while perhaps for the sound to actually reach us. There's low cloud cover, so it's a little hard to see exactly what -- all the rockets, when they come, they come from that direction, obviously, which is the direction of the Gaza Strip. Today, Secretary of State Antony Blinken was back here in Tel Aviv meeting with Israel's defense minister and the newly formed war cabinets. That's one of the big developments that's occurred on the ground here in Israel today as the military gears up for the next phase of the war. Israel Defense Forces' fighter jets struck Hezbollah targets in Lebanon as well. CNN's Nic Robertson is in Sderot, and Jeremy Diamond is in Jerusalem for us. Nic, talk about what you have been seeing. I understand the tempo of strikes near you slowed down today.",

There was the sound of a jets sort of coming through. And, often, that's followed by an explosion. We have had a number of explosions this evening. But through the day, it was so quiet at times that it was almost eerily quiet. You couldn't hear any drones flying. You couldn't hear any helicopters. You couldn't hear any jets. The artillery wasn't firing. There were no missiles going in on Gaza for a period. And it created that impression that this was a little bit of a lull maybe to allow some diplomacy to get that humanitarian aid into Gaza, potentially get more fuel and food and water to come in. But, by this evening, it has just started picking up again. And, as I say, there are jets. And, usually, when the rockets are fired out, as they were towards you just now, you would expect to hear some impacts behind us as well, Anderson.",

He was in Jordan, Egypt, the UAE, Qatar, just all of the regional -- key regional players talking about the humanitarian situation in Gaza and also making an effort to really try and prevent this war between Hamas and Israel from widening into a broader regional conflict. Whether or not that can be achieved remains to be seen, particularly as we have seen some crossfire between Israeli forces and Hezbollah forces in Lebanon across that border. But, today, the secretary of state also making a point to reaffirm the U.S.' support for Israel and his belief that Israel has a right and an obligation to defend itself. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  You know our deep commitment to Israel's right, indeed, its obligation, to defend itself and to defend its people.

That is the first time that we have seen something like that in the last week and change since this all kicked off, not this Saturday, but the previous Saturday. So it does appear that some fuel is at least beginning to flow into Gaza. Whether that results in a broader humanitarian corridor being established, whether that results in more humanitarian aid and also for civilians, including American citizens, to make their way out of Gaza remains to be seen -- Anderson.",

Our teams, despite facing exactly the same situation as the displaced people there -- it's not inch better for them -- yet they are operating. And we have provided three days ago 140,000 people with bread, yesterday 107,000 people with bread, today 160,000 people with bread. And so it's going into the shelters. We can't reach everybody, unfortunately, in the houses, because it's really, really complicated to reach people. So this is how we operate inside. And we need to continue to have unimpeded, safe access to all the people who need our assistance desperately now. But we need to replenish our stocks. We are running out of stocks inside. And we have food, but -- we still have inside, but also piling up at the -- at the borders enough to feed 1.3 million people for two weeks. Now, this food has to move in.

And they have the calories and the nutritional elements required for the day. But we also have brought in mobile storage units for us to be able to assemble our supplies at the border. But these supplies are now ready to move in. And the details of how much shelter equipment there is, I don't have, but I know it's an absolute requirement as well. I mean, people now need medicine. They need food,they need water, they need fuel, they need electricity, and they need shelter. Just to explain to you, as the needs are growing, actually, our ability to reach people is decreasing, because bakeries need fuel, bakeries need water, and if they don't have that, they will not be able to produce bread anymore.
