An Iranian news agency reporting there were three explosions heard near an army base in the Isfahan province. That's about 270 miles south of Tehran. The International Atomic Energy Agency says there are no - there's no damage to Iran's nuclear sites. The Israeli military is not commenting on the attack. It's not immediately clear what was targeted. This appears to be in retaliation for Iran's failed missile and drone attack on Israel last weekend. And prior to last night's strikes, Iran's foreign minister warned Israel against taking any further military action. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HOSSEIN AMIR-ABDOLLAHIAN, IRAN MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS (through translator): In case the Israeli regime embarks on that adventurism again and takes action against the interests of Iran, the next response from us will be immediate and at a maximum level.

What's your reaction to what we saw overnight? It seems as though the Israelis wanted to send a message but not provoke Iran to unleash a response of their own. What's your sense of it MICHAEL OREN, FORMER ISRAELI AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S.: Good to be with you, Jim. Good morning. Israel had to thread multiple needles here. Not just one. Not just reply to Iran and send an unequivocal message to Iran that its military bases are vulnerable in the way that Israel's skies were not vulnerable to Iranian missiles. But also do this in a way that wouldn't alienates Israel's Sunni Arab allies who stood by us last Saturday night. Some actively participating in Israel's defense. Certainly not create oppression in Washington. The great fear in Washington that the United States could be dragged into a regional conflagration. All of this had to be threaded. And I think that Israel succeeded very well if the reports, I say, are true about the Israel - about the attack on the military base in Isfahan. Of course, Israel is not claiming any responsibility for this and Israeli ministers, for the most part, are remaining mum. Still, the message has gotten across.",

He said, take the win, reportedly. And overnight, from what we understand from talking to our sources, is that the U.S., yes, was given a heads up about this strike that occurred overnight, but at the same time the U.S., I guess, sent the message that - that the Americans are not onboard with it.What's your response to all that?

So it - Netanyahu is getting criticism for within his own government about this.No, I think it's an attempt to get on the same page with President Biden, while at the same time sending that message to the Iranians that they cannot shoot massive amounts of rockets at us with impunity and a message. And I think that was underscored by even sort of be - you know, we have a national unity government here and there are opposition members of this government, Benny Gantz, Gadi Eisenkot, who are actually in favor of a much bigger response.

But your sense of it, this relationship between the president and the prime minister, it seems to be improving, and maybe as Michael Oren was saying a few moments ago, Israel did not go overboard with this retaliated strike last night and perhaps that will keep things on an even keel.

Also there are reports from - on the news today that the media inside Iran is actually saying, we don't know who this was, and sort of downplaying it within their own state media.

      "sentences": "Good morning, Jim.Yes, so U.S. officials were anticipating, as we reported earlier this week, that Israel might, in fact, launched some kind of limited strike inside Iran. And the reason for that is because of that massive aerial barrage, of course, that we saw from Iran just last week, they felt like they had to respond in a very substantial and meaningful way and one that actually was a kinetic attack, a physical attack inside Iran itself. Now, the response, though, was always expected to be limited in scope. And that has a lot to do with all the diplomatic heavy lifting that the U.S. was doing over the last week to try to convince Israel not to overreact. The message, of course, had been, take the win because Israel, in conjunction with its allies, they really did prevent Iran's ballistic missile attack, drones, cruise missiles, from causing any significant damage inside Israel itself. And so that was seen as a pretty big victory here. And so over the last week U.S. officials and allies, western officials, were trying to convince Israel to keep its strike very limited. It now appears as though that is what Israel has done. And Iran, of course, is also apparently downplaying this this morning. But Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, he did speak to his Israeli counterpart just yesterday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. It's unclear if they discussed just what Israel's reaction was going to be to that Iranian strike last week. However, they did discuss, according to a readout of the call, Iran's escalation in the region. So, undoubtedly on the minds of Secretary Austin and Yoav Gallant were just how Israel was going to respond to this. And now, of course, we are told that Israel did give the U.S. a heads up, that it was going to respond in some way. Of course they made it clear to the U.S. that these targets would not be civilian, they would not be nuclear, and therefore, again, telegraphing that this response was not going to be overly escalatory and overly dramatic, Jim.",

And so what we expect to hear is, of course, a plea for calm on all sides. You know, behind the scenes, what is likely occurring here is essentially back channeling so that Iran gets the message here that this should really be over at this point. And we should note that we do have a regional intelligence source telling our colleague Nic Robertson that, in fact, Iran does not plan to retaliate further, and that this tit for tat, for now at least, appears to be over.",

And just as Swifties finished listening through that, the Grammy winner stunned fans by dropping another 15 songs in a surprise album titled The Tortured Poets SocietyHow does she have the time? With Travis Kelce and everything else? Joining me now, someone who has interviewed Taylor Swift several times, CJ Farley. He is a cultural commentator, author of the upcoming novel, \"OK Computer.\" Wow, you have a great job. We all have envy here in Washington after the conversations we've been having this morning. Tell us about this, CJ. A 31 song album. Then a 2nd 2:00 a.m. release. Correct me if I have any of this wrong.

And she even makes a reference to the Blue Nile, a Scottish group that released an album - released a song called \"The Downtown Lights\" back in 1989. So, this isn't just a song about things that she's gone through in her own life. This is a song that really takes note of the past and brings it into - into the - into the present. A really smart album. I think it's kind of multi- generational. I mean we think of Swifties as these young girls who are just following Taylor Swift, but really she makes albums, I think, that our multigenerational, multifaceted and she keeps getting better.",
