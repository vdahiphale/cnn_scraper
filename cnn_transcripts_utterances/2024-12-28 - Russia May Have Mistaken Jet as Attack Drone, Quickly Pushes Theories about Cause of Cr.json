A U.S. official tells CNN that Russian air defenses may have misidentified the commercial jet, confusing it for a Ukrainian drone.Moscow is trying to blame the pilot, claiming he failed to land the plane twice before it went down in Kazakhstan. But Azerbaijan Airlines says its early investigation shows, quote, \"physical and technical external interference caused the crash.\" The airline has now suspended flights from the country's capital to several Russian cities.

      "sentences": "Hi, Ben. It's good to see you. So as we're hearing more from these 29 survivors, we're hearing someinteresting new details. Some of them are saying that they heard a loud bang and felt an explosion moments before the plane crashed on Azerbaijani soil. And in fact, one man, who was recording himself praying, also said that he saw some damage to the plane's main body. And in fact, if you take a look at this video, Ben, you can actually see visible holes in the plane's aircraft (sic). Now we don't really know what caused these holes and what caused the plane to crash. But according to one of our aviation experts, Miles O'Brien, the fact that the metal around these holes is bent inwards and not outwards could indicate that there was, quote, \"an explosion in proximity to the tail of that aircraft.\" Now this could all lend further weight to a growing theory about Russia's involvement. As you said, we've heard from a U.S. official, an Azerbaijani lawmaker, several aviation and military experts, all suggesting that Russia could have potentially misidentified the passenger jet as a Ukrainian drone and shot it down. Now interestingly, on Friday, Russia did say that, for the first time ever, the plane had to be redirected to a new destination from its original destination because of Ukrainian drones in that area as well as fog. Also on Friday, as you described, Azerbaijani Airlines indicated that after their initial investigation, the plane crashed after experiencing, quote, \"physical and technical external interference.\" So while this theory is still unconfirmed, it is gaining a lot of traction, Ben. And in terms of what's next for this investigation, investigators did find a second black box in the wreckage on Friday. And they're hoping that this will really be key to solving this puzzle. They're hoping that voice recordings from the cockpit and also instrument readings will give some kind of indication as to why dozens of people lost their lives during this very tragic flight on Christmas Day -- Ben.",

Obviously, I'm speculating based on the information that's been released, photographic information about the damage to the aircraft. So we think we know what happened. And contrary to what the Russians are saying, it appears that it was hit by a missile. It appears that this was a medium-sized missile. It was probably not one of these hand-held missiles nor was it a very large missile like brought down the Malaysia 17 Boeing 777. So it looks like it was a tactical type missile. And there's a new type of missile the Russians have had actually for several years but they've deployed it to that region recently. And it's a very dangerous missile because it can react very quickly. And within four seconds after detecting a target, it can launch a missile. OK. And that can do this automatically or under manual control. Now, of course, we don't know any of the direct evidence right now but suspicion points in the direction of this so-called Pantsir type missile system. Now this isn't the first time a passenger plane was reportedly shot down in Russian airspace. You just alluded to one of the previous incidents there.

Now remember, there's a lot of radar and radio jamming going on, so it's possible that the transponder, the electronic identifier from the airliner, didn't appear on their scopes.

      "sentences": "Well, president-elect Donald Trump on Friday urged the Supreme Court to put a pause on a controversial ban on TikTok, arguing that a delay in implementation would allow his incoming administration to try and negotiate some sort of deal that would save the app.Now all of this relates back to a ban that Congress approved earlier this year and Biden signed into law, really arguing and requiring that the platform be sold to a new non-Chinese owner or be banned in the United States. That ban is currently slated to take effect on January 19th, just one day before Donald Trump is sworn in to office. Now what Donald Trump is urging the Supreme Court to do puts him at odds with the Biden administration, which filed its own briefing on Friday, urging the Supreme Court to move forward with the ban. And they warned of grave national security concerns if it is not implemented. Now one thing to be clear on is that Donald Trump, in his briefing, did not really address the underlying First Amendment questions. But he did urge the court to put this pause on the ban so that his administration can try to find some way to resolve the issue. This is what he said in the briefing, quote, \"President-elect Trump urges the court to stay the statute's effective date to allow his incoming administration to pursue a negotiated resolution that could prevent a nationwide shutdown of TikTok, thus preserving the First Amendment rights of tens of millions of Americans. \"While also addressing the government's national security concerns.\" Now one thing to be clear on is that TikTok is very popular in the United States. It has 170 million monthly users in the U.S. And Trump, for his part, has wavered on the issue. Back during his first administration, he actually signed an executive order that would have effectively put a ban on TikTok, also arguing of its national security concerns, given China's influence over the social media platform. However, throughout his time on the campaign trail in 2024, as well as just a couple of weeks ago, Donald Trump said that he is warming to TikTok. And he argued that part of his stance on that is because so many young voters who voted for him use the app. Now all to say it is very unclear what is going to happen. But Donald Trump's argument is that he wants a pause on this ban so that his administration can figure out how they want to resolve this -- Alayna Treene, CNN, West Palm Beach, Florida.

The allegations were first aired on Israel Channel 12's \"Uvda\" program, the country's equivalent of \"60 Minutes.\" Benjamin Netanyahu decried the report as a new blood libel, calling it biased and false propaganda. The prime minister sees it as another strand of what he describes as a witch hunt against him, orchestrated by the left-wing media and which led to him being tried for fraud, breach of trust and bribery, charges he vehemently denies. Netanyahu asked that his trial be postponed due to the wars with Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza but to no avail. In the enclave itself, the Israeli military, on Friday, said it was carrying out targeted operations against what it described as a Hamas terrorist stronghold in and around the Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza. Hamas has denied that it uses hospitals for military purposes and the IDF has not offered definitive proof of its claims. Hospital director Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya said in a social media post that the IDF was besieging Kamal Adwan and issuing orders for its evacuation.
