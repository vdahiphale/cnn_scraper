When the Supreme Court hears that, it's very atypical for a criminal defendant to be there in person, and they don't need to be there. It's a legal argument that the two sides would be making, the Justice Department and his lawyers. So, the judge was quite clear today. Trump needs to be in court next week.

In January 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported that in the weeks before the 2016 election, Donald Trump had arranged a $130,000 payment to the adult film star to keep her from publicly discussing their alleged 2006 encounter. Later, former Trump attorney Michael Cohen testified that Trump directed him to make payments to Daniels, \"For the principal purpose of influencing the election\" and that Trump later reimbursed him. Cohen served jail time for campaign finance violations related to the hush money payments and gave jarring testimony to Congress. MICHAEL COHEN, DONALD TRUMP'S FORMER ATTORNEY: I am ashamed that I chose to take part in concealing Mr. Trump's illicit acts rather than listening to my own conscience. TODD (voice-over): Donald Trump has always denied having an affair with Stormy Daniels. In April 2018, Trump was asked by reporters about hush money.",

An Israeli source familiar with thenegotiations telling me that Hamas has slashed the numbers of hostages it is willing to release over the course of a six-week ceasefire, which would be the first phase of the potential agreement between Israel and Hamas. For weeks now, months even, the basis of these negotiations to try and reach a ceasefire deal has been a six-week ceasefire in exchange for the release of some 40 Israeli hostages with the number of Palestinian prisoners to be determined. But now, Hamas is offering fewer than 20 Israeli hostages to release over the course of those same six weeks. And it's not just that, Julia. In addition, Hamas also is demanding more Palestinian prisoners be released in exchange for those 20 hostages, and they're also pushing for more Palestinian prisoners who are serving life sentences in Israeli jails. A Hamas official, Basem Naim, told me that Hamas has proposed releasing three captured Israelis each week, but he said that no one is talking about final numbers. So, this is being viewed, again, as kind of a step back in the negotiations, and it comes as these negotiations have been going on for months now. There have signs of progress and then signs that the negotiations are stalling. And so, now, this is very much being taken by the Israeli side as a sense that this not able to move forward at this time. And so, instead, what Israeli officials are beginning to prepare for is a potential ground offensive in Rafah. The Israeli prime minister has said that he views that operation as necessary, and with hostage talks appearing to break down or come close to it, that may be what comes next. But for the moment, I'm told that that ground offensive in Rafah has been put on hold.

I think there's wideacceptance now this attack that we saw at the weekend is not something that the Israeli government can simply ignore and move on from. What are you expecting from them in terms of response, be it military or diplomatic or both? DANIEL KURTZER, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO ISRAEL: I think it's hard for Israel to contemplate not responding to the attack. It took out three senior Iranian Revolutionary Guard generals in Syria and probably expected some response, but the nature and scope of the Iranian attack more than 300 drones and cruise missiles and ballistic missiles indicated that Iran was seeking to really have a very important impact in terms of killing and destroying property in Israel. And so, Israel can't ignore this, and I think they're now trying to figure out how and when and what to do and how to it in a way that doesn't incur further ire from the White House.",

Whether that calls for or leads to some greater action against Iran is a much more significant strategic issue. Just today, the former National Security adviser under President Trump said that the United States should join in an attack on Iran, including against Iran's nuclear facilities. And I think that's absurd. That would lead us into the kind of all-out war from which we -- it took 20 years to disengage from Afghanistan and Iraq. But the question you raised is a valid one.

And so, what we heard today, this idea that they're going to reduce -- they want to reduce the number of hostages to be released, they want a longer ceasefire, they want more prisoners, including those who have blood on their hands, is just part of a very cruel game. They know that it impacts the Israeli public, they know that it's causing very significant distress within the Israeli political system and they're milking it for all that it's worth.",

So, I think it's going to be hard for Israel to turn that around. The Iranian attack should give the world community some pause, but it's all going to depend on what comes next. You need to follow what's happening with a scorecard, and if the Israelis react in a way that changes the narrative, they will again find themselves on the losing end of a public narrative.",

So, it's so important that you have the jury that's able to do that. It's not worth putting on a juror who's -- who claim that they will and they won't.

Now, from the trials of Donald Trump to the tribulations of those invested in his social media platform. Shares of Trump Media, the parent company of Truth Social fell 18 percent on Monday. They closed below $30 a share for the first time ever. It happened after the company said it could sell millions of additional shares, a move that would raise more money for the firm, but of course dilute the value of the shares now on the market. And that obviously is the reaction. Trump Media stock, which rose above $70 per share when it started trading last month, has since fallen some 60 percent. All right. Stay with CNN.
