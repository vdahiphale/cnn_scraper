The final result will surely come down to a handful of swing states, like Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania, which both candidates are trying to clinch. Veteran journalist, Christine Spolar, has been interviewing voters in the state for months now, and she's joining us now from Pittsburgh. Christine, welcome to the program. Can I just start by asking you a sort of a gut reaction from what you've been hearing gleaning from talking to potential voters? These fresh warnings from John Kelly and others, particularly in Bob Woodward's book from former chief of staff -- former chairman of the joint chiefs, Mark Milley, that Trump actually does fall into that fascist space. Do you think that affects voters at this time?",

And Pittsburgh in particular has over 100,000 people who are retired military from various wars. Pennsylvania is a good state to be retired military person. The question is whether books and long articles and that sort of news is actually getting to that population. In my reporting here, both in 2020 and now in 2024, I'm not finding that people are reading. I'm finding that they are getting their news from social media, largely, and an older generation is on TV. So, really, these big questions of values, are, you know, really debatable whether people were reacting to that. Because the military people are bringing up these issues as a matter of integrity and values and understanding the different branches of government and why the military is not answerable and it's not a friend of the president. They are answerable to the constitution and to their military service. It's unclear if that message is, you know, getting through.",

So, people were not leafleting. People were not out in the streets registering. Last weekend in Pittsburgh, I was -- three people came up trying to register me to vote. There's leaflettings -- leaflets abound on our front porches here. It's interesting. It's a stronger ground game. The issues that are coming out in conversations with people I have are the Roe v. Wade and the Dobbs decision. And that gets to, you know, the gender split, will women be voting and particularly voting on that issue, both Republicans and Democrats? There are still more Democrats than Republicans, you know, in this county. But the question is, will that be changing? And because the -- both of those campaigns, 2016 and 2020, were decided by tens of thousands of votes, tens of thousands of votes are, you know, part of that people who are changing their registration or becoming independents. As of this week, registration stopped, as of Monday. There's 1.9 million people who are now independents. That is -- I've been talking to analysts, Lara Putnam from the University of Pittsburgh, has been looking at the data for the past two presidential campaigns, and she just has a new piece out in New York Review of Books, and she analyzes rural women, rural white women, rural middle-aged women who were activated by the 2017 vote, but further activated by the Dobbs decision. Some of those people who were Democrats are now independents based on partly the President Biden's poor debate. But a lot of Republicans, because of the Dobbs decision, also registered now or seem to have switched to be independent. And that crowd, that group of people, who knows how they're going to vote. The polls are showing -- CNN has done polls, The New York Times has done polls. We're all aware it's very close. And that anybody who says they know what's going to happen, they're just telling a story. But what we're not really seeing is what are those independent voters doing and what are the issues that are motivating them? You had the January 6th, you know, protests that were resulted in a lot of criminal charges. Well, about two dozen people from Western Pennsylvania were among those charged. So, you have a lot of different threads of, you know, thoughts about government, thoughts about how the government should have agency over your body or not, and all of those are playing out in this election this year.",

Kamala Harris has talked about it, and she hasn't run on gender, but she did just talk about it in her last interview, one of her latest interviews with NBC. We're just going to play this little snippet. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE:  I will never assume that anyone in our country should elect a leader based on their gender or their race. Instead, that that leader needs to earn the vote based on substance and what they will do to address challenges and to inspire people to know that their aspirations and their ambitions can and will be achieved through the opportunity to do that.

And that gets back to, you know, the running commentarynow on the revelations about Mr. Trump and the military and their opinions about him. But what she is saying -- I spent an afternoon at Bat's Barbershop, which is in on East Liberty in a neighborhood of Pittsburgh that is predominantly black. And the men were first time voters. I interviewed a 28-year-old first time voter. I interviewed a 43-year-old first time voter. Both black men. Both -- one working in a juice factory and one working as a caterer. And the caterer was quite interesting. He was watching everything. He was watching Fox News, CNN, social media. His issue was values. Now, he was reacting to how -- what -- how President Trump has talked about some values. He said he was offended about the way he spoke about women, and this was a 43-year-old man who had never voted before. So, that was interesting. I've gone to rallies. I've gone just walking around neighborhoods and talking to people in different neighborhoods of Pittsburgh, wealthy neighborhoods and not so wealthy neighborhoods. There is an interesting thing going on where everybody is nervous, as they were four years ago, but they're also thinking, well, maybe that person is being quiet because they're actually voting for a way they think I'm not voting. I interviewed a couple from Fox Chapel, which is probably the wealthiest neighborhood in Pittsburgh, and it was a lawyer, and it was a psychiatrist, and they said that they thought that Kamala Harris was getting more votes. And I said, well, why would you think that in Fox Chapel? And they said, because people won't talk. And they thought that meant that in their neighborhood where people have voted for Mr. Trump before, that people were quietly changing Kamala Harris. Is that scientific? Absolutely not. But, you know, people have lived in their communities here a long time, and they know how people react, and that's their gut reaction. I also spoke to an 80-year-old retired daycare worker who lives in the Hill District of Pittsburgh, a predominantly historically black area. And she said that she was quite worried because she was going to be voting for Harris, but when she talked to young men, they got very quiet. And so, she said to me, I think their silence means they're going to vote for Mr. Trump. So, you know, it's tense times here. And I think the idea that the bigger issues of integrity and values, what is binding you as a community may be what brings it together.

Kim Jong Un, the leader of North Korea, who is -- if there was ever a rogue leader in the world, it is him. And the intelligence showed that Kim and North Korea were capable of deploying a nuclear weapon on an ICBM, Intercontinental Ballistic Missile, that could reach the United States. They had not yet perfected that, but they are focusing on that for years. And so, Burns reported to the president and the National Security Council, we are now in a world of we have to deal with unplanned, inadvertent escalation. And he said all the warning systems are blinking red. This is now. This is -- this spring blinking red. If you recall before 9/11, that's what the CIA said about the anticipation of some sort of attack. So, this is exactly like that and this is the assessment.

He's not one of those who talks much and gets quoted, unlike some of the other administration officials. So, he spoke to his Russian counterpart, you say, Sergei Shoigu. I'm going to read this. He says, this could put us on the path of a confrontation that would have existential implications for you and for us. Don't step on that slippery slope. And then you say, when Shoigu responded that he doesn't take kindly to being threatened, Austin retorts, I am the leader of the most powerful military in the history of the world.

I think that -- well, first of all, let me just say that 30 percent of the Jewish community generally holds views thatare consistent with non or anti-Zionism. And that number rises to 40 percent under 44 -- under the age of 44. So, our job, in some way, is to hold this 40 percent of a younger generation, 30 percent of the community overall to allow them a way to be Jewish and claim their Jewishness in the context of -- or in the framework of justice and liberation for Palestinians and also to fight for that from their particular positionality, particularly as their positionality is being weaponized through accusations of anti-Semitism. We know that anti-Semitism rises as -- like it directly correlates to the number of Palestinians that the Israeli government kills. Brown University just put out a study that says that the death toll in Gaza may actually be closer to 100,000, if not more. And so, yes, like I think when you have an Israeli government that is claiming to speak for Jews across the world, there is going to be rising anti-Semitism. At the same time, the conflation of anti-Zionism and anti- Semitism is muddying the water such that it becomes very, very difficult to actually address that anti-Semitism in a way that has real credibility and that addresses the real pieces of it.",

I didn't really know. And so, when I started to do activist work for Palestine, I actually didn't call myself an anti-Zionist, I didn't even think about Zionism because I didn't -- I barely knew what it was. And I think that that's fairly common within the Jewish community. It's a marker of belonging without a very firm definition. And essentially, what anti-Zionism means for me now is twofold. One, it means that I recognize what Palestinians have experienced as Zionism as the primary way of understanding what Zionism means, because it has meant a different set of -- different standards on equality, the -- not having freedom of movement being tried in different courts, according to different laws, not having the right to vote for the government that controls their lives. All of these factors are what Zionism means for Palestinians. It means, in many cases, being killed or massacred at will. And certainly, what we're seeing in Gaza is that it has meant essentially ethnic cleansing and mass murder. And so, I see that. And I also -- I have a diasporic interpretation of Judaism, which many ultra-Orthodox people across the across the world share, but also, I think, many cultural Jews share, that there is something about being Jewish for me that is about understanding the stranger in a certain sense and that nationalism and particularly ethnonationalism conflicts with that vision for me.",

And what is maddening about it is that what we're really trying to say, at its very basic level, is that Palestinians deserve basic human rights and equality and dignity and reparations for the plunder of their homes and the right to return to those homes under international law. These are international laws, first of all, that were created after the Holocaust to stop something like it from happening again.

And actually, what you have is an Israeli government that has been saying, no, we want all of it. There's no two states, there's no negotiation, and we are going to slug this out with force.

The question of rights who exist has become one of those questions that obscures rather than illuminates what's actually happening. The fact of the matter is, is that you have 15 million people living between the river and the sea, half are Jews, half are Palestinians. And in order to create a demographic majority, the right to for a Jewish State, you will need to do one of two things, ethnic cleansing and mass murder.
