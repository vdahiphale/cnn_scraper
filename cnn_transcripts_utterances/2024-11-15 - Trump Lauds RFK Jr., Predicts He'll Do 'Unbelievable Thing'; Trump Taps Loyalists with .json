It almost feels like some of these appointments are trying to burn these institutions to the ground from the inside, which is what some people in the Trump camp are saying. And the real question for us in the United States is not whether these people are qualified for these jobs. Some of them are, as I mentioned, but some of them very clearly are not.

And these are very much known China hawks in Washington. So, this is going to color this meeting, as well. But from the Biden administration's perspective going into this meeting, their bottom line is, no matter who is in the White House, this tough and complicated relationship between two superpowers needs to be managed. That's why, they say, the president, the U.S. president, is expected to highlight some of the progress they have made in recent months, including the resumption of military-to-military dialogs, as well as the joint efforts in cracking down global fentanyl trade. Of course, they're going to continue to raise U.S. concerns and allegations, ranging from China's support for Russia, as well as the recent alleged hacking of U.S. infrastructure, not to mention Taiwan and the South China Sea. Now from Beijing's perspective, they're going into this more trying to project this image of stability and China's global leadership. The message being China is now the biggest certainty in the world full of growing uncertainties, especially with Trump's impending return. Now, of course, they are worried about these potential massive tariffs on China's imports, as threatened by Trump during the campaign. But I think what has angered them, perhaps, more in the past few years, is Biden's approach of forming this united front with allies and partners, targeting China on numerous issues. So, from that perspective, the -- Trump's philosophy -- philosophy of America first, going alone in foreign policy, is still seen as potentially strategically beneficial to them. Now, of course, Chinese officials have told us they're very much prepared to deal with a very different Trump administration, and they are not going to take anything he throws their way lying down. And the fact, of course, this is all happening in Peru is not lost on people. China just unveiled a multi-billion-dollar mega port built by a state-owned shipping company. And that, of course, is very much a testament of China's growing economic clout in the region, replacing the U.S. as the biggest trading partner with the growing numbers -- growing number of Latin American countries just in the past two decades and so. And that kind of inroads China has made economically, many analysts have said, will eventually turn into their strategic -- strategic advantage, as well.
