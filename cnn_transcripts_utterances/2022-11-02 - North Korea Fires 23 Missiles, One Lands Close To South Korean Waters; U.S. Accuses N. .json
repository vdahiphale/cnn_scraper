The country launching at least 23 short-range missiles into the waters off the east and west coast of the Korean Peninsula, the most it has fired in a single day, for the first time since the peninsula was divided in 1945.One of the missiles landed close to South Korean waters, less than 40 miles, we're told. CNN's Kylie Atwood joins us now. Kylie, there's been a response for the State Department to this. What have they said?",

And one of those missiles landed close to the South Korean territorial waters, according to the South Korean government. So we're watching to see exactly how the U.S. responds, if they feel that they need to do anything to show U.S. support and its support for its allies in the region, particularly, as you have the South Korean president calling for a firm response -- Bianna?",

The Republican governor is widely seen as Trump's biggest competition for the 2024 GOP nomination. Joining us now is former Trump White House communications director, Alyssa Farah Griffin, and former Pence advisor, Olivia Troye. Olivia, let's start with you. Because we talk about this potential fight between Trump and DeSantis in Florida. But it's interesting that your former boss, former Vice President Pence, also posted this on to his Instagram account, talking about the latest division, I guess, and rifts between him and his former boss. Let's play it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE PENCE, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (voice-over): I was always loyal to President Trump. He was my president and he was my friend. And throughout our four years together, we worked closely together. We forged a close personal relationship. But in the end, came on difficult times. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

OLIVIA TROYE, FORMER ADVISER TO V.P. MIKE PENCE: I can't predict the future, but I certainly believe he does intend to run. I think he's trying to remind the voters that he's still here, he's still in the running. And he can tout the Trump administration accomplishments and everything that they did. But at the end of the day, there's something that separated them, and that was democracy. That's the one thing that Mike Pence did. He stood up for our democracy and he had the courage to actually do the right thing that day. So we have DeSantis and Trump and Mike Pence, I think. between the three of them, Mike Pence is the differentiate of them.",

I hope it's a message that's aimed at bringing in Republicans who are not among the 30 percent of Republicans who are hard and fast about the election.There are plenty of people on the margins who will go oat to vote next Tuesday, who may not be voting for Democrats, but they're concerned about election denialism. They're concerned about the conspiracy theories that have taking hold in my party. My one caution is this, I don't expect to hear it in remarks, but Democrats made a strategic error when they put about $50 million behind election deniers in primary election, which was to boost candidates they thought would be easier for Democrats to beat. However, in some cases, some of those may win, like Bolduc in New Hampshire, for example, John Gibbs in Michigan. I would love to see Biden condemn that. I don't expect to see that. But that gives more credence to his push for we all have a stake in this democracy and a role to play in it.",

Is that enough of a pre-warning, I guess, from the president tonight?

And I hope it's important -- I hope he talks about the need to really tamp down political violence, and how critical that is. I think Republicans are actually messengers for that talking point. They're the ones that need to be out there saying, this could take time, don't come out of the gate the next morning saying, oh, they stole the election from me. Which is what I expect that some of these election-denying candidates will likely do. They've already sort of started circulating and saying that. And quite frankly, I worry for election officials that will be doing the counts on these. I worry for the poll workers. And I worry for some of these other candidates that are funning that may be on the receiving end of the threats that will come.",

Among the speakers that we've already heard from today was Samantha Fuentes. She is a student, was a student at MSD. And she told Nikolas Cruz, she described the pain, the agony her life has been since the shooting happened back in 2018. She told Cruz she often thinks about killing herself. And she worries that someone out there's going to try to finish the job that she says Cruz started. We also heard from the family of Alyssa Alhadeff. Her mother and father both addressed Nikolas Cruz in court. Her mother was quite distraught. She says she hopes that Nikolas Cruz spends the rest of his life just miserable in jail in a prison cell. Her father, he deplored the judge to make some changes with respect to the type of security that Cruz will get once he is sentenced. Here now are the Alhadeff parents. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
