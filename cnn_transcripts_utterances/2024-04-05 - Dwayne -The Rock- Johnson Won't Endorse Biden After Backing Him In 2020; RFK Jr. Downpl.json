And while he ruled out a run this year, I didn't hear him ruling out a run in the future. I wonder how all of these fits into perhaps a master plan.Now I want to bring in Shermichael Singleton, a CNN political commentator and former deputy chief of staff of Housing and Urban Development under Donald Trump, and Kate Bedingfield, a CNN political commentator and former Biden White House communications director. I'm so glad that you're both here. I'm going to try not to show my WrestleMania past -- (LAUGHTER) -- but it's there. (LAUGHTER) Kate, let me begin with you here because, first of all, the idea of the endorsement or not endorsing, it's quite a thing. Did anyone ask him, per se, to describe it in this way?

He's clearly sorts of trying to, you know, correct -- course correct for his own personal -- his own personal reasons.Um, so, you know, I don't know that this is so much a reflection on Biden as it is an effort by a celebrity to sort of say, you know, I stuck my toe in the pool of politics, I didn't love it, and now I'm trying to adjust and pull back. I think it's a little ironic to go on Fox News and talk about how you reject division and hate the division that you see in the country given what Fox News does, but -- but I think that it's very clear.

We've seen that in the battleground states. Obviously, not where he wants to be yet, but moving in the right direction.You know, I think there's also -- we've also seen good economic news. We saw a gangbuster jobs report just yesterday or this morning even. What is time anymore? I don't know. But -- (LAUGHTER) -- you know, that was better than people anticipated. So, you know, there continue to be economic indicators that are strong. Now, yes, is there a disconnect between how people are feeling, the sense of unease that people have, and substantively where the economy is? Yes. And so, it is on President Biden and the Biden campaign to spend the next seven months talking about not just what they've done, not just what they've passed, not just the bills, but really how they have made a difference in people's lives. And I think they have a very good story to tell about his focus on kitchen table issues and on what matters to middle class families. And don't forget, he's running against Donald Trump, whose entire message is about Donald Trump and about himself, and is not in any way about how he's going to -- how his second term is going to make life better for working people. So, the Biden campaign also has to drive that contrast for the next seven months.",

I'm not sure how one misconstrues or misunderstands given, of course, we've heard many a moment talking about the bear spray, the mace. (END VIDEO CLIP) There is the idea of the knives.

It's just odd. It's just weird.I mean, I think the evidence on this is pretty straight clear. We've had a year and a half worth of individuals coming out, testifying publicly about it. I think it was a catastrophic mistake. I'm not exactly sure what RFK Jr. was thinking here. I think he needs to probably focus on what is his path when there really isn't one to try to continue forward over the next couple of months. He selected a running mate that no one knows anything about. And when you really look at some of his policy positions, they really are sort of indistinguishable in terms of how they actually are going to address many of the issues that people are actually facing.
