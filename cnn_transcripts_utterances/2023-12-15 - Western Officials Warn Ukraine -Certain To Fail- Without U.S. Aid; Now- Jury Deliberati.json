He said if the U.S. fails here, our allies will follow. We got an indication of that overnight just over the last 24 hours where E.U. partners failed to vote to extend their own aid. Now they'll have another chance next month, much like the U.S. Congress will have another chance next month. But the trouble is, those delays matter and it's not clear it's going to come through.",

But this jury, they began yesterday, they talked amongst themselves deliberating for about three and a half hours. They had a question about exact numbers that had been presented in court about how much Shaye Moss and Ruby Freeman, those two Georgia election workers, want Rudy Giuliani to pay them to repair their reputations.That number breakdown was each of them asking for about $24 million just for the defamation, the reputational damages. That jury has other things they have to determine as well. And so they've been talking, deliberating behind closed doors. We've heard nothing from them for about four additional hours today. We're past the lunch hour, they're still at work. And the other things they are determining is not just the reputational damage number, but the amount to find Rudy Giuliani for the emotional distress that he caused these two women. And then on top of that, there is also the question of how much he should be punished. We know that the lawyers of Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss want that number to be significant. It's a punitive damages number. So punishment. And they are also asking this jury quite bluntly to send a message to powerful people who choose to do and say things like Rudy Giuliani, what he was saying, after the 2020 election, spreading lies. They're asking to send a message. There is also a question in this case about, can Rudy Giuliani even pay what the jury may find here, if it's into the millions, or even tens of billions of dollars? He said in court, he's broke, but there was a discussion this morning in court that's still unresolved about if the jury brings back a verdict as soon as today. Is the judge going to say, OK, now is the time, or is he going to have a little leeway, a little bit of extra time to start thinking through things and potentially begin his appeal? So a lot of questions up in the air this afternoon over here at the federal courthouse?",

CNN's Zach Cohen is live for us outside the courthouse in Atlanta. Zach, walk us through what it was like at today's hearing. ZACHARY COHEN, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER: Yes. Boris, the lawyer for Mark Meadows really was grilled by this panel of three judges, who was once again trying to argue that Mark Meadows's case in the Georgia election interference case, the state level charges should be moved to federal court because everything that's alleged in the indictment here in Georgia, those actions took place while he was chief of staff. But look, the panel of three judges was really skeptical about that argument and really wanted Mark Meadow's attorney to draw a distinction because just because you're chief of staff doesn't mean that what you're doing falls under your official duties. Take a listen to this one exchange between Meadows's lawyer and one of the judges on the panel actually pushed him on this point. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We knew that, for example, the letter written by Sidney Powell, one of Trump's former attorneys, who was really pushing to get access to voting systems here in Georgia and Coffee County.We knew that that was going to be a pretty short letter, but reading it and seeing it with our own eyes, we emphasize how short it was. It was one sentence long, handwritten and simply says, \"I'm sorry for what I did in Coffee County\", referring to the county in Georgia, that she was trying to get access to voting systems. And Ken Chesebro, the other attorney similarly had a very shorthand written letter. So at the end of the day, I think this does raise some questions about why the district attorney here in Atlanta, Fulton County, demanded that these letters be part of the plea agreements that they reached with these two defendants, and to others as well. But going forward, we'll also have to see if that remains a condition of any other plea agreements. We do expect more of the 15 defendants that remain in this case, to try to get some sort of plea deal with prosecutors to avoid a trial. So we'll have to see but, I mean, again, not very much remorse in these letters, in some cases, one sentence long.",

According to a very detailed incident report, one of the three girls that were being threatened according to this report, is a 13-year-old Muslim student. According to the Council of American Islamic Relations, Georgia chapter, she is half Palestinian. That student told the deputy that she asked about the flag that was hanging in Reese's classroom. She said that he told her it was hanging because he was Jewish and he had family who lived in Israel. She said she told him she was offended by that flag because, quote, of Israelis killing Palestinians. That's when she says the teacher became angry. He began shouting at her, calling her antisemitic and asking if Israel had the right to exist and followed them through the hallway.

The other is Samer Talalqa, who was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Am on October 7. Our understanding is that this took place earlier this morning, according to Daniel Hagari, the spokesman for the Israeli military in the Shujaiya neighborhood in Gaza, which has been the site of very intense fighting between the Israeli military and Hamas. The Israeli military says that this is one of the last remaining Hamas strongholds in northern Gaza and apparently also the location where Hamas was holding some of these captives. And in this tragic incident, it appears that the Israeli military misidentified those three Israeli hostages as a potential threat, potentially as militants fired at them and killed them. Their bodies, we understand, were taken into Israel and transferred for examination, according to the Israeli military.
