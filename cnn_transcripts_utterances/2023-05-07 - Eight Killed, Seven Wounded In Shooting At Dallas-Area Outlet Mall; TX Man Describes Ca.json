And we don't know how much -- I mean, because the public safety authorities have just not disclosed the basic information, which I think is a disservice at this stage, we don't even know how much more ammunition he had. I mean, we just simply don't know the killer's intent in terms of what he actually planned that day.We know -- we certainly saw the -- we certainly saw that he was on a mission to kill as many people as possible. So, look, I mean, one of the reasons, you know, in terms of this common ground, right, is one of the reasons why the AR-15, if that's, in fact, what it was, or a similar type weapon is a weapon of wars because it does not give the public any time to respond. And it just -- you're either dead or you're not, just depending on where the government is aiming. But, you know, as well, it gives public safety. No time to respond because you're talking about seconds before multiple people are dead and you heard that man say, you know, what am I -- I'm not a first responder, I'm the first one here. Just because you happen to be at that place and we're demanding on the public, you know, ways to try to save people or to protect children who may still be under harm or traumatized. So in terms of why this kind of weapon is different than say guns generally, we don't -- they're not all the same. We have to admit that. And I think the second issue is, of course, depending on who he is, because that too has not been disclosed. Was he known to public safety officials? What kind of military or other background did he have, if any, just given, how he was dressed or was he just being performative? One of the things that I am -- I think will help solve some of this is, is the extent to which gun culture has become a way of sort of mocking or a sort of strut, I guess I would say. You know, in other words, we can bring the temperature down whether you believe in gun ownership or this kind of gun ownership or not, and recognize that this performative aspect of guns that you see from politicians or you see from people about, well, it's my right is really, is amplifying the use of guns.

Now, we haven't heard since then a more fulsome statement from the President or the First Lady about this shooting in Allen, Texas. But of course, the President has to -- has had to routinely respond to these very tragic mass shootings across the country, particularly this year. It's something that he's had to do, frankly, back to back to back. And when these happen, he uses the moment to call once again for gun control measure. Specifically, he's talking about an assault style weapons ban. Now CNN previously reported that an AR-15 was found near the gunman yesterday, so this is something that President Biden is likely to talk about as well.

And I think that the developers of the Patriot missile systems, I mean, particularly the United States and the Pentagon, will be looking at this incident in detail to try to establish which of those three things it was because this is a missile system. An anti-missile system that was developed to take out missiles that predate the hypersonic missile that the -- the Kinzhal that the Russians have been using occasionally in Ukraine.This is a missile that the Russians claim can fly at 10 times the speed of sound, and in technical terms, too fast for the Patriot. But the Ukrainians are saying that they did successfully shoot one down. Now, they are very short, indeed, of Patriot missile systems. They say they are very short indeed of all forms of aerial defenses. So, this has been a major morale booster for the Ukrainians. And it also represents from the Russian perspective a bit of a slap in the face and that they did assume that these Kinzhal Missiles, although they don't have large numbers of them, were pretty invulnerable. Now, they will have to take extra precautions to protect those missiles that they have been firing into this country. And they fired them at a time when they try to overwhelm the systems here with other missiles and drones from the very primitive Iranian-made Shahed drones all the way through to the Russian-made cruise missile systems. They fire swarms of these things, and then on top of them fire these hypersonic missiles. So, it is a significant step for the Ukrainians, but we don't really know the technical detail, whether or not it was basically a lucky shot.",

There's been images of very large queues of vehicles leaving the city. There've also been reports coming from even Russian officials of other towns being evacuated closer to the front lines in anticipation of a Ukrainian offensive along that very long front line there in the -- that essentially runs east to west from Zaporizhzhia, all the way through to north of Mariupol, which of course was flattened by the Russians when they captured it last year. This is seen as preparations being made by the civilian and Russian authorities in the south of the country that they have captured the beginning of this war, ahead of a Russian -- sorry, a Ukrainian offensive in the summer. The assumption is that they will be attacking in the south. But of course, the Ukrainians are also being trained by NATO in maneuver warfare and feints and fake attacks will be very much part of any future offensive that they do conduct.",
