I think it's too soon to know whether it's going to have any nuanced impact, but because it's GA and because you're looking at the potential for a runoff that creates sort of a barrier to - it creates the possibility that we just want to know the answer to this election on Election Day or even the day after it, so we'll see what happens.

Listen, what I'm hearing from Democrats is a rising level of concern with each passing day now that there is this potential red wave building and that this midterm election season may perform to form like we have seen in previous midterm cycles with a first term president, which is that everything at the end potentially just collapses in the direction away from the president's party and there's real concern among Democrats that that may be happening here.Well, you noted about where the President is going today, to New York. I mean, here is - we're 12 days away from Election Day. We know President Biden's approval ratings are upside down. He is more unpopular than he is popular broadly across the country. So where can he go? Well, he can go to a district like this one up in Syracuse that he bested Trumpian by like 78 percentage points, so high single digit margin of victory and yet there he is, perhaps, to try and - it's a Republican old seat right now, there's a retirement there and with redistricting, perhaps a seat the Democrats eyes - Democrats eye as a potential pickup of a Republican seat. And as you noted, that gubernatorial race between Kathy Hochul and Lee Zeldin is uncomfortably close for Democrats in deep blue New York. But that is where the President can sort of go and show up at this moment, because in a lot of the true toss up races, he's just not being welcomed there right now.",

These memos sort of get disseminated a lot of times, specifically, if we're coming up to a big parade, so to speak, but it's very notable that it's coming out right before this midterm election, specifically, because Bolton says that we're in a complex domestic threat environment. And it brings in real world examples of things that they're keeping their eye on ahead of these midterms, not just here in New York, but really across this country.One thing they bring up is the tailgating that we're seeing that Kyung Lah has reported on so well in other states. They've also brought in intelligence they're seeing online and encrypted apps and chat rooms about threats to poll workers. Again, it is important to note there is no immediate threat that they're seeing against a poll worker or a polling site or any candidates. However, this again is just so notable because it is warning everyone to be alert when those midterm elections come up. I want to read one part of what this memo says. It says given the elevated domestic violent extremism threat landscape throughout the United States, uniform members of service are advised to maintain heightened situational awareness when deployed citywide in support of the upcoming midterm elections. So again, this just speaks again and it says it in this memo of the environment that we are in right now created by January 6, of course, with the election deniers that we've been talking about for years. So again, they're just getting ready for what's to come in just less than two weeks.",
