A group of anti-abortion doctors that sued to ban a common abortion medication is urging a U.S. appeals court to uphold a ruling that would take the drug off the market.The group filed its response to request -- requests from the U.S. Justice Department and the maker of the drug, mifepristone, asking that a Texas judge's decision to suspend that drug's long held FDA approval be allowed to take effect on Friday. The group says mifepristone is not safe and that the FDA did not adequately assess its risks when it approved the drug 23 years ago. The appeals court wants the Justice Department and drugmaker, Danco Laboratories, to respond by midday Wednesday, whichever side loses, that ruling could still appeal and possibly ultimately go all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Mifepristone is typically used in conjunction with another drug, misoprostol, to end pregnancies that are 10 weeks or long. Misoprostol can also be used alone to cause an abortion, but women may encounter more complications when doing so. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. ERIKA WERNER, TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER: With misoprostol alone, abortion and miscarriage management is less effective, were more likely to see failures, and therefore, more likely to need surgical intervention after misoprostol alone. When we use mifepristone and misoprostol, we're more likely to get a complete result with medication only and avoid a woman having to go to the operating room. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And just to go back to the basics here, if you're not a woman of childbearing age, you might think you won't be personally impacted by the dueling rulings and events that are playing out of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.

Joe Biden touched down in Belfast on Tuesday and will later head to Ireland, his ancestral home.Upon landing, there were salutes, and there was British Prime Minister Ritchie Sunak. The two will hold talks in just a few hours from now. President Biden will also meet with all five parties that make up Northern Ireland's power sharing agreement. And CNN's Kevin Liptak is live in Belfast, Northern Ireland, he joins us now. Good to see you, Kevin. So what's on the agenda for the President in the hours ahead, of course for the rest of the week? KEVIN LIPTAK, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Well, really, Rosemary, the centerpiece of the president's visit here in Northern Ireland is the speech that he will deliver a little bit later today at Ulster University, talking to university students. And I think that the choice of that venue is really highly symbolic talking, not necessarily about Northern Ireland's bloody past but its future. You know, many of these audience -- members of this audience may not even remember the troubles. They might not have been born in 1998 when the Good Friday agreement was signed. And really what the president is hoping to emphasize is the economic potential of this region, the potential for investments here and really trying to focus on what's next for Northern Ireland instead of focusing only on what has happened in the past. Now, the president is not speaking to lawmakers while he's here. He's not addressing the Parliament of Stormont and that in part because the parliament is not functioning at the moment. There's this dispute over Brexit trade rules and so that the power sharing agreement that was one of the outcomes of the Good Friday agreement is not currently sort of functioning. And I do think that tells you the Good Friday agreement for all of its success in bringing an end to the sectarian violence, many of its ambitions are sort of remain unfulfilled. And, of course, the piece is also somewhat uneasy here. And even in the last several days, you've seen some flare outs of sectarian violence, including in Derry when Republican dissidents clashed with police. And I think the images of that were so disappointing for so many people because of how young some of those dissidents were really just young teenagers really the sort of people for whom the Good Friday agreement which really meant to bring about major changes. And so, the president will only be here in Northern Ireland for around 15 hours from there, it's onward to the Republic of Ireland. Later on today, he'll have the first of two visits to ancestral homes. This one is in County Louth. That is where his great-great-great grandfather, Owen Finnegan, he was a shoemaker. He left Ireland in 1849, came to the United States and really he's kind of the origin of President Biden's Irish story. Rosemary?",

I can't say that there was any physical or psychological pressure applied to him. We made sure to ask him that, and he confirmed that there wasn't any. Then we talked about the conditions of his detention, his day- to-day life, on whether or not he is in need of medical attention. But we have not uncovered any problems. CHANCE (voice-over):  In fact, Evan Gershkovich appeared calm, he told me, unlike many who find themselves trapped, cut off from the outside world behind Lefortovo's walls. MELNIKOV (through translator):  In the case of Gershkovich, I would probably say he was not shocked. You couldn't say that he was happy or that he envisaged this development. He simply took it calmly. That's all. CHANCE (voice-over):  But even a glimpse inside Lefortovo can be unnerving. This was rare access granted to Russian state television more than a decade ago. Even Russians are fascinated with the prison, infamous for holding dissidents where the old KGB executed countless Soviet citizens. Officials tell us these facilities have now been renovated, but the layout designed to limit contact between detainees remains unchanged as does the same as old prison regime. MELNIKOV (through translator):  Wake-up call is at 6 a.m., lights out at 10, breakfast, lunch and dinner, morning, day, evening. There's an inspection every morning. They ask if there are any problems, they deliver mail, parcels, deliveries from a shop. This routine will include trips to court if there are any and meetings with lawyers and investigators, et cetera. Under walk, the authorities have to let prisoners walk for an hour every day. PAUL WHELAN, FORMER U.S. MARINE:  I want to tell the world that I'm -- I'm a victim of political kidnapping ransom.

I don't even know if I'd yelled out, he told \"The Wall Street Journal,\" the other prisoners could have heard me.
