      "sentences": "Yeah. You know, Kate, I think generally speaking, there is a sense across the board in Washington, D.C. right now of bracing for and preparing for the incoming Trump administration and how that is manifesting here at the White House is the president, along with White House and administration officials, trying to figure out what, if anything, they can realistically try to do with really just the handful of weeks left before President Biden leaves office to one, continue to advance some of his policy goals, and then also put protections and guardrails in place for the work that's already been done.And as you said, Kate, you know, student loan forgiveness has been a huge priority for this president and the administration. And notably, he had put forward this signature landmark proposal that would have canceled some $400 billion in student loans. But that ended up getting caught up in the Supreme Court with the highest court basically rejecting that. And since then, we have seen this basically piecemeal effort by the administration to offer relief in places where they can. Now, Democratic lawmakers, as you noted, they are basically putting pressure on this administration and this president to do whatever they can to get a little more work done, provide a little more relief. Again, with the little time that is left. And that includes sort of targeting specific groups of borrowers, including students who have been defrauded by schools. Many of them have had their debts still not canceled out. There's also students that are eligible for relief under borrower defense. And then finally, borrowers who are still in limbo right now because of a program called stave, which is currently in litigation. As you mentioned, there are many pieces of this that are basically stuck in limbo because of the various legal actions that have been taken. It's not really clear, Kate, what exactly Donald Trump intends to do just on the broad issue of student loans, though he certainly has not spoken about this issue in the same way. And there's no expectation that he's going to go out of his way in any way, really, to defend and protect the initiatives that were started under the Biden administration. So you can easily imagine this being a really tough time in general for borrowers, many of whom at some point over the last few years thought that they were going to have a lot of their debt canceled out or forgiven. And now they are stuck in limbo and they have no idea if, if at all, that debt that they thought was going to go away is going to go away anytime soon -- Kate.",

And I am personally and on television, applying to be the military governor of Greenland if, in fact, we do take control of it.

Who knows?The fact of the matter is, is that we can't take the Panama Canal just by saying we want to take the Panama Canal. It doesn't belong to us. And so maybe Trump should crack a book, read the law, look at history, try to understand what actually happened not just 25 years ago, but in 1977 and 100 years ago, when the construction of the Panama canal started. It doesn't belong to us. And so just by saying it doesn't make it so -- doesn't make it a good idea. But look, if he is actually concerned about the Chinese influence in Panama on the Panama Canal in Latin America, which is what I understand is the basis of this, and that I do think should be a concern. Then he should be smart about it. He should be strategic. He should go to Panama and say, we want to work with you. We want to invest with you. It's exactly what the Chinese are doing. We want to invest in the Panama Canal, make it work better, make it work for you. That way, if it works for you, it works for us. It's called partnership. I understand that he doesn't really believe in that. He wants to be the strong man. Go in there, own it all. Greenland, I really don't get that. But, you know, Scott is very interested in it. So, Scott, if you move to Greenland, I would love to come and visit you. It doesn't mean it's good for America or that it's a smart thing to do. And frankly, it's not what he talked about in the campaign. Its not why people voted for him.

The Chinese are trying to rival and surpass the United States as the most influential culture in the world, as the most influential superpower in society in the world. We cannot allow this. And so Donald Trump is extremely worried about this, and I think he needs to put the rest of our neighbors on notice that we're not going to permit the Chinese to encroach upon our part of the world. And yes, we do need partnership. Yes, we do need diplomacy. Yes, we do need to work together. But you have to lay down some markers and you have to lay down some boundaries. And I think Joe Biden has frankly been asleep at the wheel on the encroachment of Chinese influence in the world. Donald Trump is back. He is well aware of the threat that they pose. And so I'm for a little bit of a wild card presidency here, especially, especially when it comes to counteracting Chinese influence. We cannot allow it. And so after four years, if he pushes back on that and pushes them away from us and pushes them away from our closest allies and our closest neighbors, that will be a good thing.",

I don't think so.And so I'm sorry, Joe Manchin is not the king of credibility when it comes to the Democratic Party. In terms of what Liz Smith said. Look, certainly the Democrats had huge challenges in communicating our message. But let's remember, this was not a rout. This was not a huge, sweeping win by Donald Trump, 7,000 votes in the House, the difference of 7000 votes in the house. And Democrats would be in control, 200,000 votes, more or less and Kamala Harris would have won the blue walls and would have won the presidency. This was not a sweeping mandate. Donald Trump didn't even break 50 percent of the popular vote. I'm not saying that Democrats don't have challenges. Absolutely, we have challenges in how we communicated and where we communicated and to whom we communicated. But I do not agree that the Democratic Party brand is in as much trouble as both of these folks are talking about. We certainly have work to do, but there's no question that the Democrats still stand for making sure that everyone has the ability to acquire the American dream, that everyone is on an equitable and level playing field, to be able to live up to their God-given potential and to be able to do what they can to succeed in this country. And it's not the party that focuses on oligarchs and billionaires and millionaires, which is what Donald Trump is doing right now in his transition and apparently wants to do in the in the first Trump administration. I think Democrats have a huge challenge ahead, but we also have a huge opportunity to continue making the distinction between what Trump is proving, what he is about. And our last conversation actually underscores that he wants to go and be the strongman and take over everything and be all about, you know, Elon Musk and billionaires and millionaires. And he's forgetting the promises that he made to working class and middle class Americans about bringing down prices, bringing down housing prices.

Welcome, Jeremy. Thank you so much for coming on this holiday week just before Christmas. Let's talk about Mangione's attorney, Karen Agnifilo. She hit two points hard in court yesterday. One, she railed against the Fed's piling on with the parallel case alongside the state case. And she talked about the spectacle, the police and including the mayor of New York made of her client during transfer to New York, saying that the pretrial publicity is prejudicial, be hard for her to get a jury in her mind.

And I don't say that in a -- I mean, it's a humorous situation for a very tragic, very real, you know, horror.But what she's saying basically is, is Mayor Adams, you you're not standing up and doing this elsewhere. You're not doing this in domestic violence homicides. You're not doing this, at least not yet, about this tragedy we just saw on a subway in Manhattan where someone was burned alive in an alleged murder there too. The federal government, when you have a clemency to 37 out of 40 people on death row by the current president, Joe Biden, and the southern district is potentially seeking the death penalty on this case. There's a lot of disarray here. It doesn't make sense. And what she's ultimately saying is this is throwing this all out of whack. This is not legal. It's not lawful. That being said, neither of those arguments are going to hold much water. The U.S. attorney can have a different theory. And they could have a mayor who can say a lot of things, but it's not going to really hold water. But her point is a very important one, which is what's going on here. Let's stick to the four corners of this case. This is a murder two case. And somehow, because you have UnitedHealthcare CEO, it's exploded into more. I will say one thing and I give Karen credit. I've known Karen for many, many years as a prosecutor. This is not to take away from that argument, but I'm wondering if those same arguments were made during her tenure for countless other cases where we hear sort of a publicity and press releases and a lot of action outside the courtroom.",
