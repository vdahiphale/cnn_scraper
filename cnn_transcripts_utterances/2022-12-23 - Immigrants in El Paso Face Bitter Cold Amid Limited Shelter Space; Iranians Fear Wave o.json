This really wasn't packing a whole lot of snow, but it's that wind that kept kicking it up that has resulted in some of these just treacherous conditions. Now, when it comes to these winds here, the National Weather Service here in Buffalo confirming one wind measurement of roughly 79 miles an hour, a wind gust of 79 miles an hour in the Buffalo area earlier today. That surpasses that of a historic blizzard in 1977. So that certainly confirms what we've been hearing from officials. This is an extraordinary storm, even for western New York.

These winds will continue as well. But for now, authorities here, Jake, the big recommendation is to stay at home. In fact, that's the safest place.

Look at the millions under these high wind warnings, gusting to near Category 1 strength.

I talked to one of these migrants who told me, look, I was telling my friends, get on the bus because you're going to freeze to death. But a lot of them are just so scared and they are going to go through this because they want to be in this country. Despite the very low temperatures, they want a future in the U.S. and they're willing to do whatever it makes to stay here -- Jake?",

ELBAGIR (on camera): In collaboration with Iranian activist group, 1500Tasvir, we worked to verify court documents which show that dozens of Iranians, including high-profile Iranian athletes face execution. We also worked to verify video pleas like this one, from this 81-year- old mother of one of the detainees. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translation): We don't know his whereabouts, no information about him nor do we even know where he is. (voice-over): This document from inside the Isfahan Regional Court shows that at least 10 people have been charged with Moharabe, war against God, spreading corruption on earth, and other charges, all which carry the possibility of the death penalty. ELBAGIR (on camera): Through obtaining and verifying court documents and witness testimony, we have evidence which supports a rushed- through judicial process. Defendants having court appointed counsel forced on them. Many defendants having their right to appeal refused. Some defendants faced with charges which could carry the death sentence being handed down in a single sitting. Terrified Iranian families believe that while the world is busy celebrating the holiday season, busy with their families, that they in Iran face imminent execution of their loved ones. (voice-over): CNN has confirmed that Iranian footballer Amir Nasr- Azadani is among those facing execution. Here he is training ahead of matchday. Now, he's on death row, waiting. This is social media video from the night of his arrest. CNN made contact with someone close to Amir Nasr-Azadani inside Iran. We are not disclosing their identity. They told us that in the days after his arrest, they were unable to get word from him or about him from authorities, even as the Iranian authorities denied his arrest. [17:45:01] UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translation): It was one month and 19 days, I think maybe even perhaps longer since the security forces came and wanted to see Amir's home.",

And that's in addition to the two executed by Iran amid the excitement of the World Cup. (SINGING) ELBAGIR (voice-over): Just this week, 27-year-old Iranian-Kurdish rapper, Saman Yasin, attempted suicide whilst in detention, according to a source from the prison. Yasin tried to end his life, sources say, with pills, after enjoying extreme psychological torture in the harsh prison conditions in Northern Iran. As much of the world gets absorbed with their festivities, Iranian families have one message. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translation): Please save them. For the love of God, save my sons. ELBAGIR (on camera)  We reached out to Iranian authorities for a response and did not receive any comments. We also shared out findings with the U.S. State Department, who, based on what we have found, said that they strongly denounce the charges handed down by Iranian authorities to these Iranians -- Jake?
