The US economy grows after shrinking for two quarters, but there are signs the mighty US consumer is starting to lag. Shares of Facebook owner, Meta are down at 23 percent after it reports declining revenue and plans to cut costs. And CNN gets an inside look at the damage Russia is causing to Ukraine's power network. Live from New York, it's Thursday, October 27th. I'm Alison Kosik. I'm in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Good evening. The US economy shifted into growth mode during the third quarter. Gross domestic product increased 2.6 percent on an annualized basis from July through September. This is the first positive reading this year, and while it ends debate as to if the US is in a recession now, it does little to quell fears of whether one is on the way. The Dow Jones surging this morning on the stronger than expected growth. It was up by more than 500 points. The S&amp;P 500 was briefly higher, the NASDAQ is firmly in the red at the moment. Here is what drove us economic growth: In the third quarter, exports rose despite a strong US dollar. Consumer spending advanced 1.4 percent. That's a slight drop off from the second quarter; and Federal, State and local government spending, that increased. Let's get more now. I want to bring in Rahel Solomon. She joins us from New York. I know you've been pouring over this GDP report all day. I'm curious, how does the first quarter of contraction compared to what you're seeing in this third quarter?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think if you look at net exports, for example, you can see that net exports really solidly movedhigher, right? So you can see that there is still strong demand for US goods and services. Is that sustainable? Well, that's a different question. The US consumer imported less. We didn't buy things from out of the country, out of the US and so that led to a positive net export, which really helped on that top line number. But our government spending that moved positive as compared to the last few quarters. Really at every level, Alison, at the Federal level, we saw increased spending for things like Defense spending, then we also saw increased spend for things like State governments and local government. Businesses continue to spend not on structures or on buildings, but on other things like equipment, for things like intellectual property and consumer spending, also slowing certainly compared to the first quarter of this year and the second quarter of this year, but still positive. And that was on things like services, things like restaurant spending, hotel spending, not physical goods, which sort of matches up right to what we saw on the trade data, that we're not buying physical things, but we still are spending. And how do you read all of this with the recession fears? Well, I spoke to one economist from Citi today, who told me this: \"We would expect that we're in a mild recession next year.\" These comments coming from Veronica Clark. \"So, this doesn't really tell you where we're headed. It does, however, tell you that right now, things are still okay, backed up by a labor market that is very strong.\" And of course, the labor market right now at 3.5 percent unemployment, which is practically a 50-year low.",

I mean, Mark Zandi, the Chief Economist of Moody's actually talked about this this morning to me, Alison. He said that, look, we're getting these swings in trade and inventories, a lot of it related to the pandemic. But saying that we're not really seeing anything fundamental that shows improving, we're basically just moving sideways. And to be fair for those economists who honestly told me earlier this year, this is noise. This is data: It's trade data, it's inventory data. It doesn't really say much about the strength of the economy. They're saying the same now that this is a lot of those same factors, but just moving in a different direction. But one thing that is still solidly good news, you can't slice it any other way. The US consumer is still holding on, still spending albeit at a slower pace.",

The residential component subtracted a significant amount of points from GDP in the last printout that we just saw, and that weakness is expected to persist.

Are we just waiting for the labor market to crack, the unemployment rate to rise, so we can go ahead and say we're in a recession? SONOLA Now, I think, a genuine recession territory, you will need the labor markets to crack. When you go back to the first two quarters that we saw, again, it was -- it had a lot to do with the noise from trade, and also the noise from inventory. But we expect the unemployment rate to increase from here on out. We are at three-and-a-half percent now. We expect that number to creep up to the four percent range in 2023 and ultimately, top out in the five percent range in 2024.

On the asset side, net worth is at all-time highs, and when you also think about the savings that were accumulated during the pandemic, we asked -- we still have decent savings there that will cushion the spending. When you also look at the liability side of it, household leverage is relatively low and household debt service is relatively low. So, to a large extent, the consumer can also lean on borrowing to support spending. So we think the US economy is coming into this recession from a place of strength. It will take some body blows during the recession, but it should be able to come out of it relatively in good faith. We're definitely not talking about a great recession style recession, if I can put it that way.

You know, Meta so far this year has spent $9.4 billion on its Metaverse efforts, and it says it's going to spend even more next year. And in the meantime, as you say, its core business is facing a host of challenges. You know, all the tech companies are seeing ad revenues decline, ad companies are spending less money because of the fears of a recession, high inflation. Meta is also losing younger users to rivals like TikTok. You know, the company is facing all of these challenges to its core business.

      "sentences": "Well, the decision, the basic one was, as you say, that rate rise, which was completely expected. So really no surprisethere. It is trying to tackle inflation, which is nearly five times what it should be, the two percent medium target for the ECB nearly at 10 percent. So, here is what they've done and here is what they can do. First of all, that rate hike, we're going to get more of them. The quote from the ECB today was they're expecting to raise interest rates further. Now, 1.5 percent where it is now is considered kind of to have a neutral effect on the economy. Any higher than that, though, is considered restrictive. It will be tricky, perhaps to get a full consensus on board for further rate hikes, particularly of this sort of magnitude. It was a big one this month, likely because of the fear of recession and what that could do. In the past, the ECB in 2008, for example, did raise rates and then had to slash them just two months later, so that is definitely the risk. Then we get to quantitative tightening, and this was perhaps the most surprising element from the ECB today, there isn't any. Here in the UK, the Bank of England has already started on this path; but the ECB, not even passive QT at this stage. They are still going to reinvest maturing bonds. And then Alison, perhaps the most interesting part of today was the real economy, ensuring that the rate hikes that they produce at the top actually filter down to the real economy of -- let's remember 19 economies -- and that is no mean feat. There has been a lot of criticism on how banks, commercial banks have been using the so-called TLTRO III. This was a loan mechanism. It was after the pandemic, trying to get banks to loan out to people. So essentially, banks were able to obtain loans at zero or negative rates, and now that rates have risen. They can park that money at the ECB, make a tidy profit, nice little carry trade. They are cracking down on that. So that could see some opposition from commercial banks, but this is the plan. So they are trying to take some money off the balance sheet, maybe there, but the QT, I think we have to wait a few more meetings, I reckon before we hear much more on that. So for now, it's really a focus on the interest rates.",

The energy crisis, there is a big supply side shock and the demand has never been as strong as in the US. So, we forecast a recession in the Euro area, where the peak to trough decline in GDP is quite deep. Second reason, as you mentioned, the ECB has to be cautious because of the risk of financial fragmentations, and the possibility that obviously, the tighter the monetary policy, the higher the risk that investors become concerned about the debt sustainability in high debt countries.

They havestarted using QE from the beginning of the year and inflation in the euro area is very elevated, but it's of a different nature. It has really been driven by this energy shock, by the supply side shock. It is the terms of trade, negative for the Euro area as a whole and we have not seen in the Euro area any significant wage increase that basically lead us to think that there are second round effects. Just to give you a sense, average nominal wage growth in the Euro area is tracking at 2.7 percent year-on-year. So in the near term, there is a very big squeeze. So in our take -- we have a different take, so we actually think that today, more dovish outcome that the market expected was, you know, what was an inappropriate shift, if you say so. I mean, we expected 75 basis point of hike at this meeting, we expect 50 at the next one, and then two hikes by 25 basis points. So we were forecasting less hikes than the market was pricing. And I think the ECB sent the message that an aggressive shift has been done, and that we know that monetary policy actually lags. So, let's see what the tightening and financing condition will bring about. Probably, we think in December when the ECB will release the new forecast, they will set up inflation for 2025 going back to two percent target.

Ukrainians are being urged to use electricity sparingly, as energy officials try to prevent a complete blackout. Our Nic Robertson visited the power plant and brought an exclusive look at the damage brought by Russia. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

The drone, they say, got tangled up in the high voltage cables up here, ripping equipment apart, all on the ground here, all around; burnt out cables and over here, burnt out equipment. And the problem, officials say, is that this part of the site was the most sensitive part, the place that's the easiest to take the whole system down. The plant, now completely offline. The other problem is that some of this equipment here it's very hard to replace. It's scarce. Some of this not even made anymore. What they are saying they're doing is turning to other power plants across the country to scavenge useful items. Repair work is going on all the time. But for many of the engineers here, part of their days are spent underground in bunkers, because you still get a lot of air raid siren alerts. This is still a target, and they are worried about it. Already, some of the easier to repair parts of the plant have been put back together new concrete columns here. The cruise missile landed right here, taking them out. But it raises the big question for the government now. 3can they repair at a faster rate than Russia is destroying? Thirty percent to 40 percent of the country's electricity generating capacity is down. The public have been told to expect blackouts. They've been told to keep their phones and power banks charged, not to use high energy appliances in their homes, particularly during peak hours of the evening. It is a real problem facing the government, a real pressure point that President Putin is putting on them right now -- Nic Robertson, CNN, at a power generating plant in Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

If you look at the number,which we do at IEA, we see that there is a major expansion of renewables around the world, in the western part of the world, but also in China, in India, in Southeast Asia. As a result, we see that the global emissions increase only a fraction of what they did last year. And the coal, there was expectation of the major growth of coal use. And there was only muted increase, less than 1 percent increase in coal use, mainly coming from China. But all in all, the news of the emissions this year is not extremely good but much better than many expected.",

We have, of course, negative impact on the economy, energy market, our lives, businesses and people. But at the same time, but I think many of us can be missing that the government responses to this energy crisis in terms of huge amount of money putting on the table to accelerate clean energy technologies is huge. Inflation Reduction Act from the United States, $US 400 billion in terms of tax incentives, in terms of subsidies for solar, wind, nuclear power, hydrogen, electric cars. In Europe, there is also a similar plan, which we call the REPowerEU. In Japan, in China, India, governments are putting real money on the table to accelerate the clean energy, not necessarily for environmental climate reasons but mainly for energy security reasons.
