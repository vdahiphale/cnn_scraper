But now the Starship team says it's a go. The rocket will take off from the coast of Boca Chica, Texas, and then it's going to fly partly around the world, to ultimately splashed down in the waters of Hawaii.

We're about 25 minutes or so away from the scheduled launch. But the weather continues to be a factor. We're told by a SpaceX official that the weather conditions are mostly favorable. We've had a lot of cloud cover here this morning. In fact, just withinthe last 20 to 30 minutes we've really started being able to get a clear glimpse of the rocket there on the launch pad. So, we are, as you mentioned, that window opens up about 8:30 Central Time, 9:30 Eastern. And so far everything is on track. But, remember, everything was on track on Monday about this time. And it was about six minutes or so before the scheduled launch that the launch was scrubbed because of a pressurization valves that had frozen somewhere in that rocket system. We haven't got much clearer indication of what exactly happened there over the last few days, but we are told SpaceX officials have been working on cleaning that up. But they've already put in the fuel. The propellant is inside the rocket system. They did that I think within the last hour. And that is about 10 million pounds of liquid methane and liquid oxygen inside that rocket system. And, remember, you know, as we've said over and over again, this is one of the most powerful -- the most powerful rocket ever built, 33 engines in that heavy booster, that lower part of that rocket system, which is about 230 feet long. The entire rocket is about 400. And, Kate, when this launches, it will take off and kind of go out toward the east, toward the - in the Gulf of Mexico. About three minutes into the launch, the booster will separate from the rocketing and continue traveling eastern. It will not make a complete orbit around the earth. It will come up short. It will splash down somewhere in the Pacific Ocean around Hawaii. And the entire mission should take about an hour and a half. But that is best case scenario. So, we'll see if this continues to play out. But so far, Kate, this morning, everything seems to be on track once again. And we'll see if that holds for the next 30 minutes or so.",

It's massive, standing at 394 feet when fully assembled. Look at that. That's more than 70 feet taller than NASA's Artemis 1 moon rocket system and nearly 90 feet taller than the Statue of Liberty. It's also incredibly powerful. You just heard Ed Lavandera say 33 engines will lift Starship off its launching pad in south Texas and generate 16 million pounds of thrust. The rocket that took NASA astronauts to the moon had only 7.6 million pounds of thrust. [09:05:00] Now, Starship can carry 150 metric tons of crew and cargo into space. That's close to 331,000 pounds. And it's not only huge, it's also designed to be fully reusable, which means that when it returns to earth, both the rocket and the spaceship have to land in one piece. Here's a look at an animation of what that would look like. For Elon Musk, Starship is the start of his dream to put humans on Mars. But Starship could do way more than that. It could change the way we travel here on earth. SpaceX claims that Starship could get you anywhere in the world -- look at that -- in an hour or less.

What's going on here? Is that actually fair or is he just trying to - to make us excited about this?O'BRIEN: Well, if you look at the history of this program, there have been a lot of mishaps or tests that went awry along the way. The SpaceX philosophy is to test frequently, rapidly, learn from the mistakes and move forward. This is a test that we are all paying a lot of attention to and so he's trying to prepare us for that idea that things could go awry. We're talking about 33 separate engines in the first stage. Making all of those fire in perfect synchronicity and just as they should, it's an awful lot of plumbing that has to go just perfectly for this to work, John. So, he is setting us up for the reality that when it comes to space, it's a cliche, but space is hard. BERMAN: How important is this for NASA in what are supposed to be the next steps in space exploration? O'BRIEN: We won't get human beings onto the surface of the moon without Starship. NASA has contracted with SpaceX to use the top portion of that rocket, the black portion, which is the Starship portion of this stack. It's actually two vehicles. A super heavy lift at the bottom and Starship at the top. But a modified version of that will carry NASA astronauts from a NASA craft, from the space launch system Orion capsule, to the surface of the moon. So, this is crucial. It's interesting, you know, Elon Musk started developing this -- he called it the BFR for big -- well, let's just say freaking rocket back in 2005 before he had a single successful launch. And he developed this out of his own pocket while he pursued the Falcon 1 all the way through to the Falcon 9. And along the way NASA started paying attention to this starship program and ultimately became a customer. So, it's interesting how SpaceX is now intertwined with NASA.",

We're starting to see that threat of severe weather extend further north. We've noticed from the Storm Prediction Center, they've included central portions of Illinois. So, as we start to see the daytime heating from the sun, we get to destabilize the atmosphere, we'll see the increase for severe weather. A small chance of tornadoes for these locations, including central Texas, but the greater threat here really damaging winds and very large hail. Just to summarize what Sarah mentioned, 15 tornado reports in the past 24 hours and hail over three inches falling from the sky. That's the size of a baseball. Here's the latest radar. Zooming in and I want to show you some of the stronger storms that were warned a few hours ago that rolled through Kansas City with gusts over 60 mph. Again, this is associated with the same storm system that brought the tornadoes to Oklahoma City yesterday evening. So, we know they have the capability of producing tornadoes. Now we need the ignition. And that, of course, is the sunshine when we start to destabilize and make that atmosphere a little bit more volatile. Here's the probability of tornadoes today.

Most immediately it's a decision from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. And that court handed down a ruling last week that did not fully side with the ruling that kicked off this legal chaos. The judge in Texas, who moved to block FDA approval of the drug. And Mifepristone, remember, has been FDA approved for 23 years. But the Fifth Circuit did agree to reimpose some restrictions on the pill, like preventing women from getting the drug after seven weeks of pregnancy, also now stopping access to the drug by mail and requiring in person doctor's visits before getting the medication.
