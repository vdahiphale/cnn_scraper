The eyes of the world on the Kremlin for day two of a high-stakes summit in Moscow that has just wrapped up with Russian President Vladimir Putin calling his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping successful. Today, the two leaders signing a joint declaration, deepening their partnership. And this summit obviously comes at a critical time for the war in Ukraine. There are strong indications now that Russia and China are moving closer, both economically and militarily.",

      "sentences": "Well, you know, there was a line from Vladimir Putin as they were signing these documents, deepening their partnership that really summed up the reason why these two are getting together. Why Xi Jinping, the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao, picked a guy that is, you know, potentially facing war crimes trial at some point down the road? He's a global pariah, heavily sanctioned by the West. And Xi Jinping is taking a lot of heat from the West for his support, his no-limits partnership of Vladimir Putin, which was announced even before the war began and is now strengthening through the war.I mean, China has been you know, bolstering Russia's economy, protecting them in many ways from the impact of sanctions by buying Russian oil, by selling things that are sanctioned by the West, including high-tech microchips. They've been selling parts that can be used for military purposes. Whether they're going to take that to the next level and give them ammunition or military equipment has yet to be seen. And it certainly wouldn't be a big announcement about that. But the reason why Xi is favoring Putin is because these guys have the same ideology. And they believe that the U.S. world order that has been in place since the end of World War Two more than 70 years, should be disrupted. They think that their system, their autocratic system is superior, that they are what the world needs moving forward in the future, and so they're banding together. China making Russia more stable and counting on Russia's support if China decides to make similar moves down the road, for example, here on this self-ruled democracy of Taiwan. So, listen to Vladimir Putin specifically talking about this. Talking about his opposition to countries that interfere with what his country wants. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And we learned that in addition to the fact that the Pentagon is likely to announce today that they're going to speed up that delivery of Abrams tanks to Ukraine, we're also learning that the Patriot training, that air defense training, you can actually see a decommissioned one right behind me here. That is also going to be sped up because the Ukrainians were just so proficient, according to the U.S. defense officials that we spoke to here at learning this system that they were able to train them in a much shorter period of time than they had anticipated.Just a lot has really gone into the last 10 weeks of training here of roughly 65 Ukrainian soldiers that came all the way from Ukraine to this base here in Oklahoma to train. And then the ages we should note, of the soldiers that have been training with the U.S. military trainers here. They range in age from 19 to 67. So, a really wide range here. But the bottom line is that the U.S. now is going to be sending these patriots in the next few weeks into Ukraine just after these Ukrainian soldiers that have been here at Fort Sill go to Europe to wrap up their training. They're going to be sent back into Ukraine with two Patriot systems. One of those will be U.S. provided and one of them will be provided jointly by Germany and the Netherlands. So, the U.S. clearly trying to get the Ukrainians in a good position to launch that anticipated spring counteroffensive with these heavy Western weapons that they have promised to the Ukrainians that the Ukrainians were frankly, a -- fearful that they would not get in time to launch that counter-offensive and eject the Russians from their territory. Now, it seems the U.S. is really making a concerted effort to send not only the Abrams tanks, which are very complicated systems but also the Patriots, which are also very complicated. It typically takes several months to learn on. But they believe that the Ukrainians have proven so proficient at learning these systems that they can send them a lot sooner, Boris.",

For example, this is -- you know, we know that it's a no-limits partnership. And today, they said it is the highest ever level of that.So, there's a lot of hyperbole. But I think if you look at what's happening, Xi comes to Moscow for a number of different reasons, primarily economic, China needs oil and needs gas. And you know, in a sense, you could say has, that's a terrible pun, but it has -- they have Putin over a barrel because Putin needs to sell that oil and gas, as the markets in Europe are drying up. So, Russia has been selling that crucial -- those crucial combat commodities but at a discount. So, I think China comes, presents the peace plan, Xi, as you've said, does want to look like the peacekeeper. And in fairness, they just brokered an agreement, a reestablishment of relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran. So, there are a lot of moving parts internationally. That's why I think this visit by the Japanese Prime Minister is very, very interesting. But I do think in the end, pretty much the meeting is about economics, and words, but not very specific words about Ukraine and any possible settlement.",

China is very much dependent on external sources of energy, and nothing better than to secure your supplies in three different areas, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Russia. So, the Chinese are very much looking at the Russians as a major source of not only energy but also other natural resources. And with that, you know, you've got the possibility of China being able to if it needs to, at some point, isolate itself from the rest of the world.Even though their trade volume with the United States, for example, is higher than it is with Russia currently, it still becomes very important for the Chinese to have that safety valve, should they try to do something with Taiwan, and should they further support the Russians in the combat in Ukraine.",

But the basic idea is that the Chinese want to keep the Russians involved in Ukraine.It gives them a way to put the Russians in a certain area. It also makes the Russians a bit of a junior partner because what we've seen is the weakness of the Russian military. And it also frees the Chinese to potentially do things in Taiwan.

And they are allowed to make these requests particularly when a defendant is likely to be indicted.Prosecutors granted this request. Costello was before the grand jury yesterday, where again, his role was to discuss Michael Cohen's credibility because Cohen is the witness at the center of all of this. And Costello previously was a legal adviser to Cohen. So, he went before the grand jury and said that during his conversations with Cohen back in 2018 when federal investigators were looking into this hush-money scheme, Cohen told him he says that the hush-money was his idea. And, of course, that contradicts subsequent statements that Cohen has made about this probe. Now, as I said, after his testimony, Costello answered questions from reporters.

This guy by any prosecutor standard and I used to be deputy chief of the criminal division in the Southern District of New York, I wouldn't have touched the guy like Michael Cohen, especially if he's a convicted perjurer.
