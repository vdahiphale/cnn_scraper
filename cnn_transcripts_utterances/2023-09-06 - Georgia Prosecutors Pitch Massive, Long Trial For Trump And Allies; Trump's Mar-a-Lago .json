It is shaping up to be one of the biggest criminal trials in American history, literally. Today was the very first televised hearing in that Georgia case against Donald Trump and 18 of his allies. District Attorney Fani Willis and her team revealed three big things about the election interference charges. First, they want to charge and try all 19 co-defendants together. Second, this trial could last four months. And third, they'll call more than 150 different witnesses. That means that the former president of the United States could spend a third of the next year sitting in a courtroom in just one of his cases while running for a second term. It is just extraordinary. And we are getting a preview of the tensions to come. Two of those co- defendants, Trump's legal adviser Sidney Powell and the so called architect of the coup plot, Kenneth Cheseboro, they want their trials to be separated, even though, through their lawyers today, started pointing the finger at each other, essentially over who's less crazy.

I think that's virtually impossible to do. I do think there's going to be a lot of pretrial motions. You have 150 witnesses. You're going to have a lot of motions relating to evidentiary issues, a lot of motions to dismiss. And, quite frankly, as clean as Jack Smith's case was, this one is just a mess in terms of trying to manage it from the judge's perspective. Sure, there have been cases around the country that all the defendants in that number have been tried before for, but I don't think it's likely to happen in this case, given all the complex issues.

It also has law that says that citizens can go to court to challenge a candidate who's not qualified. So, it has a procedure built in. It's a quick procedure.

This isn't a criminal punishment. It's a qualification. It's like the Constitution says, you got to be at least 35 to run for president and you can go to court. And if a 23-year-old runs for president, you can go to court and say that this person is not constitutionally qualified. You have to establish with evidence that they're in fact 23 years old, not 35. And if you do, they're off of the ballot. It's the same thing here. Obviously, the substance is much more serious. But if we can go to court and it's a civil trial, you proved by preponderance of the evidence that there was an insurrection, that this person in this case, Donald Trump, engaged in that insurrection, and we did that in the case of Couy Griffin in New Mexico, totally apart from his misdemeanor conviction, and in that case, a judge ruled that he was disqualified.

It's really actually quite different. And I will say because, frankly, you can prove from a factual perspective how old a person is.

And in this case, whether you look at what the House select committee on January 6th found or what conservative scholars, Professors Bowd and Paulson (ph), very prominent conservative scholars, wrote a major piece about this. A lot of people across the political spectrum are looking at this, and they're saying the law and the facts are actually very clear here. Now, it is true that certainly one line of criticism is, shouldn't the American people get to vote. And one of the rejoinders to that is that's what happened in 2020. The American people got to decide whether they wanted to vote for Donald Trump. They didn't vote for him. He refused to accept the result of that election and actually, ultimately incited a violent attack. There's no particular reason to believe that the result would be different this time.

It's not a court that has, in any sense, seemed to want to condone the kind of insurrectionist activity we saw after the 2020 election.

Now, is this a major issue in the grand scheme of things? No. I mean, this is a gun charge as you mentioned. It is a charge based on the fact that he signed a form when he bought a gun saying that he was not under the influence of drugs and he -- that was not true. He was taking drugs. He was now very open about the fact that he was addicted to crack cocaine.

He's arguing that Biden is in a better position than most people realize. But first of all, the polls say otherwise. And, Dana, I know you and I both remember in 2016 when other Obama alums were basically making the same argument about Trump.

Just look at this video of convicted murderer Danelo Cavalcante crab-walking between two walls at Chester County, Pennsylvania.

But he was captured within a few minutes of his escape. He's -- Cavalcante has been on the run now for a full week.Joining me now is Kevin Mulverhill. He was the sheriff in Franklin County, New York, when two convicted murderers escaped from prison there in 2015. They had help from a former prison employee who was enamored with the men. She smuggled weapons in to help break them out. One of the inmates was recaptured. The other was killed in a shootout with police. Now, Kevin, the prison warden here in Pennsylvania is calling this basically a failure on the human side. What do you see when you watch that video? KEVIN MULVERHILLE, FORMER FRANKLIN COUNTY, NY SHERIFF:  Well, Abby, I think it just goes to show that inmates, just because they're in jail, doesn't mean they're not an intelligent person, doesn't mean they lack initiative or the fortitude. And this is obviously a man who does not want to be incarcerated. And he would do anything to get out. I mean, it's almost ninja-like.

They claim that she did these things to secure for herself a book deal and media appearances that would not happen in the event of a mistrial.She co-authored that book with my next guest. It's called \"Behind the Doors of Justice: The Murdaugh Murders\". Hill is not responding to these allegations, but my next guest, Neil Gordon, is. Neil, thanks for being here. I want to first get you just to respond here to some of these allegations. One of the jurors says that Hill instructed the jury to, quote, \"watch Murdaugh closely and to look at his actions and movement\". That juror says they interpreted those instructions to mean that Murdaugh was guilty. Did she say that? NEIL GORDON, CO-AUTHOR \"BEHIND THE DOORS OF JUSTICE: THE MURDAUGH MURDERS\":  Not to me. We spent four months together working on the book and I asked her many, many questions about all of her duties which included working with the jury, with the judge, with the witnesses with the media with the public and we went through just a litany of questions and nothing like that ever came up whatsoever.
