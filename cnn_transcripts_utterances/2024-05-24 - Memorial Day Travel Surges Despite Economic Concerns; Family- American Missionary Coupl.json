They're worried about the economy. We've talked seven different passengers about the amount of money they are willing to spend. The lowest amount so far has been about $2,000.

And I think what the campaign can do is connect the dots as to why you have more money, but why are things more expensive?And a lot of that has to do and the president has said around corporate greed, corporations raising their cost, even though they're still making money. One of the people in the segments said, find me of businesses they're not making money and I'll tell you that they're lying. Its because they're charging people more than they need to just so they can increase their profit margins, maybe because of what happened during COVID, but also because they just want to make more money on the American people's back.",

Now, when it comes to actual preparation, it looks very different. The Biden campaign telling our colleague Isaac Dovere that they were going to plan extensive preparation, that might even include some sequestered time at a place like Camp David. They are going to be grilling him. They are going to be doing that kind of traditional preparation for a debate. On the Trump side, they haven't even had any formal conversations about that.

In a complaint filed Thursday in New York, April Lampros says that Combs assaulted her four times between the mid '90s and early 2000s. This follows just one week after a CNN obtained surveillance video showing a violent altercation between Diddy and is then girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, that was back in 2016.One of the eight lawsuits was filed by Ventura. It was settled late last year. CNN's Elizabeth Wagmeister reports on all of the allegations of abuse piling up against Combs. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELIZABETH WAGMEISTER, CNN ENTERTAINMENT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The legal fallout continues for Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, just a week after CNN uncovered this disturbing video of the music mogul, throwing then- girlfriend Cassie Ventura to the ground, then kicking in, dragging her. On Thursday, April Lampros filed a civil law lawsuit accusing Combs of sexual assault when she was a fashion student in New York in 1994, sharing with him her dreams of working in the fashion industry. Then Mr. Combs love-bombed her, the suit alleges, using flowers and cards like this one, and inviting her to his first Father's Day celebration. But Combs is kind gestures became more aggressive, the suit alleges, leading to a total of four separate sexual assault. The first and alleged rape in 1995, leaving Lampros nude, sore, and confused. She claims that Combs used his power in the industry to regain her trust. But then in a New York parking garage, forced Lampros to perform oral sex as Ms. Lampros' eyes filled with tears, she could see the parking garage attendant witnessing this horrific assault, the suit claims. Lampros says she was caught in an abusive relationship in tried to end it after several years, but after running into Combs at an event, he pursued her and in late 2000s at her apartment, Combs violently grabbed her and forced himself onto her, kissing and touching her against her will. All this the suit notes, while Combs was in a public relationship with Jennifer Lopez. Combs develop this mobster persona, the suit claims, at one point violently yanking her down to her knees in pulling her hair. The alleged abuse similar to this, when Combs was caught on hotel surveillance in 2016, kicking and dragging Cassie Ventura, then throwing a vase at her. Cassie made her first public statements since the videos released this week, writing: Domestic violence is the issue. It broke me down to someone I never thought I would become.

Turning now to our sports lead, if you are a college student athlete in a major conference, you could soon be making some serious money. The NCAA and five power conferences, which are the ACC, the Big Ten, Big 12, Pack 12, and the SEC have all agreed to settle three antitrust lawsuits, which has paved the way for colleges to start paying student athletes for the very first time. According to ESPN, over ten years, more than $2.7 billion will be split among more than 10,000 current and former athletes dating back to 2016. And each college can share about $20 million with its athletes per year. But all this still needs to be approved by a judge and possibly then Congress. To discuss all this, I want to bring in lead attorney on this historic deal, Jeffrey Kessler. Jeffrey, thank you so much for joining us. First on this $2.7 billion to be paid out going back to 2016. So, you have thousands of athletes. So how are they going to divvy up that amount given the popularity of some sports and the popularity of certain athletes? JEFFREY KESSLER, LEAD ATTORNEY, HOUSE V. NCAA: So, we use the experts to come up with an allocation formula that will affect what we believe would be the recovery of the athletes, and that will be employed to distribute this money.",

It's coming from this season enormous revenue part that the schools currently use to do things like pay their athletic directors $4 million a year or pay their strength and conditioning coach at some schools a million dollars a year.

That is very much not how the court appears to see things, however, as they repeatedly brought up the warnings from humanitarian aid officials for months now about the impact that this Israeli really military offensive in Rafah could have, and the one that it is indeed having right now.So, there's no expectation that this will have any impact on the ground in Rafah in terms of how the Israeli military is carrying forward this offensive. But this is just the latest example of the way in which especially over the last month, we have watched extraordinary condemnation of Israel's actions in Gaza, growing isolation on the world stage, when you look at President Biden threatening to withhold weapons to Israel if it carries out an all-out offensive in central Rafah, when you look at just earlier this week, the ICC's top prosecutor requesting arrest warrants for Netanyahu. So, it's all part of the same picture and one that could have consequences for Israel long term.
