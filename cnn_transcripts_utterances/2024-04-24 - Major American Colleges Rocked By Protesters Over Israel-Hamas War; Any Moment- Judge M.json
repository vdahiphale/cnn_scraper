This is -- it looks like -- again, these are live pictures coming in, so we're interpreting them as they happen. We understand that students were set to demonstrate a pro-Palestinian protest of March. And as they arrived on scene, law enforcement was there in large numbers. We've heard reports of multiple arrests. This just one of many scenes that have been playing out in collegesall over the country. Protests brought about over the Israel-Hamas war. In the next hour, House Speaker Mike Johnson is going to speak from Columbia University in New York City, calling on that school's president to resign.",

We've heard over 100 students here right now gathered, singing, chanting from Columbia to Brown. We will not let Gaza down.And I do also want to point out this building right here. That is the administrative building. So they could see from these windows as this encampment continues to grow here, those chants as well. And from some of the organizers that we've spoken to, they have two big demands, and that is for the university to divest and break apart any ties to any companies dealing with the Israeli government. And the second is for them to drop charges against 41 students who were arrested back in December for a sit-in. I do also want to play for you now a video we took here in the last hour showing these students gathered in a circle. And you can see university police accompanying school, a school employee, and they have a machine and they're scanning IDs one by one by one, scanning IDs. These students do face disciplinary action. I spoke with organizers just a couple of hours ago, one of which is a Jewish student. Here's what they had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We understand that there were several arrests there. You can see that demonstrators are face-to-face with police. Who apparently responded to a demonstration on campus.There's pushing and shoving. And this echoes what we've seen in many campuses across the country. This afternoon at the University of Texas at Austin. In earlier days at NYU, at Columbia University as well. It's part of the reason that a congressional delegation including House Speaker Mike Johnson are headed up to Columbia University this afternoon to make a statement. Specifically about the anti-Semitism that has been present at some of these demonstrations. We're going to keep an eye on the situation. Not only at USC but across campuses across the country, and bring you the latest as we get it. We should note that at any moment, the judge that's overseeing Donald Trump's hush money trial, could rule on whether the former president violated a court-imposed gag order. In a heated hearing yesterday, prosecutors argued that Trump violated the order by attacking witnesses and jurors multiple times on social media. Now after the gag order hearing. Trump's longtime friend and former \"National Enquirer\" publisher David Pecker testified about a 2015 Trump Tower meeting with both Trump and his former attorney Michael Cohen, where Pecker agreed to run positive stories about Trump and run negative stories about his political rivals. Joining us now to discuss his former Trump White House lawyer and CNN Legal Commentator Jim Schultz. Jim thanks so much for being with us. Let's start where we left off in court yesterday. And what we're set to pick up tomorrow. And that's testimony from David Pecker. Prosecutors zeroed in on questions about the arrangement between Trump and the publisher and the intent behind it, partly because their case relies on making a clear argument to the jury that Pecker tried to help Trump for political purposes, not personal ones. That gets to the core of the alleged conspiracy. I'm wondering how well you think prosecutors did in illustrating that for the jury?",

There were speakers, they -- there were people who had picked tents on a small portion of a quadrangle, and then public safety officers from USC moved in to try to remove those tents, and it very quickly got very ugly.Those officers were surrounded by protesters swearing at them, cheering them. It then became physical with pushing and shoving between those public safety officers and the protesters. So right now the situation is -- one person has been arrested. He is currently in a squad car which is being surrounded by protesters who will not let that squad car leave. Meanwhile, on the park where the tents were, where they were told to move the tents, those protesters are now marching, carrying their tents. So they are not breaking any university ordinance by having tents pitch. That is what's going on right now. It is very tense, as I say, it got very tense, very, very fast. Back to you guys.",
