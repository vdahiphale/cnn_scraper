But if you're a real estate agent, the new rules could mean your commission takes a huge cut. CNN business writer, Samantha Delouya, is here with us. Samantha, you described this as a seismic shift. I know certainly realtors are feeling that and they're very apprehensive about this. Explain the changes.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Brianna. So basically, some big changes are coming to the way that buyers and sellers basically transact in the U.S.This rule change affects 1.5 million real estate professionals. who are members of the powerful trade association, the National Association of Realtors. These rules are kind of designed to shake up that traditional 5 percent or 6 percent commission that was usually paid out by a home seller when their home was sold. So that meant that if you sold a million-dollar home, you could be on the hook to pay about $60,000 in commission payments. Those payments were usually split between the agent that represented the seller and the agent of represented the buyer. But these new rules are designed to kind of shake that up. And they go into effect on August 17th. The first rule prohibits offers of buyer compensation or buyer agent compensation to be advertised on the centralized databases that realtors used to look up listings. The second rule affects the relationship between a home buyer and their real estate agent. It requires homebuyers basically to sign a legally binding representation agreement before even going to tour a house with their representation. Now, these changes, it remains to be seen what's actually going to come of them and how this is actually going to affect transactions. But many experts say that this could ultimately lower the cost that home buyers and sellers pay when they transact. And it's unclear, basically, what's going to happen, but it could be the biggest change in a generation. At least that's what experts are saying -- Brianna?",

But ultimately, you know, some say that they don't think that changes are going to affect them that much at all. I spoke to one of the CEOs of the biggest brokerages in America, and he said, you know, this is basically, Brianna, going to be a grand experiment and it remains to be seen.",

Her headquarters responding to that accusation by calling out the former president for not campaigning in a swing state in over a week. Which I think is interesting, too, to keep seeing how they're responding to his attacks like this. They're not getting down with him going tit for tat. They bring it back to people and also to what he's doing in his spare time. But more broadly, Margaret, what does it say to you that someone who is running for president, who has been president, continues to traffic in these conspiracy theories?",

Because what we've seen coming out of the weekend is new polling, including that \"New York Times\"/Sienna poll that does show Harris -- Vice President Harris overtaking former President Trump.Not just nationally, but in three really crucial states -- crucial battleground states. Michigan -- (AUDIO PROBLEM) -- august. Yes, the election is not until November but that suggests a changing of the graph (AUDIO PROBLEM) -- found strategy versus discipline. It certainly is the strategy. But there are many Republicans who are telling the former president, either behind closed doors or in public settings, that he should set a more focused and disciplined strategy on going after areas where she is it has been weakest, including the border and the economy. One of the emerging challenges for him seems to be, in this most recent polling, that even on the economy, President Biden's decision not to seek reelection and her ascent as the Democratic nominee, has given a bit of a fresh start or a reset button to the Democratic ticket. And there are now voters who are more confident that she has the ability to both tackle the economy and sort of be honest or be a change or be reliable. He's needing to shake up his whole playbook. And so he's going back to some of the things that worked in 2016. The landscape has changed dramatically since 2016, including who votes. So this is obviously a period of a trial and error for the former president. He's back on Twitter. That definitely tells you something as well. And we're going to see his efforts with X and this Elon Musk interview to try to shake up a narrative that has turned against him in recent weeks.",

It is interesting those put out polls that Margaret notes, she doesn't seem to be getting tied to what Biden was on the economy. A poll, though, still finding that Americans trust Trump over Harris to handle the economy. But you see it's not a huge split there. What -- what do you make of all of this? I mean, we saw her adopt. We don't know much about her economic policy yet. We just heard over the weekend say she's on board with not taxing tips. But what do you expect to hear from her and what do you think can be effective in convincing some of these Americans who might be skeptical that she can handle the economy?",

The earlier the child's tablet use, the higher number of expressions of anger and frustration after one year.Also a child's proneness to anger and frustration at age 4.5 was associated with more use of tablets by age 5.5. Dr. Scott Hadland is a pediatrician at Mass General for Children. Doctor, thanks so much for being here with us. This is the interesting stuff. What's your take on this study? DR. SCOTT HADLAND, PEDIATRICIAN, MASS GENERAL FOR CHILDREN: Yes, thanks so much for having me. I was really fascinated by the study. I think it's really important and impactful because it showed kind of that cycle that you just described. The fact that you know, more tablet use when you're younger, a year later, when you're 4, leads to just these issues with anger and frustration, which then feeds into, when you're 5, more issues looking at tablets all the time. And so it seems like there is kind of this cycle that's going on that we really need to try to break.",

Is what's not happening when a child is in front of a tablet.And I'm not just a pediatrician, I'm also a dad and I'm a parent of a 6-year-old and a 3-year-old. And so I understand how hard it can be when your child is having frustrations, when they're angry. And it's really easy to hand them a screen, right, to put them in front of a movie, to hand them an iPad, give them your phone as a way to kind of distract them, right? But when that is happening, your child is not learning the right way to deal with their frustrations. And so they're sort of being soothed by-- by a device. And we really want them to learn healthier coping skills. I guess the other thing I would say is that we're now coming up on many years of research where they're showing that the more time that children spend in front of screens, the more at risk they are of having changes to their brain development, right? And so we also can't rule out that one thing that we might be seeing in this study is that the tablets themselves are sort of changing brain development in children in a way that's showing up in their emotions.",

Well, again, when you're -- when you're in front of a tablet, you're not really learning the right way to take on life's frustrations, right?So a healthy way, when you're frustrated as a child to cope, is to seek comfort from a parent or to find a book or a toy to play with. And I think that tablets really just sort of give this -- this very easy sort of escape for families. And so, you know, it's no surprise then that we, as pediatricians, always recommend that, for as long as possible, parents are delaying the first time that they're introducing tablets and other screens to children. Because we're really trying to push back the age at which kids start to turn to tablets as a way to be distracted. And even then, we want to try to minimize as much as possible the amount of time that kids are spending with tablets. So we really say you know -- and I think these are actually kind of high limits -- that when a child is -- it's a work week for a child, sort of Monday to Friday, that they should be spending no more than an hour in front of a tablet or other screens. And then on the weekends, no more than three hours. I try for less than this as a parent. It's really tough to do. But I think it's really important to do.",
