CNN's Chloe Melas is behind this new exclusive reporting. And multiple sources, Chloe, I understand, are telling you that Ye's last album, he wanted to actually call \"Hitler\"?",

So, what we know from somebody who was part of West's camp at the time who was in that room, that Kanye did indeed -- they back up what Van was saying, that Kanye did indeed praise Hitler and say these things.

CNN royal commentator Emily Nash is joining us now. And, Emily, Harry's publisher promises raw, unflinching honesty, that this book is full of insight. You have interviewed Harry a number of times, I know. Compared to other members of the royal family, how candid do you find him to be?",

If you interviewed him, you would ask him a question, and he would open up and tell you a lot. And this opportunity, I think, is going to be one for him to really get across his side of events, his side of the story, the story that we all think that we know, I think he is not going to hold back.",

And we all projected our own ideas onto that, our own empathy, our sympathy for them, and wondered how they were going to recover from that. And we are now going to hear from one of those young boys who's now a grown man just about how it was for him. And he's talked about his life in the public spotlight as being a mix of \"The Truman Show\" and being in a zoo. I think it's going to be very interesting to see how he explains what was going on behind the scenes.",

Now that his father is king, things do change, but, actually, their relationship, maybe not. And I don't know if there is any truth in the various reports that he's gone back and asked for edits in recent months. But it's no secret that this is going to be a very challenging moment for the king so early in his reign.",

Let's start with the very latest, Justice Elena Kagan ruling to temporarily block a subpoena from the January 6 Committee for the cell phone records of Arizona's Republican Party leader. Kelli Ward served as a fake elector for Donald Trump and spoke with him about the election certification. Meantime, just a few days ago, Justice Clarence Thomas temporarily froze an order for Senator Lindsey Graham to testify before a Georgia grand jury probing efforts to overturn results there. CNN Supreme Court reporter Ariane de Vogue joins us now. Ariane, explain why Justice Kagan blocked the cell phone record subpoena.",

      "sentences": "Right.So that case involves a district attorney out of Fulton County, Georgia, looking again into election results, particularly phone calls that Lindsey Graham made. Some people have interpreted those phone calls as being problematic for Lindsey Graham. A lower court said he actually had to testify, but he didn't have to testify about anything having to do with his job as a senator, for instance, anything having to do with certification of votes, right, or his role on the Senate subcommittee. But the district court and the appeals court said he would have to sit for testimony for anything having to do with, say, communications that weren't -- where he's not protected because he's not talking in his official capacity. The court said, exactly, communications and coordination with the Trump campaign regarding post-election efforts. Now, Graham says he doesn't have to answer any questions, the Constitution protects him under the speech or debate clause. And now that has gone to the Supreme Court. And it went to Clarence Thomas, who has jurisdiction. But, again, his -- Clarence Thomas did issue this temporary stay, but just like what Kagan did, it's really meant just to get the justices, give them time to get read in here. So it's too soon to see how the justices will rule on the merits. But, Ana, what's interesting here is, the Supreme Court, currently made up of six Republican appointees, three Democratic appointees, they keep being called political by some members of the public, and they keep having to answer and get into these political cases. And it's just not where they want to be, Ana.",

Also found recently, sunken boats, a World War II era landing craft and very, very ancient volcanic rock. OK, did you get a flu shot yet? New data from the CDC shows that this year's flu vaccine could reduce your risk of hospitalization by nearly half. And this flu season is expected to be a bad one.

So, researchers looked at data in the country of Chile and found that, during flu season there, vaccine effectiveness was 49 percent against flu-associated hospitalization, which suggests that getting your flu shot can reduce your risk of being hospitalized with flu by 49 percent. And, also, they found, Ana, that during the flu season earlier this year, they saw flu circulating months before expected, and that's similar to how here in the U.S. we're seeing a lot of respiratory activity. And it's not even November. We haven't even entered winter season yet. And, because of that, some experts say things could get much worse. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. NIPUNIE RAJAPAKSE, MAYO CLINIC:  So, unfortunately, I do think, with the upcoming colder weather, with holidays and people gathering more, and with the removal of some of the preventative measures that we have been using over the last couple of years, like masking, I think this is going to get worse before it starts to get better, unfortunately.
