Ukrainian ambassador to the United States raising questions about whether it was staged. She's OUTFRONT. And TikTok, its parent company spying on American journalists. This is according to my guest, who is one of the two reporters targeted. What could this mean for the 100 million Americans on TikTok? Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, a game changer, it is the 11th hour. And at this moment, former President Trump's team chose to call up a witness to testify before the Manhattan grand jury investigating the hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels. Now, the hope is that this witness could save Trump from being the first former president in United States history to be indicted. So who is this person this witness? Well, his name is Robert Costello. You see him right there today. He was a one-time legal adviser to Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen. Cohen, of course, is the key witness in New York's case against Trump. Costello today met with the grand jury for three hours and then emerged to tell reporters why he testified. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, the payment itself, it's important to say here, is not illegal.What matters here is whether it was improperly classified or not. Trump's hope is that Costello could turn around an impending indictment and get Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney who's remained tightlipped about the details about this investigation, to back off. So, did Costello deliver for Trump? Well, tonight, the entire nation needs to know, the entire nation is on edge and waiting, as Trump stands by claims he's hours away now from being arrested. He is now calling on his supporters to protest. In New York, police setting up security cameras and barricades in Washington. Officials tell CNN they are preparing for demonstrations that could erupt if Trump is indicted on these charges. Twelve agencies now currently on standby.

The decision to proceed in this case was initially in the hands of the United States attorney's office for the Southern District. They made a very clear they were not going to proceed with this, based on a foundation that was Cohen because of his lack of credibility.They abandoned it and went to Bragg's predecessor, Vance. He looked hard at it, he concluded it was pointless. He consulted with a number of outside experts in addition to people internally. Mark Pomerantz, one of the attorneys who was working on the Trump investigation for Vance and later for Bragg, you know, demeaned this particular case, the Cohen case severely in his book and statements, while explaining he thought the better case was and the financial improprieties. So, almost everybody who has looked at, it except Alvin Bragg, has decided that it doesn't pass the smell test, particularly because it rests so heavily on Cohen. And at the end of the day, I think everybody understands that these particular charges, contrived as they may be, they would not be brought against any American not named Donald Trump.

So I'm curious, Emily, as to your point of view on what we are hearing now, which is President Biden wants TikTok to be spun off into its own company. And that would theoretically separate it from ByteDance. But is there anything to that? I mean, it seems like these companies essentially operate as one company regardless of whatever their former corporate structure will be. BAKER-WHITE:  So that's definitely what our reporting has shown over the past year. So I've talked to a lot of employees at both TikTok and ByteDance who describe them internally as really one in the same. And I think that's part of the reason why the Biden administration is skeptical that TikTok can operate independently from ByteDance while ByteDance still owns it. And that's been the question as the Biden administration has been negotiating with TikTok. TikTok has been arguing, we can put in place all sorts of data management systems that will limit foreign access to U.S. user data. And the question has been, can they do that in a way that's satisfactory if ByteDance is still owning and controlling TikTok. And it seems like the Biden administration has decided in recent weeks that the answer to that question is no.",
