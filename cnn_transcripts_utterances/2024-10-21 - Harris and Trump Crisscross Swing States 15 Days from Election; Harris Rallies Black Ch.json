She has said that when she was younger, she worked the French fry machine at McDonald's. Donald Trump has said that that's simply not true. He has absolutely no evidence of that, but he has continued to hammer that point almost to a point of obsession. And, of course, he did it again when he was in McDonald's over the weekend at this franchise in Pennsylvania. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Democrats, they said that it was silly. We heard some Democrats saying that he was making fun of McDonald's workers. But, again, we live in such a polarizing time that it really depends on where you stand.Now, one thing I do want to note, as you noted, I am here in North Carolina, a state that is considered a critical battleground state and one that when Joe Biden was at the top of the ticket, Donald Trump and Republicans felt like was in the bag. I will let you decide or let our viewers decide how they feel now, given that they have two events, two days of events in North Carolina, this close to the election.

      "sentences": "Well, one thing I think is very interesting when you hear Danny talking now is this idea of Harris trying to reach out to these moderate women voters, particularly suburban women voters. One of the things that Donald Trump's team seems to really have realized in the last several weeks is that this gender gap is real. It's not just real for Donald Trump. It's real for Republicans across the board, and they're trying to make up for it in any way that they possibly can.Now, here in North Carolina, what I would expect for us to see from him is, one, he is going to an area that was hit by Hurricane Helene. As we know, he is again, without evidence, claimed that FEMA is not helping. He has said that there is no federal response in these areas, something that we know not to be true from the people that are actually on the ground, but expect him to be talking about that. Then he is going to potentially take questions there. Then he's going to a faith event here where we are in Concord, which is just outside of Charlotte. Again, when you talk about these faith events, we know Donald Trump himself is not a particularly religious man, but they are trying to reach the suburban voters, particularly the suburban women voters by trying to soften his image. Now, whether or not that works by attending an event here when over the weekend he was talking about Arnold Palmer's genitalia during a rally there, it really doesn't make the gap, doesn't close the gap when it comes to women voters. But one of the things they're really going to try to do in these last final weeks is, one, try to reach those women suburban voters and to try to also reach those low propensity voters, people who don't usually engage with politics in a traditional way, and drive them to the polls in November, trying to make sure they actually cast a ballot when they head to those polls.",

It's good to have you with us this morning, Mr. Mayor.I know you were out campaigning for Kamala Harris at churches in Detroit yesterday. I saw some of those photos you posted on social media. You know, as the vice president points out, every vote matters, right? It's not just about breaking it down by demographic, but there is some real concern within the Democratic Party about slipping support Kamala Harris. How concerning is it to you? MAYOR BRANDON JOHNSON (D-CHICAGO, IL):  Well, first of all, good morning. And the vice president, Kamala Harris, has earned my vote as a black man, and she has earned the vote and support of black men across this country. One thing that I know for sure as a black man is that we always recognize our responsibility and role in this democracy, providing, preparing and protecting. And that's really what this moment is about, is about providing real opportunities for black men, but all Americans to have a right to health care, mental health care, good paying jobs, protecting our democracy, right? You know, we're talking about the former president, who made it very clear, if you vote for him, you don't ever have to vote ever again. As a black man, you don't have to dog whistle. I know exactly what he's saying. And then, of course, the ultimate desire provide or protect as well as prepare, we have to prepare the next generation of workers. Look, the Inflation Reduction Act, we're talking about billions of dollars to transform our infrastructure, particularly green in the blue economy, something I'm doing here in Chicago, where we have reinstituted the Department of the Environment, $20 billion of new investment since I've been mayor. What Vice President Kamala Harris essentially had done, she's already laid the groundwork to create opportunities for black men to actually rebuild this country. And she has a partner in Chicago. She has partners across this country that recognize that when we fight for the things that we want, we win them.",

When our country -- when we were in the Great Depression -- you know, I'm a social studies teacher, just like Governor Tim Walz, and that should be another note, we have to elect more social studies teachers. There, I said it. But during the Great Depression, unemployment for white men was 30 percent and our country called it a national crisis. And white men received shovels before there were things to dig. They received education support, housing support.Black men are simply saying that we are Great Depression era level of crisis, and we need real investments. Yes, that frustration is real, but you're not going to get it through a president who's made it very clear that he has no interest in supporting our agenda. That's why Vice President Kamala Harris, Governor Walz, social studies teachers, like myself, are the best pathway to give black men shovel so that they can dig stuff, give black men an opportunity to actually own homes and give black men an opportunity to start their own businesses. That's what this moment is about. That's why the only choice is Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walz.",

And it is Kamala Harris still leads among black voters, but it's the trend that is so worrisome, right? You go back to Obama in 2012, he won it by 90, then Hillary Clinton, 85, Biden, 81. Look at what Kamala Harris is today. She's down 15 points from where Biden was just four years ago, and she's down, get this, 24 points from where Obama was 12 years ago. So, look, Kamala Harris is ahead but the margin is shrinking among a core Democratic group.Now, you know, you were talking about black men, but let's start off with black women here because I think it gets rather interesting here. The Democratic presidential margin among black women, look. Obama won them by 93. Clinton won them by 93. Biden allowed a little bit to 85. Look what Kamala Harris is right now. This isn't just about black men. It's about black women as well. She's only up by 71 points among black women, which, again, is a rather large lead, but given the history of how black women have voted in this country in the last few elections, it's significantly smaller. Now, let's get into black men a little bit, all right? Let's get into black men. What do we see here? The Democratic margin among black men, again, we see the shrinkage. Again, Kamala Harris is ahead by 54, but that's way down from where Joe Biden was four years ago, 69 points, 71 for Clinton, way down from Obama, that 85 point margin. And how about young black men? Look at this, Kamala Harris up only 41 points among black men under the age of 45. That is down 12 points from where Biden was four years ago, but way down. We're talking about half of the margin that we were looking at back with Obama in 2012, Erica.",
