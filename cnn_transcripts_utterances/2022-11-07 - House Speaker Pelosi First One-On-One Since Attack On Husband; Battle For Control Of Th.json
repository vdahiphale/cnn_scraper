For the first time since what might easily have been a deadly attack on her husband, Paul, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is talking about the ordeal. She was not at their San Francisco home in the overnight hours of October 28th, which is when Paul Pelosi was awakened by an intruder asking to talk with his wife. According to Federal prosecutors, the suspect told them he intended to hold Nancy Pelosi captive, interrogate her, and possibly break her kneecaps if her answers did not satisfy him. Paul Pelosi managed to call 9-1-1. Police arrived just in time to see a suspect hit him with a hammer fracturing his skull. Tonight, Mr. Pelosi is out of the hospital. Speaker Pelosi is telling her story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

I also think that there are enough people who, while they may not may legitimately be Republicans, and I respect that, are not a party to feeding the flame of violence and disunity in our country. Let me just say that it's about time, you know, it's a time for healing as Ecclesiastes says. Ecclesiastes says, the time -- there is a time for everything and this is a time long overdue for healing, to do so in a prayerful and respectful way, to do so open to hearing each other, about the future of our country. I do believe that our democracy is in danger because of what the others are saying about undermining elections, even now, as we go forward. I think that if enough people in our country are aware of what that challenge is, it might change behavior on the other side.

[20:25:23] And so they have to put a stop to me, right? Because they know that I'm about having our members succeed. I have great confidence in our members, and every compliment I receive about being a great legislator or a great political force, I convey that gratitude to my members for their courage, for their astuteness, for their excellence, and so I take great pride in what they -- we all do -- working together.

What I see is across the country, legislation that says if they don't like the results of the election, they will establish new standards for what wins an election and determine for themselves what that is. That is not what a democracy is.A democracy is freedom to vote free and fair elections, a standard that we apply to other countries, it should certainly apply to us here, whether it's a Democratic victory or a Republican victory. It isn't about it, unless it turns out my way, I don't accept it. That's not a democracy. So that's why I say that defending our democracy is on the ballot in so many ways, and we are just being very prayerful about it. Now, when I was growing up, we were taught in our very democratic Italian-American Catholic family, you don't pray to win an election, you pray that God's will, will be done. So it's not about saying, God be on our side, it's just that God's will, will be done, but we do pray. We pray for that. And then as President Kennedy said, God's work will be truly be our -- must truly be our own, and that's how we go forward. So it is -- I've done very well. I've been close to tears a number of times in this conversation. I think I've done very well in containing that. But you know, of course, I'm sad because of my husband, but I'm also sad because of our country, unless we can get over this and have enough people out there say, while I may not agree with everything the Democrats are for, or the Republicans are for, I do agree that our democracy is important. And that we must, we must protect it. It is a model to the world. What we do -- what we do now, we see as our charge from our founders. Imagine the courage and the vision that they had, the vision -- we have to honor the vision of our founders, the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform and their families to protect our freedoms, and democracy, and the aspirations of our children as they go forward into the future. Babies born now will live into the next century. We want to make sure that our democracy is strong, our planet is safe, and our values are intact, and that we have healed as we go forward.",

They've ordered county officials that they cannot count those votes. The Fetterman campaign in this lawsuit saying they argue that it's a technicality. It does nothing to qualify whether or not this ballot is actually being cast illegally or legally. They say because it's a technicality. They're imploring the federal judge to overrule it. So, these ballots can be counted.And we're talking about thousands of ballots, potentially, 34,000 votes and Philadelphia, another more than thousand in Allegheny County, which is Pittsburgh.

But you go to Allentown, that's Lehigh County, you go south you get on Route 29. You cross the line. And this is where you find Pennsburg. Just across the Lehigh County line in Montgomery County, just a very short drive from Bucks County. Now why does that matter? As Kate noted, that is the suburban call around Philadelphia that decides close elections. Let's go back in time. Pat Toomey is the Republican senator right now, he's retiring. That's the seat Fetterman and Oz are running for. In Montgomery County and 2016, he got beat, right you say, oh, well, he got beat. Why is Mehmet Oz there? Look at the margin. Right look at the margin for Pat Toomey, he lost in Montgomery County, but it's about 11 points.Let's look at Donald Trump the same year in Montgomery County. He got smoked more than 20 points by Hillary Clinton. That's why Donald Trump is not with Mehmet Oz tonight. Donald Trump is not welcomed in this more upscale, more moderate. Yes, formally a lot of Republicans there but they don't like Donald Trump. Let's come back to that Senate race in 2016. What do you notice about this? This is Bucks County. Pat Toomey carried Bucks County. If you come to the presidential race in 2016, and in 2020, Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden carried Bucks County. So, if Mehmet Oz, if Bucks County is red tomorrow night, and if Mehmet Oz is within eight, 10 points, maybe even 11 points in Montgomery County, he's got a shot to win the Commonwealth.
