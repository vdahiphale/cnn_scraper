Some of them are money laundering, wire fraud, continuously making false statements to the House, which I'm sure everyone has head time and time again about. And then, a House Republican said, we don't really want to do that, we are going to buy ourselves some time and try to push this off and have -- refer this resolution to the House at the Ethics Committee and have them take it up first. And so, that is kind of what played out today. But I have to say through all of this, George Santos is loving the media attention. He is not backing away away from the fight.

When you think back to 2011 when then Vice President Biden was one of the lead negotiators of that debt ceiling deal at the time, a lot of Democrats felt like he gave away too much, like the Obama White House and Vice President Biden gave away too much in those negotiations.So, there is a sense of that fear that still exists today among some congressional Democrats, especially as you are starting to see them talk about things like work requirements for some of the safety net programs. Now, the president, part of the reason why they are having these concerns is because a few days ago, he kind of left the door open to the possibility of enhancing some of those work requirements. The White House quickly shut the door on the notion of work requirements for Medicaid programs, but they are still leaving themselves a little bit of wiggle room in the negotiating room to negotiate more work requirements for some other programs.",

It's also just the very threat of default. And that's certainly going to loom over the president's trips. What I'm looking out for to see is how much does this actually factor in to the president's trip and what kind of a message of reassurance is he going to try and deliver to these allies at the G7 about the United States, about its creditworthiness going forward and, as the president says, the U.S. is not a dead-beat nation, a nation that pays its debts.

There was an incident this week where she was taking questions from reporters and it seemed as if she either stumbled or she mistook that she was gone. But long story short, there is a big question about whether she should resign, if Democrats in the Senate and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer should talk to her about this. So, it's something we will be following closely. But I will say, a lot of these lawmakers we hear from are saying it's her decision as long as she can continue her work.
