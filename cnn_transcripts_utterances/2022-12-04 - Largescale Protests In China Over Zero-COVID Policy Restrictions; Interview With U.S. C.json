Well, for those of us who watch China professionally it's easy to focus on elite politics, the leaders. You know, recently we had the death of the former president (INAUDIBLE). But there are many, many Chinese who probably -- barely remember what (INAUDIBLE) looked like. They're young. They might be working in factories.In terms of the World Cup audience they tend to be male. They tend to be competitive. Maybe the type of person who might jump up and go out and act on their emotions, and there are half a billion of them who are interested in watching the World Cup. That is the audience in China. So what happened was they're all looking forward to, you know, being entertained at least by watching something on the screen, but the first thing they see in the very beginning was, oh, my god, there's an audience there and they're in person, and they're shouting and screaming and having fun and watching sports, and they're not wearing masks which, of course, you know, to a country where like one quarter of the population is in some kind of lockdown and masks are mandatory just about everywhere, that was a wakeup call. And I have friends who told me that was the moment where a lot of ordinary folks, not necessarily the intelligence, yes, or the elite, but ordinary folks looked at each other and said, oh, my god, we've been tricked. And they don't like that.",

And so what we have is a kind of a dis-coordinated city by city or region by region or even district by district relaxation of the various -- what had been various stringent and various sort of pervasive anti- COVID protocols. So, for example, in Beijing, which is what I can speak about with most authority because this is where I am and when I'm on the streets I can see it myself.Suddenly it was announced that public transport, meaning the subways, the buses, you no longer have to show evidence of a negative COVID test because in many cases you have to show a negative COVID test within 48 hours. And so suddenly the city said it -- no one can prohibit you from getting onto public transport if you don't have that. OK, fine. But the problem is the stores still require it, the restaurants -- the ones that are open still require it. Many of them not even open yet. They're just doing takeout. And so you get this kind of discombobulation. Other cities are doing other things. Nonetheless, I think eventually we'll see the evolving of good-bye zero COVID and long live the economy. The message we're getting now is, OK, folks, our economy is in bad shape and we need to focus on getting it back on track.",

And certainly I don't see that. I don't see that at all. I agree with you that China has its share of challenges at the moment, but when I look at the United States, I see a country investing, you know, in the past 20 months under the president's leadership we've invested over a trillion dollars in our infrastructure, in ourselves, in our innovation. I see an unbelievably talented workforce. Some of the biggest most profitable entrepreneurial companies in the world.

But I will say this. Our strategy, our economic strategy isn't about slowing China down at all. It's about investing in America so we can maintain our edge. And as it relates to the export controls, which we're leading here atthe Commerce Department, that's not designed to slow China down either. What it's designed to do is protect American technology from getting into the hands of the Chinese military and the Chinese government who wants our most sophisticated technology to advance their military.",

And at the same time it does seem to me sometimes that the Biden administration is sort of taking a page out of Xi's playbook with our own industrial policy.What I'm wondering is, is that the right approach? You know, for example, you're showering money on a company like Intel, which has failed to compete with TSMC in making the world's highest quality chips. As a result of that they're getting massive federal subsidies. Is that rewarding failure?",

Madam Secretary, in your speech one of the clarion calls you have is for immigration, the value of immigration, celebrating how important it is particularly in this issue of competitiveness, get the best and brightest, keep them here. And yet when I look at the Biden administration's immigration policy on something like H-1B visas, which is the high skilled visas, it's not that different from the Trump administration. It hasn't really reversed many of the Trump era kind of caps on it.Do we need more high skilled immigration in this country to properly compete? Right now in Canada a high skilled worker can simply apply for immigrant status by himself without even having a company sponsoring him. Whereas in the U.S. you have a lottery system where you just -- you  kind of have to get lucky to get a visa to work in the United States.",

That is a good thing. We want them here. There's no place for any kind of discrimination or xenophobia in our policies.And yes, we do need more -- we need to make it easier, as you say, to have high skilled immigrants come to America, stay in America, and help us. In fact, I would argue, you know, that's the American story, our whole story of how we continue to reinvent and lead the world is -- is in part because of immigration, because of our diversity. That is our great strength. The politics as you know as well as I do, Fareed, are very challenging around immigration. I don't -- you know, I hear what you say about the president. I think, you know, Republicans in the Congress are challenging on this point. Every business leader I talk to small or large agrees -- President Biden agrees we need a more sensible immigration policy. By the way, you see that in the labor market which is still very tight. So I hope we can find a way towards sensible immigration reform that does, as you say, welcome and make it easier to welcome, you know, high skilled folks from other countries to work and study in the United States.",

A lot of European countries feel that what America is engaging in here is unilateralism and protectionism, that the buy America provisions in the Biden administration's program are actually even worse than the Trump tariffs because tariffs raised the price of foreign goods. Buy America provision means no matter what the price you cannot buy a foreign good. Every nail, every screw has to be made in America.President Macron has surely been pressing President Biden about this these days. And what I've heard from Europeans is they say the U.S. wants to uphold a rule based international system they say against the Chinese who are trying to destroy it. But the U.S. is itself tearing up a rules based international system if it's going to engage in the kind of unilateralism and protectionism that is clearly a violation of the WTO.",

Ressa is the CEO and co-founder of Rappler, a digital news site in the Philippines, and a former CNN bureau chief. She became a target of her country's Department of Justice after Rappler investigated then President Rodrigo Duterte's deadly war on drugs. She currently faces about 100 years in prison for cyber libel and other charges.In the face of her legal troubles, the Nobel committee bestowed the Peace Prize on Ressa for her efforts to safeguard freedom of expression. She has a new book out titled \"How to Stand Up to a Dictator: The Fight for Our Future.\" Maria, welcome. Always a pleasure to have you on. I want to get right to something that's at core of your book. You talk about how democracy can die a death of a thousand cuts. And the peculiar way it dies is that you have elected leaders who use laws to prosecute and oppress journalists. Describe how that happened in your case as an example. MARIA RESSA, AUTHOR, \"HOW TO STAND UP TO A DICTATOR\": It's a combination of many things, you know? But I go back to what caused these cascading failures, what caused the weaponization of the law. It really is kind of this astroturfing, bottom up. When lies spread faster and further than facts on social media, so the information operations seeding a lie amid a narrative bottom up. In my case, it was journalist equals criminal. And then the same lie coming a year later top down from President Duterte himself. A week later we got our first subpoena, there were 14 investigations, and then by January 2018 the first shutdown order for Rappler. It is the same methodology whether it is the Philippines against me or whether it is stop the steal in the United States.",

Their goal is to keep us scrolling on this, right? And how do they do that? They manipulated our biology. It is A/B testing. What keeps us scrolling? Fear, anger, hate, us against them. And when you do that, you're mildly addicted. And then it keeps going. They change your world view and subsequently your actions through our emotions. And the other -- the other problem, of course, is that governments haven't done anything, have done very little to protect us.
