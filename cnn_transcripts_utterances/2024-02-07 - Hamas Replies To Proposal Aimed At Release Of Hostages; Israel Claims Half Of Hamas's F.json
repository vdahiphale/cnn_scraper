The response, according to the Qatari Prime Minister was said that Hamas's proposal was positive. Now, here at CNN, we're hearing from a source familiar with the negotiations, saying that the proposal by Hamas was, in their words, reasonable. And not only that, but crucially, this very public and widely reported demand from Hamas, that Israel, not only ceasefire completely put an end to the war, but also withdraw its troops from the Gaza Strip. Those two elements are not in this Hamas proposal, which could make it more palatable to the Israelis. Where we are right now is that the United States and Israel is probably -- is properly reviewing the proposal by Hamas, and will now be expecting some kind of counteroffer from the Israelis. Now, we know what the Israelis red lines are. We've heard from Prime Minister Netanyahu saying that there won't be a deal at any cost and that Israel won't be releasing thousands of terrorists. But perhaps if Hamas has climbed down with its proposal from what seemed to be its red lines for a complete ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, then Israel might be inclined to meet it halfway. But as I say, very early days, still, but certainly some weary optimism that we could finally be inching towards a deal, Rosemary.",

But at the moment, Hamas is not dead. And it is certainly still a fairly potent force and could arise again at some point in the future. But the Israelis have clearly made it a point to, you know, decimate, interdict, do all of the things that they can in an urban combat type situation. And they have done a lot to go into the tunnels, for example, they've done a lot of reconnaissance, they're destroyed a lot of those tunnels, both on the ground and from the air.

First, Republicans failed to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas after weeks of hyping the issue. Republicans were ultimately undone by a spate of absences in their party. Then, there was a standalone funding bill that would have provided nearly $18 billion in aid to Israel. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle oppose the measure, which needed two thirds majority to pass. Meanwhile, a bipartisan deal on immigration and foreign aid is on track to fail, a key vote in the U.S. Senate in the coming hours. Amid Republican infighting and Donald Trump's desire to kill the bill, a majority of Senate Republicans say they're likely to vote no or leaning against the bill worth $118 billion.

Pinera was on the site of the rescue for hours as each miner was pulled from the mine. He would come and shake their hands and greet them. He monitored minute by minute the progress of that successful rescue operation that was followed by people throughout the world. He will also be remembered during his second term, a flooding heavy handed response to widespread protests in the streets by students that received a lot of criticism because so many people were injured or killed as a result of the government clashing with those students. Afterwards, he admitted that perhaps the reaction to those protests had been too strong.

The country's former prime minister and widely popular leader Imran Khan is in prison and barred from taking part, leaving voters with difficult choices as the country faces mounting challenges from economic uncertainty to frequent terror attacks. CNN's Anna Coren reports.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANNA COREN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The ultima (ph) of an explosion in southern Pakistan, just one of a string of attacks targeting political candidates across the country. So as the nation of more than 230 million people prepares to go to the polls, there's an air of unease. Pakistan's widely popular Former Prime Minister Imran Khan is behind bars, charged with corruption and revealing state secrets, and is banned from running in the election. He denies any wrongdoing. After Khan was arrested by paramilitary police in May last year, his supporters took to the streets, some of them armed. What followed was an extensive crackdown by what many say was led by the country's powerful military, a claim it denied. Protesters were detained, journalists censored. Among those jailed, social media activist, Sanam Javed, a supporter of Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf or PTI party. The 36-year-old mother of two is facing terrorism charges, accused of inciting her thousands of followers to commit arson on the day Khan was arrested. She denies the charges. Her father says her incarceration is an example of authorities silencing dissenting voices. IQBAL JAVED, FATHER OF SANAM JAVED (through translator): I know that all of this is fake and created, and being done to victimize the political party of Imran Khan. This is a political case. COREN (voice-over): Pakistan's information minister denied those claims, saying law enforcers in prosecutors have evidence against Javed. With the fall of Imran Khan has come the return and rise in popularity of his predecessor, Nawaz Sharif. Sharif is back in Pakistan after corruption charges led to years of self-imposed exile. He's now widely expected to win a historic fourth term. TIM WILLASEY-WILSEY, POLITICAL ANALYST: The good prognosis is that Sharif is elected, he builds a coalition which includes Bilawal Bhutto, and starts to run the country pragmatically. He's a pragmatist and starts to balance relations between U.S. and China, get the economy back on track COREN (voice-over): Standing between Sharif and the top job is Bilawal Bhutto Zardari. The 35-year-old is descended from one of Pakistan's political dynasties, yet even with Zardari's useful appeal, many young voters have been left disillusioned by Pakistan's recent political disorder.",

So according to my calculations, to CNN's and to many, many fans, Taylor Swift is going to make it back in time for that Super Bowl kiss. Even the Japanese embassy in Washington, D.C., reassured fans that they were going to see that kiss on Sunday. So just very quickly, the mathematics about this. If we assume that Taylor Swift is taking her private jet, which we assume she will be, that direct flight from Tokyo to Vegas is 12 hours. Now, there's also a time difference here that works in Taylor Swift's favor. Tokyo is 17 hours ahead of Vegas. So by the time that she lands in the United States, it will still be Saturday evening, nearly a whole day before that Super Bowl.So, you know, I'm no betting woman, but I'm going to say with pretty much 100 percent certainty that she is going to be there for that Super Bowl, for that kiss, because let's be real, why else are Swifties watching the Super Bowl. Am I right?",
