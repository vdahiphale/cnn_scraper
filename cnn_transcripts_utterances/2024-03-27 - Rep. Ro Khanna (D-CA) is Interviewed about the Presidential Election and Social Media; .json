Congressman, thank you so much for being with us. You are on the record saying that President Biden has work to do to win back the support among young voters. Now, I do want to stipulate here, I'm not hip, all right. That time has come and gone. But that lineup, Obama, Clinton, Colbert, Kaling, Queen Latifah, is that what's hip now? Is that going to win back young voters? REP. RO KHANNA (D-CA): Well, that's a lot of star power. I wish I had a ticket. I'm sure anyone in America would want to be at that event. But let me tell you, the president as some momentum. The latest polls, John, in \"Bloomberg\"/Morning Consult shows that he has closed the gap in a lot of the battleground states. He's up in Wisconsin, tied in Pennsylvania, tied in Michigan. I actually think it's after his strong State of the Union speech where he laid out the clear economic differences between him and Donald Trump. The country's responding.",
