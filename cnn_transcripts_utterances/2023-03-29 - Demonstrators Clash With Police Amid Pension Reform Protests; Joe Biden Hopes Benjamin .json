You see there hundreds of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets Tuesday for yet another day of nationwide strikes. Now, in several cities, protesters clashed with police throwing stones and burning garbage piles. The French interior ministry estimates more than 700,000 people participated in the protests. Here's the thing though, that is a lower number than demonstrations earlier this month. Now many union leaders are calling on President Emmanuel Macron to put the unpopular pension reform plan on hold. The government shows no signs of backing down. Meantime, trash collectors in Paris announced their suspending their week's long strike and will return to work Wednesday morning. CNN's Sam Kiley has more now in the French capital. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): 10 days of demonstrations and the latest marched through Paris begins to feel almost routine. Within a few hours, this though was the scene. Concern over the rising level of violence has led the unions to ask for a dialogue with the government. This is what a senior union official said.",

CNN's Elizabeth Cohen is following all of this for us from Tel Aviv and joins us now live.Elizabeth, it's good to have you on this story. Now look, even in the face of U.S. criticism that we just heard, Netanyahu seems to be standing firm. How did he react to Biden's really incredibly blunt remarks throughout the day? ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Paula, it was quite blunt, it was really quite strong criticism. Let's read through some tweets from the Prime Minister that he said -- that he wrote rather, in response, he wrote, I have known President Biden for over 40 years. And I appreciate his long standing commitment to Israel, the alliance between Israel and the United States is unbreakable and always overcomes the occasional disagreements between us. My administration is committed to strengthening democracy by restoring the proper balance between the three branches of government, which we're striving to achieve the broad consensus. Israel as a sovereign country which makes his decisions by the will of its people and not based on pressures from abroad, including from the best of friends. Now, there's a lot to unpack there, Paula. But just to make two quick points, I think you could make a case that this is not just an occasional disagreement. As you said, this was very strong criticism from President Biden, it is unusual. And he went on to say even more than what we showed just now. It was really unusual criticism. This doesn't feel occasional, this feels much bigger than that. And also, the prime minister talked about Israel going by the will of its people as a sovereign country. I think the will of the people has been made pretty clear by the many, many -- you know, the huge numbers that have shot for demonstrations and real questions about whether the prime minister would win an election if it were held now. Certainly being here in Israel, I have spoken to people who voted for Netanyahu over and over and over again, but recently, were out in the streets protesting against his government, Paula.",

You know, you have said categorically that the U.S. is deporting these migrants to Mexico to places that even the State Department warns travelers are not safe. Do you see a way out of this at this point? RAUL REYES, ATTORNEY AND IMMIGRATION ANALYST (on camera): Well, look, at this point, you know, just -- you know, these images are so disturbing. The sound is disturbing. I mean, what we're talking about, regardless of people what your political affiliation is, these were 38 people who are seeking a better life and the Mexican government as well as the United States government bears some responsibility for this -- for this, you know, horrible event. And the thing is, what the Biden administration has been pursuing is a deterrence policy, trying to get people to not attempt to come here and claim their lawful right for asylum. This is an approach, the same approach taken by -- President Obama took this approach. President Trump took that approach. And what we know from all these years of talking about the immigration issue and the border crisis, is that it doesn't work. So, I believe in my view, there is a path forward. But both Republicans and Democrats have not been -- have not been willing to touch what seems like the third rail of immigration and address it. For example, right now with the Biden administration is doing is largely restricting asylum, right? Now, they want people to apply for asylum on the Mexican side of the border because our resources are overwhelmed. And all we're doing is basically outsourcing the problem to Mexican officials. Their side of the border becomes overcrowded. And then periodically, they do their roundups, they place people in detention, and this facility, in particular, has a history of inhumane conditions. And as a result is these horrendous tragedies that are very sad. But they are also -- they are also predictable, and they could be avoided with a different approach.",

And just like all the other neighboring Pacific family countries, we respond to natural disasters when our neighbors are in need. COREN (voice-over): All know the value of winning hearts and minds in the Pacific. Beijing sent in cyclone aid, too.
