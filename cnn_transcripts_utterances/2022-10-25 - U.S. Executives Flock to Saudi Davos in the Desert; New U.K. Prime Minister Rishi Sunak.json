To the part of the world where I am today, relations between Saudi Arabia and the United States, they have been strained of late. That is after OPEC+ decided to slash oil production. And Washington has not held back in its rebuke of the kingdom. Joe Biden tells CNN that Washington must rethink its relationship with Riyadh. It was particularly stinging because of Mr. Biden's efforts, just months earlier, to repair ties with Saudi Arabia. The U.S. President was welcomed on the tarmac by the kingdom's ambassador to the U.S., Princess Reema bint Bandar. She was also the only Saudi woman in the room with the president during his meeting with crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. Princess Reema took on the role of ambassador at a particularly low point in Saudi-U.S. Relations. It was mere months after Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. She had a tough task of mending relations back, then and it seems like she is back at it now. I sat down with Princess Reema bint Bandar to discuss all of that and the kingdom's role in energy security. I started by asking her to describe the tone of current Saudi-U.S. relations.

And so at the moment, the conditions are getting -- you have to look behind me to get a sense of it -- cold and wet. The conditions for people without heating and electricity are becoming difficult.

The Israeli military say that they've conducted this major raid in Nablus to target this new Lions Den militant group. This is a new group that has taken responsibility for several deadly attacks, specifically targeting usually Israeli security forces but also Israel says that they were planning an attack in Tel Aviv. This group has no affiliation with the traditional Palestinian factions. And as far as we understand, it's made up of mostly young men who have become disaffected with the Palestinian leadership and really see themselves as the new resistance fighters against the Israeli occupation and against Israeli settlers. Israeli Defense Forces say they targeted what they saw was essentially a headquarter building, that they said was an explosive manufacturing workshop and that during these clashes that resulted from this raid, they killed one of the leaders. This was something that was confirmed by the group. And in a statement, the Israeli prime minister Yair Lapid says that our goal was and remains to inflict severe and lasting damage on terrorism and its agents in Jenin and Nablus and anywhere where terrorists' nests grow. We will not allow the existence of terrorist organizations that harm Israeli citizens an idea of soldiers. What I find really interesting is, that the last few days, we have been talking about Israeli military on a daily basis but we are seeing accusations that Israel's really escalating the way that they are targeting their militants. The Lions Den group says that one of their other leaders was killed by an explosive that was placed under a motorcycle and they're also claiming that one of the men died overnight in what they say was a targeted drone strike. These sort of targeted attacks that are not part of the ground incursions, we have not seen targeted attacks like that in what some analysts have said 20 years or since the Second Intifada, 2002 and that is seen as potentially a major escalation in all of this, Becky.",
