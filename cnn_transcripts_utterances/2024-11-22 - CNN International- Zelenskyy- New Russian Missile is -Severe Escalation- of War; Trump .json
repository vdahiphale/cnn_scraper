Also coming up in the next two hours, an Australian teenager is the sixth tourist to die after suspected methanol poisoning in Laos. Donald Trump's incoming national security adviser warns of a strong response to the ICC after it issued an arrest warrant for the Israeli Prime Minister. And the attention swings to Trump's other controversial picks after Matt Gaetz bows out of the running to be the next U.S. Attorney General. Well, the stock market in New York will open about 30 minutes from now, and a quick look at the future shows a mixed bag. One interesting thing in the world of finance, crypto, which is on the rise -- in part to the U.S. President-elect. We'll explain in half an hour's time, right after that opening bell at 09:30 a.m. New York time. Well, a week of escalating danger in Ukraine, punctuated by today's closure of the country's parliament. Lawmakers say they are fearful of Russian missile strikes. The cancelation coming a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin said his military struck Ukraine's Dnipro region with a new medium range ballistic missile. The Kremlin today calling it a response, to quote, reckless decisions by Western countries supplying weapons to Ukraine. Well, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says use of the new missile by Russia amounts to a severe escalation in what is this nearly three-year-old war. And it is coming while Ukraine struggles along the front lines and faces an influx of North Korean troops fighting alongside Russian forces. Ukraine's Defense Minister addressed the increasingly difficult conditions in comments, earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RUSTEM UMEROV, UKRAINE'S DEFENSE MINISTER: It's already a second time they escalate more within this year. One they send the DPRK soldiers contingent in the -- now they use the missiles. So, at this stage, we're working on increasing the capability, air defense capability, and we're working on replying. The situation in a front line of the unprovoked Russian war against is difficult. Russia is attempting to gain territories with a huge losses and equipment in manpower.

But it's an extraordinary moment for a military official to be publicly hypothetically envisioning, you know, the very idea of a Russian attack. Nick, it's good to have you.

Now, Tehran says it is taking the measures to, quote, protect the country's interests as well as develop what it calls peaceful nuclear energy. Well, the announcement comes just one day after the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency ordered Iran to cooperate with it more.

We don't know yet the exact origin of the suspected tainted alcohol, but this is something that sadly comes up relatively often in different parts of the world. Methanol used in the place of ethanol in the making of cheap moonshine, essentially. And it's very difficult for anyone having a cocktail, for instance, in one of these hostels in this town in Laos, they wouldn't smell it. They couldn't taste it. It would be several hours after drinking the alcohol that they'd start having breathing difficulties. And very quickly, their system would -- their health would deteriorate, and essentially, their organs would then shut down. Even now, what we understand is happening is that several western consulates are still in touch with some of their citizens that are believed to have been impacted by the alcohol, but clearly all issuing warnings, once again, that if you're anywhere on the road and serve an alcoholic beverage where it's a shot or a cocktail, to be very careful about what might be inside.

These indictments come after a nearly two-year investigation. Police allege Bolsonaro had full knowledge of a plot to kill his political opponent, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva after he won the presidential election. Well, journalist Stefano Pozzebon joins us from Bogota in Colombia.

We're talking of a final investigation report of more than 800 pages, and that he would wait to see the recommendations from his lawyers. But then immediately he started spinning it and attacking Alexandre de Moraes. This is the supreme court justice. It's a divisive and central figure in Brazilian politics these days. And he's both one of the targets of these alleged plot to assassinate the current President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, his Vice President Geraldine, and indeed, the Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, but Moraes is also the main judge that is overseeing this investigation, which might sound odd for international viewers around the world, that Brazilian judges do not need to recuse themselves from cases that involve them directly. So, Bolsonaro immediately accusing de Moraes saying that there is a weaponization of justice, and that truth will come out. He has always denied any charge. But I think it's also interesting to hear what the other main person, the main character, is saying, which is Lula. This is what he said yesterday, just hours before these indictments were unveiled, and talking about a plot to kill him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And we learned yesterday that prosecutors are positive that the former president was indeed aware of these plots, and they want to put him on to trial. That decision in terms of what happens next will fall onto the hands of the Brazilian Attorney General, who will decide whether to toss the investigation, which at this point is very unlikely, or indeed proceed with a trial. Our sources at CNN Brazil are telling us that it's likely that we will have this trial in spring of next year, between May, April and March, April and May of 2025. But you can tell that this scandal is already rocketing the Brazilian politics these days right now, because, together with Bolsonaro, 36 other people have been indicted yesterday, and among these ones are former ministers, former retired generals, the president of the party that Bolsonaro represents, his former chief of staff. These are the people. This was the cabinet that ruled over Brazil between 2018 and 2022 and these are the people that are likely to take into the stand, Becky.",

He started accepting crypto donations for his campaign. He's also suggested creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve.
