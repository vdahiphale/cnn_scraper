Now, there were clashes inside the Gaza Strip, on the ground, for thefirst time yesterday, for the first time since that terrorist attack from Hamas on October the 7th. Now, the result of that was that an anti-tank missile was fired by militants towards Israel. One IDF soldier was killed. Three were injured. And Hamas, at the same time, claiming to destroy a couple of bulldozers and a tank. So this was the first skirmish, but this doesn't seem to have been the starting gun on a ground invasion. Now, there could be multitude of reasons why Israel hasn't gone in just yet. It's clearly focusing on airstrikes to try to target commanders, target weapons, storage facilities, and also, of course, that tunnel network that Hamas maintains underground. There could be other reasons, such as the weather, or simply just changing facts on the ground, maybe something to do with the hostages, where they are. They're also trying to find where the hostages are. And also where bodies may be from people that were taken from Israel inside the Gaza Strip. But for now, we still don't know. We still think that it is imminent, that Israel go in. We, of course, heard the chief of the general staff, Herzi Halevi, over the weekend, telling troops that they will be going into Gaza. The simple fact that right now, Michael, remains that we simply do not know when.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Those who arrive at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in central Gaza, alive, are the lucky ones. There were five airstrikes this morning, near the hospital. This video shows the smoke from one, rising nearby. Some 110 bodies were brought here overnight and this morning, one medical source tells CNN. The morgue is now full. The rest of the bodies, wrapped in white sheets, now lay outside in the heat of the day. Relatives try to identify their loved ones. Finding them confirms their worst fears. Inside the hospital, children, including a toddler, are among the dead. Several of these victims were found with their names written in Arabic on their legs, an increasingly common marking, as parents try to make identification easier if they, or their kids, are killed. This hospital is located outside of the area of Northern Gaza that Israel has been trying to get civilians to evacuate. On Saturday, the IDF dropped leaflets, telling people that \"Everyone who chose to not evacuate from the North of the strip to the South of Wadi Gaza, might be considered as a partner for the terrorist organization.\" In a statement, the IDF confirmed it dropped the leaflets, but said it has no intention to consider those who have not evacuated from the affected area of fighting, as a member of the terrorist group. Even those who have managed to avoid the bombs are not out of danger. A trickle of aid, 20 trucks, were allowed to cross the Rafah border crossing from Egypt on Saturday. But that's a tiny fraction of what is needed.",

There has been, of course, quite rightly, enormous empathy with Israelis in the wake of that attack.But Israel's bombardment of Gaza has gone on and on. The death toll of particularly women and children, it must be said, have mounted. Do you feel an empathy deficit around the world for Palestinians? Many or even most of whom in Gaza want nothing to do with the (UNINTELLIGIBLE) of Hamas. EL-HADDAD: Absolutely. I know we've said this from day one. It's selective moral outrage. It always has been, always will be. Not now, but it's especially emphasized now. And -- and it has real-life consequences for Palestinians, who are dehumanized and demonized and othered. And you know, we saw this deliberate campaign happening in the beginning where they were depicted like this. Their city was called wicked. They were called human animals and so on and so forth. The implication being that the laws of war don't apply to them. We can do what we want. And the media is kind of going along with this spin. And so anything they do is morally -- anything the Israelis want to do that is morally justified. And the reality is, the satellite imagery and all of the analysis shows the targets have been civilian targets. The overwhelming majority of the fatalities have been, you know, a large percentage. Nineteen hundred, I want to say now, have been children and have been -- it has been civilian infrastructure.",

EL-HADDAD: I mean, it's just an all-out catastrophe. Nothing short of Armageddon. I don't know what to say. You know, it bears repeating. We're not talking here about a sovereign nation state where people can escape, where they can defend themselves. We're talking about a besieged territory of 2.2 million women, children, elderly. I had a friend of mine who's 103 years old. She survived the ethnic cleansing of Palestine, and her house was bombed, and she miraculously survived. We're talking about human beings who have no recourse. We're captive. And we're -- we all seem to be OK with this in the modern age, with seeing this ethnic cleansing and this modern-day genocide unfold. I mean, I'm literally speechless. I don't know what to say. And again, the statistics, and the targets, and else, tell a very different story about what's going on. It's wreaking damage on the innocent civilian population of Gaza. It's not targeting Hamas.

So, why is he there in the Middle East? What is China's agenda here? KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR/CORRESPONDENT: Michael, China's envoy for Middle East affairs is in the region to push for peace talks. Zhai Jun says that China is willing to do, quote, \"whatever is conducive\" to promote dialogue, reach a cease-fire, and restore peace. Over the weekend, we heard from Zhai Jun, who said that the risk of a large-scale ground conflict in Gaza is significantly rising. Now, some background here. China wants to present itself as a neutral mediator, but the nation has deep economic interests in the Middle East, especially when it comes to energy, access to oil and gas. Now on Saturday, Zhai Jun was in Egypt. He was at the conference where he made remarks. The Cairo summit for peace. China, in addition to Egypt, is visiting the UAE and Saudi Arabia, Jordan, other countries in the region. And according to Zhai, China has provided and will continue to provide humanitarian aid to Palestinians through the U.N., through bilateral channels. And China also wants to promote a two-state solution. Now, according to a foreign ministry read-out of the Cairo summit. We have it for you. Let's bring it up for you. This is what was said. Quote, \"To end the cycle of the conflict between Palestine and Israel, it is essential to implement the two-state solution to establish an independent state of Palestine and realize peaceful coexistence between Palestine and Israel,\" unquote. Now, this is what we heard last week, on Thursday, from the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping. It was his first public comments since the war broke out in early October. Xi called for a two-state solution, saying that it was, quote, \"the fundamental way out.\" But what we have not heard from China? We have yet to hear any condemnation of Hamas. Now, China has not condemned Hamas for its brutal and coordinated terror attack on Israel that took place October the 7th. And that has prompted both anger and disappointment from Israel, as well as criticism from the United States. Back to you, Michael.",

There's only been one motion to vacate the chair, to basically fire the speaker in the House, since the turn of the 20th Century. And that failed against Joe Cannon, who many of them worked in the office building named after him on Capitol Hill. So, you know, that is the first thing that is taking us into uncharted waters. The other thing and that makes the answer to the question so hard is that, historically, the parties have unified behind whoever wins the closed-door vote, right? I mean, you know, you can vote against your party on various issues in Congress, but you are supposed to vote with your party on the organization of Congress and the leadership of Congress. And in many ways, the most remarkable part of this entire episode has been that, even after the caucus -- the conference, a vote in conference had -- you know, had voted to make Steve Scalise the nominee, the opponents held out. After they voted to make Jordan the nominee, the opponents held out. There's no reason to believe that it's going to be any different behind, you know, whoever gets the nod --",

It doesn't really affect voter decisions.But I'm not sure that's right. I mean, you know, what we saw in 2022 was a very unusual outcome, where a higher percentage of voters than we have seen previously, who were dissatisfied with Joe Biden's performance and dissatisfied with the economy still voted against Republicans in a key race, because they viewed them as too extreme. And certainly, everything that is happening here is giving enormous ammunition to Democrats to make the case in 2024 that, whatever you feel about Joe Biden, however you feel about the way things are going in the country, you can not trust Republicans with power. That argument is not going to work everywhere. But can it work in the 18 districts where -- that Republicans are holding out that voted for Biden in '20, as well as another 15 or so that only narrowly voted for Trump? I'm guessing that there are places, particularly in New York and California, where control of the House may be decided, that this can be -- this will likely be a problem for Republicans.
