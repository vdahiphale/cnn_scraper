I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. It's make or break moment for Ukraine, as the U.S. Congress looks closer than ever to finally pushing through its long stalled aid package. House Speaker Mike Johnson is risking his job to get that money to Kyiv, moving forward with the vote despite an uproar from a couple of MAGA aligned lawmakers who are threatening to oust him. The package includes billions of dollars for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan, plus, additional money for humanitarian relief. President Biden says he would sign it into law immediately. Without U.S. support, Ukraine has had to rely on other allies, including the Czech Republic, which has pioneered an effort to buy ammunition for Kyiv from third countries. Last week, President Zelenskyy met with Petr Pavel in Vilnius. Since his election just over a year ago, he's been one of the most outspoken European leaders on countering Russian aggression. Warning that if Ukraine fails, so will we. He's a former top NATO general, and he joined me from Prague to discuss all of this. President Pavel, welcome to the program.",

Here's the answer. Israel is not a NATO country. The NATO allies, including NATO countries, have been defending Israel. They showed the Iranian forces that Israel was not alone. And this is a lesson.

We fundamentally got that wrong, for very different reasons in both countries, but we weren't listening to Putin when he said in Munich in 2007 that there were parts of the old Russian empire, meaning Peter the Great's empire that needed to be restored. We didn't react fast enough when he annexed Crimea, a part of Ukraine, and then the German's chancellor, Merkel, signed the Nord Stream 2 deal the next year, 2015, right after Crimea, which gave a new form of revenue to the Russians for gas exports. So, what was Vladimir Putin supposed to conclude other than we would scream a lot about Ukraine if you want to take the entire country, but we wouldn't do much. And in China, we made parallel mistakes. Did we push them together? I'm not sure we did, but it is clear that they are today doing what Nixon and Kissinger were trying to prevent in the mid '70s.",

That are preventing China from getting the most sophisticated chips, particularly chips that would help them with artificial intelligence. That makes sense to create a bit of a of time and gap for the U.S. to catch up. The steel tariffs, which he is describing, seem to be -- to me, to be more classic protectionism and an election year gambit. And, you know, you're seeing that even with non-adversaries. The president has made it clear he doesn't want a Japanese firm to invest in U.S. steel. Well, there's no closer ally we have in the world than Japan.

In Washington last week, we saw the first meeting between the Philippine leader and the Japanese prime minister with the Americans sort of guiding it along the way.

You know, I did a commercial with her years ago, which we did a Pepsi commercial together where she sang \"Carmen.\" She came in and sang \"Carmen.\" And did a great job. And I've seen her shows live where she would sing operatic arias during her show. You know, so, she's has -- she's always had a natural curiosity for music in general. So, when somebody told me that she was doing a country album, I'm like, figures, it just makes sense, you know, and let's see what's going to happen after that. She'd be going to a totally different direction after that, but that just makes sense. And I don't understand why people are upset about it. They should be praising her for her musical prowess and acumen, you know, to be able to do it. Not only do it, but do it in such a way that's respectful of the genre and do it on a high level.

They never really understood it. And coming here at the Met, this is one of the places where all of those different walks of life can come in here and experience something on the same plane. Now, you know, this happens that being all-black cast for \"Fire Shut Up in My Bones,\" but this story could be told by anybody, you know. And when people come in here, I don't think people realize it's an all- black cast. I don't think that's the first thing that comes to your mind. What comes to your mind is that this is a coming-of-age story with a guy who was sexually assaulted by a family member. And I see so many people of different walks of life relate to the story and that, hopefully, they can carry out into their daily lives.

Then another time, I played at the American Embassy in Russia, and the ambassador told me at the time, he said, man, he said, you've probably done more for American-Russian relations than anybody, because there were some old oligarchs here who came to your show and really enjoyed the music. And that part of it speaks to just what we were talking about earlier, the power of music, how it can break down people's inhibitions and, you know, hopefully, get to the core of some issues. You know, because deep down, I tend to believe -- and it's just because of my spiritual background, I just tend to believe we're more alike than we're different, you know, and it's just hard for us to kind of admit that sometimes.",
