And we are in that path right now. We are literally within this devastation. And you're looking at Wynne High School directly over my right shoulder.Let me take you to my left here, and you can just see the power of what this tornado did, just toppling large trees that have been here for at least decades. There's a home that's been exposed the living room with a piano just off in the distance there. And you can just actually see down that road if my cameraman can pan a little to the right, just how far the devastation goes that way. The tornado actually skipped over this church, knocked a -- knocked over the steeple of this particular church. And as it moved over this direction, landed almost directly on top of this Wynne High School. This is home of the Yellowjackets. And earlier, I walked onto their football field. This is where they have their home football games. And standing on the 50-yard line was almost surreal, because the power of the tornado was almost like peeling the skin off of an onion or peeling, let's say an orange, because the updraft of the tornado literally took the artificial turf and cleared a pathway where that tornado came through. Let me cross the road with my cameraman watch off the debris below us. You can see how it's getting pushed to the sides here. There is lots of electrical crews that are in the area, you can pan down the road, you can see them moving down Highway One. There they are. The bucket trucks that are going to fix the power and the communication, which of course is very minimal at the moment across Wynne, Arkansas. The devastation down that particular neighborhood is catastrophic. And you could just see really with this high school, the entire roof completely imploding. Hopefully, we have the aerial visuals coming, so you can get a bird's eye perspective of just how wide the magnitude of this devastation really is. But this is the nature of these powerful tornadoes. They don't really care where we forecast them to go. Right? They basically will spare one neighborhood, will devastate in another. And that's what we've witnessed. Because we drive 100 yards that way, or 100 yards that way and they are completely untouched home. So, it is unfortunate for the people who have been impacted by this. We know that there's been fatalities. We know there's a state of emergency. But you know what? The weather has cleared and now the recovery process gets underway in earnest. Fredricka?",

So, what is next because the storm systems, they're not done?BRITLEY RITZ, CNN METEOROLOGIST (on camera): Yes, Fred. Unfortunately, we are still dealing with the same threats again today. And as of the latest hour, we now have another severe thunderstorm watch box in place and that includes Buffalo, back down into Cleveland, Pittsburgh also included. We also have several severe thunderstorm warnings now in place for parts of Ohio, Cleveland included, just over toward Columbus as well, where winds are expected to reach over 70 miles per hour. Ping pong sized hail, and even isolated tornadoes can't be rolled out. That watch goes until roughly about 6:00, 7:00 into the evening. Holding on to the threat of severe weather, not only through the afternoon, but again, through the evening. across the Northeast. This is where we're really focused on that tornado threat today. But again, wind being one of our biggest concerns, and then holding on to that threat again across the southeast later on this afternoon, too. You'll see that. We'll time it out 3:00-4:00 in the afternoon. So, holding on to that threat of stronger storms. Again, winds being the biggest concern, but hail and tornadoes can't be ruled out. That threat dies down once we get into the evening hours. Head up to the northeast, watch this. You see how that line is really starting to form? Already dealing with that across the Ohio Valley. It's starting to bow out around 2:00-3:00 into the afternoon once it moves into the mid-Atlantic. Look at that bow. That's the damaging wind threat that we're talking about. We could have winds over 80 miles per hour. In that case, that holds through the early evening hours. Once we get into the overnight, it turns much colder. The front moves through and we watched that precept switch over to snow. Let's put things into perspective here. 57 tornado reports across the Ohio Valley Midwest down into the south over the last 24 hours. Add that in since January 1st, we picked up 370 tornado reports. That puts us over 150 percent of average. Folks, our typical season for tornadoes starting in April. So, we're well early ahead of time when that comes into play, Fred.",

We actually put out a joint statement on behalf of the nation's governors after the awful tragedy at Uvalde, in Texas. And it spoke to both school safety and gun safety. And then, Governor Hutchinson and I designated a group of bipartisan governors to help us oversee the implementation of those -- of those steps that you mentioned that Congress took last year. Now, New Jersey is one of only two states that gets an A on their report card from the Giffords Center which is Gabby Giffords organization, and we're incredibly proud of that. But we are not an island. We need to see more federal progress. And I pray that Congress can get to that point. I know the president wants to see that happen.
