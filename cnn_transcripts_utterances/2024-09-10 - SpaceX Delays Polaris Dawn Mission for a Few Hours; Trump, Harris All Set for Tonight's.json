I'm Anna Coren.Well, just moments ago, SpaceX announced it is delaying the launch of its Polaris Dawn mission by about two hours this morning. The five-day Polaris Dawn mission will carry four astronauts and feature the first ever commercial spacewalk. We have extensive live coverage planned here on CNN over the next few hours. We're also following another highly anticipated event, the U.S. presidential debate set to take place later today. Vice President Kamala Harris is preparing to meet for the first time with former President Donald Trump when the two take the stage in Philadelphia. Harris predicts Trump will lie and attack her personally. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS (D), U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He played from this really old and tired playbook, right, where he -- there's no floor for him in terms of how low he will go and we should be prepared for that. We should be prepared for the fact that he is not burdened by telling the truth. (END AUDIO CLIP)",

He first flew to space in 2021 on Inspiration 4, which was the first all-civilian mission to orbit. He got back from that trip and said, look, I want to do more.And some people would say, although somebody like Jared Isaacman really bristles at the phrase space tourism, you might be able to concede that you know inspiration for was a space tourism mission, but what this is Polaris Dawn. This is not space tourism. This truly is a Testing and development program. Jared Isaacman went to SpaceX and said look I see these areas in your testing and development that needs some work. You need some guinea pigs essentially to go out and test a brand new EVA suit and test flying humans in the spacecraft into the radiation belt. Let me do that for you. And so he essentially chartered this flight. He got a very experienced Air Force pilot to be the pilot of Polaris Dawn and then he has two other SpaceX employees as the other two crew members, two women and one of them is an astronaut trainer. SpaceX's lead astronaut trainer, the woman who was responsible for training Jared on his first mission. And so the whole idea here is Jared says, look, you know, we believe, I believe that the person in charge of training all, not just commercial astronauts that fly on SpaceX Dragon capsules, but also NASA astronauts that fly to space on Dragon to the International Space Station, Jared believes that the person that trains those astronauts should have the firsthand experience of flying to space themselves. So that's why this crew was selected. They are incredibly experienced. They've been training for about two years. So it really does go beyond just a trip up and back from space. They are doing things that not even NASA astronauts have done. First time that a brand new EVA suit has ever been developed or worn in space since NASA's EVAs, or they're called EMUs, 40 years ago. And NASA's really struggled with developing and financing these new suits. So some really groundbreaking stuff here, Anna.",

Miles, tell me, how are you feeling about the launch knowing that it has been delayed by a few hours and whether or not it will actually take place today? MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AEROSPACE ANALYST: Well, Anna, I'm not a weather person. You just had the expert on for that. But I will tell you this. One of the things that they think about is the possibility that the rocket itself flying through thick clouds can create its own lightning, triggered lightning is what it's called. And it actually happened on one space mission years ago, Apollo 12, the second moon mission. They flew through a thick anvil cloud, they call it a cumulus cloud, and it created its own lightning event, kind of shorted things out, if you will. And it caused a huge electrical failure on the capsule and they very nearly had to abort that mission. So it's not just the presence of nature's lightning, it's the fact that the rocket itself, while flying through these thick clouds, can create its own lightning. So with that in mind, and look, and when I look at the weather radar for Florida right now, I think the chances of things improving over the course of this window this morning are not great, but you never know. And that's why they decided at the last minute not to put fuel in the rocket, because once you do that, it's pretty much that's going to be your attempt. And so they're trying to sort of use their crystal ball to see when they feel the best shot will be. They have three windows will open up over a four hour period. They'll look for that best window and try to fuel up just in advance of that because that's going to be their best or their only attempt.",

Michael, wonderful to have you with us as always. There is so much at stake in this debate. Let's break it down, I guess, for both candidates. What does Harris and Trump need to do to win the debate? MICHAEL GENOVESE, POLITICAL ANALYST, AUTHOR, AND PRESIDENT, LOYOLA MARYMOUNT UNIVERSITY-GLOBAL POLICY CENTER: They need to do almost exactly the opposite of one another. You know, the first debate was so consequential, so meaningful, and in that debate, Joe Biden delivered a knockout punch, but he did it to himself. The two candidates have to really be concerned about that. You don't want to get too far ahead of your skis. You don't want to get too far out front. And so for Trump, the key is to tone it down, and for Harris, it's to lift it up. Trump has to tone down the crazy that he sometimes gets involved in on his campaign addresses where he goes really overboard. He's got to avoid doing that because it's going to be a huge audience and they're going to be judging him. Harris, on the other hand, has to lift up her game, has to prove that she's presidential, that she belongs there. She's known to the American public but not well known.

You have to not only get equipment out but you have to get people out. And I think when we're talking about coming on the cusp of the two administrations and the transfer of power from one to the other, there seemed to be a lot of confusion and I think the Biden administration made it perfectly known that they weren't getting the kind of information that they needed from both the Trump State Department and Department of Defense. And that caused problems in terms of the final withdrawal in the end state. So yeah, it's difficult. It -- you know, having done or prepared for not having to execute a noncombatant evacuation operation, what's called a NEO, I know how difficult those missions are. And when the government falls apart and when the local security forces turn, pale, and run, which is what happened with the Afghan army and all the security forces, and the Taliban was gaining ground over the several weeks preceding the evacuation.

I'm trying to teach him about firearms and safety and how to do it all and get him in and arrest me outdoors.ROSALES (voice-over): At the time, there was no probable cause for arrest. CNN also obtained text messages Colt Gray's mother, Marcy Gray, wrote to family members after the shooting. I was the one who notified the school counselor, she wrote. I told them it was an extreme emergency and for them to go and immediately find Colt to check on him. According to a phone log also obtained by CNN. Marcy Gray urgently reached out to Apalachee High multiple times the morning of the shooting. One call lasted 10 minutes and came in a full half hour before the shooting. I don't understand what took them so long, because the first shots weren't fired until 10:30, Marcy Gray texted. Gray told the \"Washington Post\" and a family member confirmed to CNN that her son sent her an alarming text the morning of the shooting. It read only, I'm sorry, Mom. Students inside the alleged shooter's classroom, confirmed to CNN that an administrator came looking for the 14 year old, but mistook him for another student with a similar name.",

SAYARETH: Knowing now that it was her that had called and the fact that they had been telling the school for an entire week at least beforehand that he was homicidal and suicidal and had access to guns just should have been in place of hand from the moment they got that call that morning.
