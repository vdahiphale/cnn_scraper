According to new results from Nation's Report Card, scores in the U.S. history and civics are down across the country for eighth-graders. In U.S. history, actually, scores dropped by five points from 2018 to 2022 -- a downtrend that actually began nine years ago and unfortunately, has continued.Another negative, 2022 also marked the first-ever score drop for civics classes. Only 14 percent of students reached at or above what is considered a proficient mark in history. It was 22 percent in civics. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said in a statement that the report underscores the profound impact that the pandemic had on student learning in subjects beyond math and reading. Here is a sample U.S. history question that is deemed medium difficulty. The question is: What were the European explorers such as Henry Hudson looking for when they sailed the coast and rivers of North America in the 1600s? One more. Here's an open-ended civics question that's categorized as hard. Quote, \"Many citizens of the U.S. believe the federal government should work with other nations to develop ways to protect the environment. What are two ways, other than military action, countries can act together to address environmental issues? Those are the kinds of questions that are on these exams.
