Kenya's President works towards a solution that a Sudan solution on the sidelines of Africa's Climate Summit. And the Burning Man festival is a wash out. All right. Russia taking aim at the food Ukraine exports to the world. Ukrainian officials say a massive airstrike targeted port facilities near its Danube River overnight. It's hit second straight night that Russia has taken aim at Ukraine's food exports. And that attack came just hours before Russian President Vladimir Putin met his Turkish counterpart in Russia where both leaders are talking about avoiding a food crisis. Recep Tayyip Erdogan is encouraging the Kremlin to revive the Black Sea Grain Deal with Kyiv. CNN's Melissa Bell joining me now live from the Dnipro in Ukraine. And we'll talk about the grain deal itself a little later this hour. But Russia again targeting infrastructure, even as Putin and Erdogan talk about reviving this deal. What are we seeing on the ground?",

But as you say, Becky, quite extraordinary that on the eve of that summit that so many different parts of the world watch with great anticipation to see whether this crucial grinding can be revived. It should be agricultural port infrastructure. In fact, one of the main export ports of Ukraine, no one ready down by the border with Romania that should have been targeted overnight. What we're seeing again, today, a series of drone strikes, not just on the South that I mentioned, the Odesa region but here around the eastern parts around Dnipro as well. Some of them caused damage, most of them were intercepted by Ukrainian air defenses. And this comes even as intense fighting continues long, several points on the front line, Becky, that all attention here very much on what's happening in southern Zaporizhzhia and specifically the gains that have been made around robotics. We've been meeting with some of the men who achieved those gains these last few days really speak of apocalyptic scenes further south, the sky black with drones, the extensive minefields, and yet, they say they believe that progress is being made. The first line of use of Russian defenses appears to have been broken. And with that, Ukraine hopes that there is no momentum on its side, it's going to be able to extend the bridgeheads to the south of Russia, as it seeks to make it to its next objective, which is the strategic and logistical hub of Tokmak. Of course, much is going to be down to whether the momentum can now be found to consolidate those gains. It is smaller, small groups that are going in, in the hope, Becky, that a larger assault can be prepared with a double aim not just moving further south, but drawing frontline elite Russian troops from elsewhere along the front line, Becky.",

It's really interesting, Becky, because there was a lot of expectation placed aroundthis meeting that President Erdogan, who helped get Russia into the black sea green corridor deal last year, a parallel deal with a deal that the U.N. and Turkey also strike with Ukraine, that he was going to perhaps have some leverage to get Putin back in. But I think listening to the statements coming out of the press conference here at the end, it doesn't seem to advance much from when Turkey's foreign minister met them Russian foreign minister last week, and Putin probably doubling down and even stronger in his language, saying that it's the West's fault that this deal has collapsed that Ukraine doesn't do what it says it does which is export grain and food products to the -- to third- world countries in the way that he says Russia does. He says, you know, we're ready to get back into the Grain deal, as long as we get what we want. And he's even talking about an alternate grain deal whereby Russia exports grain to Turkey, Turkey, then exports it on from there. So, I don't think we've moved -- I don't think the conversation has moved forward. Rather, Putin has got a bigger platform to make his message known more widely, Becky.",

But some of it, of course, does get there. And that's important.

So, there's -- there is potential leverage there. But I -- that's not leverage -- that's not leverage Erdogan is trying to exert. It's really diplomatic leverage is really trying to have a face to face conversation. Look, Putin is in pretty much of a bubble, he speaks only to those around him and leaders that have come to Russia that frankly, for the most part support him. You know, Erdogan can you explain it differently to Putin. Putin's statistics on where Ukraine's grain goes to reduce a pretty much accurate but the alternate part of that conversation. But the other part of that conversation, of course, that Erdogan can have is, look, if Ukraine's grain didn't go to the nation's and it goes to, there will be shortages of food there. And that will drive up the global food price which has always been the argument of international aid agencies as well that it is the combined grain output from Russia and Ukraine that makes a difference to stabilizing global food prices. And that, of course, is vital for third world. So, I'm not clear what real leverage Erdogan has. At least that's not getting discussed here in this meeting public -- publicly, let's say.",

And when President Ruto is telling you is that he thinks that they're finally ready to come to the table and agree. General Burhan who leaves the Sudanese armed forces to claim that Kenya was partisan and cannot lead these talks. He says he's happy to drop that. And he's going to speak to the president of Egypt, President Sisi as well. And the President of South Sudan President Salva Kiir was on his way here and then all agreed that there's a way forward to some kind of talks to get this stalemate settled in Sudan.

There have been a lot of commitments that previous COP 27, COP 26 and shadow shake in Glasgow, but these countries, the least-developed countries, the global south countries, that small island nations feel that there's been a lot of talk, very little action. So, part of the reason why the Africa Climate Summit is happening here for the first time is to try and get a combined voice. A unified voice to do that. President Ruto, for instance, mentioned in that speech, that Africa is carbon footprint is very small, but the real human tall, of the climate crisis is devastating here. And he sees this as an opportunity that African carbon sinks. For instance, the Congo basin, the large water table that exists between Gabon and the Democratic Republic of Congo and whatnot. These are opportunities that the rest of the world can tap into. So, in a way, the African leaders are saying, we're not just asking for a handout, we can do something that's good for the world, but also helps cushion the people here in Africa who are worst affected by climate crisis, considering that Africa is warming faster than the rest of the world. And there's just the need, for instance, the urgency President Ruto said to address loss and damage and to find out new financing mechanisms to build resilience in this part of the world.",
