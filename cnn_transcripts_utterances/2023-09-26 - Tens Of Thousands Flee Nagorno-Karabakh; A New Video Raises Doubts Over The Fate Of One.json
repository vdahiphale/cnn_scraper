We'll speak to an NGO working on the ground. Then dead or alive, really? A new video is raising doubts over the fate of one of Russia's top admirals. Plus, U.S. President Joe Biden visits the picket lines in support of auto workers. We're live from Michigan just ahead for you. We start this hour though with an exodus in Nagorno- Karabakh. Authorities say more than 20,000 people have now fled into Armenia, that's about a sixth of all ethnic Armenians living in Nagorno- Karabakh. And that number could grow as separatists surrender to Azerbaijan. The disputed region has been the focus of all for decades. And this month's military action by Baku is driving fears of ethnic cleansing. Azerbaijani say that won't happen. But just last week, if you remember, they were shelling the same people they're now asking to trust them. Many Armenians just aren't convinced. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The commander of the Black Sea fleet all of a sudden appeared to be present. But you're absolutely right, we of course, don't know when that video was filmed now that it's been put out. So certainly, there are still contending claims here. Also, the spokesman for the Kremlin was asked about this today, and he also said that he wouldn't comment on it, and said that this was all in the remit as he put it, of the Defense Ministry. At the same time, of course, Isa, you do have the war here continuing to be in full swing. This of course, is part of it, it claims that they're going back-and-forth between the Ukrainians and the Russians.

Now, we were on the battlefield last night, and we saw just how tough, just how harsh this war is being waged. Here's what we witnessed. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (voice-over): Rolling into battle as night falls. Ukrainian's army attacking in the east around Bakhmut. (on camera): For the Ukrainians, this is an extremely important, but also very complicated and potentially very dangerous mission. And we're going to be located very close to where the Russians are. (voice-over): We're with a frontline drone unit called Code 9.2. Their drone, the Ukrainian-made Vampire. The crew attaching the bombs as artillery whistles over our heads.

The amount of tasks that those drones are being asked to fulfill. Also essentially, being frontline bombers for the Ukrainians. But then also, if you look at some of the night-time action that goes on here, the amount of ammunition that is fired from both sides, but also from the Ukrainian sides. Of course, nowadays, a lot of that, it comes from western artillery.

They are coming in from as far away as China. But when you have these folks that are settling in either to assess the ground and figure out their next steps, they will stay here for a good amount of time. Let me show you, you can get a sense of the crowds building up in Tapachula. They're going to a park turned processing center that is attracting hundreds and thousands of people that will get their transit documents or claim asylum here in Mexico. Because if they are trying to get to the U.S. and claim asylum in the U.S., the U.S. policy stipulates they have to have a third country in which they have attempted to claim asylum. Many are choosing to do that here in Mexico. And because they're in Mexico illegally, they have to get the documentation to stay here, to give them enough time to go all the way north, more than 1000 miles from where we are now. Many of them stay between one and four months. You can see, it is so common for them. There are so many rafts, they are going constantly across this river and continuing on the migrants' journey. It is becoming such an issue for these Mexican cities. We were on a flight yesterday from Tapachula to Mexico City with the head of migration for the Mexican government. He said there is a reason why I'm coming Tapachula. This is a very important city. The individuals who claimed asylum in Mexico last year, it's double those numbers this year. Over half the applications happened in southern Mexico. That is why the head of migration for Mexico is in Tapachula, trying to assess the situation. And currently they are dealing with about 17,000 migrants in this area alone. It's just a continuous passage to get north.",
