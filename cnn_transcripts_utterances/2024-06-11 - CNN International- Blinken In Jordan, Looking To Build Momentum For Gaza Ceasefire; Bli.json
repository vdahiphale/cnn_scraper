      "sentences": "Good morning or good evening, depending on where you're watching. I'm Rahel Solomon live in New York.Straight ahead on CNN NEWSROOM, the U.S. Secretary of State is in Jordan today, as pressure grows for a Gaza ceasefire deal. We are live this hour in Tel Aviv and in Beirut. Plus, the jury in the Hunter Biden gun trial resumes deliberations. We are live outside the courthouse. And Donald Trump juggling his conviction with his campaign. We will look at why the former President is quoting conservative Christians. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is trying to build momentum for a Gaza ceasefire proposal, saying that he is quote \"hopeful about the latest Hamas response.\" Blinken is now in Jordan, where he attended an international conference on emergency humanitarian aid for Gaza. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is there as well, an urgent end to the quote \"horror of war\". Blinken is expected to meet any moment now with the Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa. Now, Blinken's whirlwind day began in Israel where he met with Benny Gantz, the former war cabinet member who just resigned on Sunday. Blinken also greeted today some of the families of the hostages. And a written statement just released by an Israeli government official suggesting that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is ready to sign up for the U.S. outlined ceasefire plan. Blinken also saying that it is a quote \"hopeful sign that Hamas is welcoming a UN Security Council resolution endorsing the ceasefire\", but he also says that formal approval must come from the top. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: I think there is a strong consensus, again, behind moving forward the proposal, but it really is down to one person at this point. We await the answer from Hamas, and that will speak volumes about what they want, what they're looking for, who they're looking after. (END VIDEO CLIP) SOLOMON: The UN Security Council vote approving the U.S. outlined ceasefire was the first time that it endorsed such a plan to end the war. 14 of 15 members voted in favor Monday. Only one, Russia, abstained. Now, the three-stage proposal would eventually lead to the return of all hostages, a permanent ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. The Palestinian UN Ambassador spoke shortly after the vote. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, Israel is accusing the military leader of Hamas of profiting off the deaths of Gaza civilians. The IDF responding to a Wall Street Journal report that suggests that Yahya Sinwar believes Hamas has the upper hand in the war.Let's get more now from Paula Hancocks, she is live for us in Jerusalem, and Ben Wedeman, who is in Beirut. Paula, let's start with you again. During his stop in Israel, Antony Blinken met with both the Israeli Prime Minister but also Benny Gantz, who resigned from Israel's war cabinet over the weekend. Paula, what's your sense of the takeaway from those meetings?",

      "sentences": "Well, Rahel, the entire reason, really, for the Secretary of State to be here was trying to push this ceasefire hostage proposal forward, as it appeared to be going nowhere. So, that would have been the main topic of conversation, certainly here in Israel. Now, we have seen an Israeli government statement since Blinken has moved on from Israel, and it says that Israel appears to be moving towards accepting this proposal from the U.S. Now, the U.S. has said that Israel already accepted it, this three-stage proposal, which would end in that complete ceasefire, the release of hostages, Palestinian prisoners and humanitarian aid getting into Gaza.But, we haven't heard that in so many words, certainly not from the Prime Minister. So, in this statement, they have said that Israel stands by its demands to not end the war until they have made sure that the political and military capabilities of Hamas have been destroyed, until all the hostages are released, and until Gaza does not pose a threat. [11:05:00] Now, on the face of it, it does seem to work to differ slightly from this proposal that we have seen, which has been endorsed by the U.S. President Joe Biden. But, it's -- it appears to be the closest we have come up until this point of Israel's Prime Minister accepting this deal. Now, of course, Hamas has to accept the deal as well. You heard the Secretary of State there saying it's up to one man, Yahya Sinwar, who is the head of Gaza, has to officially agree to it, and they are waiting for an official response from him.",

We are able to push for a permanent ceasefire, also suggesting as well allegedly that civilian casualties are accepted as a means to an end, again, Wall Street Journal's reporting. The Israeli military, though, has responded to that report, saying that Sinwar profits off the deaths of Gaza civilians. Rahel.",

      "sentences": "Well, basically, everybody is waiting for some sort of response from Hamas. Now, Hamas responded positively to that UN Security Council vote, but it has yet to sort of pass final judgment on the U.S.-backed proposal. Now, we do know that Osama Hamdan, a senior official of Hamas based here in Beirut, has said that what Hamas is looking for is a permanent ceasefire and a total withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. Those are basic elements that they are interested in. And short of that, they won't go along with the deal.Now, if you look at the American proposal, that is basically what the Americans are suggesting. On the other hand, what we heard, this statement that came out from an unnamed Israeli government official would indicate that on the one hand, yes, they are in favor that this proposal is not -- does not contradict their basic aims, but their basic aims continued to be the destruction of Hamas' military and governing capabilities, and that they will continue until they achieve those ends. So, there is a bit of a contradiction. So, we really have to wait and hear of what Hamas has to say, and then take it from there. But, keep in mind that Prime Minister Netanyahu himself has not explicitly accepted the U.S.-backed proposal. And I think as Paula was referencing, he is now, in the absence of Benny Gantz in the war cabinet, he is under more pressure from those extremist elements in his cabinet who have threatened that if he accepts a ceasefire deal and does not carry the war to an end, meaning the destruction of Hamas, that they will withdraw from his cabinet, the government falls and then you're back to square one.",

      "sentences": "We don't know the verdict yet, Rahel. Just to give our viewers a sense, things are a bit delayed because they don't allow any electronics in this federal courthouse in Wilmington, Delaware. So, the system that we've been relying on is we have a team of reporters in that courtroom. They actually have to hand write the notes as they're getting information from inside the courtroom. And then, we have college students, interns, actually running those notes out to our teams to get the information transmitted.So, what we know so far is that the jury has alerted the judge and the court personnel that they've come to a verdict in this case. Now, what's interesting is shortly after they convened at nine o'clock this morning, so they've only been deliberating two hours this morning and then they had one hour of deliberation yesterday, we know that Hunter Biden actually exited the courtroom sometime around 9:30 or so. We understand that he and his family have set up at a nearby hotel. So, you actually see moments ago, Hunter Biden and his wife walking into the courtroom, the courthouse. So, obviously, they've gotten the word there is a verdict. They will enter the courtroom. Rahel, sometimes, it does take a little bit of time for the verdict to actually be read. The judge has to assemble the jury into the courtroom. All of the court personnel has to be at the ready. So, sometimes, it takes from the moment we get word that there is a verdict, it can take 30 minutes plus to actually get word of what that verdict is. But, again, Hunter Biden, as you mentioned and laid out, he is facing these three felony counts, two of them for, as the government alleges, improperly filling out these forms when he bought the gun, not acknowledging that he was a user of drugs, as the prosecution has claimed he was at the time in October 2018 when he bought this gun. And then also, the third count relates to possessing a gun while also using drugs, again, what the prosecution alleges here. This was actually not a long trial. We had jury selection last Monday that lasted one day. And this trial was essentially about five days. We had four days last week, and then yesterday, there were closing arguments. The jury began deliberating around 3:30 yesterday afternoon, deliberated for an hour. So, these aren't a lot of criminal counts, just three criminal counts, and that probably speaks to why the jury is deciding or has decided relatively quickly here. So, yeah, we continue to watch the courthouse here, watch our email, and wait and see what the verdict is. If Hunter Biden is convicted on one or all three of these counts, there is the possibility for prison time. All three counts would carry up to 25 years in prison, plus a nearly million dollar fine, conviction on just one of these counts does carry, let's see -- what is it, up to 10 years in prison for just one count. However, I will note, given that Hunter Biden has no criminal history, it's also possible he doesn't get prison time and might get some sort of probation. And then, of course, his team would likely appeal this. And any sentence he got would be paused while this appeal happens. So, yes, we are waiting to find out what the verdict is here, Rahel.",

So, yes, guilty on all three charges. And let's say, concluding he violated the laws meant to prevent drug addicts from owning firearms.Rahel, yeah, I mean, this guilty verdict means that Hunter Biden definitely faces prison time. Even just being found guilty on one of these counts carries up to 10 years in prison. Again, Hunter Biden does not have a criminal record. So, it will likely be much less. But, the question is, how much less? And there is still that potential that he could serve some prison time, likely, even if not prison time, probation time. And of course, this is coming during an election year, during the campaign season, when Hunter Biden has already drawn the fire of Republicans. They have consistently railed against him for what they've called shady business dealings, accused the current President of being involved in those business dealings, which there has never been any proof of. But, this just sort of adds even more fire to the Republicans' claims against the current President, Joe Biden, just as we are headed into an election. Rahel.",

I can't say that it is, and we've seen it whether it's O.J. Simpson, whether it's any other celebrity who has gone to trial. Felicity Huffman, guy ended up getting time on probably a charge that she should not have gotten any time on. But, she was a celebrity. Those things occur.Then again, there are people who don't get charged at all because they are celebrities and they find their way out of cases. And we've seen this with Alec Baldwin. We've seen this with other people. I think that that's what we see within our political system. And somehow or another, we have to lose this feeling, or this love affair or hate affair with celebrities or politicians. They're entitled to their due process like anybody else.

And we know from the testimony that he was having drug issues before and around that time of the -- is the people he was associated with. He was either using drugs with or introducing them to drugs. He had been rehabbed. There is not really a question there. The question was, whether or not his defense was going to be able to poke a hole, if you will, in this idea that he might not have known he was an addict. And that was a stretch, I think, to go with. But then, you sort of danced with what (inaudible) if you're the defense lawyer in some of these cases, and that's really all they had, frankly, to work with. So, it's not surprising.

And so, does it matter if you may have at one time been an addict?So, for instance, somebody might be an alcoholic. They say they're an alcoholic the rest of their entire life. Somebody may have at one time been a drug addict or they a drug addict their entire life. Does that forever prohibit them from owning a gun on the Second Amendment? And so, these are things that an appellate court will dig into because there are constitutional questions. Anytime we talk about the right to have a gun and things that may infringe upon that right, there are constitutional issues as it relates to the Second Amendment.

Now, he has got to go face a tax case, which we're going to -- those things were going to be resolved.

There was always talk about what that could or could not mean for a jury, as they see a defendant's support system there around them. Marshall, so, no sentencing perhaps for the next several months. But, I would imagine that his legal team, meaning Hunter Biden's legal team, likely already starting their work on some type of an appeal.",

They have mounted many challenges to this case before the trial and there will be plenty to come after the trial. They don't even think that these charges are constitutional. There are some real questions about the constitutionality of these laws that restrict gun ownership that prevents drug users from owning a gun, after the Supreme Court, the conservative majority on the Supreme Court, ruled a couple of years ago in a massive gun case. We have seen some gun restrictions being struck down. And Hunter's team was hoping that this law would also fall. The judge did not agree with him on that, that they will certainly pursue it on appeal.And of course, Erica, we can't have this conversation without also mentioning the fact that he has a second trial pending later this year. This was just one half of his legal problems. He is now convicted in the gun case. But, he has been indicted in a separate tax case, nine charges, three of them felonies. That is scheduled to go on trial in Los Angeles in September. So, there is a lot for him and his lawyers to deal with. They will absorb this punch today. But, they have so much ahead of them, many more problems ahead for the President's son. This is not the end.",

But, what that means is that he'll find out his fate three months from now, this is June, July, August. So, if they put this sentencing in August or September, he may be learning his sentence in the gun case right around the time that he starts going on trial and the tax case.

And generally, those are at odds, quite frankly, lawyers don't like to talk about anything as it relates to the case and any sentencing or anything else, or have our client talk to anybody or say anything or do anything in public. But, the realities are, is that we're in the presidential election, and this is the President's son.So, I think while his lawyers may be focused on the case, focused on the issues relating to the case, focused on the appeal, focused on sentencing, focused on preparation in terms of the California case, I think there is a public relations narrative, and that narrative will probably be far different. It'll be the issue of addiction, the issue of whether this case was about a shaming of addiction, whether or not he is overcoming his addiction, whether or not they embrace the fact that he is had some dark moments, but he is trying to move on. In terms of the tax case, he has paid his taxes. He has made the government hole, should we be going through that, should it be prosecuted at all. Right? Is this another issue of the weaponization of the Justice Department? Do they stay away from that? It seems to me that the messaging around that has been, right, that we respect the justice system. We've heard from his father. We've talked about that just now, Erica, right, where you have Joe Biden saying, hey, I respect the verdict. I'm not issuing any pardons. Will then his son, Hunter Biden, say I respect the verdict? I was in a dark place. And it's going to be what it's going to be. That narrative, we'll wait to see.

I mean, Donald Trump's life in the gutter and President Biden's family and having some of the chaos and confusion behind the scenes, I think is what could potentially influence.But, I think interesting takeaway here, it's been the family's reactions or the reactions inside the families to these specific cases. I think the Trump family and Donald Trump himself just has literally torn the face off this judge and the jury and the process and the DA. I think the Biden family has embraced the fact that there is a process playing out here and that there was no sort of whisper or rumor that he was going to be pardoned. I do think there is some civility to that reaction. So, at the end of the day, I think this is going to move past this phase and we'll get back to the campaigning on the other chaos and confusion that's been created.",
