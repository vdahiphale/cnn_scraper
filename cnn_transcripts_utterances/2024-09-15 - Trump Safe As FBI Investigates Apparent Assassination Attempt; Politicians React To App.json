      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to all of our viewers watching here in the U.S. and around the world. I'm Jim Sciutto in Washington.CNN's Breaking News continues this hour. The FBI is investigating an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump two months after the former president was shot in the ear at a rally in Pennsylvania. Trump is safe, was not harmed in Sunday's incident at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida. A 58-year-old man identified as Ryan Wesley Routh has been detained. He's pictured there. He had weighed in on politics on social media in the past and at times had criticized Donald Trump. The Palm Beach County Sheriff says the Secret Service fired shots at a man who had a rifle in the bushes along the perimeter of the Trump International Golf Club. A source says that Trump had been playing golf at the time, moving between the fifth and sixth holes. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I will never slow down. I will never give up. I will never surrender. So, let's circle back now on what exactly we know about the person now detained in connection with this incident. Law enforcement sources say he's 58-year-old Ryan Wesley Routh, a self-employed affordable housing builder in Hawaii. He has had run ins with law enforcement in the past. He also has a strong social media presence where at times he has criticized Donald Trump. He's also expressed support for the war in Ukraine.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But most interestingly has been his continual postings about efforts to recruit fighters to go to the Ukraine. He has called out for people to send him their passport copies, their military experience, their resumes and what other battles they have fought in. He has provided a link for fighters to, you know, populate this information. He has indicated that he's been in theater in Ukraine.So, as we kind of cast about for a motive, that doesn't mean that the motive is connected to Ukraine, but it is an issue where Donald Trump has been accused of dodging the question about whether he would support Ukraine or Zelenskyy. So, it's -- it's something that they'll be curious about. Also, the remarkable thing is all the way back in 2002 in North Carolina, he has an arrest, one of his eight arrests. But it stood out to me because the charge was possession of a weapon of mass destruction. When you go back through that case, what you see is he was stopped by police. He took off in the car. He barricaded himself in an office building for three hours. But he was charged with possession of a concealed weapon, the pistol, and the weapon of mass destruction charge related to the other weapon, which wasn't a bomb. It was a machine gun that was fully automatic. So, when you see him today with this, allegedly with this AK-47 and talking about having been in war zones, his familiarity and comfort with these weapons starts to emerge. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We're also joined by CNN senior law enforcement analyst, Charles Ramsey. He led police forces in Philadelphia and here in Washington. Good to have you both on this evening and a serious evening. I want to begin, if I can, Juliette, with the security around the president, the former president in a situation like this. It's a golf course, as Randi Kaye was saying there. There is no wall around it. They did have, as police described, agents ahead of him creating some sort of buffer zone or cordon around him. And yet you have a man who was able to get on the course and get within, as I understand it, 250, 300 yards. I mean, short of shutting down a mile radius around Trump, wherever he goes. Was this a proper, a proper, properly sized cordon, as it were, around the former president?",

They do not care if he's in a public forum at a rally, as we saw in Butler, Pennsylvania, or in a private event or private excursion on a Sunday.And so, the thinking has got to be that this is a person who is going to be sort of a high likely target for the time being. He sits, as we've been saying, he sits in his sort of own lane. He's neither a former president who sort of goes off to their ranch or whatever else. And you hear from them occasionally. And he is also a presidential candidate. And so, I think at some stage, security perimeters have to end. You can't close down all of -- all of -- all of a city or community. But obviously, in these instances, there has to be a greater assessment of the security perimeter, what is going on close to the security perimeter. And then, of course, getting Trump, if this is the case in this assassination attempt, that his movement is well known simply because he's on public streets and he tends to play golf or whatever else, is to make sure that his routine is -- that he changes up his routine. And he may not like it, but it's definitely for his protection.",

They can trace it back to the point of sale that took place.And unfortunately, in Florida, there's no requirement if the original owner sells the gun to someone else to, you know, run a background check or otherwise record it. So, it's easy to get a gun in the United States. This is another example of some very dangerous weapons that are on our streets. What's unusual about this is it is an AK-47. Normally, you would see an AR-15 or something like that. But him getting his hands on a gun like that is not anything that is unfortunately surprising.",

As anyone who studies radical, as I look at radicalization, in particular, political violence, not, be very focused here, it's not politics, it's the political violence aspect of it. What we need to learn is what was his pathway to violence. There's lots of people who don't like Trump, right? I mean, that's not a surprise. Lots of people who love him. But what is that path? And what I want to focus on, and what I think the FBI will be focusing on, is where has he been since Butler, Pennsylvania? He has commented on it in social media. He seems angry at Trump for it, rather than the assassin. And he -- and then he all of a sudden shows up in Florida. And so, if I were investigating this, what I want to know is where was he? What was he staking out? What did he purchase in terms of weaponry? How many times had he been in Florida? How many times had he been in that area? You know, this is luck in some ways that Trump happened to be on the golf course. I find that less likely than he became familiar with Donald Trump's routines, knew when streets were closed, knew that he liked this golf course, and was then able to set up. And so, I really do look at the connectivity between, very different between Butler and what happened.",

Authorities say Trump was walking between the fifth and sixth holes when Secret Service agents open fire, the man fled in the car, was later detained by law enforcement, officials say at the time that they noticed him, he was 300 to 500 yards away from Trump. We should note Trump was not harmed at the scene. Investigators recovered an AK-47 style rifle with a scope. Two backpacks and a GoPro camera. Three law enforcement sources tell CNN the person in custody now is 58-year-old Ryan Wesley Routh. He is a self-employed, affordable housing builder in Hawaii. He has a criminal history. He has also publicly criticized Trump on social media. A source says authorities are working to obtain search warrants for various online accounts associated with Routh. And some are on platforms headquartered outside the U.S. The FBI is also aware of suspected online claims about travel overseas. Routh's son tells CNN his father, in his view, is a loving, caring, and hardworking man. And it is not like him to, quote, do anything crazy, much less violent. The Palm Beach County Sheriff noted that Donald Trump's U.S. Secret Service detail is limited because he is not a sitting president. Former U.S. presidents have Secret Service protection for the rest of their lives after their time in office. The local sheriff praise those Secret Service and other law enforcement responses to the situation. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The second attempt in just two months.Officials say 58-year-old Ryan Wesley Routh is a self-employed, affordable housing builder in Hawaii. He has made media -- social media posts critical of Trump in the past, records show that Routh has had previous run ins with law enforcement, including an arrest in 2002, including for having a fully automatic machine gun at the time. There are also several court cases dating back to the 1990s. Officials say Sunday's incident happened while Trump was playing golf at his course in Palm Beach, Florida. A Secret Service agent spotted a man pointing a rifle from the bushes along the course. The agent then open fired. There are no reports of anyone hit by gunfire. It's also not clear if the alleged gunman was able to fire any shots. The FBI is investigating. CNN's Kristen Holmes is following all the developments. Has more now from Washington. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I've spoken to a number of campaign advisors who say there are still a lot of questions as to what exactly happened the details there and how exactly this happened, in particular how the suspect knew where Donald Trump was going to be and win today. Just a reminder, he is a former president. He is not a current sitting president which means he doesn't have to put out a schedule. There is no pool of press pool following him around. And so instead this was a private event with a close friend. He was with ally and donor Steve Witkoff golfing at his property there. So, there are a lot of questions as to how exactly this unfolded. Now, one thing that I've spoken to a number of campaign advisors about is that they are pleased with the Secret Service response. One thing that I will note is that after that assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, there were a lot of questions as to why exactly the U.S. Secret Service did not respond or engage in the shooter quickly. That is not or at least does not seem to be the case here. As we know, Donald Trump seemed to be traveling with at least two sets of Secret Service agents, ones that were behind him and then another set that was in front of him. He himself the fifth and six hole we are told, there was an entire other Secret Service group ahead of him, advancing him. That is the group that saw the rifle and engaged with the suspect on the golf course. Shots were fired. And then a second group of Secret Service agents took Donald Trump away. They went back to the club, which was on lockdown for several hours. Then we were told Donald Trump was brought back to Mar-a-Lago again several hours later, which is not completely unreasonable. Something we saw in Butler, Pennsylvania, as well. Secret Service taking their time to secure the location, as well as make sure there's no secondary location or secondary potential gunman waiting. So that is unsurprising. Now we also are told that the campaign managers have now reached out to the entire staff, to the campaign to discuss what happened today with them in an e-mail, this is what they wrote. And this came from co-managers, Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles. Partly they say, today for the second time in two months an evil monster attempted to take the life of President Trump. Thankfully no one was injured at the golf course. This is not a matter that we take lightly. Your safety is always top priority. We ask that you remain vigilant in your daily comings and goings, be observant, maintain a constant level of situational awareness. We are also told that for at least some time period after this assassination attempt, they did close down the West Palm Beach, or at least locked down the West Palm Beach campaign offices. They had done the same thing after the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. They're clearly trying to make sure that everyone around Donald Trump is safe. But also, you hear them they're encouraging and urging people to remain vigilant, to keep their eyes open. They believe there is potentially an ongoing security threat. But again, a big -- a huge notable event here. We are now talking about the second assassination attempt in roughly two months. But on top of that lots of questions still as to how exactly and why exactly this happened again. Kristen Holmes, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Tim, listen, political violence, you know better than me, has sadly been part of this country's history too often and going back centuries, really, and you could -- you could list the presidents Reagan, Ford attempt, Kennedy, sadly successful, Truman, McKinley, Lincoln, it's -- it's -- it's a sad litany.
