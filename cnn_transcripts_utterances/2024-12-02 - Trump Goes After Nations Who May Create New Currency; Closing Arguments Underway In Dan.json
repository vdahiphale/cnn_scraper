I mean, the global south. in particular, but also, you know, obviously Russia and China, have become increasingly ostracized and increasingly pushed out of the U.S. financial system by our own economic sanctions, by our own financial penalties.Which are, you know, people here would say with good reason, are responding to bad actions taken by those countries. But it spurred this interest in saying, you know, if -- if the U.S. can, with -- with a sort of a flip of a switch, you know, prevent a commodity from getting into China, that they need, let's say, to power, you know, their A.I. or their other sort of semiconductor industries, for instance, which the U.S. has effectively done, at what point do those countries say we need to build our own network of payment systems to prevent the U.S. from hitting us? And I think part of the big problem here, right, is that these countries are very factionally divided among themselves. So while they are sort of ostensibly unified in the idea that they oppose sort of Western hegemony and want to be able to do these important trades outside sort of the all-seeing U.S. eye. But at the same time, right. Putin, for instance, has an ICC warrant out for his arrest. And so he, you know, was not able to go to South Africa, which is another sort of founding, quote, unquote, \"BRICS member,\" for their conference last year. India and China are also unified in this ostensible alliance but are becoming increasingly divided as sort of the next rising superpowers. India has actually strengthened its ties over the last couple of years with the U.S. to counter China's rise. So it's - it's a little hard. I mean, the impetus makes sense. The rationale behind it makes sense. But there's a lot of reasons to be suspicious that this is a real threat to the (INAUDIBLE). Obviously, Trump, especially at the start of his administration, wants to set this threat up to be as menacing as possible so he can take credit if it doesn't materialize. A lot of the experts I talked to said there's -- you know, this thing doesn't exist yet, so him threatening it, you know, and precluding it from happening is -- is kind of a threat without a purpose at this point.",

      "sentences": "That's right. Now, for nearly more than two hours, we have been hearing from defense attorney, Steve Raiser.Tried to put the jury back into the subway car. He has tried to paint this picture for them, describing a subway car filled with passengers that he said were, quote, \"frozen in fear.\" Now he has tried to do this, to try and explain why Danny -- Daniel Penny took action. He said that those passengers were afraid when they saw Jordan Neely get on the train and began acting erratically. And he said that Penny stepped in to protect others because of his training as a Marine. That he felt the need to make sure that other people were safe. Now, he said that it's actually not an accident, that there's no video of the entire struggle between Penny and Jordan Neely because, he said, people were frozen in fear and did not start recording until Jordan Neely had been subdued by Penny. Now there's another very interesting point that Raiser has tried to make so far, and that is about the amount of pressure that Penny used while he was holding Neely in that chokehold. That's important because the city medical examiner said that Neely had died as a result of pressure applied during the chokehold. In fact, he has been referring to that choke hold as a, quote, \"civilian restraint.\" And he has said that he could have used a different maneuver that he was trained on but decided not to do it. The reason for that, Raiser said, quote, \"He's an architectural student,\" he said of Penny. \"He's a surfer. He's a musician. He's a caring friend, brother and son. That's the softer side of Danny that informed him not to choose -- to choose not to use a textbook Marine chokehold.\" Very interesting point by Raiser here, considering that the Marine trainer who showed Penny how to do this maneuver testified that he had used it incorrectly. Another point Raiser has been making is that the prosecution was rushed to bring charges as a result of political pressure. You might remember just how many protests there we're here in the city following the incident. We are expecting the defense to wrap up their closing arguments in the next few hours -- Boris?",

Sarah Boone was found guilty in October of second-degree murder. Prosecutors said that her boyfriend voluntarily climbed into the bag during a game of hide and seek. But Boone then zipped it, recording herself, taunting him and ignoring his pleas to get out. She went to sleep, they said, with him still trapped inside. And she is facing up to life in prison. Also, after a disastrous tenure, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger is out. He took on that role in 2021, tasked with reviving the tech giant. But under his leadership, Intel's stock has tanked 61 percent, due, in large part, to Intel missing the A.I. boom and being surpassed by most of its rivals.

He told a London audience at a performance of \"The Devil Wears Prada\" musical that he still cannot see months after suffering a severe eye infection in his right eye.
