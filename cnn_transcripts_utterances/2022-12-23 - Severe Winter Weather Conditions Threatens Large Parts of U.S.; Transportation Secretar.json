Yesterday, the delays and cancellations were primary focused in the Midwest and the west. Today it's going to be the airports in the east that will be the big concern. LaGuardia ranks the top as the number of cancellations go. Seattle, we see Chicago still in top spots, here in O'Hare and at Midway. Detroit, 42 percent of all flights have been cancelled. It's a major hub for Delta Airlines.Also, we're going to see some cancellations climbing in Boston and in D.C. the FAA says what will drive delays and cancellations is really the ground game that airports are playing right now, how quickly they can de-ice planes and get them on their way. I want you to listen now to United Airlines head of network operations Joe Heins. He told me that it's really not the snow that is causing all of these delays and cancellations. It's more the biting cold. The high temperatures here forecast at Chicago O'Hare, United's biggest hub, only one degree Fahrenheit today, and that's not factoring in the windchill. Listen.

One of the big challenges now is that there's simply not all that many seats if you get booked on to a new flight. Passenger volume is up, but the number of seats remains still pretty low. One other interesting delay that's coming into the mix here, we're hearing from HPS, FedEx, and the United States Postal Service, they are putting into place some contingency plans about delayed shipments for Christmas, those presents arriving on your doorstep.

If the indication from the forecasts and local authorities is that you can drive but you need to do it with caution, take those steps. We've got recommendations on our website. You can see that with local authorities, too, about how to make sure your car is equipped for winter weather, that you are using a car seat in a way that's safe with the blanket and jackets on the outside of the straps, not the inside, just those kinds of steps that will make it safe.But if they're saying don't drive, don't drive. The president indicated just how serious this is. We're seeing things like I-90 actually closed outright in parts of South Dakota and Minnesota last I saw. That is not a step that authorities take lightly, closing an interstate. So you really want to make sure that you're paying attention to those local warnings because these temperatures that we're seeing, especially in the middle part of the country, that can turn an ordinary fender bender into something much more dangerous.",

You can see it right here. Already this morning, in this section, we have seen four cars spin out of control. That car right there, that vehicle, that SUV is the long one that is just stuck. It can't move because of the ice. Not only is this ice on this road hard to drive on what is absolutely impossible to walk on. I got a chance myself -- to see for myself that it is ice for sure. And for the most part, people are having trouble going up the hill, also down the hill, as you see we just crashed our car right here. Also, with people coming down this hill right here, people are ending up that hill, for sure. So, I've been in contact with several sources and with local hospitals. Thankfully, no one has shown up to a hospital this morning due to injuries because any of the car crashes that have happened are as -- being spun out of control here in the city of Memphis.

We're used to snow We're used to the temperatures dropping but, of course, the swiftness with which this arctic blast came barreling through was just remarkable. We're talking about a 75-degree temperature swing from roughly 50 degrees on Wednesday when I was on air to minus 24 degrees Thursday morning. And those numbers don't do justice to how it actually feels to the human body to the skin outside. Wind chills of negative 60 -- approaching negative 60 In some parts of Colorado, that's the kind of condition that can cause frostbite to exposed skin within minutes. Folks being urged to stand indoors -- to stay indoors. Colorado's Governor activated the National Guard to help with extreme cold weather conditions. Now, we did see this massive Denver Coliseum opened up and converted into a 24-hour warming center to get folks out of the cold but there was so much demand on that they have to open up two more emergency warming centers to keep people out of those freezing uncomfortable painful conditions. Most of the city is hunkering down, we are seeing some car traffic. And there is, of course, good news on the horizon for us. We're expecting these cold wind chills until about 11:00 a.m. local time but then the temperatures will finally start climbing above zero. We've had nearly 35 hours -- consecutive hours of temperatures below zero. But we couldn't be back to 50 degrees by Christmas. Good news for us. Not so good for you guys as that storm moves your way, Don.",

The forecasts for this event are quite remarkable, especially the cold air outbreak which was highlighted in Climate Prediction Center outlooks over two weeks ago, there was a signal in the atmosphere that there was a growing pool of arctic air across the polar regions, and that that air was going to spill south across the Canadian border into the plains and then eventually to the East Coast. We are just minutes away on the east coast here from getting the arctic cold frontal passage, and we will see temperatures drop 10 to 20 degrees in about an hour. One of the big concerns is we've had a lot of rain overnight, and some of those roadways will quickly freeze up once that cold air starts to come into the East Coast.And, of course, it's across the rest of the country as well. 67-degree wind chills down across parts of the Great Plains. Right now, we've got a lot of rain and high winds across parts of the Northeast, possibly taking power out and also causing major delays as far as the air traffic system goes.",

However, this system has some similarities to a major blizzard that occurred across the Midwest back in 1978. So, over 40 years ago, we had a very similar situation occur with a very deep cyclone located over the Great Lakes and causing similar problems. The forecast in that event were not great. And in fact, that gives you an idea of how far we've come in the forecasting and the science of meteorology that we're able to foresee this event over a week in advance.",

It does look like a late Christmas present for parts of the south and southeast. We will see a moderation trend and temperatures will come back above freezing right after Christmas in those areas.
