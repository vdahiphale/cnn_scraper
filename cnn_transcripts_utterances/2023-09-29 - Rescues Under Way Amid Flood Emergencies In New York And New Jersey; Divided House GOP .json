Right now, we're following multiple breaking stories. We'll have the latest on the government shutdown. That's coming up shortly.

What actually looks like a rushing stream here leads up to the entrance to Brooklyn's Prospect Park, all of this coming out of the park and eventually onto the roadways. Because of that break, though, Wolf, if we have seen more people venture out, not only on foot, but also on the roadway, in their vehicles.

You mentioned the subway system that was partially paralyzed earlier this morning, all three of the major New York City airports also feeling an impact, however, no closures to report, no closures to report at the airport.

And how do you explain why this is happening to the millions of Americans who will go unpaid and lose so many other key government functions? REP. MARCUS MOLINARO (R-NY):  I think that's what's important. We'll have to start with. There is simply no excuse. This could have been and still can be averted. But there are two -- there are members both within the Republican conference and, quite frankly, there are even Democrats unwilling to cross over the line in order to, in this case even today, support a short-term funding mechanism that at least focused our attention on border security and confronted the massive amount of federal spending that you know Americans want us to confront. But, you know, we are working hard, believe me. There are members like myself working hard because we understand the impact.

Anyone who thinks that the end result isn't going to be bipartisan, I have a bridge in New York to sell you.But the truth is the strongest position for us has always been to confront the massive amount of federal spending that's, quite frankly, the Democrats, one party, stuffed into this economy that drove up inflation and to confront border security. The fact that we haven't gotten there just is inexcusable. It's not something that we should accept.

She ran a great race for governor, didn't make it, but people loved her. She had an easy time winning. I, on the other hand, was in asterisks in the polls. And she grabbed my hand and she never let it go. And we faced discrimination.

And that's just to take a couple examples from the transportation space alone. The extremism has taken a hold. I think it's just a few fringe members of the Republican Party in Congress.

He said if the Senate drops Ukraine aid, does not include it in its plan, and then he says, perhaps, they can get a deal and get this through the House. His exact words were, I think if we hit a clean continuing resolution without Ukraine on it, we could probably move that through. I think if the Senate puts Ukraine on their, it focuses Ukraine over America, I think that could cause real problems. Now, just to unpack this a bit, Wolf, the Senate right now is trying to move a bill along bipartisan lines to keep the government open, until mid November, including in that plan, $6 billion in disaster aid for national disaster relief and $6 billion in aid to Ukraine. That is what McCarthy in particular is concerned about, even as there is bipartisan support in Congress to continue providing money for Ukraine, in its war against Russia, there is opposition within the House GOP conference for doing that, for continuing the funding. McCarthy wants to move separately. Now, in the aftermath of McCarthy's efforts that have failed this afternoon to get his conference on the same page on one bill, he's indicated a little bit of movement. In that bill that fell to date, Wolf, it included spending cuts and border security money as well. McCarthy is not indicating that is the red line, he's indicating Ukraine aid is.
