      "sentences": "Well, Dana, what we have just learned in the past few moments, sources have told our colleague Kaitlan Collins and myself that the ball essentially is an Israel's court, that it has to be approved by Israel's government.There are several different groups within the Israeli government, the war cabinet, security cabinet, and then the broader cabinet, who have to vote on this deal in order to get it approved by the Israeli side. But, otherwise, the deal is essentially all set and done. In terms of what we expect to play out after an announcement is made is that, over the course of the next few days, four to five days, we are told, there will be a pause, a halt to the military fighting in Gaza between Hamas and Israel. And during those four to five days, some 50 hostages held by Israel -- held by Hamas -- excuse me -- would be released. They are all women and children. They're all civilians. At the same time, around 150 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel would be released from Israeli prisons. That ratio of three to one would also apply for more hostage and prisoner releases going forward, because, Dana, there is a chance that, after that four-to-five-day pause that, if things go well, that we could see more hostages released. So we would expect that, during that pause, there would be a rolling release of around 10 to 12 of these Hamas hostages, women and children, released per day. Now, remember, we have reported that these hostages have been held around the Gaza Strip. They have been held by different factions of Hamas, by different militant groups, including Palestinian Islamic Jihad. There are two more major components to this agreement, as we understand it, Dana. Hamas has demanded more and continued humanitarian aid to go into the Gaza Strip, hundreds of trucks per day, up from the around 150 per day that we have seen, to closer to 300 or 400 trucks per day. What we think the obstacle is there is the inspection mechanism. Israel has wanted to have oversight over everything that is going into the Gaza Strip, so we still need to understand better how the implementation would happen of those trucks going into Gaza. And then finally, Dana, there was also the question of surveillance drones. All over Gaza, in the skies above Gaza, you have these Israeli surveillance drones flying quite low, collecting data on Hamas, trying to figure out where these hostages are. This deal, we understand, includes a pause of six hours, during which time -- six hours per day, during which time these drones would not be allowed to fly above Gaza. But you can be sure, Dana, that there are other ways for Israel to peer into the Gaza Strip during these pauses. The last thing I will say, Dana, is that it is, of course, terrific news that some 50 hostages are expected to be released. At the same time, there are 240 believed to be in Gaza right now. So this would be a distinct minority, a small part, just around 20 percent of the overall group of hostages taken by Hamas and others back on October 7.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, I think it's fair to say, Dana, that feelings here are very mixed.I mean, obviously, there's a great deal of excitement, happiness at the fact that this deal looks like it's going to be done. There's a government meeting right now under way in which it's expected that the Israeli government will approve this hostage swap deal in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. But, obviously, as Alex was mentioning, it's going to be 50 people, maybe a few more than 50 people, if Hamas, according to Israeli government sources that I have spoken to, are prepared to offer up more hostages, in exchange for pauses in the fighting from Israel side. And the people, of course, the hostages who are first in line to be released, according to what we know, are going to be the women and they're going to be the children. And, of course, that's fantastic news. But it means that there's lots of other people that will not be included in this first wave. And so, again, mixed feelings. I spoke to one woman earlier whose nephew is from the settlement of Be'eri, which was attacked, like so many others, on October the 7th. And his parents were killed. He's 38 years old. He was taken into Gaza. There's no chance, they say, no chance of him being released in this wave, if ever. And so it is with immense sort of mixed feelings and sadness that people are preparing for this very big potentially hostage release that could be agreed later on. But, look, just to quickly give you a sense of the level of feeling, every night here in central Tel Aviv, just outside the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, people, ordinary Israelis, not just families, but sympathizers are coming out and they're laying this huge table out, a place set for every single one of the hostages that are held inside the Gaza Strip by Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups. You can see there are cuddly toys, there are children's seats, children's lollipops, places for the many children that are held hostage in Gaza, also adult places as well, of course. And so it's just a sort of mark, a memorial to the fact that these people are still away from their homes, they're still being held. And nobody knows how many of them, of course, are still alive. The other point that I want to put across very quickly is that there is a great deal of anger in -- amongst this group of people about how the Israeli government has handled this crisis, has handled this conflict. The overwhelming view of people I speak to here is that the number one priority shouldn't have been destroying Hamas. It should have been getting Israeli citizens out of Gaza. And people here are, frankly, very angry that the government's priority, they believe, has been the opposite, has been destroying Hamas, and then bringing, getting the civilians out afterwards. And they say they will not forgive the Israeli government for making that cynical, in their words, decision.",

Israel cannot start a war without approval of the security cabinet and Israel cannot go into a pause, as it's called right now in that regard. And the controversy is around the fact that there are two contradicting goals that the government, that the security cabinet has approved for this war that can be contradicting. The first is to remove Hamas from its ruling Gaza, and not only to win it over, but also to free Gaza from Hamas' terror organization. They turned against their own people. The second, of course, is to bring back all of the hostages, alive, if possible, meaning as soon as possible. And those two things, it's difficult to reconcile the two of them. And there is controversy among the security cabinet. I expect this to be approved. Israel has delayed for several weeks. As Becky explained before, this has been in the making for several weeks, because the demand was to bring back as many as possible, and not to break the women and children group apart and slice it up, the way Hamas wanted, because it's like playing with our emotions. And as I understand it right now, there is a -- the full group can be released. Hamas has said that they're all alive. And I expect this to be approved. I have to say that there is nothing to celebrate here. I mean, this will bring relief to some of the families, but, by and large, this doesn't end the war. Until all...",

Talk about the implications of that.COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Yes, Dana, the real implication is that this gives them a potential gap in their intelligence coverage. So, every time the Israelis fly a drone, they're, of course, gathering intelligence. Imagery intelligence, signals intelligence are the general sources that they use. And the key thing is that, during that time, Hamas fighters can move into position. They can potentially set up ambushes. They can lay IEDs, do things like that.
