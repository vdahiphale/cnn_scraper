      "sentences": "Good evening from New York and welcome to this 360 CNN Town Hall with former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. I'm Anderson Cooper.Tonight, on the eve of former President Donald Trump's arraignment in Miami on 37 federal counts, we're going to hear directly from Governor Christie who announced his candidacy just six days ago. Christie, as you know, ran in 2016, dropped out after New Hampshire, and endorsed then-candidate Trump two weeks later. Christie enters the race again dominated by the former president, will be battling a growing number of rivals for the chance to take on President Joe Biden. Tonight, voters will have the opportunity to question the former governor directly about the issues on their minds. And I'll have a chance to ask questions of my own. This town hall is part of the Republican primary process. And so, the audience tonight are voters who say they plan to participate in their state's Republican nominating contest. The audience comes from New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, as well as the four Republican early primary states -- Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada. To find tonight's questioners, we reached out to Republican-affiliated business groups, also young professional and advocacy organizations. A few guests of the Christie campaign are also in the family -- in the audience, as well as the family members. They will not be asking any questions however. We've asked everyone here to be respectful to voters in the room and at home so they have a chance to hear from the candidate. Please welcome former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. (APPLAUSE)",

I am convinced that if he goes back to the White House, that the next four years will be all about him settling scores, Anderson, with everybody who he thinks wasn't perfectly nice to him, you know? And the bottom line is that if you're lucky enough to become the president of the United States, every day, you should wake up thinking about what you do for the people of this country, not what scores you need to settle for yourself. And he has shown himself -- and I think most particularly in his post-presidency -- to be completely self- centered, completely self-consumed, and doesn't give a damn about the American people, in my view, if what the American people want is in conflict with what Donald Trump is best for him.

I mean, battle plans against Iran, nuclear secrets, the presidential daily brief, which has the most important intelligence information that anyone in the country can get. These are not his personal documents. This isn't, like, his doodle notes on his pad or, like, a nice, you know, newspaper article about himself. These are intelligence documents created by the government of the United States. It's our property, and the government is supposed to have that stuff, not laying around. That's one. Two, to suggest to your lawyers that they should lie in response to a grand jury subpoena -- I've had a number of people ask me, why did his lawyer make those voice memos about each meeting? I know why he did because this guy was asking him to lie and break the law, and he wanted a contemporaneous recording of exactly what was happening when it was happening because he also knew that Donald Trump, as he's done before, would throw his lawyer under the bus and say his lawyer was lying. The third thing is he is voluntarily putting our country through this. If at any point before the search in August of '22 he had just done what anyone I suspect in this audience would have done which is said, all right, you're serious? You're serving a grand jury subpoena? Let me just give the documents back. He wouldn't have been charged.

And he wants to continue to pretend he's president. He wants the trappings of the presidency around him. And I think one of those trappings is these documents that he could wave around to people as they detail in the indictment, this is secret. I can't show you. I might have been able to show you but now I can't, but this is what it's about. I had someone call me right after the raid last August and say, you know him so well, is he trying to sell these things to a foreign government? Is he trying to blackmail somebody? I said, oh, for God's sake, stop. This is just to show off. It's just to show off. And it turned out to be right. This -- and that's what makes it so ridiculous that we're here and we're in a situation where there are people in my own party who are blaming DOJ. How about blame him? He did it. He kept -- he took documents he wasn't supposed to take. He kept them when he asked them back for them? They got a grand jury subpoena. He refused to comply.

And then Trump kind of implodes and goes away, then you're more likely to vote for me. How about we do this? How about you decide who is the most honest, forthright leader who has common sense and will put you first and let's put that person behind the desk in the Oval Office? How about we stop these games? And I think that's a game where you want -- and, look. I've said this before, Anderson. I was someone who thought Hillary Clinton should have been prosecuted, and I think it was wrong. And I think Jim Comey made a mess of the FBI and he made a mess of that case. Loretta Lynch, I don't know what she was thinking about in letting Jim Comey announce that no reasonable prosecutor would prosecute that case. He's the FBI director. It's not your decision. It's the attorney general's decision. And that has made some Republicans rightfully feel like there's two standards. We can have that argument and we should. And we should have that argument because it's wrong. And I can tell you this, if I'm president of the United States, one thing you can count on for sure, there's going to be an attorney general who I say to him or her, day one, go do your job, and unless you need me for something, leave me alone. Just go and do your job without fear or favor or partisanship. And that's what we need as an attorney general. And I think we can have that argument and discussion, and we should. But that should not allow these other candidates to then say, oh, but I don't want to talk about anything else. I saw Lee Zeldin yesterday tying himself in knots to not answer, what do you think of the conduct? Look, everybody, whether you like Donald Trump or you don't like Donald Trump, this conduct is inexcusable, in my opinion, for somebody who wants to be president of the United States. Let's say, for instance, I'm looking at these two leading candidates right now, at Joe Biden and at Donald Trump. Let's say it's 60 years now since the Cuban missile crisis. Let's say there was a Cuban missile crisis again. And by the way, China's putting surveillance in Cuba as we speak. So, this is not a far-fetched example. Do you think Joe Biden could actually handle it? Do you think he's up to it at his age? And secondly, would you trust Donald Trump's judgment after all of this to handle something like that? I think the answer to both those questions is no, and that's why I'm running for president.",

Sorry about that.But, look, I think -- and I said at the time -- that the Russia business was complete baloney right off the jump. I was involved in that campaign in 2016 with Donald Trump. Let me tell you something, I can guarantee you there was no colluding going on. They were trying to figure out how to get from New York to Wisconsin, okay? They were not -- colluding with the Russians was the last thing they were thinking about, okay? And I spoke out right from the beginning that I thought that Jim Comey in particular made the decision that he didn't believe Donald Trump should be president. And that's wrong. I think it was wrong Hillary wasn't prosecuted. I think it was wrong that Jim Comey wasn't brought to justice for the things that happened at the FBI. So, yes, I'm against the weaponization of the Justice Department. I'm the only person in this race, other than Governor Hutchinson, who was also a U.S. attorney, but I ran the fifth largest attorney's office in the country. I know how important this is. And I was in a blue state where Democrats were looking all the time to this Republican U.S. attorney going, what's he going to do? We did 130 political corruption prosecutions. And never once, never once on any of those prosecutions did anybody say we were playing politics. And we got guilty verdicts or guilty pleas on every single one of them, 130-0. [20:15:12] That's the kind of Justice Department I want that, you know, goes and does justice. When I would swear in a new assistant U.S. attorney, the last thing I would make him do before I gave him the oath was, I'd make him read the -- read the seal. And they'd say: \"The Latin part?\" I would say: \"No, no, no, the English part.\" They'd say: \"Department of Justice.\" I would say: \"Does that say Department of Prosecution?\" It doesn't. It says Department of Justice. And the job of the attorney general of the United States in a Christie administration would make sure justice is done for every single American, Republican, independent, Democrat, black, white, brown, conservative, liberal. It doesn't matter. Justice needs to be done, and we need to restore faith in our justice system. But none of that, with all due respect to Governor DeSantis, none of that excuses you from talking about the conduct that Donald Trump is engaged in, because, in the end, the person you put behind that desk, it's their character, it's what's in their heart that is going to matter in how they make decisions.

I will say this about with the job that Chris has done. Every person that was in leadership under Jim Comey's FBI is gone and has been gone for a long time. And the law enforcement community knows the FBI is doing a good job, because, while everything else in this country, in terms of law enforcement, is being degraded, and they're not being able to recruit people, the FBI has record applications to it now. And so I think there's a lot to be said for what Chris has done, in terms of the job he's done. And you know what? I'm sure he's made some mistakes too, because all of us do in public life. And so we're not going to hold him to that standard. But the standard I'm going to hold him to is the one I just told you, which is justice is to be done.

And it's been going on for a long time now. And I'd remind everybody that's a Republican U.S. attorney in Delaware, Donald Trump's appointee, who's handling the Hunter Biden case. So that's an important fact to know that Donald Trump never talks about. But, in the end, I think this is a bigger, broader problem, because I think there were problems inside the Trump administration too. I don't think that Jeff Sessions should have ever recused himself from the Russia investigation. I wouldn't have appointed Bob Mueller to be special counsel. If I were attorney general, I would have handled the investigation. And I think all of those steps makes Republicans, in particular -- and I know that Democrats complained a little bit during the Trump years too. But Republicans, in particular, feel like there's two sets of standards. What we need to do is reassure people by putting someone who has done this in charge. And I have done it. And they're going to know by looking at my record as U.S. attorney in New Jersey that it's going to be done fair and upright. And it doesn't matter who -- which party it is.

Understand that when I say you have got to be willing to compromise, it means you're not going to get 100 percent of what you want all the time. But if you get 80 percent of a Republican principle, rather than zero percent of anything, that's a win. And I think we have got to redefine how this works. I know people don't want you to compromise. And I'm not saying that I will just go -- you have seen me operate. I don't go and lay down, OK? I fight. But the skill in this business is to fight and fight and fight, and then know when the moment is to take your win and go and move on to the next topic. There are so many problems we have to deal with in this country. Who would you rather have to deal with the problem of rampant crime in our cities all over this country? I have done this. In the city of Camden, New Jersey -- and you know this -- 10 years ago, it was the most dangerous city in America. You know what I did? And I don't think this is compromising Republican principles. I fired the entire Camden City Police Department. The union sued me. I won. And we created a new police department that emphasized three things, accountability, community policing, and violence de-escalation, took them out of cars, put them on bicycles and on foot, so that they would and get to know the people in the city, and the people would get to know them. You know what the result is? The stats just came out this week, the 10-year anniversary of the firing of that department. Murder rates in Camden are down 75 percent from 10 years ago. We need to bring commonsense solutions to these problems with someone who's done it. I have been there. I have done it. I have done it in the toughest state. Maybe New York and California and Illinois may be a little bit tougher than New Jersey on being a Republican. But we are at least a suitable fourth, and we may be higher. I have done it in the toughest place it can be done. So I'm ready to go to Washington now and make it work for Republican values in the right way.",

We got convinced that we should all fight amongst ourselves, myself, Marco Rubio, JEB Bush, John Kasich, kind of the establishment lane of the party. And that somehow it was going to be like the NCAA tournament, you know? We were going to advance to the next round and we were going to face the winner of Trump and Cruz and Carson and Fiorina.Well, guess what? By the time we all got done fighting with each other, Trump won the nomination. We cannot let that happen this time. And I will not let it happen this time. I'm going to take him on directly, and not because I don't like him. I'm going to take him on directly because he's the leader. Like, how do you -- that's what I don't understand the other candidates who won't even mention his name. I watched that Joni Ernst \"roast and ride\" thing. It was like he was Voldemort from \"Harry Potter.\" Like, nobody wanted to mention his name. You know -- you know, someone who's leaning backwards and looking backwards.

I think, like I said before, they're playing politics. The second one is, some of them are afraid. They're afraid of him. Look what he does. Right? I've got a nickname now. I never got one all through '16. I got one now, which is really nice. Makes me feel even more important. I'm -- I'm just telling you, I've known him for 22 years. The only thing he understands is force. The only thing he understands is coming right at him and making your case. And if these other candidates don't want to do it, the American people and Republican primary voters have to start to understand this. When did it -- when did we get to the point we're always blaming our adversaries for the weakness of our candidates? Oh, it's the Democrats' fault, it's DoJ's fault, it's this person's fault, it's the media's fault. How about, it's his? He hasn't won a damn thing since 2016. Three-time loser. 2018, we lost the House. 2020, we lost the White House. We lost the United States Senate a couple of weeks later in 2021. And in 2022, we lost two more governorships, another Senate seat, and barely took the House of Representatives when Joe Biden had the most first incompetent two years I've ever seen in my life. Loser, loser, loser. Now we're getting going. It'll be different this time. Why? Why will it be different this time? Those arguments need to be made. And I'm not afraid to make them for two reasons.

I had absolutely nothing to do with it, no knowledge of it. I was appalled by it. And I had nothing to do with it.Now, the second question is, with all due respect, the more important one, which is, what did I learn? What I learned was every person you pick for a job in your government is important, no matter how distant they may be from you or close they are to you. And you've got to know you can trust those people to do the right thing because you can't watch them every minute of the day. In New Jersey I had 60,000 employees. In the federal government, you have a couple million. And so you can't every day watch everything they do. But you need to set an example that tells them this is unacceptable on my watch and it won't happen. And I'll be much better at that. Believe me. With the way all that happened, it's not a lesson that you forget. And so, I'm glad you asked the question because people do need to know. But what they need to know is this. I came out the day after all this happened, and I stood up for an hour and 50 minutes on national television and took every question from every national and local reporter until they had no more questions left. If you're guilty of anything, you don't do that. I did it, and I regret what happened, and I feel I am accountable for it because it happened on my watch.

For the last 50 years, we have been investing in China to try to bring them into the community of nations and to try to make them better, because we thought it would make us better, too. And in some ways, it has. We have great trade with China over a long period of time. And by great, I mean a large volume of it.But the Chinese have taken advantage of our good nature, stealing our intellectual property, spying on us, causing trouble around the world, unfair trade deals. And it's time for that to stop now. They're no longer a fledgling economy. They're the second largest economy in the world and inching up on us. And so what I would do on tariffs would be to say, \"Look, they don't like those tariffs -- and those tariffs also increase prices for some of us, right? But we're not going to get rid of that stuff until they decide to be fair on those other things.\" You come up with a great idea, intellectual property, you should be able to own that. And if they want to use it, they pay you for it, not steal it from you. TikTok is here in this country. We let them in. Facebook and Twitter are not in China. They want Facebook -- they're going to let Facebook, Twitter and our social media into China, I'll let TikTok stay. If they don't, TikTok goes, in a Christie administration. They need to understand that we will be fair, but we won't be chumps. And so I don't want to give that away on the CNN town hall in June of 2023. I want to use it as a card that we can negotiate with going forward, smartly, so that we -- we right this relationship. Because, if we don't right this relationship, it will be the relationship that defines the world for the next 50 years. And I'd rather that -- have that be a prosperous, fair, competitive relationship, rather than a relationship that involves warfare.",

That was the last time I heard from him during the seven days of intensive care. The end of the story is that he got out of the hospital before I did.He went back on the campaign trail. Two reporters who were on Air Force One with him on his first trip called me and said, look, we're not supposed to tell you this because it's off the record, but we're going to tell you because we're so appalled by it. He came back to the press cabin today and an off the record and said to us that you gave him COVID.

Two years ago, my son's professors talked about how fortunate his class would be to be graduating into such a strong economy and job market. Fast forward to today and my son's job search is still ongoing. He does have some prospects, so.And my husband and I wonder, once he does get a job, how can he possibly afford to live on his own with the economy and inflation as it is? What are your thoughts on the factors that have contributed to today's poor economy and what is your plan to address it?",

      "sentences": "Well, I have a 2023 graduate, too, who's here tonight, so I can relate to this very directly and personally.First, as I said before, the out-of-control old government spending has created this inflation. I mean, even Larry Summers, who I don't agree with much on, former Democratic Treasury Secretary warned Joe Biden, don't do this spending. It's going to cause the inflation. So first, we need to bring spending down, and we've talked about that before. Second, the reinstitution of all these regulations, it's just a job killer. Every dollar they spend complying with regulation is a dollar they're not going to spend to create a job. We got to do that. Third, I really want to spend more in this country on vocational education. You know, for you and I and our college age graduates, that cake is already baked. And hopefully the combination of bringing inflation back under control, which will bring interest rates down, which will allow businesses to then reinvest in, expanding and growing, will create the jobs for them. But we also have to look at folks a few years earlier maybe who college isn't the right thing for them. We have a lot of jobs out there. We have 1.7 empty jobs, right, for every one person who's unemployed, but we don't have the skills. Those people are not skilled in the jobs that we need. So I really believe there's got to be more of an emphasis on vocational education in this country. You know, the aspiration of college is wonderful. Like, I'm really glad that people in this country now feel like there's almost no barriers to them being able to get a four-year college education, but only if that's what they want, and only if that's what's best for them. And we have to show people that we value vocational training. We value the building trades. We value people who don't need a four-year college education to do what their passion is in their life or what they believe can make them the best living. So I think we need to have much more of a focus on that, and the federal government should be encouraging that. And so those are the three immediate ways that I would go about doing that. And the answer on China before and how we deal with those issues would be helpful with that as well.",
