      "sentences": "Right. Max, I think, look, obviously, the dye was cast before people even went to the ballots in many ways.But I think this election in some ways has revealed two things, one that, you know, even without potential ballot stuffing or other forms of vote rigging, the Kremlin has effectively over the past 24 years built a political system entirely around one man, that these policies of repression, the propaganda, that they are, in a sense, working. You know, people in Russia may not like the war. It's incredibly costly. They may not like 7 percent inflation or 16 percent interest rates. But they have been taught by the propaganda not to associate this with Putin, not to blame him for any of this. So I think on the one hand, we see that functioning well in this election. But on the other hand, as Matthew's piece so clearly showed, this election has revealed -- has exposed this undercurrent of dissatisfaction in a sort of strange twist of irony that may have actually contributed to those turnout numbers. You saw those lines outside polling booths. I was out in London talking to Russian voters here, and one group of 28-year-olds told me that this was the first time they'd actually participated in elections. Admittedly, they'd have had one other opportunity. But they said, look, this is a moment in our history. I spoke to a key ally of Alexei Navalny, who said, look, we don't think we can change anything now, but we want to make sure that we're a unified political force and we're ready to take part in the next stage of Russia's development. So I think in some ways it has ignited this sort of opposition sentiment, and that is going to be a key part of how this election sort of goes down in Russian history. But overall, look, this means more Putin. This means more repression. It means more confrontation with the West, more war in Ukraine. But I think we need to closely monitor what follows from those acts of defiance that Matthew laid out.",

As I say, people may not like the war, but not link that with Vladimir Putin.That is what certainly the Russians that I speak to say, those outside the country mainly, that they are just not linking the policies that they might find distasteful with Putin himself, partly because what we see in the propaganda so often, and you saw it with him railing against the U.S. in his post-election speech, is that the West is so heavily scapegoated and blamed for what happens in Russia that people have learned to disassociate that from Putin himself. So he is presenting this as a new mandate to continue the war. You can see that part of that involves a militarization of society. One of the first things he did in his post-election speech was thank the troops on the front line for creating the conditions for Russia's future development. But I think it's not guaranteed, certainly, that the population overall supports this. And I think that exposes -- that this decision to go to war and to continue it now in its third year is inherently risky for Putin.",

But generally, I just think that there is a groundswell of support across both the political left as well as some elements of the political right that just don't want Donald Trump in office. And so they're willing to take their checkbook out and write checks to the Biden administration. I mean, we actually saw something very similar with Nikki Haley, even despite the fact that she had no legitimate shot of winning the Republican nomination. There were a few select donors, even on the right, who were really willing to support her regardless of that fact. So, you know, this is good news for Biden.

And I think anyone expecting Trump to change course now heading into the general election is really missing the mark. It doesn't track with his rhetoric or his record. In 2016 and 2020, Trump really dialed up the language heading into the general election. That includes specifically his comments surrounding immigration. So it's unsurprising.

It's apocalyptic rhetoric. It's designed to trigger a visceral reaction.There are ways to speak about problems that aren't so incendiary, but Trump doesn't want to do that. I mean, he knows what he's doing. He wants to whip up anger. That's part of the demagoguery. Plus, I think if we're putting Trump's remarks in context, which we should, it's important to point out, as you noted at the outset, that in the same speech, he praised January 6 rioters as patriots. He said America might not have any more meaningful elections if he doesn't win in 2024. So I think that this is very much a harbinger of what we can expect going into the general election.",

Officials there say there's been no damage so far to critical infrastructure but adding that the lava flow has slowed pretty substantially. Seismic activity also decreased overnight. Airports on the island are operating as normal.Now the heat index in Rio de Janeiro just set a new record high and it's the second day in a row that the Brazilian city has broken the old record for thermal sensation. Thermal sensation uses temperature and humidity data like the heat index or fields like temperature. One Rio neighborhood hit 62.3 degrees Celsius or 144 degrees Fahrenheit on Sunday. Officials say it's the highest thermal sensation temperature since the Rio alert system began in 2014. Now Tuesday officially marks the end of winter in the northern hemisphere but in the U.S. at least 22 million people in the Deep South are under a freeze watch. Cities in the northeastern U.S. such as New York may see a brief spike with temperatures Wednesday before they drop again. CNN meteorologist Ellisa Raffa has a look at the cold snap and the week ahead. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

That's going to send freezing cold temperatures as far south as Birmingham and Atlanta by Tuesday morning. Looking at those morning lows at 32 degrees, 30 degrees in Birmingham dropping to 27 degrees in Nashville where an average for this time of year across the mid-south is in the middle 40s. So definitely some unseasonably cold temperatures. We'll find those temperatures even on the cold side during the afternoon. Those daytime high temperatures will be about 10 to 15 degrees below average for a huge swath of the U.S. on Monday and then by Tuesday continuing to shift south and east. Those cold readings getting as far south as New Orleans and Jacksonville, Florida. Now some of these cold temperatures are a little bit more typical for January and February. Those highs in the 30s from Chicago to Cleveland, those are a little bit closer to average for early February. Even the warmer, relatively warmer highs in the upper 40s and low 50s from Memphis to Huntsville, those are a little bit more typical for mid-January. Same thing going into Tuesday as that cold slides east, your high temperature of 58 degrees in Atlanta is a little bit more typical for the middle of February. Now, this cold snap could cause some problems for agriculture because we just came off of the heels of the warmest winter on record. So fruit trees, flowers all kind of bloomed and blossomed a little bit early this year. Now that means they're vulnerable and at risk to frost and freeze damage with these cold temperatures coming in. We know that the growing season is getting longer because our winters are getting warmer. You can see a lot of these green dots showing places that add about a month or even more than that to the growing season for a lot of these places that are about to get the cold snap. For a place like Atlanta, they add about 34 days to the growing season, a whole other month again with that cold snap that could put anything that's blooming at risk. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
