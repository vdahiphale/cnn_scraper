As well as previous studies and plans from the state seeing that western Maui was very prone, more than 90 percent probability, of having wildfires. Yet, they're saying, they're alleging that the electric companies did not de-energize lines, did not power down, even though that is a tactic that the county says has been seen as successful in California here, Nevada, Oregon. And this is part of the lawsuit statement from the county saying, \"Defendants' inactions caused loss of life, severe injuries, complete destruction of homes and businesses, displacement of thousands of people, and damage to many of Hawaii's historic and cultural sites.\" But it's worth noting the CEO and president of Hawaii Electric made this statement on August 14th about the idea of de-energizing lines. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SHELEE KIMURA, CEO &amp; PRESIDENT, HAWAII ELECTRIC: It's worth noting that even in places where this has been used, it is controversial and it's not universally accepted. It's seen as -- can be seen as creating a hardship for those customers that have medical needs, that are higher risk. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You're seeing a lot of people, family members of people who are in Wagner, Wagner soldiers themselves coming here to pay their respects. This woman here, I don't know whether she speaks English. (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) She's not -- doesn't want to speak to us. It's not -- it's a quite solemn situation. There's another photograph of Prigozhin over there. This is very interesting because somebody here, look, has put this really heavy, really heavy sledgehammer here with Wagner written on it. The sledgehammer, of course, a potent symbol of the extreme violence that Wagner represented. And it's -- it was a sledgehammer like that that someone they regarded as a traitor was brutally executed with on camera. And it really kind of like bolstered this reputation that Wagner had as being this completely ruthless organization that did whatever it felt it had to, to fight for Russia. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Now we have seen the U.K. say effectively the same thing, it's highly likely that Prigozhin is now dead. But there is a bit of a hedge there, even as you see everybody appearing to converge toward the same conclusion that Prigozhin was dead. The question is, how do they know this? This is what I pressed Ryder on yesterday. Still not a lot of information beyond a variety of sources. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRIG. GEN.

The question then, what did bring this plane down? And that's where the investigation continues, looking at a number of different possibilities, Brianna, including perhaps an explosion or explosive device on board.

That means the return of germs spreading in the classroom and into your home.And already, we've seen an uptick in Covid cases this summer, along with flu and other respiratory illnesses, that are well represented in my house, and that schools are grappling with. A difficult start to the school season because of. So in eastern Kentucky, two school districts actually canceled in- person classes this week after more students and staff got sick. One of the districts reporting an 82 percent decrease in attendance last Friday. But relief could be coming soon. We have CNN medical correspondent, Meg Tirrell, joining us on this story. Meg, when exactly will the vaccine updates be available? MEG TIRRELL, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: So it's coming pretty soon. We understand that CDC's outside advisers are scheduled to meet on September 12th to talk about recommending the Covid vaccines for the fall. That always happens after the FDA has signed off on these. So that's expected to happen around the same time. And then once the CDC director accepts the recommendation, these will start to become available. So we're talking about perhaps that week around September 12th, by the end of that week, when they started going out to their pharmacies. The updated vaccines target a single strain of one of the more recent circulating variants call XBB.1.5. The currently dominant circulating variant is called EG5. It represents about 20 percent of cases in the U.S. At least that's the estimate as of a couple weeks ago. And it's not expected to be particularly different in terms of protection from the XBB.1.5-targeted vaccines. The companies have done some testing and they say this provides good protection. And, Brianna, we are in a little bit of a Covid uptick right now. Wastewater monitoring is higher, suggesting higher case levels. And hospitalizations and deaths are both about 21 percent higher in the most recent week of data from the CDC. So there is a lot of Covid going around.",

In terms of Covid, this BA.2.86 is this emerging variant that has authorities on alert because it has a lot of mutation that's folks worry about. As of now, only 10 cases have been found worldwide. There's no evidence yet that it causes more severe disease. And tests and medications like Paxlovid should work against it. But the concern is, because it's so highly mutated, it could evade our existing immunities from infection or vaccines and cause more infections. We're waiting to see more data on that.",
