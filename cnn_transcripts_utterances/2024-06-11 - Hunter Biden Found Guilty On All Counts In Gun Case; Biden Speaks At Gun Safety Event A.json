Hunter Biden, guilty on all charges in the federal gun case against him. His fathers speaking at the gun safety event just hours after. Did he say anything about it? Now, Biden, the president is rushing to Delaware to be by his son side. So, will Hunter Biden now head to prison and for how long? Plus, Trump has a gun situation of his own. A source telling CNN the former president fessed up about his weapon in Florida, which he is legally not allowed to possess as a convicted in felon. But does Donald Trump plan to hand the gun over? CNN's digging into what he might face if he does not. Plus, leaked messages reported from the leader of the terrorist group Hamas, revealing that he thinks Hamas is benefiting from the deaths of Palestinian civilians in Gaza. And that he seemingly could really not care less what happens to them. (MUSIC) TAPPER: Welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper. Hunter Biden is now a convicted felon. It took a Delaware jury less than three hours to find the president's son guilty, guilty, guilty on all three felony gun charges, deciding he violated laws meant to prevent those who use and are addicted to illegal drugs from owning firearms. Multiple jurors spoke to CNN in the moments after they left court, including juror number ten who told CNN that the jury had been evenly split last night when they wrapped for the day, with six guilty, six not guilty. But this morning, jurors went count by count and unanimously decided Hunter Biden was in fact guilty on all three counts. Juror number 10 went on to tell CNN he does not think politics played a role in any jurors decision to convict. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)",

But he did not mention that number. That number instead, coming in a Department of Justice press release that was released earlier today, but it comes as, of course, the president is in an uncomfortable position, both promoting these laws as well as dealing with what he has long said is a personal and family matter. In his statement today, in the wake of that verdict, he again praised Hunters resiliency and recovery and said this: I will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal. Jill and I will always be there for Hunter and the rest of our family with our love and support. Nothing will ever change that. Now that statement is expected to stand alone today with the press pool here at the White House reporting that the White House is no longer expected to hold a press briefing.

Yahya Sinwar, the military leader of Hamas. Sinwar, helped mastermind the horrific October 7 attacks and is suspected to be hiding out in the tunnels under Gaza, exactly where is unknown.

The exchanges show that the terrorist leader thinks he may have the upper hand in the current negotiations. Quote: We have the Israelis right where we want on them. Sinwar allegedly said in recent messages. These stunning messages which CNN cannot independently verify, reveal his frame of mind, as this war drags into its ninth month. With the Palestinian death toll climbing, Sinwar wrote, quote, these are necessary sacrifices, and this is why U.S. officials believed Sinwar has had little incentive to broker a deal. Not only will Israel refused to stop fighting, but the pressure will continue to mount on Israel daily, which Sinwar believes is to his benefit. The Israeli military responded to these messages saying, quote, Hamas leaders don't care about Gazans. How many times did they have to say it for themselves before the world believes them? And as Blinken continues to push for a deal that could eventually end the war, he took aim at Sinwar.",

They hold some 50,000 ISIS suspects and their families. CNN's Clarissa Ward went there.

With an estimated 4,000 inmates, it is the largest concentration of ISIS fighters in the world. No journalist has been allowed inside Panorama since 2021 until now. So the head of the prison has asked me to put on a head scarf while we walk through here because these are some of the most radicalized prisoners they have. A senior U.S. official told us the number one concern at Panorama is a prison break, a fear that was realized in 2022, when hundreds of inmates managed to escape. Can I look inside? Twenty-five men sit cross-legged in silence. The cell is spotless. The men we see appear to be in decent physical condition. But tuberculosis is rampant in the prison. And we are only allowed to look inside two cells. Are you British? You are? Where are you from? A British man approaches the grate but does not want to show his face.
