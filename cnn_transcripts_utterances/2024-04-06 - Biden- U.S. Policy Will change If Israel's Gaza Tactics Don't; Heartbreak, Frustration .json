It's in response to the IDF strikes that killed seven aid workers from World central kitchen on Tuesday. The White House says the president was heartbroken and frustrated. Well, now the administration is waiting to see if Israel's government follows through, if more aid will reach the people who desperately need it. The people in Gaza have been heartbroken and frustrated. More than 32,000 have been killed according to the Palestinian health ministry. More than 32,000.

We need a series of small Americans. Right now, the NGOs are closing -- closing their soup kitchens. And you know, we're only serving about 500 to 600 families a day. There is more need to be done. We're aware. We can't wait to see more NGOs and humanitarian relief to support our people. But also it's hard for them to do their job without a sense of safety and without a ceasefire. So I'm hoping my family will stay safe. I'm so worried for their safety, sir, that I called the White House and gave the coordinates for the soup kitchen.

A ban on menthol cigarettes was expected last year that was pushed to March of this year. Well, obviously now we're in April. Still no announcement.Here's what we do know though, menthol cigarettes are popular with black smokers and black people die at higher rates from smoking related illnesses. According to one study, a menthol ban would save 255,000 Black Lives in the US within 40 years. Another study by the Council on Foreign Relations estimates that if Menthols were banned, the gap between black and white lung cancer deaths would close within five years. And now some civil rights and medical organizations are suing the Food and Drug Administration. Carol McGruder is a founding member of the African American Tobacco Control Leadership Council. Her organization is a plaintiff in the lawsuit along with the group's Action on Smoking and Health, and the National Medical Association, the nation's oldest group representing black physicians. Carol, good morning to you very early morning, because you're joining me from California. And I thank you for that. So the administration says that they're in the final stages of rulemaking, that they've sent everything over to the FDA now, and they're close to the end of the process. So why the lawsuit? CAROL MCGRUDER, AFRICAN-AMERICAN TOBACCO CONTROL LEADERSHIP COUNCIL: We found a new lawsuit. This is our second one, because this issue it has is not solely a public health issue because of the racial overlay of every single thing in our country. And so we've gotten mired up in politics. And so this is really a public health decision that needs to be made that other countries have made. We filed a new lawsuit, because we really want to let the Biden administration know that we are not going anywhere, and that we will not allow this issue to be pushed back. And you know, we don't know what's going to happen with our next election, we're going to have a change in administration. And so it makes it more critical, more crucial that we get the job done and that we get the job done right now. We've been waiting a long time. And we're not going to -- we're going to keep pushing forward until we can get the tobacco industry out of our communities and stop killing the 45,000 black people who die every year in this country from tobacco induced diseases.",

And so this, the issue of waiting longer, it's for us, it's we can't wait any longer. That every delay every year means that more of our children more of our people are smoking.There are some you know, there's comedy about this. And so why do black people smoke Newports? Black people smoked Newports because the tobacco industry seeded them in our community for decades, gave them away free to children, children like Dave Chappelle, that's how he started smoking when he was 14 years old, giving vaping having given free cigarettes at the DC metro station. He talks about that in his interviews. And people like Marie Evans, a woman who if she were alive, she would be my age. And so when we see the deaths from the industry, it kills our parents. It kills our grandparents. It kills the people who are the -- who stabilize our communities, who are the foundation of our families.

So that prompted me to go back and look at my charts and look at different tests. And I noticed that there was a difference between the GFR and the GFRE. So I did my own due diligence to really see what was happening.And then once ever, I brought my findings back to see that race was actually calculated, my doctors been confirmed that this was something that was happening. So I can only imagine what was also happening to the thousands of black Americans that didn't necessarily know to do that research on your own.",

And when black people and people of color go into doctor's offices. How has this this moment, this recalculation impacted your degree of trust? EVANSFor me, I will say that the work that you knows and OPT (ph) in are doing right now does give us a glimmer of hope that there are people out there that are pushing the needle on change in equity within the healthcare system. But I'm also sober to remember that we still have a very long way to go. There are still thousands of black Americans that are waiting for organs across the board, not just exclusively to kidney transplants. And so I think that we need to keep using our voices, I need to think that we need to keep holding our doctors and our physicians accountable for the work that they are doing, and so that they could also uphold their own oath to do no harm to the patients in front of them, no matter their race or creed.",

When you work, and work and work and put in those 10,000 hours youfind that greatness. As of late, I've been doing a little bit more political pieces. As artists, we want to create beautiful things, right. But as artists, we also are reflecting the world around us. I'm a son of Egyptian immigrants, my parents from Maseb (ph), I see these kids who have no water, no food, no electricity. The fundamental pieces of life have been robbed from them. The biggest thing is just to see the humanity in these people. I've been trying to make beautiful pieces but also I found this voice through watching these injustices and now I'm just trying to speak with it using the crafts and the talents that I have.
