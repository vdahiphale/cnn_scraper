      "sentences": "The man who led the revolt against the Russian military two months ago is presumed dead this morning after his plane crashed. I'm talking about this man, Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin. He was one of ten people on board this plane that ended up burning on the ground when it came down just north of Moscow. Investigators say there are no survivors. As of this morning, only eight of the ten bodies have been found. And those remains have been taken off site for forensic testing.So, the fight -- we can follow the course of the flight right here. It left Moscow at about 6:00 p.m. last night. Its last point of contact was right here, just a few minutes after takeoff here. And then by 6:30, only 30 minutes into the flight, that is when it crashed. Now, flight radar says it was at 28,000 feet before things started going wrong. It started rising and descend erratically. And then it began falling at a rate of about 8,000 feet per minute. We've got some remarkable footage of this plane plummeting almost vertically from the sky. Obviously, they're receiving no data from the plane at this point. Our Richard Quest notes that planes don't just fall like that for no reason. They don't malfunction and then just fall directly down. Typically, something needs to happen to them. And we are now learning that the plane is believed to have been on fire before it hit the ground. You can see it there, plummeting to earth. Ten people on board. No survivors. Sara.",

I think we all knew that.But the second is that when Putin is really challenged, really threatened at home, and that two months ago by Prigozhin, no one had ever seen before, he doesn't act irrationally, he acts to ensure his own survival. And that's why Prigozhin is dead now, as opposed to two months ago. Two months ago you had Prigozhin at his maximum level of power. Thousands of his own troops aligned with him, taking over Rostov, heading towards Moscow. A Ukrainian counteroffensive about to hit the Russians. Putin probably leaving Moscow and going to St. Petersburg. The worst possible timing for him to say, I'm going to go after this guy and hit him hard. Instead, he cuts a deal. And since then, over the last two months, they've shut down Wagner's media operations. They've taken away and -- the heavy weapons from most of the troops, dispersed them on a wild goose chase in Belarus. They've, in other words, shored up Putin's power, weakened Prigozhin and now he's dead. That's a fair amount of, you know, strategic thinking on Putin's part facing a very significant challenge. I don't think anyone's surprised by the fact that he did it, but it certainly shows how he considers threats to his power going forward.",

It's not relevant for the fight on the ground in Ukraine. That won't change. And indeed we've seen, over the past weeks, the Ukrainian counter offensive has not gone very well. Russian defenses on the ground are dug in, and they're defending themselves capably. So, there we don't see much of a change.Where you will see a question is what happens on the ground across Africa where Wagner has been a principal paramilitary group making billions of dollars and shoring up a number of dictators, including in Niger, where we've just seen a coup and where the Nigerians and others in Ecowas (ph) may be preparing to attack that illegitimate government militarily. What happens when Prigozhin, who has been personally responsible for those troops on the ground, has now been killed, likely directly on Putin's orders. What are those leaders going to do? Is that a possibility for the Americans and allies, the French, others, to play more of a role? Will we see a breakdown into instability? The single biggest impact of Prigozhin and his confederates being killed on this airplane is going to be seen on the ground in a number of African states over the coming weeks and months.",
