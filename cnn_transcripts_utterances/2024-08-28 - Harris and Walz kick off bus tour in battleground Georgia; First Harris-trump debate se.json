Any moment now, Vice President Kamala Harris will depart for Georgia, where she and her running mate, Governor Tim Walz, will kick off a two day bus tour. Their swing will take them through the southern part of the Peach State as they reach out to voters in areas that typically lean Republican. Just to underscore how important Georgia is, the Harris campaign is pouring advertising money into Savannah, the first stop on their visit.It's a state that President Biden won, we should note, by fewer than 12,000 votes four years ago. All of this is coming as Harrison-Walz prepare for their first major sit down interview with CNN's Dana Bash that airs tomorrow. Let's turn now to CNN's Priscilla Alvarez, who's live for us in Savannah. So talk to us, Priscilla, about how the campaign is zeroing in on that part of Georgia.",

That is a position that she no longer supports.But I am most interested in how she talks about immigration. You know, Boris, if you read her memoir, the first organization that she visited after she was elected to the Senate was CHIRLA, an immigrant rights group in California. She gives a very passionate defense of undocumented immigrants in her book, talking about how she was really distressed about families potentially being separated under the Trump administration, about how aggressively the Trump administration were targeting undocumented immigrants, even those who were not committing crimes after being in the United States. Well, now, she advocates for a border enforcement bill that doesn't even include a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.

I mean, there's just no evidence of that whatsoever. Although I will say that, you know, this is an unprecedented election. You have a former President who still has Secret Service detail. And then it was then a current sitting president who's both running against each other. Now, you have Vice President Kamala Harris. So there's been a lot of strain that we have reported on thoroughly here on the Secret Service and whether or not that impacted them that day.I think we're still waiting to learn more details in their investigation. But all to say, this is some really, you know, nasty attacks now from Donald Trump. We're entering that news phase, new phase of the election, where we're going to continue to see some of this. There's obviously no evidence that Vice President Harris or President Joe Biden contributed at all to this. But he's trying to argue that their rhetoric, some of the perhaps did play a role that day. You know, Donald Trump has said this before. I think we're going to continue to hear some of these lines, but obviously no evidence to back it up.",

And his mother thought he was God. So that's something that Donald Trump should understand as he's speaking about Jesus. Nobody cares. Genuinely, nobody cares. They don't care how big your crowd size is. They don't care about whether you're going to win California, lose California. It's not relevant. California, with all due respect to your California viewers, the state is not going to vote Republican no matter what. What matters is how it plays in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, which is now up for grabs, Georgia, which is now up for grabs again, or the states of Nevada and Arizona. That's all that matters in this election. That's number one.Number two is the negativity does not play. The public is just frustrated with it. It's had enough of it. And when you compare the two candidates side by side on personality, Kamala Harris beats Donald Trump overwhelmingly. But when you compare them on inflation, when you compare them, which is really affordability, when you compare them on immigration, which is really security and safety, and a sense of not being afraid in the country. When you compare them on those two issues, which matter more to the voters than anything else, that's what Trump does well. And I want to emphasize this. To every viewer who thinks I'm anti- Trump or anti-Harris. If you talk about things that voters don't care about, they're not going to vote for you. And Donald Trump is already talking about this election being stolen. You can't steal something that you gave away. I've never seen the candidates more miss the mark than Trump has. His advertising is exceptional. It's very explicit and very clear. But in terms of he himself, he's all over the map and he deserves the fact that he's been falling. But again, I have to give you one caveat, and then I'll be quiet. He's actually stopped falling. Even though they had a pretty strong convention last week, it looks like the Harris boomlet has reached his peak with her having roughly a three point advantage. I remind you that that was the advantage that Hillary Clinton had over Donald Trump on Election Day 2016 and he still beat her in the Electoral College. This election is way too close to call.",

He did not need that to win Ohio. Did Harris choose the right vice presidential nominee? She does not need the governor of Minnesota to win Pennsylvania. I think that both campaigns are calibrated perfectly. Both candidates are not.And you're going to have this bigger divergence as time goes on between how the candidate performs and how the campaign performs. And mark my word, they both matter. And the fact is that debate on September 10th when it is side by side is going to be mind-blowing. Arguably, it's going to be the most important day of this entire campaign, except for the day when Biden and Trump had that same interaction and Joe Biden came up wanting.",

You'll remember John Bolton, very hawkish when it comes to Iran. Not exactly one of Iran's biggest fans per se. But this former official had his personal email account compromised. Iranian hackers were able to then impersonate that former official, sending out a wide net of emails and pretending to be this person seeking advice on a manuscript, a book manuscript that they were working on. I want to read one of the emails impersonating this former Trump official that was sent to D.C. based think tankers who are also hardliners on Iran. It says, I'm close to finishing the manuscript and have begun asking experts like yourselves to review the chapters. The email then has a link and asks the recipients to click that link, purporting to be innocent enough, linking to the chapters of the book he once reviewed. It was actually a link to malware that would have given the hackers access to these various individuals accounts. Look, we don't know the scope of the success of this operation, but we do notice that the tactics are very similar to what we've seen recently by Iranian hackers, the same Iranian hacking group to target Trump campaign officials using Roger Stone's personal email account that they were able to compromise. We're also learning that they were able to successfully infiltrate the account of a former Biden ambassador who has a lot of visibility into issues dealing with Israel. So you can kind of see why they're -- who they're targeting and why.",

You know, they did influence that election in 2016.And so what the Iranians are doing now, certainly intelligence officials are very concerned about because, you know, they've gone from just routine intelligence collection to what appears to be an effort to try to influence voters before November. And that's what is the most concerning part of this. Obviously, Iran has a lot of things that's on their agenda, including, of course, people who are critics of the regime. But also, you know, they clearly want to sow chaos with the 2024 election. And so that appears to be one of the efforts that they're making this year.",
