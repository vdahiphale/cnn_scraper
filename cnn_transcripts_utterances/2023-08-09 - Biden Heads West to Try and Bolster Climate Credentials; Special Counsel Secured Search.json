It kind of shows just how hamstrung he is here. Yesterday, the government forecast the crude oil production in the U.S. will hit a record, right? So, it's the realities, as Nia- Malika said -- it's the realities of knowing that voters are price sensitive, particularly to energy prices, but then there's this aspiration from younger voters on getting anything done with the green (ph) in climate.",

And now, we know it was a case between the Special Counsel's office, the people investigating January 6th and Donald Trump, and Twitter. And what happened was, in January, the Special Counsel investigators went to Twitter and they said, \"We have a search warrant, and we would like data and records related to Donald Trump's Twitter account @realDonaldTrump.\"At that time, they didn't comply right away. Twitter had had some sort of hiccups. They took a little bit of time. They faced a fine of $350,000 for delaying producing those records. And then why this ended up in court is because the Justice Department didn't want Twitter to tell Donald Trump that they were seeking this information and they won that ability not to have Twitter disclose to Donald Trump, the client of Twitter, right, as the account holder that the search was going to be taking place of his Twitter account, and the reason is really interesting. It's outlined here in the court that they went before -- the Special Counsel office went before, believed that there was reasonable grounds to say that if they were to tell Donald Trump they were doing this search on his Twitter account, it could seriously jeopardize the ongoing investigation. He could potentially want to destroy evidence, change patterns of behavior, or \"notify confederates.\" There's also a footnote about how there was a discussion of whether he might flee from prosecution if he knew the search was being discussed. The Justice Department ultimately walked that back, but that was something that the judge also had to look at. Would Donald Trump flee? (LAUGHTER)",

What would their friends, families, co- workers think about them if this comes out. And that restricts them from seeking help.But the other big thing that was happening to me was, I just -- I didn't understand what mental illness was. I've never been educated about it. And mostly, I just thought if you have it, there's really nothing that can be done about it. I describe it to people as saying, I think that in my mind, there was this imaginary line, either normal or you are crazy, all right? And you want to stay on the normal side of that line. OK? So, I couldn't possibly have a mental health issue, because if I had a mental health issue, that meant I was crazy and I didn't want to be that. That's not the way it works. There are multiple layers that contribute to anxiety and depression. And certainly, people have more cases than others, but there are basics to how you can protect your mental health that can help you deal with these problems.
