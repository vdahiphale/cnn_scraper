That's 34 in total as a new round of storms move in. Authorities urged residents to get ready and be prepared for heavy rain and possible flooding over the coming hours. There are currently more than 17 million people under flood alerts across much of central and northern California as well as parts of Nevada.Along with the heavy rain, the higher elevations are expected to be hit with even more heavy snow, just as they're still trying to dig out from earlier storms.

      "sentences": "Well, if you're anything like me, you have maybe fond childhood memories of playing outdoors during a winter storm with that light, fluffy snow. We know that sometimes those storms come in on the mild side and we get a denser snowpack. So, it's easier to make a snow ball or a snowman, for instance. But sometimes there's so much moisture associated with these winter storms that they actually pose a threat to structures and homes.And I bring that up because that's exactly what the National Weather Service out of California is warning some of its residents for the upcoming weekend with this latest atmospheric river event that's about to take place. Did you know that 12 inches of snow and a typical sized-home, wet snow we're talking about is equivalent to having three pickup trucks on top of your roof? Let's say you double that snowpack. We're talking 24 inches of heavy wet snowfall and you're talking about nearly 40,000 pounds of pressure on top of your house. No wonder there's the risk of structural collapse with this heavy wet snowfall. We just have to investigate the origins of where this moisture is coming from. We call it the Pineapple Express because it originates near Hawaii. It's pulling in a lot of deep tropical moisture. And that means that this will be a mild storm as it unleashes this kind of firehose of water and heavy wet snowfall and the higher elevations. Weather Prediction Center picking up on that level three of four, what you see that shading of red, Sacramento to San Francisco, notice that like a very small suddenly shift in that moderate risk of flash flooding for the day on Friday. So, keep that in mind. Malibu northward. Now this is how much rain we anticipate. Three to six inches for the most part. There will be the heavy wet snowfall that will be measured in feet especially across the Sierra Nevada crust. But you have heavy wet snow on top of what's already fallen. And that is why we have the potential for rapid snow melt, flash flooding, landslides and mudslides. Can't forget about the potential of 70-mile an hour wind gusts on top of that for the highest elevations. Here's a quick look at the latest winter weather alerts blankly in the western U.S. Back to you.",
