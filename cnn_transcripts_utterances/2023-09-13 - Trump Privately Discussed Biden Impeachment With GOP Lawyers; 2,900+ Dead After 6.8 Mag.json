Now, I've talked to a number of Trump advisors, and they do acknowledge about Trump's talked to various House members about them -- about this. It is not just Stefanik and Marjorie Taylor Greene, that it's not something that he is obsessed with and hyper focused on.But they can't push back on the sense that this is something that he has brought up, something that privately and publicly he says he would like to see happen. And even if he is not pushing directly, by saying he's something that he would like to have it. He is still really -- if you look at the poll numbers, the head of the Republican Party. And there are members within the House, who wants to do what makes Donald Trump happy. And so that's where you really see this disconnect. Whether or not it is that he is obsessed with it, he is pushing it, or whether or not it is that he's just mentioned it but these House members, they want to placate him. He really is at least in part at the center of all of this.",

He is now a CNN Political Commentator and Republican Strategist Joseph Pinion. Thank you so much for being here this morning.We just -- I want to go back to whether or not, we just heard this new reporting. Is it any surprise? And I'll start here with you, the Donald Trump is somehow involved in this idea of going forward with an impeachment. It serves him politically, certainly. JOSEPH PINION, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR &amp; COMMUNITY ACTIVIST: Well, look, I think that impeachment is inherently a political process. I think that certainly action of President Trump speaking about it with members of Congress, there was certainly an appetite for Republicans to see if they could move forward with some type of impeachment procedure. I would also mention that again, he's not necessarily doing anything on towards. But if people are bothered by it, they should also be bothered by the fact that we now know from the former Deputy Director of the CIA, Michael Morell. That there were conversations with anti-Blinken, at the time working with Joe Biden's campaign, about what was happening with those accusations Trump campaign was making about them. Which led to that, 51 members of former intelligence signing that letter. So, yes, I think that it is fair to ask the question, but I think that fair play has to be fair play. And I don't think it is on towards to expect. Other the members of Congress would be consulted with President Trump about how they're going to be proceeding with this impeachment.",

What are the risks for the Republicans here? Why are there Republicans in these four districts that are nervous? SIMMONSWhat do we know? What we know is the President son, Hunter, last name Biden, right? Told people that his father was the Vice President when he was going out pitching business. Now, you guys have been on the inside or gotten pitches from P.R. people who are trying to get stories done. Sometimes there's too much English on the ball. And maybe that's what happened on Hunter. Is inappropriate? Probably. Is it impeachable? Probably not. And the second thing perhaps, Joe Biden talked to his friend, his son's friends when he called them and said, hello, that's it. Those are bombshells. Those are bombshells. 2/3 of Americans know what it's like to have an addicted person in their family, right? And they know the bad decisions that addicted people make. The President United States is standing by his son who is admitted having an addiction problem. The Republicans go after an addiction problem in a family, at their own peril, and I think they are in jeopardy of losing moderate Republicans all over the country if they do it.",

The summit the West had feared will lead to a fresh supply of weapons for Russia in its war on Ukraine. Putin welcome Kim to a Russian space launch site in the Amur region where Kim got a tour of Russia's space center and rocket complex.Now, Kim is headed to another city in Russia's Far East where he is scheduled to visit factories that make civilian and military equipment. Watch a showcase of Russia's Pacific Fleet and visit to educational institutes. The visit comes of force as North Korea launched two short range ballistic missiles off the Eastern Coast of the Korean Peninsula this morning. Just hours before that summit took place. With us now, former CIA Director and Former U.S. CENTCOM commander, General David Petraeus. He has recently returned from a trip to Ukraine. I want to first start with what you are hearing -- what we -- what you learned from your trip. What is the thing that you took away that was the most important you felt after visiting Ukraine, sir? GEN. DAVID PETRAEUS, FORMER COMMANDER, U.S. CENTCOM: Well, Sara, the mood was more sober than when I was there, say three months ago before the start of the counter offensive. As we all know, counter that counter offence, no plan survives contact with the enemy. They had to make adaptations, they have though. And they have been grinding out progress, it has been accumulating has been impressive but it's slow. It's tough, it's costly. The Russian defense is much more formidable, I think, than any anticipated, but they have gotten through the first line of defense in the south in Zaporizhzhia. They have taken a town called Robotyne and they're expanding the breach. But again, at a pace of say 500 to thousand meters a day. So, that's the reality. What's interesting, though, is that because this is not as dependent on armored vehicles as was the original expectation. The Ukrainians are saying they're going to fight all through the winter. Again, people are slowed by the onset of winter rains and the mud and so forth, anywhere near as much as track armored, track vehicles are. For the determination, that commitment, the National resolve is still very, very strong. But as I said, there's -- it's a bit more sober, of a mood, than it was, say three months ago. And beyond that, there's a bit of apprehension about U.S. politics, about whether Congress can be as forthcoming as they'd like it to be, with the additional assistance, given the dynamics on Capitol Hill. There is hope, also, though, that the U.S. will finally approve the army tactical missile system, which would double the range of the precision munitions provided for the rocket systems that we've provided. And that perhaps, the F-16 will arrive more expeditiously, there might be cluster munitions for rockets, as well as artillery, noting that those artillery delivered cluster munitions have proven to be very, very helpful to this offensive. I think the question now is, can they start to crack maybe to achieve a bit of crumbling of the Russian defenses? Now that they're into the second line of these defenses. There are three belts essentially, the first being the most formidable and they have certainly penetrated that. And then, can they get close enough to that critical logistical line of communication that runs from Russia along the southeast coast of Ukraine, so that they can interdict it, degrade it, and interrupt the flow of support that the Russians are providing to their fortress in the frontlines?",

He points out with less than 3 percent of our defense budget. You know, the Russian military has been taken down very considerably. And, of course, this is a longtime enemy of ours, it is the enemy of NATO and so forth.Ironically, of course, Putin has done more for NATO than any other individual. He set out to make Russia great again, and he's made NATO great again. But we need to continue to lead this effort. Noting that the Europeans have actually been coming online, very substantial in the latest calculation show that even in the area of security assistance, the Europeans pledged more than we have provided, noting that we have provided a very substantial.
