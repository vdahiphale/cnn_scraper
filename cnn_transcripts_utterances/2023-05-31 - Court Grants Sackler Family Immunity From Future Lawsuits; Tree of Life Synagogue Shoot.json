And that is part of the dispute here. The U.S. doesn't recognize that, nor does international law or many other countries. So, the U.S., from its position, can operate there, can fly there, just like we saw this reconnaissance airplane, an RC- 135 Rivet Joint. Take a look at this video as we're watching it here. This is on Friday, the RC-135 Rivet Joint, again, a reconnaissance airplane, flying over the South China Sea, when that Chinese jet from the right cuts in front, forcing the larger, heavier Rivet Joint to fly through the aircraft's wake turbulence. And that shaking there is the shudder as the airplane passes through that turbulent air. We have seen Chinese aircraft do this before, not only against U.S. aircraft, but others as well. For example, back in December, another Chinese fighter jet from the Navy came within 20 feet of the nose of a similar aircraft, another RC-135 Rivet Joint. So, the U.S. sees this as a pattern of aggressive behavior. But it's not just these aggressive interactions between U.S. and Chinese military aircraft. The broader problem here is a lack of communication between the sides. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin right now traveling in the Indo- Pacific, where he will be at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore in just a couple of days. The U.S. had reached out about a chance to meet his Chinese counterpart, Minister of National Defense Li Shangfu. They hadn't gotten back for some time, until they were rejected by the Chinese. So there will be no meeting, and the U.S. sees that as a major concern. Here's John Kirby from the National Security Council. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

At the core of this incident is the dispute between China and the United States over the South China Sea. China says this happened over their training ground. The United States says this was international waters. I'm wondering what you make of that dispute. GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Well, I think it's very important for the United States to continue to insist that this is international waters. Something like a third of the world's commerce goes through the South China Sea. That's not China's territorial waters, under the Law of the Sea Convention. It is something they declared with a so-called nine- dash line that was -- some government wrote up from China in 1948, and they have suddenly seized on it. This has gone on for several years. They built up the atolls. They put air bases on these atolls, after they promised they wouldn't. They armed them with air defense missiles, after they promised President Obama they wouldn't do that.

We will put $4.5 billion into the bankruptcy, but we want all of the civil cases that are against us to go into the channels of bankruptcy, which is protocol anyway. But we want immunity from those cases and any future cases. Well, at the time, all the lawsuits between Purdue Pharma and the Sacklers, according to legal documents, $40 trillion is what it amounted to. And so that's when the negotiation started. And as the appeal went on, the Sacklers went up to $6 billion that they would put into the bankruptcy action. And here's what's going to come from those $6 billion. First of all, they are going to go to victims compensation, because all of those suits went into the channels of bankruptcy. It's going to go into the opioid crisis abatement programs for the local level, for the state level, all around the country. And it will also go for overdose rescue medicines, which are so important. And Purdue Pharma, the Sackler family agreed that they would do that. There is no more Purdue Pharma. That company is gone. But the Sackler family will make sure that those medicines are available on the local level, on the state level, around the country. And so, for the next years, this $6 billion will be put to good work. Now, we do have a statement from Purdue Pharma. Let's read that: \"Our creditors understand the plan is the best option to help those who need it most, the most fair and expeditious way to resolve the litigation and the only way to deliver billions of dollars in value specifically to fund opioid crisis abatement efforts.\" And 95 percent were agreeing with this.
