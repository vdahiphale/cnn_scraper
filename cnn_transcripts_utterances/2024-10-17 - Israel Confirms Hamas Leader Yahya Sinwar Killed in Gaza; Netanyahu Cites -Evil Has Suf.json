      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, I want to go straight to our breaking news. Israel's mostwanted man is dead. The IDF confirmed the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza just a short time ago. And now, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is speaking out, saying evil has been dealt a blow. Well, Sinwar was considered the mastermind of the October 7th attacks. Israeli army radio says it's believed he was killed after a tank fired at a house in southern Gaza. Prime Minister Netanyahu is urging the people of Gaza to quote, \"break free from the tyranny of Hamas\". Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, PRIME MINISTER, ISRAEL (through translator):  Today, evil has suffered a heavy blow. But the task before us is not yet complete. The dear families of the hostages, I say, it is an important moment in the war, we will continue with all our strength until we return home all of your loved ones who are our loved ones. It is our highest commitment, it is my highest commitment, and to the residents of Gaza, I say, Sinwar ruined your lives. I told you he was a liar, but in reality, he was hiding in a dark den and he was killed when he fled in a -- from our soldiers. His elimination is an important landmark into flying from the evil rule of Hamas. I would like to say, again in the clearest way, Hamas will no longer rule Gaza. This is the beginning of the day after Hamas. And this is an opportunity for you, residents of Gaza, to finally break free from its tyranny. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

U.S. officials have long considered Sinwar's death to be one of the best chances to end the war in Gaza. But that's far from certain at this hour. It's also unclear how his killing might affect efforts, of course, to bring the hostages home, more than a 100 or so. And Sinwar had only been the overall head of Hamas since August, if you remember, gaining the position after Israel assassinated Ismail Haniyeh in Iran. But as Nic Robertson now reports, Sinwar was an influential figure in Hamas for decades. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over):  Feared and feted at home in Gaza, universally reviled by Israelis. Yahya Sinwar became the Jewish state's enemy number one for his leading role in Hamas' brutal October 7th slaughter, almost 1,200 people in Israel, triggering Israel's killing of tens of thousands of Palestinians. The IDF dubbed him a dead man walking. But university-educated Sinwar persistently outsmarted his enemies.",

Israel's response resulted in the unparalleled killing of tens of thousands of Palestinians and the destruction of Gaza. Internationally, it raised previously unseen potent pro-Palestinian lobby, if that was Sinwar's strategy, it was succeeding, but at great cost.

This is a protester in Tel Aviv. I know that families of American hostages are worried of what Hamas might do with the remaining hostages, following his death. Can you just give us a sense of what you're hearing? KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, that's right. I mean, the families are torn because obviously, today for them is welcome news. Yahya Sinwar was the architect of October 7th, the mastermind of that horrific attack that led to so many Israeli hostages being held by Hamas. And so, their families today are obviously welcoming the news that he has been killed, but the flip side of that coin is that they don't know precisely what this means for their family members. They believe that time is of the essence. At this moment in time to drive forth some sort of an agreement to get their family members out particularly at this delicate moment when we don't know who is going to take over Hamas. That is a question on the minds of those hostage families, also a question very squarely on the minds of U.S. officials who are at this moment not saying exactly what they believe the death of Sinwar will mean for the conflict between Hamas and Israel. In the past, they have said that the death of Sinwar effectively would be a major breakthrough in this conflict. And certainly, on one hand it is. But they've also said that the keys to a ceasefire and hostage release deal are effectively in Sinwar's hands, and a statement like that is going to be tested in the days to come because we'll have to watch and see if there's rapid momentum towards that deal which U.S. officials say is possible, or if there's still a long road ahead, which they also say is possible at this time.",

Now, I think we're still some ways off from that, and it's not clear -- you know, it's not clear how and when that will be done. But I think what the Vice President here is articulating is the way to try now to change the calculus, to send a signal to Israel, to send a signal to the Palestinians, and important one to the Palestinians. You know, it's a message that we've heard, the words she has used before to describe what the Palestinians can have. But I think it comes back to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, what is his intent? And what's the intent of his cabinet right now?

Israeli PrimeMinister Benjamin Netanyahu says evil has suffered a heavy blow with the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. It comes, of course, renewed speculation that ceasefire and hostage talks can progress. One Israeli government official has told CNN that Sinwar's death should do just that. While others, as you've been hearing from the past 20 minutes or so, are warning that a lack of a clear successor could complicate matters and could also put hostages, a hundred or so hostages, at further risk. Another Israeli source close to the issue says chaos in Hamas' ranks could follow and the risk of revenge for Sinwar's death remains very real. In the meantime, the families of some U.S. hostages still held in Gaza have called for their release following the death of Sinwar. And of course, we have shown you some pictures outside of Tel Aviv of families celebrating -- hostage families celebrating his death. I want to bring in our Chief International Correspondent Clarissa Ward to give us an idea of the wider picture across the Middle East. And, Clarissa, before we get to talk about the wider picture, you've reported -- you've been reporting this for a year or so, you've been into Gaza. We've heard from some Gazans who've basically said, with his death, this should be the end of the war. This should be it. Just give us a sense of what he represented to some, but not all, but the anger over the past year because of what they started.",

They'll say we're sad. Obviously, he was an iconic and important leader, and it's very depressing. But you're not seeing the outpouring of emotion that we've seen with the assassinations of other leaders like Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, also, Ismail Haniyeh, for example, the political leader of Hamas, who was assassinated in Tehran. And it may be possible that that will come and that we'll see in the coming days a kind of outpouring of emotion. But what you tend to see more is the lip service is paid and then the focus immediately is just on survival. What does this mean for us? Does this mean that potentially we could see an end to this hell that we have been living through now for over a year? Is there any light on the horizon? You also see a lot of cynicism and pessimism in there. Most people who CNN has spoken to throughout the day saying, listen, we are not optimistic. We don't believe that the war will stop because of this. But I do think it's a moment to just take stock for a second, 42,000 people dead, people starving, the reemergence of polio disease. I mean, we are talking about a truly extraordinary catastrophe. And so, for the vast majority of Gazans, the natural focus right now. is not on the political infighting in Hamas, but on the question of their very survival. Will we live to see another day?",

He offered his speech a couple of hours ago. What can we glean from it? He talks about the return of the hostages as still being our highest commitment. But he goes on to say, that urges people patience, talks about many challenges ahead, talks about the different fronts that have opened in this war, Hezbollah, Beirut, alluding also to Iran with the broader region.
