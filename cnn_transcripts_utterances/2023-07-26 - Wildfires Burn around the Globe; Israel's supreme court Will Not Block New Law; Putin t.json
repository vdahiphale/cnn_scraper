What we'rehearing from experts is that this is going to become a new normal here in Italy. Emergency services are still working to tackle what is contained wildfires across different regions of the southern part of Italy. We learned from the civil protection agency that, in Sicily, where we saw this devastating fire at one point bringing the airport of Palermo to a standstill as flames were dangerously close to the airport and tarmac. But we have learned that all three, some 2,000 people evacuated for fear of those wildfires. The vast majority have now been allowed to return home. But as you said there, 10 fires still ongoing, although contained in Italy, as the emergency services are trying to tackle those. Extreme weather in the north as well, storms there, hailstorms as well causing damage. At least two people reportedly killed as a result, four people in southern Italy killed as a result of those wildfires. But of course, this is something that we are seeing across the Mediterranean. Devastating fired continue to rage on across parts of Greece and the islands of Corfu and Evia and Rhodes. Thousands have been evacuated. We've seen emergency response teams being flown in from other parts of the world as well to support in that effort to try and tackle those wildfires. And, of course, we're learning of more fires further afield in Algeria, in Tunisia. Those have been contained. But of course, a huge amount of damage to land there, scorched land of course, with just a huge amount of devastation for those that rely on those lands for their livelihood. In Turkiye, emergency services are battling fires in the southern region of Antalya. Of course, we've heard these devastating warnings from experts over the last few days. The World Weather Attribution initiative warning that this is going to become the new normal. In the future, these temperatures could be considered cool and unless the world rapidly stops burning fossil fuels, these are only going to get worse. These extreme heat incidences are only going to get more severe and more frequent. E.U. officials say they are working to prepare their cities for the potential for further extreme heat instances. We do know, of course, after last year's wildfires that the E.U.  doubled the amount of firefighters to member states. They did this in preparation for what was anticipated to be another bad year. In Greece, we've heard from the Copernicus meter for -- we've heard from Cornu (ph) saying that they believe July, at this stage, according to recent data, has seen the highest wildfire emissions on record over the last two decades. These are stark warning, stark figures and the fact that the warnings are that this is only going to get worse will be (INAUDIBLE) for those who have impacted so far.",

So in reality, we obliged on Saturday evening, because of the wildfires, to evacuate 19,000 people, actually people who were here for holidays. And we had to evacuate them and redirect them; 16,000 were transported by land and 3,000 were transported by sea. This happened in a matter of a couple of hours.

They were provided with food, with water, with medical supervision. The locals were mobilized. And I think this is the most important thing to stress, that we had so many volunteers, people bringing sheets and towels from their homes to make sure that everyone had the necessary equipment.

Where Kevin Spacey has defended himself against these accusations, very, very serious accusations, including seven counts of sexual assault, one count of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent and one count of causing a person to engage in sexual activity penetrative without consent. The prosecutor, who, of course, brought forward the cases of these four male accusers, all aged in their 20s and 30s, that say that these incidents occurred in the early 2000s and 2010s, when Kevin Spacey was the artistic director of the Old Vic. The prosecutor tried to paint a picture of an actor who took advantage of his powerful position. The prosecutor describing Kevin Spacey as a sexual bully who, quote, \"delights in making others feel powerless and uncomfortable.\" As you can imagine, Spacey and his lawyers hitting back against those accusations. Kevin Spacey even admitting at one point, saying to the courtroom, yes, I am a big flirt. Yes, I was sexually promiscuous but that does not make me a bad person. He recalled some of these incidences as romantic, as flirtatious, as consensual. Of course denying all the charges against him. Throughout this trial and before this trial, Kevin Spacey has said he welcomes his day in court to prove his innocence. He has clearly won that today, again not guilty on all nine charges. But these are allegations, these are accusers that surfaced after the #MeToo movement. So this will potentially be seen as a blow to that movement.

So now this law is enforced and we know that the supreme court will not issue a temporary injunction, which means that it's on the books. It's usable right now. The court has said it will hear seven total petitions that have been brought against this law in September, this is after the supreme court goes on its recess. But this emergency injunction was something that some of the petitioners were seeking. In fact, the president of the supreme court and some of the senior justices were on an official trip to Germany and they cut that trip short in order to rush back to Israel and hear these petitions. So now that we know that this will be heard in September, we know that there is a legal fight, a legal battle likely brewing coming in September. Several reasons for that. One is that this law that was passed amends a basic law. Israel doesn't have a constitution but it does have a series of basic laws that were originally formulated to one day potentially form the base of a constitution. The supreme court so far has discussed basic laws but has never nullified a basic law. Also, the supreme court will be ruling on its own powers. That will be a unique situation to be in. And then there's even the question as to whether this government will actually heed a ruling by the supreme court if by chance they strike it down. But now that this law is on the books, that means the government can act on it. Some critics of this law have said that they fear that one of the things that the government may do is they may fire the attorney general in Israel. The attorney general is a slightly different position here in that it's more of an independent legal body and not like in the United States -- or appointed by the president or by the prime minister. And this current attorney general has been rather critical of this government. They have blocked some of the government actions. She's been critical of the judicial overhaul and she is partly overseeing Benjamin Netanyahu's, the prime minister's ongoing corruption trial. Now Benjamin Netanyahu has denied all those charges against him and he says this judicial overhaul has nothing to do with his corruption trial. But there is the fear that now that this law is in place, that the attorney general, it would be easier for the government to fire her. Before this law was passed, the supreme court potentially could have blocked that firing by calling it unreasonable. They would still have ways of saying that the attorney general cannot be fired. But this just makes it easier for the government to do so. And that's one of the fears that the critics have that is potentially the outcome of this law now being passed.",

He told family and friends that he was motivated to fight in Ukraine after seeing the depths of Russian oppression firsthand as a prisoner. Russian president Vladimir Putin is preparing to host a summit with African leaders this week in St. Petersburg. Some of those leaders are beginning to arrive ahead of the main summit. They are set to discuss everything from the war in Ukraine to food security and trade. A number of African countries are feeling the impact of Russia's withdrawal from the Black Sea grain deal with Ukraine. David McKenzie joining us now from Johannesburg. A big meeting, as we can see some of the pictures, African leaders arriving. Many African countries don't actually rely on Ukrainian grain; some do.

Thefirst one was held in 2019 but then the pandemic and, of course, the start of the Ukraine war. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has delayed it until now. Now 17 heads of state, according to Russian officials, will be attending that summit. That's dramatically down from the first Russia-Africa summit. The Kremlin has said this is, in their words, due to the schedules of heads of state in Africa. But they also blame the U.S., France and other countries of, quote, \"brazen interference\" in diplomacy in Africa that might have dissuaded some African heads of state to head to Russia. Of course, Putin invaded Ukraine. He is also indicted for war crimes for his actions in Ukraine, something he denies. But this can be seen in two ways. In one way you can see that dramatic reduction as a slight toward Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin and perhaps it is. But in another way, you can see that, with any African leader showing up, it shows that Vladimir Putin is not totally isolated from the rest of the world. Russia continues to do brisk trade with parts of Africa. Its Wagner mercenary group that has ties to the Kremlin is operating in large parts of the continent. And while there will be many different topics on the table for the discussion, the use for Putin will be that he is not isolated and he is playing the senior diplomatic role on the world stage. Senior officials, including the president from South Africa, will be attending. They say they want to push their so-called Africa peace initiative. They've already had meetings in Ukraine and in Moscow on that. So no sign of any movement on that in terms of stopping the fighting in Ukraine. But it will be very interesting to see the upticks of all those African leaders standing with Vladimir Putin, an indicted war criminal, on the stage. Eleni.",

He was out and about on Tuesday, launching a roads project, surrendered by some of these presidential guards, who are now said to have barricaded him inside the presidential palace.

There were ninecounts in total related to incidents that occurred in the early 2000s and 2010s. We are seeing live images coming through from a courthouse in London. We are anticipating that Kevin Spacey will be addressing reporters shortly. We'll be keeping a very close watch on the latest from London as we wait for Spacey to head to those microphones, as you can see on your screen right now. In the meantime, New York fire officials say they're battling a five-alarm blaze after a burning crane toppled from a Manhattan construction site a short time ago. The footage of the collapse is incredibly dramatic. I want you to take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But Iwould like to say that I am enormously grateful to the jury for having taken the time to examine all of the evidence and all of the facts carefully before they reached their decision. And I am humbled by the outcome today. I also want to thank the staff inside this courthouse, the security and all of those who took care of us every single day, my legal team, Evan Laun's (ph) team and Lucy (ph) for being here every day. And that's all I have to say for the moment. Thank you very much.",

He said he's humbled and he's grateful to the jury for what he says, taking the time to examine the facts before reaching a decision. We've got Salma Abdelaziz joining us now live outside the courthouse. Look, he said he's humbled. He thanked his legal team but this is really big for him. This is something that has plagued his career. And it's interesting to see this decision coming through today.",

All of these accusations, these incidences surfacing in the light of the #MeToo movement. So this will potentially be seen as a blow to the #MeToo movement. But for Kevin Spacey, a man who has throughout said he is innocent, who has denied all charges, this is absolutely a day of victory for him and a day that he hopes will allow him to win back his award-winning career.",
