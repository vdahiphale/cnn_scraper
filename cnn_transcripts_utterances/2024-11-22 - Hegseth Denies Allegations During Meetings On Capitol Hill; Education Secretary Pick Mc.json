Trump's choice for defense secretary, the Fox News host and Army veteran Pete Hegseth, was on Capitol Hill Thursday just hours after a police report from 2017 was made public. A woman accused Hegseth of assaulting her in a California hotel room. Hegseth was never criminally charged in the case, but he did later pay the accuser in a confidential settlement agreement.

Pam Bondi is the nominee. Pete Hegseth's future is unclear. It's going to be very tempting to follow the story about the individual nominees, but I think what connects the dots here is President-elect Trump and the policies that he wants to pursue, and the idea that he's interested in political loyalists for a lot of these jobs -- and loyalists that have taken on the institutions. I think in this particular case I'm also looking at female representation in the Senate. Because I think one of the big concerns in the U.S. military that has nothing to do directly with sort of readiness or force posture or all that but of culture of the military is that for women in the military pre all of this there have been longstanding concerns about whether there's safety in these sort of -- I don't know -- like, sexual safety situations.",

But he is accused of abusing boys and having fetishes toward them -- something that even federal investigators ultimately ended up looking into. But the big question here is what did Linda McMahon know when she was the CEO of the WWE, and when did she know it? At some point in time in the late '80s -- 1988, Linda and Vince McMahon -- they fired Mel Phillips and then they brought him back to the company about six months later. And so now, because the state of Maryland has changed its law about when you can bring child abuse lawsuits, there are anonymous former ring boys who are suing McMahon -- the McMahons -- both of them -- as well as the company, claiming that there was negligence there. That they knew and allowed this person, Mel Phillips, to continue to exist within the WWE. Now, there are a lot of things left to happen in this court case. It is something that was filed just in October. But we already have a statement from the attorney for Linda McMahon. This is Laura Brevetti. She said in a statement that the civil lawsuit is based upon 30-plus-year-old allegations and filled with scarless lies, exaggerations, and misrepresentations regarding Linda McMahon. And that she will vigorously defend against this baseless lawsuit and without doubt, ultimately succeed. Vince McMahon's lawyer has also put out a statement previously saying these allegations are false. But it's raising questions at a moment when Linda McMahon is being picked by Donald Trump to be the secretary of the Department of Education, a department that has quite a lot to do with the welfare of children in the United States.

And most importantly, what it would mean for her to be at the top of the Department of Justice considering what President Trump -- former President Trump has said he wants to do with the department? O'MARA:  Well, first -- yeah. First, I had several cases against her -- with Ms. Bondi way back in the day when she was a line prosecutor. First and foremost, she's a prosecutor. She's a good trial attorney, formidable in a courtroom, quite honestly. Now, as an attorney general she's not going to show up in a criminal courtroom very often, but she does have that ability, that style. And that presence I think is going to serve her very well as the attorney general. HUNT:  So, Mark, what -- how would you say her experience stacks up for the job that she has been nominated for? Because there have been sort of two parallel tracks here as we've been trying to cover Trump's nominees for these positions. Some of them have very problematic personal issues. Matt Gaetz is a good example -- the one who -- you know, who obviously just was pulled to make way for Bondi. But the other is questions about OK, what experience do you bring to the job? Does it line up with the types of experience that others have brought to the job in the past? How does Bondi's experience stack up for -- in terms of others who have also been attorneys general of the United States? O'MARA:  Well, if I compare it to the most recent nominee, Matt Gaetz, they are worlds apart. Matt Gaetz, I don't think had any experience in a courtroom -- no real trial experience. And although trial experience in and of itself isn't necessary for the job, the idea of being comfortable in the courtroom and presenting yourself -- it has become pretty apparent not only when she was a prosecutor over in Hillsborough County but since that she has a great presence. And after all, the attorney general job is sort of just that. So I think she -- comparing to Gaetz and also comparing to some of the other nominees for the other positions, she has the pedigree. She truly does because she's, again, been in a courtroom and presents very well. I think she's going to be an easy nominee approval by the Congress because she doesn't have some of the downside it seems that people like Matt Gaetz would have brought into it. So I think it's going to be pretty smooth. And if you compare her to all the other candidates, I think she's going to be an easy choice to be approved.",
