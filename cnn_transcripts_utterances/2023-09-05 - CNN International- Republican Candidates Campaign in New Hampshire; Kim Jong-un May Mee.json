Several candidates campaigning throughout the Labor Day weekend in New Hampshire. Of course, a critical stop on the road to the White House. Iowa will vote first next January, followed by New Hampshire. So several candidates were fanning out, making their case to voters. Republicans, of course, independent voters as well. Also important here in New Hampshire. But it was former Vice President Mike Pence who made the case that he said the race is not at the end. It's at the beginning. MIKE PENCE, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't know about the rest of you, but I think Labor Day is when campaigns begin. And I'm here because I really do believe. The different times call for different leadership. And I promise you, I'm going to continue to work my heart out to hold up a banner of common-sense conservative values. Strong National Defense, American leadership in the world. Fiscal responsibility, free market economics, traditional values in life. There's some people to say those aren't the values of the Republican Party anymore, right? I beg to differ. I believe they still are.",

But there is also a sense that many Republican voters, and certainly independent voters, have open minds. Many want to turn the page from the Trump style of leadership. Others do not believe he can win a general election.So going into the fall stages of the campaign, one thing is clear. This field of Republican candidates are beginning to try at least to distinguish themselves, to differentiate themselves. Donald Trump has not been on the campaign trail here in New Hampshire in a while. He is going to be returning to the campaign trail in other parts of the country this week, even as he contends with his legal cases around him. But as we enter a post Labor Day phase of the campaign, the question really is, is the race near the end or is it, as Mr. Pence said just, just beginning. Jeff Zeleny, CNN, Rye, New Hampshire.

Kim Jong-un may meet with Vladimir Putin and Russia -- that's according to the U.S. National Security Council -- and they are expected to discuss potential arms deals for Russia to get more North Korean weapons to use against Ukraine. The timing of this meeting is unclear. But it was \"The New York Times\" that first reported about this potential meeting. Saying that Kim would travel from Pyongyang to Vladivostok, where he would meet with Putin at a forum set to run this weekend. Starting from September the 10th, around the same time as the G20 in India.Now Vladivostok is not far from North Korea. It's where this scene played out in 2019, where Kim and Putin met for the very first time. And Kim made that journey on his famous train, his slow chugging, heavily armored green train. Now as for this new potential meeting, \"The Times\" reports that in exchange for weapons, what North Korea wants is advanced technology from the Russians. Technology for satellites and for nuclear powered submarines. As well as desperately needed food aid. Now this potential meeting, it follows a recent visit by the Russian Defense Minister who visited North Korea in July, along with the Chinese delegation. It also comes after U.S. officials said that the two countries are actively advancing their talks over another potential arms deal. You know, last year the U.S. and North Korea delivered rockets and missiles to Russia for use by Wagner forces, which are something North Korea has denied. Russia and North Korea, without a doubt, their alliance is getting closer. They've been edging closer together. We've learned the Russian Defense minister says that joint military exercises with North Korea are currently being discussed. And Kim and Putin have exchanged letters to each other pledging to boost the alliance and to increase their cooperation. Back to you, Max and Bianca.",
