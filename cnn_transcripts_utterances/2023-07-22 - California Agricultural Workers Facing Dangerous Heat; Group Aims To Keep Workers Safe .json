And Gillette Stadium shut down the Luke Combs concert as lightning flashed overhead. Fans were forced to shelter in place on the main concourse. 33 million people are under severe weather threats today. And it's not just the concern of storms. Heat warnings are in effect for 80 million people from California to Florida. And cities like Phoenix continuing to set records for 22 straight days. It's been over 110 degrees in the Arizona capital. And now, to the question that millions are asking, when will there be a cool down? CNN's Chad Myers is in the Weather Center. Hello again, Chad.

Lots of sunshine, sunscreen, you're going to need there across parts of the Northeast, where down along the Gulf Coast, you're probably if you're at the beach and have your sunscreen, you may want to keep listening for thunder because there'll be a lot of thunderstorm activity down here. So, yes, when the weather service puts out these boxes, when we have colors on the map, that just doesn't mean that it's summer. The temperatures have to exceed the normal threshold by a certain amount, seven, 10, to 15 degrees, whatever it would be to get to these different categories. So, yes, it's not just summer, it's hot and hotter than it should be. Pensacola feels like right now, 105. You'll get a little bit of a gulf breeze later on, but that's not going to cool you down much. Temperatures without the humidity out here in the desert southwest, well above 100, just about everywhere. But a little piece -- a little piece of this heat begins to break off midweek and it gets to Chicago. And then, by the weekend, it gets up and toward New York City and all of the Northeast. So, you'll begin to warm up day by day, maybe one or two degrees as you work your way into the weekend. So, yes, Chicago, you're going to warm up a little bit. 84 today, but 94 by the end of the week. So, here it comes, spread it out a little bit. I guess.",

So, we don't know about any potential FBI interview that might be scheduled or perhaps a grand jury appearance that might be scheduled. But we do know that Jack Smith has been in contact with Brian Kemp. Why would he be interested? Well, as you mentioned, Donald Trump spent a lot of time during the 2020 transition period, pressuring Governor Kemp and trying to bring Kemp on board to his efforts to interfere with the results in Georgia. He wanted Brian Kemp to refuse to certify the election that Joe Biden won. Governor Kemp followed the law and set signed the papers that were required to certify the victory. There were phone calls between Trump and Kemp, where Trump tried to twist his arm, part of a multi-state effort to overturn the results in states that he lost, Fredricka. And keep in mind, this is not the only governor or former governor that has been in touch with the special counsel.

The situation with a special military operation and in the country in general is deplorable to put it mildly, he said. This is a result of actions of the incumbent power. Girkin is a former colonel in Russia security service FSB and was the defense minister of the so-called Donetsk People's Republic in eastern Ukraine, when the Malaysian jetliner M.H.17 was shot down there in 2014. Girkin was found guilty of mass murder in absentia by a Dutch court for involvement in the incident, which he has never acknowledged.

He said that one of the reasons why it's going so slow now is because the counter offensive started late. He said the Ukrainian simply didn't have enough munitions at the time to start this earlier to start the offensive in spring. And also said, they were still learning some of those Western weapons, which took a lot longer to get to the battlefield. And that allowed the Russians to lay some massive minefields and entrench themselves down there. However, he said one of the reasons why he thinks things could start speeding up soon is that the Ukrainians are conducting demining.

JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS, CNN MILITARY ANALYST, U.S. ARMY (RET.): Fred, Zelenskyy is the leader of a nation that's fighting for its sovereignty. So, we better hear from him that things are clicking along, and there is a pace that can be maintained. And that success is inevitable, however you define success.

[12:30:04] You know, when you go on a counter offensive, there is a narrative that there is going to be a blast of tanks and artillery firing very, you know, clairvoyant type intelligence, it's not the case. This is more art than anything else. And the Russians in place for over five months digging in this great defensive, these number of defensive belts in depth, and mining operations are absolutely part of it. A good leader on the ground would say, look, if we're going to be here, dig deeper, improve your position always, and reach out as far as I can with barriers to move the enemy.

And all of a sudden, now, Congress and Senate they realize they've been lied to. When they've asked for information, they don't get answers. The whole world is creaking under the stress and the weight of whatever this UFO presence is here on planet Earth.Now, we don't know what UFOs represent to humanity yet. But these hearings coming up, that's hopefully what will shed some light on the capabilities of these advanced vehicles. Whose are they?",

We're not getting the truth about what we know in the Department of Defense.Look, a lot of people have come forward saying we've been reverse engineering these craft and they're not from here. So I'm not going to mince words. \"The New York Times\" reported on this, craft of unknown origin is one way to say it, another way to say it is craft not made here on Earth, which was reported in \"The New York Times\" who was somebody who worked on the programs.",

In a lot of my matches, I usually hit a 10 to 15 minute stretch where I can really, really play well. And I kind of hit that stretch. And I think I pushed it for two sets and maybe two and a half sets almost three sets.And there's not really anything any secret if I could bottle it up I promise I would, I'd probably sell it to people. But it just something just began to click. I was on a court that I was somewhat familiar with. I won my second round on that same court. The crowd gave me a lot of support and a lot of, you know, energy kind of invigorated me. But honestly, I can't really say what it was. It just things just started going well.

I think years and years and years of playing tournaments and being in stressful situations, playing long matches, playing short matches, playing well, playing bad. I've had probably every combination you could imagine, throughout the course of a tennis match.And I think I can just resort just go back to the experience and just say I've been here before. I've played long matches before. Let's just try to focus again on the next, getting the next game or getting for me getting the next hold unserved. That's always usually my focus. If I hold serve, it frees me up to play the other areas of my game. So my energy kind of gets just tunnel vision to I need to hold serve here. And then we kind of figure everything else out after, oh, now it's time to hold serve again. And so having that as kind of like my, I'll say like my home, is always just about holding serve, I think allows me the ability to play somewhat longer physical matches, because my mind is more focused on one thing as opposed to all the opponents playing well. We've been playing for four hours. This is starting to be a lot. I mean the quarters up again, it's not all of that kind of goes out the window when you say I need to hold serve right here.
