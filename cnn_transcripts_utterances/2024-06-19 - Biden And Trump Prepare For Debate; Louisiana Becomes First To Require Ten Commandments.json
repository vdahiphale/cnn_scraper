I'm Abby Phillip in Washington. For decades, Camp David has been a sacred place where American presidents have hosted VIPs and villains from Churchill to Putin. But deep in the woods of Maryland, it is also the place where presidents have prepared for political survival. Back in 1980, ahead of his debate with Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter battled a fake Gipper at that very location. And speaking of Reagan, he did the same in 1984 after his first debate, where he came across as tired and rambling. He started to get questions about his age. So, when Reagan hunkered down to prepare for the other debates, the prep helped give birth to one of the most memorable lines in American political history. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The president's face-off with Donald Trump is just a little more than a week away from tonight, right here on CNN. And for his challenger and predecessor, tonight, we are also learning that Trump is hunkering down in debate prep as well, except he's not doing mock debates. He's opting instead for policy sessions with some of his VP contenders and supporters. And part of those sessions includes trying to find a Goldilocks answer to January 6th.

So, 408 times a juror said, Donald Trump, you are guilty. That is an important message as we go. We still got these other trials about mishandling classified documents, putting our military in jeopardy.But I think the big overall message for us and everybody who's watching the show at home is the economy and creating jobs, good paying jobs. Inflation has continued to come down. But, you know, we still have a lot of work to do. And I give the president credit for building the strongest economy of any nation in the world today. We've come out of COVID. I think it's that. And then I think, honestly, Abby, a big piece of this is the issue of democracy. We saw what happened on January 6th. They tried to destroy our democracy, the United States of America. And he wants to pardon all these people. And then you look at Joe Biden in Normandy the other day, standing up for America, making us proud of who we are as Americans and what we represent on the world stage. So, I'd say it's democracy. I think it's about the economy. But we are running against a convicted felon. And let me finally say that the issue of choice, Donald Trump's Supreme Court is the reason women have seen their rights to make their own decisions about their body being taken away. The issue of choice, it has been strong here in Virginia. It's been strong over the country. Women and young people have come out in record numbers. Trump brags about packing the Supreme Court to stop Roe v. Wade, and that's going to come back and people are going to be motivated. So, I think all of those issues together. I'm excited.",

Look at how he has helped so many young people today erase their student loans so they're not burdened and, you know, they can go back about their lives and do things. So, we're going to talk about the issues, the economy, democracy. We're going to talk about choice. But there's a real distinction of who's going to take this country forward.

This is \"NewsNight.\"(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [23:22:39] PHILLIP: President Biden and Donald Trump are putting an obvious focus on the state of Wisconsin. It is a state that could potentially tilt the election that both have campaigned there recently, including last night when Trump declared his love for Milwaukee after calling it a horrible city just a few days ago. One of my next guests actually opened for him at that rally. But one of the hottest topics between the two candidates involves this state. It's a busted project that now Trump and Biden have a hand in. Back in 2017, Trump promised that the Taiwan-based electronics giant Foxconn would be opening a plant right outside of Milwaukee. The company was supposed to invest $10 billion in that plant, which would have created 13,000 jobs. In 2019, though, the deal was scaled back significantly, down to a $672 million and a promise of 1,500 jobs. But now, President Biden has announced that Microsoft will be pouring $3.3 billion to build an AI data hub on the same land as the failed Foxconn venture. That project is expected to create 2,000 permanent jobs and 2,300 construction jobs. As Trump was rallying in Wisconsin yesterday, the Biden campaign emailed its supporters about that failed deal. They wrote, \"This isn't the only time Donald Trump screwed over workers when he was president. His economic agenda shuttered factories and incentivized companies to ship American jobs overseas all while handing out tax breaks to the ultra-wealthy and big companies.\" Joining me now is former Wisconsin governor and Trump ally, Scott Walker. Also, with us, chair of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, Ben Wikler. Scott, I want to start with you. Is that failed Foxconn deal a vulnerability for Trump?",

This is a jobs boom and a president who is focused on fighting special interests to bring costs down, starting with big drug companies. We've already brought the cost of insulin for people on Medicare down to $35 a month. He wants to do the same thing for everyone who needs insulin and go to other drugs.

President Trump is running on a plan to jack up prices. He -- you can read the Project 2025. He wants to give away the store to special interests. He met with oil company executives and told them that if they gave him a billion dollars for his campaign, he'd give them whatever they wanted.And the opposite is true with President Biden. I mean, President Biden, unlike President Trump, apparently loves Wisconsin, loves our -- our cities and small towns and rural areas, and he's actually working to deliver stuff for people here. And if he has another term, he's going to go toe to toe with special interests across the board to keep bringing costs down. And we can see that in his record in bipartisan legislation that he has passed through Congress and signed into law. Trump's big bill was a tax cut for the ultra-wealthy and putting Supreme Court justices in who terminated Roe versus Wade and side against unions and workers at every step. For President Biden, he walked on a picket line, he signed the infrastructure bill, he signed the law to negotiate for lower prices for prescription drugs and Medicare. [23:30:01] Over and over, he has done what he said he was going to do. And what he is saying right now is that he's going to stop at nothing to bring costs down for working families and keep bringing those job numbers and those manufacturing jobs up.",

It shows him a little bit ahead of Donald Trump. One of the main reasons is because of a rebounding in voter sentiment about the economy.And yet you see the Biden administration also kind of doubling down on Trump's convictions on this. You know -- and I don't want to downplay the democracy argument, but they're -- they're running ads about Trump being in it for himself, highlighting his 34 convictions. Is that the right emphasis at this point in time or should they be focusing on some of the economic points that you are making here on the show?",

And on the one hand, we see Trump, you know, committed dozens of crimes in order to prevent voters from finding out the truth when he was running in 2016. He tried to throw out 100,000 Milwaukee votes and many others to try to overturn the election in 2020 in a conspiracy -- a criminal conspiracy. And now he wants to get into the White House to go after the people who he thinks wronged him. It's a -- it's a revenge campaign.And on the other hand, President Biden, who is delivering and talking about his economic record and his continued work to bring costs down and bring that economic boom into -- in ways that resonate for everyone. I think the more people find out about Trump, the better it is for Biden. The more people find out about what Biden has done and plans to do, the better it is for Biden. And making that choice come into focus is the key. The big challenge, if you dig into these polls, it's people who were able to tune out of politics because President Biden is not someone who makes you wake up in the middle of the night sweating in fear about what he might have done to, I don't know, side with North Korea and allow them to get nuclear weapons. President Biden is actually a steady hand on the tiller. So, a lot of people have stopped paying as much attention to the news, and the people paying the least attention to news are the people who aren't sure how they're going to vote. Those who are paying attention are siding with Biden. And so, I really think both to focus on Biden and on Trump, all of those things help President Biden win reelection and help ensure that we can restore the freedom to access an abortion safely and legally, that we can protect our democracy, and that we build an economy from the middle out instead of just giveaways to the ultra-wealthy.",

The people I talk to across Wisconsin and states all across the country are worried about the economy.Heck, we just did a poll with Young America's Foundation. Number one issue of college students isn't what anybody would think. It's the economy. That's because people are hurting and Joe Biden's policies are adding to the pain. They want a leader who's going to step forward. Yeah, maybe four years ago, there were some voters who didn't like all the chaos, didn't like some of the tweets out there.
