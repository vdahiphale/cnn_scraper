Just ahead, Israeli airstrikes continue in Gaza as the Pope calls for a ceasefire and the release of hostages on this Christmas Day. Thousands of migrants are joining a caravan headed towards the U.S., as local authorities warn they can't handle the surge. And we'll tell you about a group of British swimmers who aren't intimidated by the cold. They've been racing in freezing waters on Christmas for generations.Most people around the world celebrate Christmas. For Palestinians in Gaza, there is more suffering and death. The Hamas-run Health Ministry reports at least 70 people were killed in an Israeli airstrike at the Al-Maghazi refugee camp. Israel's Military says that it is reviewing the incident. We want to warn you we're going to show you some disturbing images. This video shot by a CNN crew shows casualties from the strikes. You can see body bags and family members looking on. The reported strikes come as Israel's Prime Minister vows to intensify the fight against Hamas. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (TRANSLATED): Citizens of Israel, we are deepening the war in the Gaza Strip. We will continue to fight until the total victory over Hamas. The war has a price, a very heavy price in the lives of our heroic warriors, and we are doing everything to safeguard the lives of our warriors. But, one thing we will not do, we will not stop until we achieve victory. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Quite a busy and deadly weekend for both the IDF over the weekend, and as we reported, that Israeli strike in Gaza. Will, what's the latest? WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, Bianna. More than a dozen IDF soldiers and scores of civilians in Gaza. The video of the body bags is tragic. It is upsetting, and yet it is sadly familiar. We keep seeing these images over and over again. And then, of course at the Rafah crossing, that desperation of people who don't have enough to eat, don't have clean water, don't have supplies, people so desperate that they would storm the aid trucks, preventing the aid from getting to people, reliably, from getting to most people, people just basically grabbing what they couldn't, a bundle running away, gunshots in the crowd. But, this is the hell that people in Gaza are living on this Christmas Day. Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, actually, they just released some photos from his office, showing that he made his second visit into northern Gaza since the beginning of this war on October 7, which does show that Israel has some semblance of operational control in the north, so that they're confident enough to send in their Prime Minister. But, the situation is very volatile in central Gaza to the south. And while there is no active warzone over in the Israeli occupied West Bank, home to the city of Bethlehem, the biblical birthplace of Jesus, a city that is so crucial for Christians on this day, well, a very different kind of suffering happening there. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RIPLEY (voice-over): Christmas is canceled in Bethlehem. Church bells ring. But, no one is listening. The season's magic missing from Manger Square, along with the Christmas tree and dangling decorations. In the biblical birthplace of Jesus, only sadness fills the air.

He also urged the release of the hostages being held in Gaza, and express sorrow for those who've been killed in the conflict. CNN's Vatican Correspondent Christopher Lamb has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHRISTOPHER LAMB, CNN VATICAN CORRESPONDENT: Pope Francis has used his Christmas Day message to call for a ceasefire in the Israel and Hamas war, and for an end to conflicts that are taking place across the globe. The Pope made his remarks in his Christmas Day \"Urbi et Orbi\" message, which means to the city of Rome and to the world. And in those remarks, he called war an inexcusable folly, and said that the world should say no to war. The Pope prayed for an end to military operations that are taking place in the Israel and Hamas conflict. And he also reiterated his appeal for hostages to be freed. Now, the Pope's remarks on hostages come a day after Sara Netanyahu, the wife of the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, had written to Francis asking for his assistance in trying to free those hostages taken by Hamas and being held in Gaza. Elsewhere in his address, the Pope called the peace in Ukraine, and for an end to conflicts in Syria and in Africa, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and in South Sudan. The Pope, who recently turned 87-years-old, delivered his remarks from the balcony overlooking St. Peter's Square. Francis has recently had a bout of ill health, having contracted bronchitis, but the Pope seemed to be recovered from that and was able to deliver his remarks without too much difficulty. Francis also criticized strongly the arms trade which he said was profiting from wars across the world. And he said that children being caught up in these conflicts were the little Jesuses of today.

What local officials that we talked to are telling us is that it's unsustainable because they have enough problems as it is with tackling local crime and protecting the community. And this is a community of only 30,000 people. And if you consider that thousands and thousands of people are getting here every week, it is hard -- it is easy to imagine how bad the situation is here.And Bianna, over the weekend, this holding area behind me was filled with immigrants who were re brought here after they surrendered to immigration officials at points along the border or at ports of entry. CBP managed to empty this area yesterday. But, just about an hour ago, it started to fill up again, and they're processing them as fast as they can. It is a cold morning here. We've been traveling to different points along the border, and we've seen how immigrants keep crossing even when immigration officials and the State of Texas have installed obstacles, including barbed wire on the banks of the Rio Grande, and buoys in the river itself that serve as floating barriers. We talked to a mother who traveled with her three-year-old son and 16- year-old daughter by land from Honduras in Central America. All three of them surrendered to immigration authorities at the border on Christmas Eve, and were hoping to spend this Christmas Day at a shelter. We also talked to a woman from Cuba, who says she, her sister and her sister's daughter were kidnapped as they traveled by land in Mexico after their family paid ransom. They were then robbed before getting to the border. In spite of all that, she says she feels blessed this Christmas day.
