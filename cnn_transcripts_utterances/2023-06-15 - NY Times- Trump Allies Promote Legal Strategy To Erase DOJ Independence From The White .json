You might remember that name because the former President tried to make him the Attorney General, during his final days, in office, as part of his effort to overturn the election. Joining us now Charlie Savage, who shares a byline, on this \"New York Times\" story. Also, Andy McCabe, CNN's Senior Law Enforcement Analyst, and the former FBI Deputy Director, and for a time, a victim of the former President's hunger, for political payback. Charlie, reading through this, I was thinking about how we see a lot of talk, from Trump, about the Justice Department. But it's not just empty rhetoric, because what you're reporting is, is that there are actually people working, behind-the-scenes, to formulate a plan, of what this would look like, of putting this in place.",

The President does not involve himself in that for the last 50 years. And Trump is openly saying, \"Forget it.

So, despite what Judge Cannon's intentions may be, on a speedy trial, do you believe it's likely that this trial is going to get delayed? How much? Could it be after the 2024 election? VANCE JR.: I think it certainly could be, after the 2024 election. I think in federal court, in particular, they control -- the judges control their calendars, with a tight fist. And that said, it's a case with some complexity. And the lawyers, on one side, are going to be saying, \"We're ready to move this as quickly as possible.\" The lawyers on the other side are going to be saying \"Perhaps, we need more time to develop defense, or develop another angle of litigation.\" And I think the judge is probably going to be given an opportunity, to do something, right down the middle.",

Do you have concerns about her lack of experience, when it comes to overseeing trials? Do you think that'll impact how the Special Counsel approaches this? VANCE JR.: The fact that she does not have a deep experience in criminal cases, is going to make it, I think, a challenge, for the judge. That's not to say that she's not going to dig in that she's not going to try to fully understand, by getting help, from others, perhaps. There's nothing wrong with that. The criminal procedural aspects of the case. But this is a very important case. Her rulings are going to be critical, in terms of what the outcome may be. And so, I think the judge is going to have to show, by her demeanor, and by her rulings, that she understands the terrain that she is playing in.

VANCE JR.: Yes, I think, unquestionably. The New York case, the hush money case, the charges with which the President has been indicted for, do not carry a mandatory prison sentence. I think it's an unlikely event that Donald Trump, if convicted, in New York, would be sent to jail. The Attorney General's case is a civil case. It's a very strong case. But it's a civil case. And so, there are limitations as to what the remedy would be. Of the three cases, clearly, the documents case, dealing with national security issues, is the most significant, and presents the greatest risk, for the President. Now, there's still two outstanding investigations that we are aware of, one in Georgia, and one around January 6.

Also, Sarah Matthews, who we should note served inside the Trump White House, and also testified before the House's January 6 Committee. Thank you both for being here. When you look at what Judge Cannon is ordering, today, which is really her first big order, in this case, is to get the ball rolling, on these attorneys, getting security clearances. Obviously, they need them, because of what is at the heart of this. What does it say to you, though, about her timeline for what this is going to look like? ELLIOT WILLIAMS, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Well, it shows that she didn't fumble one of the more basic rulings, she would have had, to enter, in this case, which is that in order for this, to even take place, at all, in any way, Kaitlan, you have to get lawyers, security clearances. Otherwise, they can't even view the evidence that their client is being accused of having mishandled.

He got us all in a room, and something I'd suggested, and just to hear everybody out, so that he knew what our thoughts were. We'd send emissaries in. And he would send somebody over to see us, back and forth. And it's always something gets lost in the translation. And I suggested to the Speaker, that he get us all in the room.
