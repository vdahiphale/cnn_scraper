You are watching CNN's special coverage of Election Day in America.The polls set to open just a couple of hours from now for millions of Americans, and the presidential candidates wrapping up their final rallies. Among those joining them, Oprah Winfrey, Lady Gaga, Will.i.am there with Kamala Harris for her final campaign event in Philadelphia. The vice president is scheduled to do a series of radio interviews today, before watching the election results from her alma mater, Howard University. Here's part of her closing argument to voters. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S. (D) AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: We will build an economy where we bring down the cost of living. We will ban corporate price gouging on groceries. We will make housing and childcare more affordable. We will cut taxes for workers, for middle class families and small businesses. We will lower health care costs, including the cost of home care for seniors. Because on the issue of health care, I absolutely believe access to health care should be a right, and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

She's a bad person. Evil. She's an evil, sick, crazy bitch. Oh no. It starts with a B, but I won't say it. I want to say it. Adam shifty Schiff. I call him pencil neck. He's got the smallest neck I've ever seen. He's got about a four. And he's got the biggest head. So I don't know how the neck can hold the head. He's an unattractive guy, both inside and out. She called up and conceded, and then spent seven years on saying how she was a good sport. Oh, she's a wonderful, she's a lovely person, crooked Hillary. But you know what? She's smart. And but she wasn't like she lied a lot. I mean, but nobody lies like this, Kamala. She's a very low IQ person. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, they'll give us some indications about rural versus urban, some of the demographic considerations. But they are, you know, they're southern states, so the white electorate is more conservative.You know, it's interesting that so much has changed since Harris replaced Biden as the Democratic nominee. She's certainly running better than he did, particularly among younger voters, Latino voters and Black voters. But in many ways, she's kind of ending up in the same place as he did, as he was, which is that her clearest path, with a big gap, is in sweeping the three states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. You know, I'm the person who coined the phrase the blue wall back in 2009, originally referred to 18 states that voted Democratic from 92 to 2012. Now, most people think about just those three states, which Trump knocked out of the blue wall in 2016. And those are states where Democrats can run better among white voters than they do in most parts of the country. And that's why, Erica, you know, it is entirely possible that Harris could win those three states and win them the Electoral College, even if she wins the popular vote by only about as much as Clinton did in 2016, which wasn't enough to win those three states. And the reason is that, like Biden in 2020, she does seem to be running better among white voters and her decline in the popular vote will primarily be among Latino voters who aren't that relevant, as relevant in those states as they are elsewhere. And so you have this possibility, you know, this assumption has been in both parties. Democrats have to win the popular vote by a lot in order to get to 270. That may be less true this year because of the way each coalition is evolving.",

But, you know, to Ron's point, even in some of this most recent polling, we're seeing a little bit of a drop compared to the numbers in 2020 for Biden when it comes to Harris's support among Black and Latino voters in this latest NPR-Marist poll, down eight points among likely Black voters, down about 2 percent from 2020 among likely Latino voters. Is it your sense that the events of the last week have injected a little bit more optimism in either of those voting blocs?",

And I know this because, as you know well, I work very closely with the Latino community and with a lot of the groups that work with Latinos and with groups that work with Black voters as well.But specifically among the Latino community, Erica, I spoke to a pollster earlier today who was part of the consortium of pollsters who were doing the exit polls. And what he told me is that the exit polls that they are doing now, which will continue until Election Day is over, but they're doing quite a bit now because of the early vote. Those aren't really polls. They're actually talking to voters who already voted. They have seen an increase in support for Kamala Harris of 10 points among Latino voters, especially the Puerto Rican voters in Pennsylvania and across the battleground states ever since the Madison Square Garden rally where Donald Trump had his supporters, specifically the comedian, call Puerto Rico an island of trash. So that really pushed Puerto Rican voters as well as Latino voters who also felt offended to say, you know what, this is absolutely unacceptable. We are going to mobilize. We're going to energize our friends and family to vote against Donald Trump and to go vote for Kamala Harris. You even had Latino voters who were Donald Trump supporters who flipped on him because they were so pissed off at how he and his allies were treating the Latino community. So I do believe that at the end of the day, when all the votes are counted, Vice President Harris is going to register at least the same amount, if not more, I believe it will be more of support among the Latino community than Joe Biden had in 2020. And I believe the same can be also for Black voters, for support among the Latino community than Joe Biden had in 2020. And I believe the same can be also for Black voters for different reasons, but they're coming home. And I've talked to pollsters who also do polling in the Black community and they're saying, look, this whole myth that Harris is bleeding support from Black voters is just that it's a myth. And so I think at the end of the day, they will come home as well.",

How concerned are you about Donald Trump's efforts to undermine this election and to sow doubt about the election before it even happens? SCOTT JENNINGS, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATORAnd everybody should act responsibly today and in the days ahead. Look, we have a beautiful, magical system in this country. It's a diffused system. You've got all these amazing volunteers, municipal staff, county clerks, secretaries of state. The way we do it protects it. And the way we do it, I think, gives you really good insurance against anything bad happening on a massive scale. So I'm going to choose to be optimistic about this election, both on the front of we're all going to believe that it's a free and fair election and maybe, just maybe, we'll get results in a timely fashion. So as we sit here at 4:41 a.m. -- by the way, I don't know if any of the rest of you figured out who we made angry at CNN, but if we're at 4:41 a.m., I'm going to have a glass half full view of this whole thing because I believe in the way we do it.

      "sentences": "I am suspicious of this. I think that there isn't, you know, there's been a real appeal by the Harris campaign to do this kind of whisper network. There was a really strong Julia Roberts narrated ad which tells women that they can vote against their husband and you can actually say you're going to do one thing and secretly do another.And it shows women sort of nodding at each other across the ballot box. You know, we're not in the 1950s. I do think that, you know, if you live in a household where you might disagree with your spouse, I hope that you can feel that you can actually vote your conscience and not have to worry about it. There was this very funny meme going around, though, that showed Donald Trump looking at Melania Trump's ballot when she was casting her vote, which I have to say went pretty viral because maybe the person who doesn't trust who is voting is Donald Trump with Melania. She's been pretty absent on the campaign trail, as has Ivanka Trump. So maybe the women in his family might vote differently. But I'm not sure there is going to be a huge hidden vote. I think what you're seeing, though, is that women are coming out very strongly for Harris. Reproductive rights are an enormous issue because in this country, since the fall of Roe, we have seen it affect women. And, you know, that has become a central issue of this campaign. And Donald Trump, frankly, hasn't done well with women, which is why one of his closing arguments was, you know, to try and appeal to women, a lot of pink signs with women for Trump behind him. But as you heard there, he didn't really stay on message. He went dark. And so we'll have to see. Is it the bros or is it the gals?",

And what we go underreported way too much is actually who will control congressional majorities in both houses because of where we live.You talked about the concentration in Pennsylvania. There's 578,000, mainly Puerto Rican and Dominican Latinos, but Mexican-Americans in Arizona and Nevada will have a big impact. And another underreported thing is there's a substantial amount of Mexican-Americans in Milwaukee and over 150,000 Latino voters in Michigan. These voters are all within the difference of what it was in the last election. That's why I think it will be so critical.",

We should get some sombreros and taco trucks and show up down at Allentown. You're going to be highly embarrassed because in Allentown, Reading, Wilkes-Barre and all these places where you've seen all these candidates on the east side of Pennsylvania are not even immigrants from the island of Puerto Rico.

When you're talking about a voter in its 40s, no matter what the color of their skin or a voter in their 20s, they just show up at different rates.
