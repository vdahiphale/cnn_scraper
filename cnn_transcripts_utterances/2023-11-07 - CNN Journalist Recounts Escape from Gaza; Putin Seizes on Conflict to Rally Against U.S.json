      "sentences": "Thank you so much for joining us. Well, Donald Trump has denied wrongdoing in each and every case against him. And Monday was no different when he took the stand and his civil fraud trial. He was belligerent with the New York judge who ordered the former U.S. president's legal team to control their client, reminding him that this was not a political rally. And that same judge whom Trump called extremely hostile will determine the financial penalties and whether Trump will be barred from doing business in New York.The judge already ruled that Trump was liable for fraud for inflating his wealth to secure better deals from banks and insurance companies. Throughout Trump's nearly four-hour testimony he flung insults at the court boasted about his net worth and insisted the whole ordeal was a scam and a disgrace. And at one point when questioned about paperwork from 2021, Trump said he was not involved because he was too busy protecting the U.S. from China and Russia. CNN's Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid has a closer look at what happened in court and what comes next. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): I think it went very well, former President Donald Trump leaving court after testifying in an attempt to defend his real estate business. DONALD TRUMP (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's a scam and this is a case that should have never been brought up. REID (voiceover): During nearly four hours on the stand, Trump continuously clashed with Judge Arthur Engoron. I'm sure that judge will rule against me because he always rules against me. The judge responding, you can attack me, you can do whatever you want but answer the question. In another testy exchange, the judge had to instruct defense attorney Chris Kise to control your client. Adding this is not a political rally. We are here to hear him answer questions. And most of the time he's not. The judge said and then threatened to remove Trump from the stand. On the financial statements at the heart of the case, Trump said I would look at them, I would see them and I would maybe on occasion, have some suggestions and on his role in preparing the statements. I accepted it. Other people did it, but I didn't say make it higher or make it lower, he said. When asked if he maintained accurate records from August 2014 going forward, Trump said I hope so. I didn't keep them myself. Trump was also questioned about the valuation of his assets, including his Trump Tower apartment which financial statements show a more than $200 million value drop in one year. I thought the apartment was high, he said. Adding, we changed it and saying different property assets were both high and low. Trump has long claimed his Florida Mar-a-Lago was undervalued saying today it is worth one to $1.5 billion.",

You saw his sons who testified earlier in this trial said that everything was pretty much done by the accountants, by the lawyers. So, they tried to pass everything off on those other professionals. Trump, on the other hand, as you stated, said that he did see financial records. At one point he said, everyone, me, him and his sons were responsible for ensuring that fraud wasn't committed or that the records weren't fraudulent. So, he didn't serve himself. Well, in the testimony that he gave today, even though you could tell that, you know, based on his ego, that he thought he was one upping the judge, but I think the prosecutors were very strategic and allowing him at points to just ramble because in his rambles, he did give testimony that was adverse to his case.",

So, there's already been a determination about liability. This phase of the trial is really about the size of a penalty that may be assessed against Trump and his organization.Two hundred and fifty million dollars is what the attorney general has estimated this fine should be. She's also on a mission to have Trump be prohibited from conducting and doing business in the state of New York to have his businesses unravel, to have his property sold. And I think attacking the judge, attacking the Attorney General, attacking the judicial system didn't do trump any good. This judge said he was going to make inferences negative to Trump because Trump refused to give answers to many of the questions posed by the Attorney General. So, I think it's a foregone conclusion that there's going to be a fine assessed against Trump that his properties have probably will be forced to be sold. You know, now, it's just a question of the record and whether Trump will have any kind of favor at the appellate level because we know given his playbook, he will appeal this to every possible higher court.",

Now to the Israel-Hamas war which marks one month today, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says that Israel will have overall security responsibility for Gaza for an indefinite period after the war ends. His comments came Monday during an interview with ABC News. He also once again stress that Israel won't allow a ceasefire until Hamas releases all the hostages. Meanwhile, the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah says that the death toll in Gaza has now surpassed 10,000. A top United Nations official is sounding the alarm about the rising death toll saying \"10,000 people in one month, this defies humanity.\" And for more, we want to go to journalist Eliott Gotkine who joins us live from London.

The war in Ukraine certainly on the agenda but unlikely to feature as prominently as it did last time given what's going on in Gaza, but I think the foreign minister certainly hope they're more unified response to that Russian invasion of Ukraine to serve as an inspiration or example of them coming together for a firm and unified approach to conflict.But so far, of course, we are seeing divisions actually emerge in between members with different concerns different, political loyalties and different economic priorities. The French, for example, voted for a U.N. Security Council Resolution calling for ceasefire, even though the U.S. vetoed it and other G7 members abstained. The host nation, Japan actually has been resisting pressure from its closest ally, the U.S. when it comes to more for long pro-Israeli public stance. Instead, Japan has adopted a \"balanced approach\" from the very beginning of the war in Gaza, because of its own diverse interests in the Middle East, especially its heavy reliance on oil imports from the region and the Gaza civilian casualties, only reinforcing that approach. So, it's going to be a tall order for all foreign ministers to agree on wording when it comes to Israel's right to defend itself, the civilian casualties in Gaza. Not to mention the concrete -- any concrete proposals of getting humanitarian aid into Gaza. But I think they were keenly aware that what they end up seeing or not seeing as being closely watched, not just by partners and allies, but especially by critics and detractors including Russia, but especially increasingly China, Beijing, Moscow and Moscow, both blaming the U.S. and its Western allies for being the root cause of the conflict in Gaza and portraying themselves as champions of the developing world as peacemakers and using that increasingly bloody conflict in Gaza as further justification of their desire and willingness to reshape a U.S.-led world order. So, I think the G7 foreign ministers understand the implications of their actions and words at the scattering because it really is going to have implications on the political relevance of their grouping, Rosemary?",
