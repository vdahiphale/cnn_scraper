He basically was down the first several days after the debate, despite the North Carolina rally, then went and spent the weekend at Camp David and only really started to really try to stop the bleeding both internally with his own staff, campaign and White House staff who were feeling very much neglected and felt like they weren't getting honest answers.And so it was a little bit of too little too late. I would not be surprised, I actually probably expect that when Congress comes back, you're going to see a lot more statements like we've seen, both calling him explicitly to drop out and also sort of equivocating and saying, well, it's his decision. But the problem with that is that Congress doesn't get a vote in this. And Joe Biden, the Joe Biden, we saw late last week is a Joe Biden that is very defiant. A president who has, you know, defied many of his doubters for decades and sort of sees this as key to his personal narrative. And you know, I think we see a president that's more dug in the last 72 hours than he was a week ago.",

And also another interesting thing, I think a lot of people think, well, Joe Biden is a man of Congress, a man of the Senate. You know, these relationships will -- these people will really matter to him. The thing you have to remember though is Joe Biden left the Senate in early 2009. He doesn't know most of the people. He knows a few, especially in the Senate. But the people that have long, long relationships with him, a lot of them are gone. And so it's unclear having some of these -- some of these congressmen call for him to drop out will matter. The other thing you -- and I think you alluded to this is that you see, in order to stop him from digging in further and you notice while the statements are always beforehand. They always talk about how great of a president he's been. He's amazing, historic as sort of this way of these are statements not meant to shame Joe Biden out of the race but to convince him.",

And in fact, I spoke to one Hill source today, Democratic lawmaker who said this person isn't hearing it either behind the scenes. It seems more like they're trying to sort of figure things out.

So I think there's going to be a lot of waiting and seeing. You're going to have to wait for more polling, you'll have to wait for how donors react to all this. Do they pull their money or at least just not give as much as they were going to do otherwise? And then I think the other thing is we're going to see more reporting. You know, I think a key question is, you know, was this the first time that Joe Biden acts this way behind closed doors and were there people that were engaged in seeing it but then thinking it wasn't as big of a deal. And I think, you know, the more reporting about how Joe Biden has been acting behind the scenes is the other thing that could convince more Democrats to eventually conclude that he isn't the best choice to go up against Donald Trump.",

He should know these answers in and out if his administration is the one sending the questions beforehand. But you're right, this is not common practice.

It was Wednesday and Thursday? And the fact that they still had it basically pre-scripted, I think is really striking. It raises more questions, not less about -- about that is -- you know, about his fitness and about his age. The second thing I've heard is, you know, internally this was -- they went through a process that was not normal. The White House's director of black media was not included in this process. The campaign has basically said this was a campaign interview. So the White House was not involved and that was why. But it was striking that this -- because I talked to some Democratic activists or Democratic strategists in the black community, and they felt that this was really patronizing. The fact that you would basically leverage the fact that this is a small local black radio and you're getting an interview with the president and basically say, well, if you're going to do it, then here are the questions we want you to ask.",

And then additionally, the strategy from the White House is to sort of script unscripted moments, right? This radio interviews are the exact example of that. We want to make it look like its unscripted, like he can handle things in real time. But we're handing him questions. You know, same thing when it comes to rallies and things like that or any kind of press conference, I'm going to be looking out for whether or not there are teleprompters, whether or not he is speaking (INAUDIBLE), whether or not they take spontaneous questions from reporters. Those are all things that the Biden administration has not been doing in terms of putting Joe Biden out there. Are they going to get comfortable now because they have to.

Asked about look, would you take a cognitive test? And he pressed him on that and President Biden said, well every day, I'm taking a cognitive test. The bottom line is he failed. You know, if that's a standard, he failed that test on debate night, right? I mean, I think that's a pretty universal view.

He was also involved in treating Joe Biden's son, Beau Biden when he had cancer. They are very, very close. He's also a bit of a character, is a bit of an eccentric person, which is why some people speculated that even during when Joe Biden had COVID, they did not let him out on out to address reporters. But now pressure is building, especially in light of the debate for people to hear from him. And you're already seeing profiles, you're seeing coverage, you're seeing people dissecting the visitor logs to see who he's been meeting with.

With respect to this case is the Supreme Court ruling. That Supreme Court ruling create certain laws in terms of the president being immune for official acts. And so it's important to give the parties their say. I think the attorneys have legitimate arguments they want to raise on behalf of Trump, and I think the prosecution and Jack Smith's team has legitimate arguments they would like to rebut.

I'll get into that at another time. As it relates to this specific case, I think the argument is going to be that the official acts were the president possessing the classified documents while in office, removing those classified documents after -- while still in office, he removed them and whether or not he legitimately declassified them while he was still president. And so with respect to this ruling of the Supreme Court where they created law, you can argue for a friend of theirs, a fellow conservative of their, wow. Notwithstanding that, and really the criticism you can make towards that, I think the Trump argument will be that while he was president in possession of these documents. That's the critical inquiry, not what happened after the fact. Now it's a fair argument and you could say, well, wait a minute, it was being charged because he was possessing them as the president. He shouldn't have had them in the first place. They were classified. They were brought to Mar-a-Lago. They weren't in the White House. Absolutely, that's true. But I think you're going to hear the core argument Pamela being that the issues relating to the classified documents, his having those classified documents and what he did with the classified documents were when he was officially president, and to the extent that it protects your official acts, this immunity, those arguments are going to be centered around that timeline, not the timeline to follow in Mar-a-Lago.",

And I think that when you look at broader in Israeli public opinion, a Channel 12 poll, Israeli channel 12, the biggest TV network in Israel, published a poll last night that showed that 67 percent of Israelis think that the return of the hostages should be the number-one priority for the Israeli government. And only 26 percent said that the destruction of Hamas needs to be the top priority. So I think it shows very well where the Israeli public is at this moment.",
