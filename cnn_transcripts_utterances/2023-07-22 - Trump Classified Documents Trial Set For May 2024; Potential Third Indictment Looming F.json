The Angels superstar giving up four home runs on the mound last night against the Pirates. Rookie Henry Davis hit two of them, becoming the first major league player ever to hit two homers in the same game off of Otani. Despite the struggles, though, he still picked up his eighth victory of the season in the Angels 8-5 win. And they know about bad weather in England, which is where we wrap up. Not too bad out there, but American Brian Harman taking an impressive five-stroke lead into the weekend at the British Open. Took control early with four straight birdies, ended the day with a six-under-65 time, the 36-hole record at Royal Liverpool held by Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy. Incredible day for the American as the weekend gets underway. (END VIDEO CLIP) MANNO (on camera): Just right about now, actually, coverage starting on the third round. And, Messi, what can you say?

And I've been shooting a show in Vancouver, British Columbia.And the goal is to always, when we go to work, when you're acting, you go where you go. How I ended up choosing Michigan is because of my career. I came here to do a set of films when there was a tax and media credit here in Michigan and fell in love with the people. And so, seven years ago, after I had my son and adopted my son, we got our house here. And when COVID hit, Canada had a 14-day quarantine. You couldn't travel in and out of the state or fly in and out. So, we had to base in the Pacific Northwest to shoot my show. But we are here full-time, and we've been here. We love this state. You know, Michigan's my home, and it's the greatest state in the country. And I want other folks to choose Michigan like I chose Michigan. When I bought my business here seven years ago, you know, I want other folks to bring and invest in this state and bring their entrepreneurship here. We're 49th in growth, so we have to do a better job getting people to move here, to come here. It's the most beautiful state, the topography. We have the 21 percent of the world's fresh water supply here. It's an incredibly resilient place, and so we want more folks to come here like I did.",

Heuermann is now behind bars, charged with the murder and the deaths of three of the Gilgo four. The four women whose remains were found on Long Island's Gilgo Beach back in 2010. Let's discuss all of this with Scott Bonn. He is a criminologist. He's also the author of, \"Why We Love Serial Killers, and the host of the podcast, The Killing Hour with Doc Bonn. Scott, appreciate your time this morning. Good morning to you. You know one of the most disturbing details about the case is that the suspect was living this double life. And you predicted back in 2011 that the killer would be someone who can walk into a room and seem like your average Joe. Elaborate, please. DR. SCOTT BONN, CRIMINOLOGIST, PODCAST HOST: Yes, absolutely. Yes, this type of serial killer is, in my mind, similar to a Ted Bundy or a John Wayne Gacy. And that they have seemingly normal lives with even a family, a successful business career respected by the community itself. And yet they've got this alter ego, if you will, that a transform into and become a diabolical, torturous killer. And, and it's through psychological compartmentalization, which is an ability almost like flipping a switch to just transform into almost like another being and this is what enables him and others like him to not suffer any emotional consequences, anxiety, guilt, cognitive dissonance, when they do so. They are -- it's almost like they just become another person.",

So, the fact that he would be so cool, calm, and collected, in custody, doesn't surprise me at all. In fact, what I think he's doing right now is getting his bearings, assessing his environment like a predator would do, determining the evidence against him. And he's going to make a calculated decision at some point whether to come clean, and stand up and take credit for what he believes is his life's great work and he truly believes that. Or, he could go another narcissistic route and try to milk this for the media attention for the long run the way Ted Bundy did.

To try and embrace the opportunities that A.I. presents while also trying to put safeguards around the challenges and the potential risks of this fast-moving technology.And these commitments that the seven leading A.I. companies have agreed to are the product of months of back and forth between the White House and these A.I. companies, as well as non-industry academic experts on A.I., including, ethicist and some A.I. critics, as well. The most significant of these commitments is a commitment by the seven leading A.I. companies to submit their unreleased new A.I. models to outside testing, red teaming, as it's called in this tech world, effectively, allowing outside experts to test and prod and conduct attempted cyber-attacks on these new A.I. systems before they are released to the public. The second most significant item here on this list of commitments is a commitment from these companies to begin clearly labeling A.I.- generated audio and visual content as A.I.-generated. One of the ways that they could do that is through watermarking, so that consumers can clearly see when content is A.I.-generated. Others on the list of commitments include investments in cybersecurity and insider threat safeguards, as well as prioritizing research into the societal risks of A.I. Now, the bottom line here is that these are indeed voluntary commitments, and they're written pretty broadly. And they are -- they can be open to interpretation. Skeptics, here will note that these tech companies really haven't lived up to a lot of other commitments that they've made in the past, and they haven't necessarily been the best at regulating themselves. So, there's some skepticism here about what these commitments will actually do. But I can tell you that I spoke with Bruce Reed, who's the president's deputy chief of staff, who has been managing this policy process. And one of the things he made clear is that this is only a first step, and he calls it a bridge to regulation and legislation. And so, that will indeed be the next step here is what does the Biden administration do from an executive action standpoint? The president, on Friday, making clear that there will be an executive order. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

In particular, China, over artificial intelligence.And the White House is also closely working with the Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who's working to develop a broad framework for A.I. regulation through bipartisan legislation. That though, will be months away, which is why these official say that these safeguards, in particular, the outside testing of these systems could be laying the groundwork for potential regulation. And that testing of those A.I. systems before they are released, could eventually be done by government regulators, or licensers. Jeremy Diamond, CNN, the White House.",
