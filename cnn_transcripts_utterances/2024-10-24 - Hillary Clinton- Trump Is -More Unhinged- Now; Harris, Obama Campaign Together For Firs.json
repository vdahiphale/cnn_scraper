Yes, really. And Barack Obama, tonight, warming up the crowd, as he laced into the former President. The nation's first Black president, campaigning for the first time, alongside the woman, who is now a coin flip away from making history of her own. And tonight, in Georgia, it's the Boss. Tomorrow, it is Beyonce. All hitting the trail with Vice President Harris deep in the heart of Texas. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. With 12 days to go, the first woman presidential nominee is here, with her take, on where this race stands, right now, and what we might expect between now and Election Day and beyond that. Hillary Clinton will join me live, in just moments. As it has been a very busy day and night for Trump and Harris, out on the campaign trail, both crisscrossing swing states, including in Georgia. That's where we saw former President Barack Obama, joining Vice President Harris, in their first appearance together, on the trail, out in suburban Atlanta. It was a star-studded evening, as you could see. It started with the Boss getting on stage as the opening act.

And it's not only people like former Chief of Staff, Marine General John Kelly, who is telling us this and warning us.It's people, who have really studied what fascism is and what fascist leadership looks like. People, like Professor Timothy Snyder. People, like former professor Paxton, who just recently came out and said that he had studied fascism during the war, particularly the Nazis, Vichy France, and he had been reluctant to use the term. But he had concluded, as so many people now are, that, sadly, here in America, the term fits. And one other thing that you'll see next week, Kaitlan, is Trump actually reenacting the Madison Square Garden rally in 1939. I write about this in my book. President Franklin Roosevelt was appalled that neo-Nazis, fascists, in America, were lining up to essentially pledge their support for the kind of government that they were seeing in Germany. So, I don't think we can ignore it. Now, it may be a leap for some people, and a lot of others may think, I don't want to go there, I don't want to say that. But please, open your eyes to the danger that this man poses to our country, because I think it is clear and present for anybody paying attention.",

You're looking back at the history of this country.But to hear such a significant statement, like that one, from -- you make a good point, not just people who've studied it, but from General Kelly, who worked very closely with Donald Trump. Obviously, General Milley did as well. But I think when you hear that, and then you look at it from a campaign perspective, there have been people, who have said for years that they do believe Donald Trump has fascist tendencies, or is a fascist, just outright himself. I think the question is, does it reach voters that Harris needs to reach right now. What do you -- how do you see that?",

I tried to sound the alarm about him, back in 2016. But it was really an uphill climb, because people could not literally imagine that he posed a danger, or that his character was so lacking, when it came to the responsibility of being President. So, I totally understand that. But now, there's just too much evidence about what he wants to do, what he is saying he wants to do. So, number one, I think that someone running for president, like Vice President Harris, really has a duty to sound the alarm. And secondly, I think that there are people, who are still paying attention. Maybe they're leaning one way or the other. And they hear John Kelly, or they hear General Milley, or they hear President Obama, or Vice President Harris. And it causes them to think really hard, Why would we take that risk? And so, I think that, sometimes in politics, you've got to do what is not only right, but important. And it is important to make a case, as well as we can, before this election, about what kind of man this is, and what kind of President he is promising to be.",

So, I think she's doing what she needs to do. And from my perspective, that's not only her job. It's the job of all of us, who are supporting her. It's obviously the job of the messaging, the advertising, everything that goes into the final sprint to the election. Because I think that the information is out there, for voters who are looking for it. You can go to her campaign webpage. You can read about what she wants to do, to lower the cost of housing, how she wants to take on people, who are exploiting pricing of necessary goods, whether it's groceries or anything else. She talks about how she has a plan for long-term care, one of the biggest expenses that many families face.",

But you're having a policy debate at that point.And I wonder, from your view, as someone who put out a lot of policy, in 2016, and talked a lot about policy, do you think that she faces a double standard, in the sense of people watched the town hall, last night. Voters say, Well, actually, I do want specifics on the economy or on immigration. Maybe she should have said they should have done something else differently sooner.

And I'm very happy that we can say that. But there still is a double standard.And I think there's also a double standard, because it still is very difficult to cover Donald Trump. You know, he is incoherent half the time. Then he'll come out with something that is about how dangerous migrants are, and that cuts through. And then, he goes back to talking about Hannibal Lecter or whatever is on his mind. And it's really hard to cover that. And so, I think there is almost a default in the press, where people go back and say, OK, well, at least Harris is trying to answer questions, and she is putting out real policy. So, let's go pile on her, and make sure we know exactly what she's talking about. Because there is no comparison. She has specific policies. Now, he tries to avoid owning Project 2025, which is very specific and very scary. And I think it's rare that the press really goes after him on that, and says, OK, look at what they want to do, get rid of the Weather Service, for heaven sakes. How are we going to know what we're doing every day? I mean, it's so bizarre. And yet, he's hardly ever held to account for it. And so, I do think there's a double standard. I think she understands that. She's been underestimated her entire political career. She gets up every day, she puts on those high heels, she goes out there, she makes her case. And I think that there's so much more energy, in her campaign, than on the other side. There is so much more enthusiasm. We see it not just in the rallies. But they got a great ground game. I'm getting incredible reporting, from the battleground states, about how effective that is. So, she knows there's a double standard. We all know, if you're paying attention. And she's just going to keep powering through it.",

And then, we certainly saw it, for what, 39 minutes, when he just froze on stage, and just kind of moved to music. So no, he's not the same person. Part of it is he seems to be totally obsessed by his grievances, his resentments, his getting even with people. And I think when you are living with that much bitterness, and that kind of mindset? You are not able to communicate effectively, because, literally, you are thinking, all the time, about who said something bad about you, who made kind of a comment that you disagreed with. You can't be president, and have that kind of mindset. So, I think that if people are paying attention, even if they voted for him before, once or even twice, they have to be honest enough to admit, he is not performing anywhere near how he was, which I think makes him even more dangerous and, frankly, more manipulable, by people around him. And let's be honest, his foreign adversaries of our country, who are watching what is a deteriorating performance with, I think, a certain amount of satisfaction. They're looking forward if he were to end up as President, to continue to flatter and manipulate him, into doing what they want him to do. You know, I--",

They like his belligerent attitude. They like his insulting. They may even occasionally believe some of his versions of alternative reality. Other people, I think, find him to be a strongman, and that's very attractive to certain voters. They may not even agree with what he's saying, but they think that he's strong, and they find that appealing. I can't psychoanalyze the electorate, for sure. But there are a lot of reasons why people would be for him that, to me, really don't add up. Because for anybody, who thinks that he would only go after somebody, unlike them, that he would only support laws and changes that would hurt somebody else? I don't think they understand, that with an authoritarian personality in power, there is no safe haven. There's always a chance, he's impulsive, he's emotional, I think he is unstable, that he will turn on anyone, any individual, any group, for any perceived disloyalty, or comment that he thinks is contrary to himself, or what he is pushing. So, I think people need to really think hard, because this is -- you know, one thing I know for sure. If you vote for Kamala Harris, you will have the opportunity to disagree with her. You will have the opportunity to vote against her, if she runs again. With Donald Trump, I'm not so sure about that. Because one of his want-to-be role models, is Orban in Hungary. And Orban did get elected and then proceeded to dismantle the institutions of democracy. So that's what people need to be worried about.",

This is what I'm talking about, Kaitlan. I mean, the Justice Department doesn't belong to him. The president should not be like Richard Nixon, or Donald Trump, ordering the Justice Department to pursue individual Americans for political purposes, or, in Trump's case, individual grievances. So, this just adds to my argument that whether it's me, or literally anybody else, he has no business saying that, he has no right to say that. He should be respecting the rule of law. And it's equally troubling that he has said he would fire Jack Smith. All those cases against him, which, based on, my assessment, as a recovering lawyer, are really filled with lots of very strong allegations, based on a lot of evidence, that he would get rid of all of that, so that he would be above the law. So, he can say whatever he wants to, about me, which he will. But that's not really my concern. My concern is what it shows about the kind of President he wants to be for everybody in the country.",

It's probably because you don't have to worry about the cost of food on the table. So, it may not. But I think that is a really significant point that we really haven't talked enough about.

He was unable to accept that loss, and he started to unravel. I know, some could argue that maybe he wasn't all there to begin with. But I believe though truly, that, in 2016, he was running on this vision to make America great again, and voters were taking a gamble on him, because he didn't have a record to run on. And then, in 2020, obviously, the American people rejected him. And then, now in 2024, he's hell bent on revenge and retribution. And so, I think it's really smart that Kamala has kind of shifted her messaging and her campaign to be Look, he has an enemy list, and I have a to-do list. She's focused on solutions. He's focused on petty arguments and getting revenge on people.

You see a significant significantly larger portion of the American public say that Kamala Harris is too liberal.
