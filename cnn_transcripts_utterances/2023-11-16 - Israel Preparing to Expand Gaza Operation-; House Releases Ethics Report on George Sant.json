In fact, in that same interview, I asked him whether he would still run for his seat even if he were expelled from the House. He said, absolutely, he would run. But George Santos, perhaps in the light of this damning evidence detailed by this bipartisan committee and facing the threat of expulsion, making clear right here that he is not going to run for reelection, which will be a sigh of relief for Republican leaders, who are eager to keep a seat that is now a Biden district, one that Democrats could most certainly pick up in the next election. Not going to be a candidate. We will see if he changes his mind again, but important note there, saying he will not run for reelection, even as he criticizes this report, saying it's a smear job, despite the allegations that have been pulled up by this bipartisan committee -- John.",

Because the chairman said that it would take some time, it would take probably up to next year if they would have to come to an expulsion resolution, given the bar that they would have to meet, if they were to make an explicit expulsion recommendation. Now, the fact that that is not in there could give some members some cover, saying that the committee has not made an official recommendation to expel, so perhaps we will not vote that way. Also, the sheer politics of this, John. If he were to step aside, this would narrow the House Republicans' already very, very tight majority if he were expelled from the House. And they would have a special election to fill it. Democrats could almost -- could have a very good chance of picking up that seat, tightening that already very, very tight majority. You have seen so many difficulties passing bills in that House Republican majority. So that could be a calculation as well, as Republican members and Democrats weigh George Santos' fate.",

So spare me all this victim talk he's still trotting out. This investigation released by the Ethics Committee is exhaustive. It is damning. It is brazen. He didn't just lie about everything to his district. He allegedly stole money from his donors and spent it on personal expenses to an absurd extent. So it raises the question, if this doesn't rise to that level, what does? At least a censure, but I think Republicans have been pushing for his expulsion, because he's such a blot, such an embarrassment. And it's a reminder that standards should be applied. Maybe they can't bring themselves to do it to Donald Trump, but George Santos seems like a pretty obvious case by comparison.",

And that makes -- it makes things even more untenable in terms of governing. But that's exactly the kind of cynical partisan gesture that shouldn't have an impact on this kind of a damning case. Very quickly, once the homework started to be done, people realized this guy has made up his life story about whole cloth.

Mark Twain once said there's no native American criminal class, except members of Congress. That's a slur on most members of Congress. It's -- and politics shouldn't be an honorable profession. But when you allow George Santos to parade around with everything we know and everything that's been divulged in this report, you give credence to that kind of cynicism and those sorts of suspicions. We should be holding folks to a higher standard inside Congress, not a lower one.

CNN has learned of reports the IDF has been dropping leaflets near the city of Khan Yunis in Southern Gaza, a city of about 250,000 people, making it the largest in Southern Gaza.They're warning people to head towards known shelters. Similar leaflets were dropped in the north just weeks ago, sending tens of thousands of people fleeing to the south. This comes just a couple of days after Israeli leaders declared the north is now under Israeli control right now. The IDF is still inside and around Gaza's largest hospital, Al Shifa, more than 36 hours after storming the complex they say was being used as a Hamas command base. IDF released this video showing the weapons they say they found inside of that hospital complex. CNN's Ed Lavandera is joining us now from Tel Aviv. What are you learning about the reports of these leaflets coming down? Because they had told people to evacuate to Southern Gaza. And now they're seeing these leaflets telling them to go to safety?",

You mentioned the city there of Khan Yunis, which sits about halfway where -- from Gaza City and the Rafah Crossing. And the leaflets, from what we understand, have been dropped just east of that city as it gets close to the border with Israel, so suggesting that there could be an incursion of Israeli soldiers through there at some point. But this is already going to make a difficult situation in Gaza much more difficult. The United Nations estimates that there are already about 1.5 million people who have been displaced by military operations inside of Gaza. And the U.N. also says there are about 800,000 people who are using its shelters, which far exceeds capacity. And the defense minister here in Israel says that ground operations will continue for months and they will fight Hamas in the north, in the south, wherever it takes. But, as you know, as you pointed out, Israel has been telling residents of Gaza to move south for weeks now. And this also happens as we are now well into day two of the raid on the Al Shifa Hospital there in Gaza City. Israeli military officials have released some video images of weaponry and other military equipment, what they describe as military equipment, inside an MRI office there. [11:20:08] Officials here in Israel say, as those operations continue, they will release more information and more details of what they describe as concrete evidence that Hamas has used this area as a command-and- control area for years. And that is why this is such a pivotal and important moment in this ground operation, as the -- as Israel has come under condemnation from many corners of the world for the way it's conducted military operations inside Gaza. Sara, this is a very significant moment, depending on what they find and what they publish to the world from inside that hospital.",

JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Kate, what it really describes is that the IDF has taken Gaza and will go after Hamas leadership in segments. They have got Gaza City now in a position where they feel, the IDF feels confident that they have protected themselves and can go after the infrastructure and the leadership in a very methodical and hopefully very precise way. They are now going to continue operations there, but they will expand their operations as they move to clear the rest of Gaza. So, the IDF is really declaring their intentions. They're saying, this is where we're going next. It's best if everybody can move to a safe haven, get out of the way. We are about to move in this direction, and we are going to continue operations to go after the leadership of Hamas. So it's very clear, they're saying, we're coming your way.",
