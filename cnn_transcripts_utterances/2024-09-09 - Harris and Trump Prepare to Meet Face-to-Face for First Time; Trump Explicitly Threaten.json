Let's get right to what America is talking about. 24 hours from now, Vice President Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will not only face off in Philadelphia for their very first and possibly only debate, but it will also be the first time that the two of them have ever met face to face. Tonight, Harris is preparing for Trump to make things very personal. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: He plays from this really old and tired playbook, right, where he -- there's no floor for him in terms of how low he will go. And we should be prepared for that. I think he's going to lie. And, you know, he has a playbook that he has used in the past. Be it, you know, his attacks on President Obama or Hillary Clinton. So, we should expect that some of that might come out. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I think his advisers are telling him not to do it. I think the guy cannot control himself. He's been doing it for 78 years, hard to think that he's going to stop for 78 minutes tomorrow.Kamala Harris needs to be unbothered. She needs to not let him get under her skin, not let him bait her. The people who have gone toe to toe and into the mud with Trump, people like Marco Rubio, where they were having a debate over the size of their hands and all this stuff, it's never ended well. But what she cannot do is let him bully her. She's got to be presidential, she's got to stand her ground. You know what she's got to do? She's got to fact-check him.

He can't talk about the economy because we lost 2.7 million jobs when Donald Trump was president and we gained 15.6 million jobs with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.

This is happening right now in Venezuela, where Maduro has put more than 2,000 opponents in jail, where this weekend, the opposition leader who won the legitimate election that Maduro will not accept the results had to flee to Spain. And so I take this really seriously, and it's really upsetting to me, and it's something that we cannot take democracy for granted. We can't just take when the leading candidate, Republican candidate, possibly president, and former President, is issuing those threats. To me, they ring like threats.

They are saying and or implying, if you elect Vice President Kamala Harris, her immigration policies will put your pets at risk. But to be clear, this allegation against these immigrants is patently false, a far-right fever dream which could easily prey upon racist and xenophobic fears. According to Springfield city officials, there is no foundation for any of this. In a statement they said, \"We wish to clarify that there have been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured, or abused by individuals within the immigrant community. Additionally, there have been no verified instances of immigrants engaging in illegal activities such as squatting or littering in front of residents' homes. Furthermore, no reports have been made regarding members of the immigrant community deliberately disrupting traffic.\" Yet, when CNN asked Vance's office why he is pushing such a blatant lie, they said, \"Senator Vance has received a high volume of calls and emails over the past several weeks from concerned citizens in Springfield. His tweet is based on what he is hearing from them.\" But again, there is no truth to what he is hearing. And that is easy to check. Abby?",

It's usually a place that celebrates the community, some place that's hometown muffin shop or a pizza place. Well, Kamala Harris chose to go to a place that's not only -- it's -- the owners posted anti-Semitic remarks on Twitter, but it's a place that, you know, they've had a huge amount of controversy regarding race. The owner had a -- all Republicans are racists to blast it out to his customers. And if you're Kamala Harris, you know, she said while she's standing in the store, you know, we have to end this, the this and this in the country. We have to end this. So, why do you choose that store to go to if you're going to end the business? A store that divides people in the city of Pittsburgh, you Google it. You could figure out that's not the place to go. Why did she go there?",

She's obviously a black woman artist.And unfortunately, the Country Music Awards, the CMAs, don't seem to respect black women that way, in part because if you look back at the history just last year, it was the first time a black woman ever won anything. That was Tracy Chapman for a song that she wrote 35 years ago that just won a reward because a white man, Luke Combs, made a cover of it. So, I think it's a reflection of how black people who are responsible for creating country music and brought the banjo to the United States from Africa have our history ignored.",
