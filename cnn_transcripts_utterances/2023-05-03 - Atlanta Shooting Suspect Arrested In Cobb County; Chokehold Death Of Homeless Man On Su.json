      "sentences": "Hey, Abby, great to see you, thank you so much. Good evening everyone, I'm Alisyn Camerota. Welcome to CNN TONIGHT.Two violent episodes, in two different cities to update you on, a suspect is in custody in Atlanta tonight after a day-long manhunt. Police say, he became enraged and opened fire in a medical facility earlier today. One person was killed, four others critically injured. And in New York City, a reportedly homeless man who was acting, quote, erratically on the subway was put into a chokehold by another rider. The homeless man lost consciousness and died. The passenger who restrained him was questioned then released by police with no charges. Our panel has strong thoughts on what happened there. Plus, the culture wars collide with the High School Musical. School districts are pulling the plug on some well-known plays. We'll tell you why the Addams Family is getting canceled. And speaking of school, could you pass an eighth grade history test? It's harder than you'd think. I tried it earlier. Tonight, we'll see how much you and I and our panelists know. Okay, but let's begin with updates on two violent crime stories. The man who opened fire in an Atlanta medical facility today killing one person and wounding four others is under arrest tonight. He was captured after many hours of a manhunt. And then there's what happened on a New York City subway on Monday. We warn you, this video is disturbing to watch. A 30-year-old man named Jordan Neely, who a witness say was acting, quote, erratic and hostile was put into a chokehold by a 24-year-old passenger and he later died. CNN has not independently confirmed what happened leading up to that incident. We do not know how long Jordan Neely was restrained or whether or not he was armed, but the medical examiner now rules his death a homicide. A source tells CNN that Neely was homeless. Protesters took to the subway tonight chanting Black Lives Matter and the homeless matter. Okay, here to talk about all of this, we have Van Lathan, Host of the Higher Learning Podcast on the Ringer. Mike DuHaime former Political Director of the RNC, Franklin Leonard, Founder and CEO of the Black List, and Alyssa Farah Griffin, former Trump White House Communication Director. Great to have all of you here tonight. So, Franklin, how do you see what happened on the subway?",

Although one did hold his hands down so that he couldn't resist. There was no attempt ostensibly to talk to the man, to offer him assistance.

He snuck up behind him, choked him out and the man died. These are sort of incontrovertible facts at this point. So -- and there's no evidence that's been presented that he had a weapon.

If you lived in a major city, you're going to be confronted with homelessness and confronted with people with issues, and it's not justifiable, it's not okay.And I do think the culture of this, whether it's stand your ground or whatever it might be, that makes people feel they can have license to do this is wrong.

You're talking about someone who doesn't have a home, someone who is going through a mental health crisis, and just be real, someone who is black. So, when you look at all those three things, if that person is perceived as a threat, there seems to be, at this particular time in our history, this knee jerk to kill or to dominate or to eliminate. And as we're talking sort of in this grand, amorphous scheme of where that's coming from, at some point, there's going to have to be somebody with the courage to name that. There is a specific side of the American political discussion that's telling you the criminals are coming to kill you, that's telling you the undocumented people are coming to kill you, that's telling you that the image of a black man, the image of somebody unwell is what you need to fear when you walk out into society at-large. So, I mean, I saw another video of a white man choking out a black shoplifter at T.J. Maxx. Like when did all of these people become Batman? Like the reality of the situation is there's something inside of them that makes them think they have to take their country back. And they didn't conjure that information by themselves. They're being told it's us or them. And if somebody doesn't come to stem the tide of some of the political animus and some of the cultural animus that we're seeing, this will get worse.",

But I actually would argue that it's not just the political right in this country, though they have certainly been engaged in a long political project to do just that. But, you know, if you look at sort of the way in which Hollywood and the way in which the media generally has characterized black people in America going back to the birth of the film industry, with The Birth of a Nation, this has been a common theme. And the consequence of that is the perception of black men as violent, the perception of black men as dangerous, and that's how you end up with Trayvon and a kid getting shot for going to the wrong door and a young man saying I don't have food and water, I'd rather die, I'd rather be in prison, and someone choking him to death over multiple minutes.",

If your local news is showing something that this happened, you're going to think that there was a threat.So, I've lived in New York not very long, but I've seen muggings, I've had similar encounters. So, you have that sense of am I at risk. But, again, there is a responsibility that comes with the individual. If you face something, what is your duty to do? What is taking it too far? How can you deescalate something? And time over time again, you see that it goes to the furthest extreme. And I just want to note, this -- mark my words, unfortunately, I hope I'm wrong, this is going to become a split screen America moment, where people on one side are going to see this blatant -- what I see as a killing of a man on a subway in one way and half of the country is going to see it as totally justified and different. And it reminds me of something like Kyle Rittenhouse, for example, where the country basically divided to one side or the other. I hope that we can come to a place where we can see perhaps this behavior was wrong or it was threatening, or it was scary to people, but that is so disproportionate to what he was doing and it was so wrong.",

The day after the January 6th insurrection, Carlson wrote a text to his producer, describing a video of a mob of Trump supporters beating up someone he called, quote, an Antifa kid. Carlson says he found himself rooting for the mob to kill the kid.The New York Times reports that the text alarmed Fox's board of directors and played a role in his abrupt firing last week. I'm back with our panel. Guys, I feel I should read the whole thing just in case somebody hasn't heard it, because it really is a journey. So, here it goes. Tucker Carlson sent this on January 7th, 2021 to his producer and this came out in the Dominion lawsuit. It says, a couple of weeks ago, I was watching video of people fighting on the street in Washington. A group of Trump guys surrounded an Antifa kid and started pounding the living shit out of him. It was three against one, at least. Jumping a guy like that is dishonorable, obviously. It's not how white men fight. Yet, suddenly, I found myself rooting for the mob against the man, hoping they'd hit him harder, kill him. I really wanted them to hurt the kid. I could taste it. Then somewhere deep in my brain, an alarm went off. This isn't good for me. I'm becoming something I don't want to be. The Antifa creep is a human being. Much as I despise what he says is and does, much as I'm sure I'd hate him personally if I knew him, I shouldn't gloat over his suffering. I should be bothered by it. I should remember that somewhere, somebody probably loves this kid and would be crushed if he was killed.

And I think when somebody tells you who they are over and over again for decades, maybe believe them. I mean, this is someone who described Iraq as semi-literate primitives. And there are countless other things that he said that are sort of analogues that that you can Google and find out yourself. This is who he is.And I think going back to our conversation in the previous segment, that's not how white men fight. Well, the guy who just killed Jordan Neely snuck up behind him and choked him out, worse than a sucker punch. I don't think that when we're talking about how white men fight and how other groups pf people fight, we already know who you are.
