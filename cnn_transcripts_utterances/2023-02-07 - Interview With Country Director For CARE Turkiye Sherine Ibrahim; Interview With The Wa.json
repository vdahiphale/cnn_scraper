And it makes it very difficult for the president who wants to talk about his agenda, talk about the economic agenda, talk about the fact that we have millions of additional jobs since he was sworn into office.

I mean, we've seen inflation slow but prices are still high though. People are still paying quite a lot of money at the pump and at the grocery store. And, you know, for your average everyday American, they are struggling to make ends meet even though the economy and the labor market seemed to be pretty tight, and people seem to be working, and unemployment is at, you know, the lowest level we have seen in almost 50 years. And so, it is a bit of a disconnect for people looking at those numbers who would think, if you have such low unemployment, you have people working, that people would feel good. But generally, we are seeing people who are really uncertain about where the economy is going to go. Worried about how they're going to make ends meet, and still dealing with inflation that has been with us for such a long time.

So even though he doesn't have a very enthusiastic, energetic base of support of people who are just saying give us Joe Biden or bust, he does have the support of the leaders of his party who say that he's done, you know, a pretty good job over the first two years, that's he's passed a lot of legislation, and that there is no one else in the party who had beaten Donald Trump before and has what it takes to potentially beat him again. So, he's planning to run. We expect an announcement here in the next several weeks. He doesn't feel any pressure because there aren't any other Democrats challenging him for that position. But this poll shows that he doesn't have that level of enthusiasm that you would expect from an incumbent president with a record like his in part because of his age, in part because people are not really pushed in terms of their support for him. You know, there are a lot of people who are tepid supporters of Joe Biden or at least willing to vote against the other side, as opposed to voting for President Biden.

And so, he's not looking to get much done in terms of passing bills through Congress. There are a couple of things they have to do. They have to raise the debt ceiling. They have to make sure the government remains funded and just, sort of, doing those basic functions of government are going to be enough of a battle for Biden that it's not likely that he can -- he's going to be able to get much more of his agenda passed. So, the next couple of years will be really focused on implementing the agenda that he's already passed and trying to get the American people to see the impact of the things that he's done over the first two years in office.

There's a large percentage of Republicans who say that the United States is doing too much. And you even have some Democrats who are saying that the United States is doing too little. So, the unity that we saw around this issue just a year ago has largely disappeared and that's going to make it much harder for the president, especially as he is operating in a divided government, to bring all the parties together and make sure that the United States is presenting a united front when it comes to the war in Ukraine.

And so, that's one of the reasons you are seeing the president trying to use his executive authority, his authority as the president to try and work with some of these foreign allies in Central America and elsewhere to try to stem the flow of irregular migration across the southern border. He's put in a number of different policies. He tried to stem the flow of migrants coming across, but it's been very difficult for the White House. It's an area where Republicans are seizing on this issue. They're going to be holding a number of different hearings and calling -- the president calling the White House to account, and really trying to seize the momentum on this issue to say to voters that Biden has not protected the southern border. Biden has not been a strong president when it comes to defending America's borders. Making sure that immigration is normalized. And so, that is a vulnerability that he has. And that's why he went to the border last month. That's why he's tried to spend some time talking about this issue and implementing new policies. But it doesn't appear that he's going to be able to get what he wants, which is legislation to not only legalized people who have been here for a long time, but also to put in new measures to make sure that the southern border is secure and the southern border is more -- is operating at a more normal way. And so, until we get to that place, it seems like Biden is going to only have to be able to use his executive authority, and that really ties his hands and it makes it much more difficult to achieve the goal of it. Not only the Democrats have but a number of independents have as well which is to make sure that we are a humane system.

Senator Hickenlooper, welcome to the program. And of course, you were the governor of Colorado. Before I get into the river crisis, I just want to follow up on our previous discussion about President Biden's challenge in his State of the Union before a divided Congress. He apparently is suffering from an enthusiasm gap, as people have been saying, and he wants to set himself apart. He wants to, apparently, set himself up for re- election. What does he need to do? SEN. JOHN HICKENLOOPER (D-CO):  Well, I think he's done it. I think what he really needs to do is find new ways of talking about it and make sure he gets not just senators and congresspeople, but governors, people all over the country, talking about how, in the last two years, we came through the worst pandemic in 100 years. And we're able to not only restart the economy, we are seeing record numbers for unemployment, for job creation.
