But some of what's being discussed in this room is warped. Questioning things like the COVID pandemic and whether climate change is even real.SHUKLA (voice-over): As the meeting concludes, many leave content with what they've heard. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): The AFD is finally standing up for the citizens and is slowly doing what we want. And what we want is to be part of the government. SHUKLA (voice-over): Omid Nouripour is part of that government. And he acknowledges that public image is partly to blame for their ailing poll numbers. OMID NOURIPOUR, HEAD OF GERMANY'S GREEN PARTY: No doubt that we have to improve a lot of things, especially the performance of our coalition, or giving the impression that we just shout at each other. We are not. But the feeling is there, and we have to improve that. SHUKLA (voice-over): Following an explosive investigation from the news outlet Correctiv, AFD lawmaker, Dr. Hans-Christoph Berndt hailed the so-called remigration plan discussed as a promise. At this hotel, far-right leaders suggested mass deportations, including for German citizens of foreign origin. HANS-CHRISTOPH BERNDT, HEAD OF ALTERNATIVE FOR GERMANY, BRANDENBERG (through translator): It is not only legitimate, it is necessary to think about remigration. Since 2015, more than 10 million foreigners have entered the country, and a large proportion of them are not willing to integrate and live in German society but are instead building parallel worlds. The federal government is not putting the interests of the indigenous population first. SHUKLA (voice-over): In the real world, the report sparked waves of anti-AFD protests. Berndt's response is to shout conspiracy. BERNDT (through translator): Yes, without the government campaign, people wouldn't be out in the street. I am very positive.

Officials are reporting strikes in the capital Kyiv and areas as far apart as Lviv in the West and Kharkiv of in the Northeast. One person was reportedly killed in the Mykolaiv region and several have been injured across the country. Meantime, the European Union foreign policy chief is visiting Kyiv to discuss the blocs military and financial aid for Ukraine. Joseh Borrell says the sudden strikes highlight the daily reality of the brave Ukrainian people who have been enduring nearly two full years this war. Just into CNN, nearly two dozen people have been killed and several others injured in two separate blasts in Pakistan's Balochistan District. Officials say the first explosion took place at an independent candidate's office killing at least 12 people. They say the second explosion occurred at an election office. Violence has escalated across Pakistan ahead of Thursday's general election and many local candidates have been shot or killed so far. But people in Pakistan are not just facing frequent terror attacks and economic uncertainty as they head to the polls. With the country's former prime minister and popular leader Imran Khan still in prison and barred from contesting, they're left with a difficult choice on who to vote for. CNN's Anna Coren has more details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The aftermath of an explosion in southern Pakistan. Just one of a string of attacks targeting political candidates across the country. So, as the nation of more than 230 million people prepares to go to the polls, there's an air of unease. Pakistan's widely popular former prime minister Imran Khan is behind bars, charged with corruption and revealing state secrets, and is banned from running in the election. He denies any wrongdoing. After Khan was arrested by paramilitary police in May last year, his supporters took to the streets, some of them armed. What followed was an extensive crackdown by what many say was led by the country's powerful military, a claim it denied. Protesters were detained, journalists censored. [04:40:00] Among those jailed social media activists Sanam Javed, a supporter of Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf or PTI Party. The 36-year-old mother of two is facing terrorism charges, accused of inciting her thousands of followers to commit arson on the day Khan was arrested. She denies the charges. Her father says her incarceration is an example of authorities silencing dissenting voices. IQBAL JAVED, FATHER OF SANAM JAVED (through translator): I know that all of this is fake and created and being done to victimize the political party of Imran Khan. This is a political case. COREN (voice-over): Pakistan's information minister denied those claims, saying law enforcers and prosecutors had evidence against Javed. With the fall of Imran Khan has come the return and rise in popularity of his predecessor, Nawaz Sharif. Sharif is back in Pakistan after corruption charges led to years of self-imposed exile. He's now widely expected to win a historic fourth term. TIM WILLASEY-WILSEY, POLITICAL ANALYST: The good prognosis is that if Sharif is elected, he builds a coalition which includes Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and starts to run the country pragmatically. He's a pragmatist. And starts to, you know, balance relations between U.S. and China, get the economy back on track. COREN (voice-over): Standing between Sharif and the top job is Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the 35-year-old is descended from one of Pakistan's political dynasties. Yet even with Zardari's youthful appeal, many young voters have been left disillusion by Pakistan's recent political disorder. RAJA IKRAM, ISLAMABAD RESIDENT (through translator): The whole country knows that the decision has already been made. RABIYA AROOJ, LAHORE RESIDENT (through translator): I don't think stability will come because I think after the elections, a lot of problems will be created.",

Just last month, Pakistan and Iran carried out strikes against alleged militant targets in each other's territory citing the threat of terrorist attacks. For Pakistan and its people, unified government after years of uncertainty, will be a must to avoid tensions spilling beyond the country's borders. Anna Coren, CNN, Hong Kong. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

We've been here since 2 p.m. Local time, four hours before her concert began and thousands of people were coming through and their different colorful themed costumes representing each different era in Taylor Swift's discography.Of course, also there's the friendship bracelets that Swifties exchange. I actually got a few myself. Very kind for Swifties to do. And of course, there's the dancing, the singing, the cheering. I don't know if you can hear a little bit, but Taylor Swift concert is happening right now and some singing can be maybe heard a little bit. So again, just so much excitement, you know, she is a very famous person in the United States, but her fame transcends international borders. All the way on the other side of the world, people are so excited to see Taylor Swift. Her concert is completely sold out all four nights. Organizers have said those tickets sold out within the first 30 minutes that they went on sale. And now she's also the first foreign female artist in Tokyo Dome to play for four consecutive nights. I mean that is just how in demand she is. That's how much people want to see her. Now, we have to remember adding to this hype is the fact that the last time Taylor Swift performed in Tokyo was back in 2018 for her Reputation Tour. So, fans are Swift deprived. They want to see Taylor Swift. They are eager to see this international superstar on that stage. We actually spoke to a super fan just earlier who's taken fandom to the next level.
