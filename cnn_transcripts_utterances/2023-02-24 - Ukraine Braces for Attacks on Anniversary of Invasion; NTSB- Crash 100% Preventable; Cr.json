Because Pence is arguing that he should be protected from this subpoena, under the Constitution's Speech or Debate Clause. Now, that clause is supposed to protect legislators from any sort of law enforcement activity that covers their actual work in Congress. Pence argues that, as president of the Senate, he should qualify. But this judge, in the op-ed, he's very clear about how he feels. He says, look, \"Jack Smith's subpoena was neither politically motivated nor designed to strengthen President Biden's political hand in 2024. Thus, the jarring dissidence between the subpoena and Mr. Pence's characterization of it. It is Mr. Pence who has chosen to politicize the subpoena, not the DOJ.\" But, I will also point out that \"The Wall Street Journal\" editorial board recently came out and had a completely different take. They argued that, because of what Pence did on January 6th, he should be given the benefit of the doubt.
