It is just after 10:00 p.m. here, and it has been 24 days since the horrific terrorist attacks by Hamas caught this country, and frankly much of the world, by surprise. We start tonight with breaking news. Israel says it is behind an enormous explosion at a refugee camp on the Gaza Strip. This was the aftermath of the blast at the Jabalia Camp, which the United Nations says is the largest refugee camp in Gaza. Israel's military says it killed a top Hamas commander in its airstrike. A man they say who was one of the leaders of the October 7th attack, and was hiding amongst civilians inside the refugee camp. Israel also claims to have killed around 50 Hamas terrorists in that strike. It is not clear how many people were killed, or injured, but the director of a hospital in the Hamas-controlled area says he has seen hundreds of dead bodies and wounded patients. He describes it as a, quote, scene no one can imagine. CNN's Wolf Blitzer pressed a spokesman for the IDF on why is real would carry out a strike with so many civilians in the area.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken stressing the importance of funding for both Israel and Ukraine's war efforts, saying that failing to do so would embolden America's enemies.

And then he was also responsible for Hamas forces in northern Gaza, as Israel continues with its ground incursion.

And the ground forces are calling it a target, and we know because we're standing here and we witness and hear the explosions all through the night and all through the day. That there are some bunker bustling munitions being dropped in Gaza, to target these tunnel networks. So, it fits it precisely.I am hearing heavy machine gun fire over my shoulder here, which is the direction of the Jabalia refugee, and Gaza City. But until last night, I was hearing that gunfire over this shoulder, which tells me that troops are actually advancing. But we don't know precisely how far they are getting, and we don't know what it looks like on the ground. Is it phalanxes of tanks and armored fighting vehicles? Is it troops moving house to house? We don't -- we just don't know. But we do know when they find big groups of Hamas, they're calling it airstrikes, despite the fact that there's a very high civilian presence there.",

They've also been attempting to breakthrough the concrete barrier that extends most of the length of the border, and Israel firing back, howitzers, tanks, air strikes going after Hezbollah infrastructure. They say they've killed close to 50 Hezbollah fighters in the last several days since October 7th, and as a result of that, what we've seen as well is that a lot of those towns right along the border, all of them along the border have been mandatory, under mandatory evacuations. And many others that aren't quite close, they've emptied out anyway because families don't feel safe. And I understand it. We drive there, we look into the hills, we see another explosion.

There's a lot of talk about the Iron Dome, that primarily for rockets coming across from Gaza and the north and southern Lebanon here. Arrow is for higher altitude threats, surface to surface missiles like this one that was fired today. In fact, the IDF says it was the first time today that the arrow missile defense system has been engaged since October 7th. So the first time one of those missiles coming from the Houthi-backed rebels in Yemen made it this close to Israel. And the worry, Jake, is that Yemen has a lot of missiles, Hezbollah has many thousands of missiles. The worry is that those Iran-backed proxies will use the same strategy that Hamas used, which was to try to overwhelm those missile defenses, and many missiles at once, in which case some undoubtedly would get through.

Violence by right wing extremists, Israeli settlers, against Palestinian civilians in the West Bank, and we saw it again today, and decide fact is that many of those settlers feel like they have the backing of elements of the Israeli government, some of the right-wing members of Benjamin Netanyahu's government.

Why would you kill him? He tells us that Kfar Aza was like a destroyed cemetery. Dead, injured, blood everywhere in the houses, in the yards, on the street. You can't understand what I saw there, he says. It's impossible to understand. He remembers a family that had been driving a car, and were until terrorists killed them. The children were charred, just charred, he says. What could a child due to an adult he asks? He was a baby, strapped into his car seat inside the car. He guessed that the terrorist took a firearm, shot and killed the members of the family, and then with a knife, cut their throats. David response like this to skeptics. It's a shame that those people didn't come there to see what happened on that Black Saturday. Get it out of my stomach, out of my head, everything that happened. Why do we deserve this? Dozens dead, the smell. Even now, it's still with me. I want the entire world to know, the entire world to know what Hamas did, he says.

There have been airstrikes in the south over the last few days, so it's been exceptionally tough on our teams, as they grieve the lost colleagues. But what is really remarkable is the UNRWA staff are really the heroes of Gaza at the present time. Many of them have displaced themselves. In fact, I'd say the majority of this of the several thousand staff that are working, currently are living in internally displaced centers. They're coming from those centers, working exceptionally long hours. And what's really tough is that they know what they need to do for the community, in terms of food, water, and other essential supplies. But they just don't have them in their hands. I met with a large group of our staff in a training center yesterday, and I continue to be overwhelmed by their sense of can do attitude, despite the difficulties and the circumstances.
