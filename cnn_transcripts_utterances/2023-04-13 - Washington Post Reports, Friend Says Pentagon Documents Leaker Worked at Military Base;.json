One of his online friends says that the alleged leaker indicated that he brought the documents home from his job on a military base. The user claimed that he worked inside a secure facility that prohibited cell phones and other electronic devices that could be used to steal the secret information.

And what they have done is they have started to comb through the distribution lists of these highly classified documents that are distributed across the entire government daily, and they have begun to whittle down those lists.And we are told that people across the government at different agencies, State Department, you know, even within the Pentagon, who were receiving this daily highly classified intelligence briefing that is put together by the Pentagon's joint staff, are now not receiving it anymore. So, clearly, they have begun to put a lid on who is able to receive these documents. And we should note that the Pentagon previously distributed these documents widely across the government to potentially thousands of people, and all of those people did have proper clearance to view these documents. It's not as though the individuals who are receiving it did not have the right security clearance. But not all of those people had a need to know when it came to these documents. And so the Pentagon now is trying to figure out who actually needs to see these highly classified documents that are prepared for senior Pentagon officials on a daily basis and who doesn't.

The drug stays on the market for now. However, what this court did is it did block some more recent changes that the FDA had put in place to make it easier to obtain the drug. And those changes, they said, it could be distributed by mail, it could be dispensed later in pregnancy. So, the appeals court did move there to block that. It's interesting to see this appeals court that had two Trump nominees on it is still expressing some skepticism about the safety of the drug.

But, again, the Biden administration was always thinking how unprecedented this lawsuit has been, because, as you said, this particular abortion medication drug had been on the books for some 20 years, and millions of women really use it.

This flooding is turning streets into rivers, stalling cars breaching buildings, it has even shut down Fort Lauderdale's airport. It leaves a lot of travelers stranded.Our Carlos Suarez joins us live in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, with more. I mean, you are in the street turned river, right? CARLOS SUAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, that's exactly right, Poppy, good morning. So, if these are flooding, numbers hold, if all of this rainfall total numbers hold, we're talking about two feet of rain that fell across parts of Fort Lauderdale yesterday. Those kind of numbers are we what we might usually see with a hurricane where in a neighborhood just north of Fort Lauderdale Hollywood International Airport, whereas you can see behind me, the story right now is all of this flooding. Cars here are making -- the drivers out here at least are making the difficult decision of whether or not they want to go ahead and try to get through all of this water. What's happening out here in Fort Lauderdale and some of these neighborhoods is drivers are deciding to go against traffic because they will hit a pocket of water where they don't know if it's deep enough and their cars are going to get stuck. And so this is what's happening for a good part of Broward County. To give you a sense of just kind of traffic that all of this is causing, we are just a few minutes off of Interstate I-95, which is a pretty busy interstate that connects north and south. You can see the line of cars out here, the drivers unsure of exactly how long it's going to take them to go where they need to be. The situation, the flooding here in Broward is bad enough that Broward County schools decided to cancel classes for the day. And all of this is playing out just a few minutes north of Fort Lauderdale Hollywood International Airport, where things there remain closed at this hour. It appears the airport might open at the earliest around noon. But already, we're looking at about 300 flights have been canceled or delayed because of all of this flooding that is going on across a good part of Broward and Miami-Dade County. It's a little bit loud out here because you've got some trucks moving by us, but I can tell you one of the big problems that happened here yesterday is that this rain really just sat on top of a good part of Broward County for most of the day. And so we just saw hour after hour all of this rain falling across a good part of Fort Lauderdale. And as you said, coming back out here if these numbers hold, we're talking about a rainfall event that we have not seen in a very long time.

Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis admonishing Fox attorney saying, and I quote here, I am very concerned that there have been misrepresentations to the court. This is very serious. So, Fox News is being sued for allegedly promoting false claims about Dominion machines rigging the 2020 presidential election. Fox denies that it ever defamed Dominion and says that it properly disclosed Rupert Murdoch's role and its public financial filings.So, joining us now, Attorney Ken Turkel, he has represented multiple high-profile figures, like Sarah Palin and Hulk Hogan in defamation cases. So, it's interesting that we have him and we're so glad that you're with us this morning. Thank you, sir. So, a judge sanctioning Fox News, appointing a special master to investigate, what is behind this? I mean, this is really significant legally. KEN TURKEL, ATTORNEY WHO'S REPRESENTED HIGH-PROFILE FIGURES IN DEFAMATION CASES:  Don, I think one of the most significant things is when it's happening. It's not uncommon in cases to have battles over discovery, what was, what wasn't produced. But to have evidence of this substance showing up in the discovery fight on the eve of trial, I've never experienced in 33 years.",

But you have the Grossberg recordings, the Murdoch testimony on the eve of a trial that has been this hotly contested, there's been so much back and forth, that, to me, is just -- it's uncommon. The discovery fighting, not so much. You're getting those in every case. But this kind of evidence, when they're about to pick a jury and their sanctions now in a master, it is fascinating to me, okay? I don't know how it plays out because (INAUDIBLE) does his investigation. So --",

Can I just ask you because yesterday, we had Sara Fischer on one of our journalist colleagues, who said she is a little bit worried about what this suit could mean for journalism because of the malice standard here? Can you just speak to your view on that at large?",

      "sentences": "Yes. I mean, you know, the Palin case was malice case. And, you know, I default to something that I think is the panel discussion that hasn't been had yet, and that is in an internet age, right, when everyone has the same access to media by tagging media outlets, and you have a computer and you put out whatever salacious content and then tag everybody, you've really gotten to the core of what started the public figure exception, the political figure exception and actual malice.Information is traveling. We just didn't anticipate it's being consumed in disseminated in a way that people and newscasters are on the news telling their stories, and at the same time, the stories are changing real-time all over the internet. So, look, I think we need to take a hard look at that component of this anyway. Beyond that, though, you know, in this case, I don't know how much it's going to be tested because there's an overwhelming amount of documentary evidence that memorialized the state of mind, and you don't really have that most of the time. It's emails, texts, et cetera.",

I'm just -- and that's another thing because we were talking about journalists. I don't want to get bogged down. I want to talk about Rupert Murdoch taking the witness stand. What do you think that's going to do for the case?",
