Texas governor, Greg Abbott, is now pushing back at the threat of a Justice Department lawsuit vowing that he is ready for a major legal showdown over these floating barriers in the Rio Grande. He'd finally missed this afternoon's deadline to commit to removing the 1,000-foot barrier.In a recent letter to Abbott, the DOJ claims the barrier violates federal law, raises humanitarian concerns, also presents serious risks to public safety and the environment. CNN's Rosa Flores, she's right by the river there in Eagle Pass, Texas. Describe to folks who are seeing this or just hearing about this from afar what it actually looks like and I think frankly what it's accomplishing.",

      "sentences": "Well, it's accomplishing nothing. Let me show you because this is what defiance on the border looks like. This potential legal battle is over the buoys that you see here in the middle of the Rio Grande.Now, these buoys were deployed by the state of Texas and according to the State Department, without consulting with the federal government, without getting permits. Now, this is an international boundary, the Rio Grande, and there are treaties that govern the flow of this water, the flow of this waterway, and these treaties are between the U.S. and Mexico. Mexico's top diplomat complained to Washington about the deployment of these buoys, saying that they violate two treaties. And Mexico is even concerned that these buoys could be on Mexican territory. Mexico's sending a team to this area to try to verify that they're indeed in U.S. soil and not Mexican soil. But of course, the latest is that the U.S. DOJ gave the state of Texas a deadline of today at 2 p.m. Eastern and the state of Texas responded by digging in its heels and saying, Mr. President, Texas is going to see you in court. Now, the White House has responded saying that the actions by the state of Texas and the letter specifically from the U.S. DOJ references the floating barriers and related structures. So could that be this concertina wire? There's two levels and layers of concertina wire on here, we don't know, but it could. But the White House specifically referencing the unlawful nature of the construction along the border, how cruel it is and how dangerous it is for migrants on the border. Now, the White House also taking credit for the drop in migrant encounters since February of 2021, that's shortly after President Joe Biden took office. They say that the encounters now are lowest since February 2021. And Jim, I've got to state the obvious here, because if you look at these buoys, if you look at them, they have a start and they have an end. And I've got to state the obvious and that this is not stopping illegal immigration. We've seen migrants walk across and also skirt these buoys and walk along the concertina wire and turn themselves into immigration authorities. So this huge legal battle between the U.S. and Texas is over something that is not even effective at stopping illegal immigration, Jim?",

But flash forward about a year when special counsel Jack Smith reached out and expressed an interest. He decided to take another look at this privilege claim. So he brought all these documents to the Trump campaign. They reviewed them and they said, look, we're not actually going to assert any privilege here. So that allowed Bernie Kerik to hand over thousands of documents to the special counsel. Again, some of these have never been seen by investigators before. And these are the materials that were produced by the team and Rudy Giuliani put together and they worked to look for this alleged fraud. These include witness statements and research. But it's also a reminder, Jim, that as many people are waiting and watching for a likely Trump indictment, the special counsel is continuing with its investigation, not only gathering evidence, but also scheduling interviews.

And Ukraine - rather, Russia has been doubling down on Ukraine's grain storage facilities, in fact, hitting a port today that's on the River Danube that is actually Ukraine's backup exit route to get grain to export grain to the rest of the world. Now that Russia has shut down the Black Sea grain deal, stopping the grain getting out through the Black Sea. So the Danube port was also a target of Russia. And interestingly, only several hundred yards away from the border with Romania. Now, had they struck Romania, a NATO member, that could have been a whole different picture there. But Russia is getting more missiles through than it was in the past. Has it switched up its targets because it knew it wasn't getting through to some to be able to get through to those that don't have the protection that President Zelenskyy needs? I mean, when you talk to any of the NATO planners, one of the big lessons out of Ukraine is you have to have dominance in the skies.
