ATF is bringing our expertise in post-blast investigations and our crime gun Intelligence to specifically assist in this investigation. I will tell you that our special agent bomb techs are working with the FBI and with Las Vegas Metro, and sifting through that post-blast debris to find components and investigative leads that will derive from that evidence process. We're too early into that investigation process to give any determination as far as how this device was initiated. I will say that we do know that the components primarily consist of fireworks, mortars, aerial shells, and are all consumer fireworks, nothing commercial grade has been discovered at this point, and we have identified some fuel enhancers like the Coleman fuel and BP racing fuel and some explosive targets that can be purchased at any sporting goods store. We've also -- as you've -- as the sheriff mentioned, we've identified two semi-automatic handguns recovered from the Tesla. We have successfully traced those firearms, and I can tell you that Matthew Livelsberger lawfully purchased both of these firearms on December 30th, 2024. We have agents following up those investigative leads. We know exactly where those firearms were purchased, and we will share any developments from those leads as they come in. Thank you.",

They're waiting for DNA, given the burn, of course, on his body. So, not a 100 percent, they said, but they are waiting for the DNA. We also heard from the sheriff that the subject sustained a gunshot wound to the head that was suffered before the explosion. He believes the gunshot was self-inflicted. In terms of how -- in terms of the confidence, they believe they may be this individual, they said they found military identification on him, credit cards, passport, and they also identified a tattoo that they showed. They're not aware of any other subjects that were involved in this case. And they talked about the -- he was a current member of the military. He served in Afghanistan previously, National Guard, Army Reserve and active duty Army Green Beret. So, a lot of questions still being asked that did give us idea of the trajectory.

So, you can imagine the international work that has to go into this right now, looking for records, looking for interviews with people who might have known what he was up to in the days and weeks before this. One of the things that they mentioned that happened just days before this explosion was the lawful purchase of the firearms that they found in the burned vehicle. The two semi-automatic handguns that police say were lawfully purchased by him two days earlier on December 30th, 2024. They also found, as you mentioned, the military ID, the passport, fireworks, an iPhone, a smartwatch, credit cards. They mentioned that most of the material in there was to help fuel a greater explosion. Now, they did mention, as you discussed, that the subject in the vehicle was -- had died by a self-inflicted gunshot wound just shortly before the explosion. And the way they characterized it was by saying this was a suicide with bombing that occurred immediately after. They also mentioned it's not lost on them that this was a Tesla outside of a Trump hotel. But at this moment, there's no confirmed ideology or explanation of motive related to politics or otherwise. They did say that there are some coincidental similarities with the person who attacked the crowd in New Orleans. But at this point in time, there is no confirmed link between the two cases. The similarities that we know of are that both men had served at Fort Bragg. That's a very large base, and it's not confirmed whether they were in the same unit or were there in the same years, same thing with their service in Afghanistan, don't know if they were in the same location or the same unit. So, there's still a lot to go through. And they did say that they -- their teams in a joint investigation worked through the night. We spoke to some of the guests who are just now checking out, but they were here yesterday when this explosion happened. We talked to a couple who were staying really high up above the 40th floor, and said that at the time of the explosion, they could feel the windows shaking, and that it sounded like a bomb had gone off. And that after 9:00 a.m., shortly after 9:00 a.m., they even saw smoke billowing from the stairwells and from the elevator doors, and elevator service was shut down for a while. So, that was a frightening experience for those who were inside. And of course, this being the day after New Year's, we see a lot of people now trying to check out.

And, John, we'll talk about New Orleans in just amoment just because I want to pick your brain about what we've heard in the last few minutes from Las Vegas officials. We're starting to get a picture. We know the subject's name. We know -- now identified, but not conclusively. They are waiting for DNA, but we also know that he sustained a gunshot wound to the head before the explosion, police beliefs it was self-inflicted. We are starting to get a clearer picture of this individual. What stood out to you from what we heard in the last 20 minutes or so?",

He did talk about -- I think it was the FBI talking aboutthe level of sophistication in terms of what they had, what he had on him, fireworks that we consume (ph), fuel enhancers, and he talked about fuel -- to fuel a greater explosion, that speaks to potentially questions of a motive.

But we've seen far more sophisticated versions of this, where the explosive black powder from the fireworks has been harvested from them and put in a container with shrapnel and other things. This was very amateurish in terms of trying to create an explosion. And what you saw there, with the lack of injuries to people, the lack of damage to the building, was it went off like a big firework show with a fire and then, that was basically it.",

The FBI, as we've heard in the last two hours or so, basically saying they believe a premeditated act of terrorism, the suspect acted alone. 100 percent, their words, inspired by ISIS.

So, let's look back when yesterday the FBI assistant special agentin charge said, we believe that others were involved, that he had accomplices. But they've had time to pour through those videos and see that the people who approached these two improvised explosive devices, far more sophisticated, by the way, than what we see in Las Vegas, these were pipe bombs that were made with remote control settings that could have been self-activated on a command detonation from the guy driving the truck, the suspect, that people who were looking in those things were not the people who placed them there. A more careful video canvas, more detailed has shown, according to the FBI, that the suspect post -- placed both of the coolers with the explosive devices there had made them in the Airbnb that he rented where he had set some kind of timer to cause a fire to possibly destroy the evidence there. And there's the five recordings he made talking about his family problems, financial problems, and the fact that he was inspired by ISIS and doing this in their name that really has kind of narrowed their thinking to he was acting alone and he was self-radicalized.",

It's going to help them understand the story, which is going back through what searches did he doonline, what websites did he return to again and again, did he watch propaganda from ISIS, did he watch any particular videos or tapes or messages more than once, had he found what we used to refer to as a spiritual sanctioner, one of these individuals like Sheikh Faisal or Ammar al-Awlaki who radicalizes with messages meant for who's ever listening. They're going to want to see all of that. They've gotten into one of the devices. They're still trying to get past the security and passwords in two of those phones. They have the two laptops. But the FBI's CART team, which is the Cyber Analysis Response Team, they're very adept at getting into these devices. It may take a while, but they usually are able to get into them without losing data, which is the risk there. And they're going to want to look back through his history. Not just the devices, too. They'll subpoena the carriers and the providers and see what kind of digital trail he left on their servers as well.",
