A majority of Democrats think that he is too old and they want another candidate. But as the clock now ticks toward the election, does the president still have the support among the people who got him to the White House in the first place? In moments, I'll speak with the man who propelled Biden to the nomination and the presidency, Congressman Jim Clyburn. But, first, one of Biden's weaknesses, according to these critics, is his number two, Vice President Kamala Harris. Her numbers aren't great either. A poll from over the summer showed half of voters have a negative view of Harris. That's one of the lowest ratings for that poll. And among Democrats, she is obviously more popular.

But there are two candidates running right now to try to win the Democratic nomination, and that's Marianne Williamson and Robert Kennedy Jr., and then you have Dr. Cornel West running as a Green Party candidate. Many of the other governor types that probably would step into this race and some members of Congress will not step into the race because of the incumbency, and they know that they will crash and burn with the Democrats who control the levers of power, just as they did in 2020. I disagreed that the handwriting was on the wall in 2020. It was not on the wall in those first contests, as I remember, until people who were even ahead of Senator Biden, before he became -- or vice President Biden before he became the president, got out of the race and jumped in on his side.

As we can see, the last few presidents, debating is not the major responsibility of the President of the United States. Maybe a more important issue for the prime minister in the U.K., but the United States is actually getting things done. And, you know, I don't always agree with everything that Donald Trump says, but as a conservative, I liked the vast majority of things he did during his four years as President on substance.
