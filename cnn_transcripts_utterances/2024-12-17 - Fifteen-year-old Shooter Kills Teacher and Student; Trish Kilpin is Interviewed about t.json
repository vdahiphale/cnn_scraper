So, it just becomes this spiraling sort of effect. How similar is the content?

So, you can imagine Trump's legal team here looking for a law in Iowa they can use to sue Ann Selzer and \"The Des Moines Register\" and its parent company, Gannett. And they've landed on this consumer fraud protection law. They're basically arguing that the poll was an example of fraud, that it was, quote, election interference fiction.Now, as you said, John, Ann Selzer has a sterling reputation, or at least she did until this year. Her pre-election poll was wildly wrong, and she has acknowledged so. She went through the data last month trying to figure out what went wrong, and she came to the conclusion that she did her job the best she could and the poll was off for a variety of obscure reasons that just chalked up to the reality of the difficulty of polling. In other words, she's saying she reported the facts the best she could. But Trump is saying this poll was fiction. It distorted the final days of the election. This seems like a legal long shot.

He has threatened other suits as well. And he has a number of them pending.But let's remember that the law goes both ways. Trump is also being sued for defamation by multiple parties. This case, though, this is a rarity because it is a fraud case. We will see pretty quickly, I think, whether a judge in Iowa takes this seriously. But the broader point, as \"Puck's\" Tara Palmieri wrote last night, the broader point might here be to deter polling in general, to stop pollsters from coming out with polls that make Trump look bad.
