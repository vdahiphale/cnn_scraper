      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to CNN \"Newsroom\", I'm Max Foster in London. Just ahead, on the eve of the first anniversary of the war in Ukraine, CNN is the first inside the village of Vuhledar which has injured heavy Russian shelling.Also ahead, Vladimir Putin pledges to strengthen Russia's nuclear capabilities days after suspending a key nuclear treaty with the U.S. And a 9-year-old girl and a TV reporter are amongst three people killed in a series of shootings in Florida. More details just ahead. Extra security measures are in place in cities and towns across Ukraine with the first anniversary of Russia's invasion less than 24 hours away. The Spanish Prime Minister is in Kyiv, where he's expected to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and make a speech to the country's parliament. Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden is back in Washington after an historic 3-day European trip meant to showcase Western unity. It comes as Vladimir Putin is promising to strengthen Russia's ability to launch nuclear missiles from land, sea and air. On the ground, the battles are particularly intense along Ukraine's Eastern front lines. CNN's Alex Marquardt has this exclusive look at a small coal mining town that has emerged as a critical hotspot. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (on camera): This fight for Vuhledar right now is one of the most important and difficult in the country. While the fight for a Bakhmut is largely symbolic. This is a very strategic fight for both sides. Vuhledar is unique in that it sits at the intersection of the two main active fronts in Ukraine, the Southern and the Eastern Front. That is why Russia wants to try to push through here to launch an offensive into Donbas. It is believed that this is one of their shaping operations, the beginning of a larger offensive to come in the next few weeks. But they are struggling very badly right now. They've lost a huge amount of men and armored vehicles as they tried to cross open fields, including minefields, where the Ukrainians have been able to inflict a huge amount of damage on their troops. At the same time, the Russians are absolutely pummeling this town. You can see all around me, these are Soviet era, apartment blocks now largely empty, the residents have fled, and almost every single one destroyed in varying degrees. All of the windows have been blown out. Craters here in the ground where children used to play. Ukrainians have the benefit of the higher ground here and these buildings to use in the fighting. But as with so many of the battles here in Eastern Ukraine, it is a fight of attrition, who can hold out the longest and Ukrainian side saying they need more ammunition to be able to keep the Russians at bay to keep them from advancing. Alex Marquardt, CNN, Vuhledar in Eastern Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It certainly seems like a major route between the Yevgeny Prigozhin and the leadership of the Russian military.And the leadership of the Russian Defense Ministry and you're absolutely right; Yevgeny Prigozhin did make some of those comments, essentially accusing the Russian Defense Ministry of starving his forces around the Bakhmut area of ammunition. Now, the Russian Defense Ministry shot back, if you will, at Yevgeny Prigozhin with a statement obviously, saying that, that was not true. They say that there were gains that had been made around Bakhmut over the past couple of days. And that alone showed that there was ammunition in that area. And so therefore, statements saying that ammunition were not arriving in the Bakhmut area to the forces that are fighting there, whether they are with Prigozhin or whether they are direct Russian Military forces that that simply isn't true. Now, Prigozhin seems to have come out this morning, as you just pointed out, Max, and said that it seems as though the issue is resolved. He said right now that's still something that's going on. On paper, it seems as though a train has left a train station, possibly with ammunition on it. But this really is you're absolutely right, a remarkable back and forth that has been going on between the Yevgeny Prigozhin and the Russian Military. And all of it, of course, we've resolved revolves around that key City of Bakhmut where some of the heaviest fighting is going on so definitely something that I think for the Russian public and also, of course, Russian politics kind of took away from the fact that they really wanted to take that city by the first anniversary of the war. However, right now that blame game seems to be over and it seems as though right now at least Yevgeny Prigozhin is saying that that ammunition is now on its way again, Max.",

The Israeli military in a rare mid-day almost raid into the old City of Nablus going after what they said was intelligence that said that militants were planning in immediate attack.And when their forces converged upon this house in the old City of Nablus, the IDF saying that they came under heavy fire not only from the house itself, but they said also from surrounding cars and people on the streets. We do know that military groups are claiming something like 6 of the 11 Palestinians who were killed, and we are hearing have extensive injuries, just the numbers the sheer numbers or numbers. Many people here have not seen since the days of the Second Intifada in the early 2000s. At least 100 were injured by live ammunition that's according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. And then several 100 more were injured by things like tear gas inhalation or shrapnel. That's according to Health Officials in Nablus. And part of the reason for these numbers is just because of the time of day and the location of where this raid took place. Typically, these really military will raid in the middle of the night to try to avoid bystanders being involved try to avoid a lot of attention. And as you can see from the footage right there, obviously this read caused a lot of attention a lot of people were out on the street already at the market in the old city. It's very crowded place the old City of Nablus, lots of winding alleys, pack homes packed tightly together. And as you can see people on the street there, especially young men, throwing rocks, Molotov cocktails at the Israeli military there were told us was an hour's long operation, very heavy firefight really astounding numbers. We also know the Islamic Jihad militant group saying at least two of its commanders was killed as well as a member of Hamas. The militant groups in Gaza threatening that they were going to react and they did last night with six rockets. Israeli Military responding with those airstrikes on what they said was a weapons manufacturing site. No injuries on either side. We do know there are efforts today to try to restore some sort of calm. We know that the U.N. mid-East Envoy tour when Aslan (ph) was in Gaza today for a few hours, no information yet though, on who he met with or what was potentially discussed.

So far, it's quite quiet, but one never wants to, you know, put the cart before the horse.But it's very different obviously here certainly in the Capitol than it was a year ago. This Capitol was one of the first to be attacked, Putin believed and so his people believed that they could encircle and capture Kyiv and decapitate the government within just a few hours or days. That is what they believe. And of course, that did not happen nowhere close Russians never got close to this Capitol at least not close enough to get the Presidential Palace. They were repelled after about five weeks. And that is set the tone of the last year President Zelenskyy who came into office, let's face it, with a history of being an entertainer, a comedian who ran on an anti-corruption platform has in this last year generally been acclaimed as one of the great war leaders of our time. And he has addressed his people every single night to keep their resolve and their spirit up. He does that every night from here. He's addressed the international community practically on a daily basis. In the last few weeks and months leading up to this one-year mark. He has traveled outside of Ukraine for the first time since he was in Munich just a few days before the war when I interviewed him then, at a time when many people didn't believe U.S. intelligence, that there would be a full scale invasion. And his lobbying and the resistance of his people and the success of his troops on the battlefield, have really engaged the world.

And this war, I'm not sure whether he calls it a war yet, but anyway, is on behalf of his people's historic rights is what he's saying. Of course, President Biden when he was in Poland, which is the coalface of the NATO alliance, now, defending against Russia. He said that Putin when his tanks rolled in, expected us to roll over, we did not, and he spoke about the strong spine of democracy. How democracy far from being weak and corrupt and soft, like the Russians, and maybe even the Chinese thing have actually shown they to be strong and stalwart in support of their worldview. And certainly in support of the international world order, which is a United Nations prescribed world order. It's not a west, it's not an east it's not a north and a south. It's an international U.N. prescribed world order that fundamentally operates around the sanctity of borders, and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States.
