That's over Beirut, those coming after Israel said it was conducting a precise strike there. And our team here, we were just standing here in capturing two more blasts near where we're standing. Of course, we're on the coast of Tel Aviv, explosions that perhaps could have been interceptions that look to be right over the water just north of here and then also hearing those blasts and jets. So we're keeping an eye on that right now as we are following this breaking news. It has been a day of fast moving developments.

BURNETT: All of that, Jim, puts incredible pressure on him to seize the moment, to seize the moment to do what he's going to do. And obviously the context here is we showed that map, you have 40,000 U.S. troops in this region at the ready. And all of that right now, the U.S. president is making quite clear as U.S. officials have made clear for months now, right? That the U.S. does not want a regional war and had each instance of escalation and to be clear escalation, certainly by Iran, by Hezbollah, but also by Israel, the U.S. has attempted, it, attempted ceasefires. They've attempted to get back Iran, that back Israel rather to defend itself, but also say, don't go too far as we heard from the U.S. president today saying, do not attack the nuclear facilities. And yet the war expands. I mean, we've been talking for weeks and months about the danger of a regional war. This is already a multiple, multiple front war. The war continues in Gaza.

He's a member of the Foreign Relations Committee. And, Senator Murphy, as I'm sitting here with Nic and Jim, you know, and we have -- we're witnessing -- we're seeing in a very fast-moving situation, where an Israeli formal response could come at any moment, Biden says to Prime Minister Netanyahu, do not strike Iran's nuclear facilities. It's a hard no. Do you think that Prime Minister Netanyahu will listen to President Biden? SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): Well, let's be clear, Iran is Israel's enemy. Iran is our enemy. These attacks are unconscionable and there must be a decisive response. That's important for Israel security, but that's important for the security of the U.S. as well. Obviously, we have thousands of troops in the region. We've got thousands of Americans inside Israel, but we also know that Iran has designed to continue its attacks on the United States and U.S. assets. So there's no doubt that the United States is going to work with Israel to deliver a response to these attacks. Now I agree with President Biden, I do not believe that it is, frankly, possible for a military attack on Iran's nuclear facilities to eliminate their ability to produce nuclear material. The fact of the matter is we had a diplomatic agreement with Iran that assured Iran would not be able to, again, a nuclear weapon within 12 months of making the decision to move towards that objective. Today, they are perhaps weeks away. You can set them back, perhaps months, perhaps over a year, but you can't bomb knowledge out of existence. So there needs to be a response here. I just think it is a true statement that there's limited efficacy in trying to eliminate scientific knowledge, which is what Iran possesses right now with respect to their nuclear program.",

I don't doubt that he cares about the security of Israel, but he seems to be guided on many days by his own political survival.We obviously thought we had the ability to obtain a ceasefire with Hamas. Hamas stood in the way of that agreement, but Prime Minister Netanyahu also seemed to believe that it would hurt his political interests to enter into that ceasefire and prisoner exchange. What has to happen now is, first, a response by Israel and the United States. But second, we have to get on a path towards de-escalation. I don't think that these attacks on Israel can go without a response, but there already was a diplomatic process in place with Hezbollah. We have the opportunity after these limited ground incursions that Israel is making to get us on a path to peace perhaps by achieving a ceasefire in the north with Hezbollah, that might be able to stimulate further talks to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza.",

And I'll read you just a part of what the case that Jack Smith, the special counsel, is making. He says that when the defendant lost the 2020 presidential election, he resorted the crimes to try to stay in office.And then he's -- they continue to say that the defendant launched a series of increasingly desperate plans to overturn the legitimate election results in seven states and list those seven states. And among them things we learned. Erin is the fact that, you know, prosecutors say they have evidence that Donald Trump himself sent that now infamous to 2:24 tweet, if you remember, on January 6, where he told his supporters that Mike Pence didn't have the courage to essentially go along with his claims that there was fraud in the election and essentially put the former the former vice president, then vice president in danger. What prosecutors lay out there, they say that they know there were only two people who could have sent that tweet and they know that the other person, obviously, it have witnesses that person did not send a tweet, therefore, it was Donald Trump, who himself sent that tweet. And, of course, as a result of that, the former vice president was put in danger. They had to evacuate them, and in this document, we learned that one of the things that happens is the former president is sitting there for hours, hearing about the evacuation at the U.S. Capitol, and he is told that the vice president essentially is in danger and his response is, \"So what?\" Again, part of what prosecutors are doing here, Erin, is to try to get over this hurdle from -- from the Supreme Court to prove, they say, that what Donald Trump did is not protected by immunity -- Erin.",

They can't drag it out indefinitely and there's no longer a looming election to worry about. That's the whole difference.Earlier, the Supreme Court was in a position to schedule a late argument to render a late decision to make sure that sending it back to Judge Chutkan would create still further delay and that there would be no full trial before the November 5 election. That was imperative and the court did Trump's bidding by stretching it out as far as humanly could. Now, that is behind us and it no longer matters whether the trial occurs in April of next year or on October of next year or even in perhaps 2026, this man is going to face justice unless he evades it by managing to get himself into the presidency again.

It was like I can't believe this is really happening after everything that he's done to our country, after being the first president to not participate in the peaceful transfer of power, like it didn't feel real. And then, you know, I'm recently engaged. I'm thinking about having children. I very much want to have children. And one day, I just thought about what I would say to my children in the future and in that moment and everything just became incredibly real. Like I want to live in a country, if I have a little girl, I want her to have autonomy over her body. And if she becomes a boy, I want her to feel safe and respected in this country. And no matter the gender of my children, I want them to live on a planet that's habitable, and I would really also like them to live in a democracy. So it just the stakes all hit me at once and I knew I had to use every resource at my disposal to get this message out there, that we need to elect Kamala Harris if they want a future.",

And now what you've seen, I mean, just to go through this and I'm -- it's not that you don't know this. I'm sorry. It's painful to listed off, but this is what's happened. He's been disbarred in New York and Washington, facing election interference cases in Georgia and Arizona, filing for bankruptcy, owes two election workers in Georgia $148 millions of -- dollars. He's being forced to sell your family home in New York City to pay a small amount of money for those debts. So, Caroline Rose, how much do you blame Trump for all of this?",

So I think it's important to look at the culture that he has created and the peep -- the way in which he has refused to accept that he lost the 2020 election and get everybody to compromise their values. Do anything just to keep him in power and attack citizens like Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, like he's willing to hurt his own people just to have power. And Kamala Harris would never do that.
