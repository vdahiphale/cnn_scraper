      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to our viewers all around the world. I'm Fredricka Whitfield, and this is the CNN Newsroom. This hour, we're following two developing legal stories. First in France this was the scene outside court in Avignon this morning, as Dominique Pelicot was found guilty alongside 50 others in a mass rape case that has shocked not only France but the world.Speaking after the verdict was handed down, the woman at the center of the case, Gisele Pelicot paid tribute to unknown victims. And then here in the United States, Luigi Mangione, the man accused of murdering the UnitedHealthcare CEO, will be in court this hour in Pennsylvania. The horrific rape case that has captured the attention of France and the world is over. Dominique Pelicot, who was accused of organizing the mass rape of his wife, Gisele, has been found guilty and sentenced to 20 years in prison. And the 50 other defendants accused of taking part in the abuse have all been found guilty. A French court handed down the verdict several hours ago for more than a decade, Dominique Pelicot drug his wife and allowed local men to rape her while she was unconscious. Gisele Pelicot has been praised for courageously speaking up and encouraging other women to report abuse. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GISELE PELICOT, SPEAKS AFTER EX-HUSBAND: I am thinking finally of the unrecognized victims of stories which often unfold in the shadows. I want you to know we share the same fight. I would like to express my most profound gratitude to everyone who supported me throughout this length trial. Your testimonies moved me, and I took strength from them to return every day during these long days of hearings. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, what we had was outside this courtroom as every day over this nearly four- month trial Fredricka, huge crowd to come out, not only to support Gisele Pelicot, but to keep a very close eye on what the verdict was going to be and what the sentences handed down were going to be.And so, we saw almost as soon as they came the guilty verdict, of course, for them, but the maximum sentence only given to Dominique Pelicot by the French judiciary, and that immediately led to cheers outside this courthouse. Some of the men who left free men today because they were given suspended sentences left under the cheers of the crowd. So, there is anger at what is perceived to be some of the leniency of those sentences. But again, huge admiration expressed, once again, for Gisele Pelicot's courage in having made this public. That was a decision Fredricka, that meant that those videos that have been at the heart of this case. Remember, it was over that decade period that Dominique Pelicot had not just recruited these men online, brought them to the family home to rape his sedated wife. He had filmed the act 200 rapes captured on video found in his phones and computers by investigators who came across him simply because he was caught one day in a supermarket trying to film up women's skirt. None of this might ever come to -- have come to light otherwise. So, this is you're right, a trial that has really grit the imagination, not just to people here in France by the sordid details that is exposed by its scale, by the courage of the woman at the center of it, but I think also because by making it public, Gisele Pelicot has also led to this being much more than a mass rape trial. It's become really something of a societal reckoning, not just here in France, but elsewhere, to do with the nature of rape culture, relationships between men and women, the nature of consent, the legal system, and how it is for victims as they try and come forward to it, and as those prosecutions are then brought where they are brought. And again, the leniency of the sentence here can still be appealed, but certainly leading to a great deal of outrage from those who follow this trial, day in day out Fredricka.",

And so, they've done their sentence. They already accomplished the accomplish time. And it's very lenient, in a sense that what they got is the kind of condemnation we have in, I would say, normal rape, which means not with this kind of drugs, not as many perpetrators, not with this kind of violence made by the husband. And this is less -- last week, we were in a trial in Paris, and the guy who was hierarchical of women, who was cleaning in a hotel, got 7 years. It was just one man, one rape, and he got seven years. And this, those men who knew what they were doing and who participate to something collective, got less than that. It is very surprising.",

I think everyone in France had to ask themselves how they are -- they were mainly men behaving with women and women asking themselves if they were ever raped this way because it was the husband and with a very strong confidence relationship.But what it sparked, certainly, is to show how the French law was outdated, and how it's -- and the how justice system is usually failing women in France. We had the chance, if I call that chance that we had very strong evidence with sorry -- the videos, but it's barely, really the case. So, it -- we were -- there was a work in process since February on how we should change the law, and this trial prove even more the need to change the law to avoid this kind of defense. We had that they thought that they had the consent because the husband said yes, or they thought that she was consented to this kind of relationship, because it was so called libertine, in fact, pornographic fantasy, which are fueled by belief that women always went it, or even when they are asleep. And this is all those rape culture that was also analyzed and again and again, but maybe we have to do it again and again in order to change the thing. I mean, we are in the time where, well, you have a president who say, your body, my choice, and we strongly have to fight that. And I think it's universal.",

So, Putin was -- you know under pressure to assure them that theeconomy is doing fine. Just look at other countries. Inflation may be up, but it's not that bad, et cetera, that that was a part of it. But I think internationally, he was asked a very interesting question by an NBC U.S. Reporter who said, you know when you meet with Trump, won't you be in a weaker position and he mentioned the war drone attacks in Moscow, assassination of general? And Putin turned it. And he is actually good at doing this. He turned it into Russia. And he said, no, actually, Russia is much more -- is much stronger than it's been. We are more sovereign. So, the things that he didn't talk about, though, were like in the Kursk region the North Korean troops who were there fighting, there was no word about those. And but I think you know, overall, what he does is, this is -- you know it's lasting for about four hours. So. there's that show of -- you know stamina that he can answer questions that were -- you know the Kremlin is totally open to questions.

So, in this 11-count indictment, more specifically, there is that, you know, count of murder in the first degree.

The issue is this special circumstance, the murder designed to incite terrorism, can be charged if the prosecutors can prove that not only was this a premeditated murder, but it was designed to incite fear intimidation in citizens and to influence governmental policies.And the prosecutor in the state of the count in Manhattan has said that this was a brazen attack that occurred in broad daylight in a busy part of Manhattan. And he believes that there's enough evidence to support the additional charges, and it's significant because this first-degree murder charge, if convicted, would allow for the defendant to receive a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. So that makes this first-degree murder charge even more significant than the second-degree murder charges that have been filed against the defendant as well, which carry only prison sentences up to 25 years.",

The documents show a complicated arrangement, with Natalie moving between homes every two to three days.

The documents also show that Natalie attended therapy and her parents were encouraged to join her. Neither Jeff nor Melissa Rupnow have responded to CNN's multiple requests for comment, but court family documents say at one point reported a generally positive co-parenting relationship. Police say Rupnow's parents, Jeff and Melissa, are co-operating with the investigation. According to police, Rupnow used a handgun in the attack, but it's unclear how she obtained the weapon. A Facebook photo posted by Rupnow's father in August shows her at a shooting range. A comment from her dad on the photo says they joined the range in the spring, and quote, we have been loving every second of it. She's also seen wearing a KMFDM shirt, a German industrial rock band whose lyrics were cited by the shooters at the Columbine High School massacre in 1999 in Colorado. The band, at the time, condemned that horrific attack. The band's music also accompanied a TikTok post from Dylan Butler shortly before he opened fire at a school in Iowa in January, killing a sixth grader and wounding seven.
