(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOHN IRVING, REPRESENTING TRUMP'S CO-DEFENDANT: The Justice Department has unfortunately decided to bring these charges against Mr. De Oliveira. And now, it's time for them to put their money where their mouth is. SCHNEIDER (voice over): Carlos De Oliveira leaving the federal courthouse in Miami, Monday, escorted business his lawyer and federal agents. A 20-year employee at Mar-a-Lago, De Oliveira walked out of court on $100,000 bond after being charged along with former President Trump and Trump's close aide, Walt Nauta, with attempting to delete security footage from Mar-a-Lago after it was subpoenaed by a federal grand jury. De Oliveira allegedly telling the director of I.T. at Mar- a-Lago, the boss, an apparent reference to Donald Trump, wanted to delete the server where security footage was stored. CNN also reporting that another Mar-a-Lago employee received a target letter from federal prosecutors. Yuscil Taveras oversees the property's surveillance cameras and has met with investigators in recent weeks. It's unclear if he is cooperating. So far, he is not facing charges, but at latest some of the allegations in the indictment were based on information he provided. DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: They're not indicting me. They're indicting you. I just happen to be standing in their way. That's all it is.",

The problem he has is there's so much evidence against Donald Trump and Walt Nauta, that he doesn't bring that much to the table. But as a prosecutor -- I mean, I've never been a prosecutor. I would defer to Elliot on this. I'd rather have the guy on the stand saying, yes, the boss called me for 24 minutes after we got that subpoena, and he wanted me to get rid of everything.

But it's not going to deflate the message coming from Putin and the Kremlin. Why? Because he still controls the narrative. The strikes are relatively small, there are not big casualties. In fact, very, very few casualties, it's structural damage so far. So, it's not going to -- this time, I think, not going to put a course correction in the way that Putin is fighting the war.
