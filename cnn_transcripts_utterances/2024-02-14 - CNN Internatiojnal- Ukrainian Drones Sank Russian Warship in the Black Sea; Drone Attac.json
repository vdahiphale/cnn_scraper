But we have been seeing on the Russian side, the military bloggers who track the victories or defeats of their own side, appearing to refer to this as well.But certainly, something to celebrate from the side of the Ukrainians, if it does turn out to be correct. And what appears to have happened is that this was a special forces operation in coordination with other parts of Ukraine's military forces using drones powered by jet skis that allow them to attack and get a hole into the side of this ship. This warship, the kind of ship that they use, Max, to carry or support amphibious operations and can carry missiles, drones, but also tanks, the kind of weaponry they need to land ashore. It is an important ship and an important part of their Black Sea fleet, which has suffered, as you suggested number of significant defeats, not just the sinking of the Ivanovets ship that was sunk earlier this month. But of course, you'll remember the Black Sea Fleet flagship that was sunk at the very start of this, one of the very early victories of the Ukrainians, the Moskva, that was sung back in April of '22. So, this is being closely watched. It is, of course, an area in which the Ukrainians have been trying to make progress using drones to try and level out the playing field given that they themselves, ever since the occupation of Crimea in 2014, and everything that's happened since, simply don't have a functioning Black Sea fleet of their own. So, they're opposite, these important warships on the Russian side and using drones to try and sink them. What we're hearing from their side as well, Max and Bianca, is that our Russians were obliged to mount an operation to try and rescue what they could off the crew and the ship, but that that failed again, hearing that from the Ukrainian side. But an important victory for them. So that be confirmed. And according to those pictures in the Black Sea and off the coast there off Crimea. Max and Bianca.",

He's been out battling cancer, receiving treatments. But he was back tonight, and I got the chance to sit down with him for an exclusive interview ahead of the America's vote where he talked about how important his vote was and just how narrow the margins are in the House right now. In terms of Mayorkas impeachment, it's going to head to the Senate, but we're being told it is dead-on arrival in the Senate with Senate Republicans and Democrats collectively saying that they just don't see the support and the appetite in the upper chamber to impeach Mayorkas. Republicans have accused him of mishandling the situation at the southern border and the flow of migrants that have crossed the southern border, but some Republicans saying that that is a policy dispute and it does not rise to the level of impeachment. So, the Senate has some options. They can vote to just entirely dismiss the trial or they could have a trial and go through with the process. But either way, very clear that even though Alejandro was -- Mayorkas was impeached in the House, he is not going to be convicted in the Senate. Melanie Zanona, Capitol Hill, CNN.",

Very febrile to any suggestion that a rate cut might be pushed off further into the future. And that's essentially what this inflation number suggested. By being higher than expected, although not out of the ballpark by any means, it's sort of solidified the view that the Fed won't change rates, won't begin cutting at its next meeting. And it might be until May or beyond before they get round to it. Because the fact is, inflation is still running hot. And the Fed chair said again and again, until they see a sustained fall in inflation, one that does not look like it's going to reignite if they start cutting rates, then they're going to keep holding rates where they are. Now, we shouldn't put too much store by today's sharp fall. The market has rallied dramatically on the prospect of future rate cuts.

From a U.S. official, we understand that the main sticking point still seems to be Hamas' demands for the release of Palestinian prisoners. Now, you recall that the original proposal, which was the U.S., the Qataris, the Egyptians, which was kind of this framework that came out of Paris provided for a six-week pause and then a phased release of the Israeli hostages who were abducted during the terrorist attacks of October the 7th in exchange for the freeing of Palestinian prisoners.And we talked about the ratios of three Palestinian prisoners for every Israeli who was going to be freed, and then a higher ratio for Israeli soldiers and bodies and those who have come in in subsequent phases. But you recall, of course, Prime Minister Netanyahu's response to Hamas' demands, which included not just women, minors, elderly, sick people, but then in subsequent phases, some 1,500 Palestinian prisoners, including 500 who they would pick who were serving life sentences, many of whom would have been found convicted of killing Israelis or taking part in attacks that killed Israelis. And that seems to be the part that Netanyahu was most irked by. And you'll recall, he said that these demands were delusional. But these talks are continuing. We know that the that the Israeli government is coming under pressure from the Biden administration to take these talks seriously. And we've also heard from Hamas, I think it was just last week, talking about how if Israel does go in on the ground in Rafah, then that would kibosh these talks. At the same time, we're hearing some reports, for example, in the \"Wall Street Journal,\" saying that Israel is almost using the prospect of a Rafah ground incursion to try to pressure Hamas to temper its demands. In other words, if you don't do a deal, this ground operation will take place. We've not firmed that up ourselves, but that's certainly some of the reports that are going out there right now. So, as I say, no breakthrough yet. No breakdown yet. The talks continue. Still optimism. And indeed, the families, the main group representing the families who have hostages still held captive in Gaza were telling the Israeli delegation before these talks, don't come back, don't return until you bring everyone home, the living and the dead.",

But as we've seen, this is, what, now three hostages out of the original more than 250 that were kidnapped that have been rescued. There are still more than 100 in captivity. It seems unlikely that Israel is going to be able to rescue all of them or many more. We know that they've tried on many occasions and only successfully carried out, you know, the female Israeli soldier who was rescued and these two Argentine-Israelis who were rescued the other night.

Also saying -- accusing Israel of being \"blinded by rage.\" Now, we have had numerous comments within the United Nations, the secretary general, calling for this not to happen, and also the UN aid chief, Martin Griffiths, who gave a statement saying, \"Today, I'm sounding the alarm once again. Military operations in Rafah could lead to a slaughter in Gaza. They could also leave an already fragile humanitarian operation at death's door.\" So, there are some very dire warnings coming from a number of different areas.

We understand in the Northern Sinai as well, there is more of a security presence as Egypt is very concerned that there could be a significant invasion into Rafah. There are 1.3 million Palestinians in this small area at this point. The vast majority of them, about a million of them, in a sprawling tent city, many of them have been moved on a number of times before. They have fled violence in either Northern Gaza, Central Gaza, Khan Younis, all the areas where Israel has told them to move from, saying that they would be safe in Rafah. Many now wondering where they should go next. Max, Bianca.",
