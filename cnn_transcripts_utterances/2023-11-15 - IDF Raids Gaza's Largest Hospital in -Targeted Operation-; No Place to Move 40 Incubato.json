The IDF calls it a precise and targeted operation against Hamas as the search for hostages intensifies. SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  An elbow to the kidneys, a challenge to a fistfight and a Smurf insult. No, it's not middle school, it's Congress. They did manage to do some work, however, passing a major hurdle to avoid a government shutdown. KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over):  President Biden and Chinese president Xi Jinping, face-to-face today, the first time they have talked in a year and so much has happened since then. What the hopes are will come of this chat today. I'm Kate Bolduan with Sara Sidner and John Berman. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. (MUSIC PLAYING)",

You can see where it is right there.Israeli forces are inside in what the IDF is calling a precise and targeted operation against Hamas. I can show you a map of the hospital compound here. It's not just one building, it's several buildings. Now Israeli tanks and army vehicles are said now to be on the ground. We've seen video of that. There are said to be patients and staff, hundreds still inside the buildings. And in addition to that, thousands of people are sheltering in these different areas you can see right there. Doctors say Israeli troops are questioning and searching people inside. We have new video from inside the hospital itself, where you can see some of the damage said to have taken place after the Israeli troops entered. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) Now the IDF has released this video, which shows its troops delivering medical supplies, food. They say they're delivering incubators because we have seen pictures of babies in the hospital over the last several days. It's crucial to note that Israel and the United States say there's a Hamas command center underneath the hospital and uses the people inside the hospital as human shields. Now remember, the Geneva Conventions say that civilian hospitals are entitled to protection but they lose that protection, they say, under no circumstances can they be used for non-medical purposes. What does that mean? Well, that includes things like sheltering able-bodied combatants, storing arm and munitions, as a shield for military action. That's the situation that's taking place. We're waiting to get visibility on what's happening here. CNN's Oren Liebermann is tracking all of this from Tel Aviv. What's the latest?",

Just a few moments ago, Poppy Harlow and Phil Mattingly asked the IDF international spokesperson on what they found and what they released. I want to read a short statement. \"We understand there is a substantial Hamas infrastructure in the area, in the vicinity of the hospital, potentially under the hospital and it's something we're working on. It will take us time.\" The fact that he says potentially now raises serious questions about what the IDF knew in advance and what they thought they knew. They have long claimed there is Hamas infrastructure under the hospital itself, going so far as to release a digital video graphic several days or weeks ago, showing Hamas tunnels underneath the hospital. If that is only potential, that's a serious question the IDF has to answer, as we wait for them to release this evidence they say shows Hamas used the hospital.",

I'm not sure they, the Israelis, are telling us everything they really know about what's going on right now at the hospital. But the senior Israeli official told me like an hour ago that the goal of this operation, the raid into the Al-Shifa Hospital, was not to try and rescue hostages. They were not looking for hostages. They were looking for a, according to this Israeli official, they were looking for a tunnel hub in one of the buildings inside the compound of the hospital that, according to this Israeli official, those tunnels led to different other parts of the Gaza Strip and were used by Hamas to move weapons, to move operatives.
