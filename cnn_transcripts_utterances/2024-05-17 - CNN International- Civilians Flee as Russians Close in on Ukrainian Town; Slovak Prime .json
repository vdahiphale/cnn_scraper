If you're just joining us here at our top stories today.Trucks carrying aid to Gaza have begun to move ashore via a temporary pier built by the U.S. military. That's according to the U.S. Central Command. CENTCOM added that no U.S. troops went ashore in Gaza. Donald Trump's attorneys grilled former fixer Michael Cohen on the witness stand on Thursday in New York. They appeared to trip Cohen up with a question about a phone call Cohen allegedly had with Trump concerning a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels. Under questioning, Cohen said that, at least at the beginning, the call was about another topic. Deadly storms have slammed the U.S. state of Texas. At least four people were killed in Houston, and hundreds of thousands of people are without power. Some buildings' windows were blown out by the strong winds. Returning to a top story we're following out of France. Police have shot and killed a man who tried to set fire at a synagogue this morning. That's according to the French Interior Ministry, which says the incident happened in the northern city of Rouen. There are -- these are the first images, at least, that we've received from where the incident happened. The Interior Minister said the man was armed, and he congratulated the officers for stopping him. Rouen is located about 110 kilometers northwest of Paris. Now, NATO says Russia's new offensive in northern Ukraine will eventually hit the wall. Moscow launched the cross-border assault operation in the Kharkiv region last week, and fighting is underway for the town of Vovchansk. But NATO says even though at least nine Ukrainian villages have fallen, Russia won't achieve a strategic breakthrough. That's because, according to a senior NATO commander, Russian troops don't have the skills or the capability to do that. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says the situation in the region is generally under control but remains extremely difficult. Civilians are desperately trying to flee Vovchansk as the fighting gets closer to their homes. But to get to safety, they have to dodge Russian artillery fire and military drones hovering over their heads. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh saw it first-hand. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): When nightmares recur, they're often the same. Here, they get worse. The border town of Vovchansk, bearing the blunt horror of Moscow's race to take as much as they can in the weeks before Ukraine starts feeling American military help again. Every street aflame, Russians deeper inside the town. Policeman Maxim is answering one of 35 calls from locals on Thursday to evacuate. The day before, three colleagues were injured. The shelling never stops.",

If we run for cover, they might come for us. All we can do is hide in the trees and hope that if we're seen, the Russians instead have a better target in mind. But they come right overhead. That noise. Either the sound of death or someone deciding you're not worth their payload. We decide to leave, but again, we cannot travel fast enough to escape the drones, only expose ourselves and pray they lose interest. Perhaps they did. We'll never know. But behind us, Ukraine is aflame again, because however the West's interest in this war wanes, Putin's burns brighter than ever. Nick Paton Walsh, CNN, Vovchansk, Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "There's been a briefing by President Zelenskyy for journalists, too. He says that they've stabilized this area. He says Vovchansk obviously is the focus of the Russian intention.The maximum they've crossed the border so far is about 10km. The maximum penetration into Ukraine is 10km. President Zelenskyy says that they've moved some battalions to reinforce their areas where they haven't been forced back, areas where they've had to cede some territory. A very clear instruction for the civilians there to get out of harm's way as soon as they can, to listen to the authorities. But the message from President Zelenskyy seems to be we're sort of getting this under control. What we heard from NATO officials was their, I guess, intelligence-based analysis that Russia isn't intending to go for maximum gains there. And if you look at a readily available open-source material of where Russia has its maximum troop deployments, remembering that this is hundreds of miles long front line, it doesn't have, compared to many of the other parts of the front line, like in Donetsk and along the southern area near Zaporizhzhia, it doesn't have big concentrations of troops. There are a few units there. So the assessment that Russia may not be intending to rush full headlong into Kharkiv, which is only less than 20 miles from the border, that seems correct. However, if Russia sees that there's an opportunity, I think you can expect them to maneuver troops and come in there. But at the moment, they're not poised for that. I think one of the assessments is that Russia is pushing the front line in a number of places, particularly in the north, in Kharkiv, opening a new front. We've heard from President Zelenskyy, they've had to move battalions in to reinforce. The Russians are pressing around Zaporizhzhia in a way that they haven't before. So there are contested areas that will require additional Ukrainian troops. Putin is stretching Ukraine's resources, but there's a sense that he's still focusing on that central Donbas area, where the maximum number of troops are, to try to make gains there.",
