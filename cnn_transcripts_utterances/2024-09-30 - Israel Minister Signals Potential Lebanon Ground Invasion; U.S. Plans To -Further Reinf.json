And their purpose, obviously, as they've been saying for months now, is to see the return of 60-plus- thousand residents to the north. What are you hearing in terms of what that next phase will look like? JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF U.S. SECURITY ANALYST: Listen, all the pieces are in place now for a ground operation into Southern Lebanon. You have forces, including armor, mechanized units deployed on the northern border, and we've seen those forces grow. You now have, as CNN was reporting earlier in the day, smaller special operations, cross-border raids to prepare the terrain, perhaps, to identify targets. And you've also had this relentless air campaign, not just in Beirut, going after the senior leadership of Hezbollah, but also going after firing positions, missile launch sites, as well as weapon storage sites over the last several days. You can call these shaping operations to be ready to go in on the ground in significant fashion. Not clear that political order has been delivered, but the military pieces appear to be in place. The question is, what is the intention here, and how long do they plan to stay? To ben's point, Israel's record of ground operations in Lebanon is long and it's bloody and not necessarily effective, if you go back to the 2006 war or to its long occupation of Southern Lebanon from 1982 to 2000. That said, given what we've seen in terms of attacks against Hezbollah in recent days, including the killing of Nasrallah, the pager attack, the complete really destruction of its communications networks, one could argue that they have a weakened adversary in Hezbollah right now.

So it's clear that Israel, unlike its war with Hamas, has been preparing for a war with Hezbollah for many, many years, just given how deeply it has penetrated the organization, the fact that it, within a matter of weeks, has been able to take out massive stockpiles, not only on bombardments, air bombardments, but obviously taking out much of their command and the head of the organization, Hassan Nasrallah, as well.

It's abundantly clear that the Israelis are planning sometype of ground incursion in order to push Hezbollah back beyond the Litani River, a river that runs about 18 miles north and parallel to the border. That diminishes two threats to Israel. One, an October 7th-style attack coming from the north, as well as diminishes the ability of Hezbollah fighters to use anti-tank munitions to fire into Israeli buildings. That's something that has been happening since October 8th. And those towns along Israel's northern border have really taken a beating. So these are all prerequisites, obviously, for bringing Israelis back to their homes. And the Israelis have clearly decided that the air power alone is not going to do it.",

In recent years, over the course of the last decade, Hezbollah has become an expeditionary force for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps of Iran and was much feared throughout the region. Hassan Nasrallah was responsible for the deaths of Syrians and Lebanese and Israelis and Americans and Yemenis. His departure, at the end of an Israeli 2,000-pound bomb, is a watershed event. Nasrallah was uniquely charismatic, despite, you know, living essentially in the shadows. So, Hezbollah is clearly taking a beating as a result of Nasrallah's loss.

Israel has been very successful in, thus far, damaging Iran's second strike capability. The Iranians may be in a mode where they have to use their rocket and missile forces or lose them. Or they may decide to actually holster those in order to not bring them into the sites of the IDF. But you're quite right. In April, the Israelis actually held off. They demonstrated that they could penetrate Iranian airspace at will, but chose not to do a tremendous amount of damage.

I do think you can expect Donald -- excuse me, J.D. Vance to talk about this tomorrow night. We heard from Jason Miller, who has been also -- he's a Trump campaign adviser, but has been helping J.D. Vance prepare for the debate, said that this will probably be something that he brings up, showing that they're not running away from that particular attack.
