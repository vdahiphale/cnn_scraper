And, look, a lot of what he's going to be talking about both in Arizona, but also in Las Vegas, is kind of what we saw him do earlier this week, where he's really been trying to make inroads with not only Latino voters, but specifically Latino men.When I talked to Donald Trump's senior advisers, they say that's going to be a big part of his rhetoric with these stops, really trying to make inroads with that key demographic. And, of course, part of that is because they recognize how incredibly close this election is going to be and that it could be won on the margins. And so any voters they feel like they can siphon away from Harris, they do think she is not doing as well with Latino voters as she could be. Any voters they can pull away from her or even try to turn out who maybe are low propensity voters will benefit them. But I do want to talk about some of his language last night and what we heard, because actually following the town hall, a lot of what we saw Donald Trump's top allies, advisers, people like his son, Donald Trump Jr., as well as Stephen Miller, one of his top aides. They really focused on one key answer from Harris, which was when Anderson Cooper asked her, what would you do differently about the last four years? Even before the town hall started, and I know, obviously, Donald Trump was on stage during some of this, so he didn't get to watch all of it. Trump made the same argument on stage. Take a listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: After all the catastrophes she has caused, Kamala Harris can't say one thing that she'd do differently. You saw that? What would you do differently? I can't think of anything. I'm asking you to be excited about the future of our country again. This will be America's new golden age. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, they've actually been playing a lot of those clips. That was an answer she gave to The View and had said in one interview, they'd been playing that interview at a lot of his rallies. But I did actually find as well him saying, I want you to be excited about the future, and we're going to deliver a new a new golden age to America. That's actually kind of different language. We've heard Don Trump say that over the weekend as well. But normally at these rallies in recent days, he's really been painting a much darker picture of America. That was one moment when he was saying, you know, kind of had an optimistic message, saying I want you to be excited about the future. So, I found that pretty interesting.",

In the 90s, there were at least three or four minimum wage increases, but we've had none since 2009, which is kind of crazy when you think about it, right, most of the Obama years, all of the Trump administration, the pandemic, the inflation crisis, it's still been stuck there more than 5,000 days since an increase. That's actually the longest stretch since the minimum wage was actually established back in 1938 under FDR.Now, Harris is calling for $15 an hour. She says that the current level is poverty wages. She's actually wants to double it and she's even suggested maybe higher because she told NBC at least that level. This is an important issue for a lot of people, especially younger people who tend to make up the bulk of the minimum wage workers, minimum wage workers also tend to be more female, less education. They work in the service sector. But, look, Kate, as you know, it's far from clear whether or not this would actually happen if Harris gets elected. Congress has been deadlocked. A lot of people, a lot of Republicans, a lot of people in the business community are worried that if you raise the minimum wage too high, it could kill jobs. It could spike prices. I mean, to some extent, that's true. But, of course, we could debate how high it should be.",
