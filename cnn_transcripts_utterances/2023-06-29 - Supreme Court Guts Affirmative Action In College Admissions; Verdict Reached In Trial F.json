In a six to three decision, the justices ending affirmative action in college admissions are ushering in a new era in which a prospective students' race cannot be a determining factor in the decision to admit them.Now, the White House is actively exploring executive actions to counteract that ruling. Today, President Biden vowed his fight is not over. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Today's decision markedly different and it comes with some very heated opinions. ARIANE DE VOGUE, CNN U.S. SUPREME COURT REPORTER: Yes, absolutely. The court really effectively saying that colleges and universities can no longer take race into consideration, overturning decades old precedent that really helped blacks and Hispanics in this area. This opinion, as you said, it was six-three, divided along ideological lines. Chief Justice John Roberts, who has long been a critic of race- conscious programs, he wrote the major opinion here. He said - invalidating both the plans, he said, \"The Harvard and UNC admissions programs cannot be reconciled with the guarantees of the Equal Protection Clause. Both programs lack sufficiently focused and measurable objectives warranting the use of race, unavoidably employ race in a negative manner, involve racial stereotyping and lack of meaningful endpoints.\" And what's key here is he tried to say near the End of the appointment that, look, you no longer can check the box, but an applicant maybe in their essay, they can talk about their experience with race, and that really riled up the dissent here. Justice Sonia Sotomayor joined by her two liberal colleagues. And she basically said that kind of solution really fall short of bringing diversity in school. She said the \"supposed recognition that universities can, in some situations, consider race in application essays is nothing but an attempt to put lipstick on a pig.\" She said, \"The devastating impact of this decision cannot be overstated.\" We did have the two African-American justices on the bench, Justice Clarence Thomas, the conservative long wanting to overturn precedent, he said he understands the background here, but he thinks everybody should be treated equally. Justice Jackson, on her first term on this court, she really pushed back on what he said. Remember, the schools here said, look, we want diversity, we think that schools are a pipeline to society. That's why it's important. And on the other side, you had this conservative group that had been fighting this for years, coming up with a victory and they said this amounts to racial discrimination and today they won.",

And those standards are based on well settled precedent about how diversity is a compelling interest, and how based upon it being diversity, a compelling interest narrowly tailored to the objective of providing opportunities to all could be considered.Now you include language suggesting that if you write an essay talking about the effect of race on your life, well, you can consider that but you can't consider the race itself. I think that's lawyers splitting hairs very intelligent, obviously, and decorated lawyers, who do I speak, Supreme Court justices. At the end of the day, you need a measure of protection, let's call it for what it is, that measure of protection was rolled back today, just as we saw the rolling back of rights as it relates to abortion rights in the case that they took up before. And so ultimately, I think this is a setback for all terms and purposes and whatever language they put in it, we know the language they said, and that is that affirmative action cannot be used and that is a - it's a problem, a significant one to say the least.",

You can have all kinds of other diversity if you want and we have it at the University of California. Here, racial preferences have been barred since Prop 209 In the mid- 1990s. Yet today, we admitted our most racially diverse class.But what the court's opinion says is that you can't use race that our constitution is colorblind. And I have to say, I really disagree with the last guest when he was saying the court is attacking precedent. It's undermining the rule of law. Sometimes the court gets it wrong. Dred Scott was a precedent of the Supreme Court, Plessy versus Ferguson, which upheld segregation was a precedent of the court. Those were both wrong, because they deviated from the Constitution's core principle, that the government cannot take account of its citizens based on their skin color. That doesn't mean you can't take socio economic class into account, geography into account, educational background into account when you make admissions decisions. But schools and universities are now going to have to be like the rest of the government and not look at your skin color.",

So many family members are looking at this case as a way to continue the healing process.

No juror can ever be required to talk about the discussions that occurred in the jury room, except by court order. For many centuries, our society has relied upon juries for consideration of difficult cases. We have recognized for hundreds of years that a jury's deliberations, discussions and votes should remain their private affair as long as they wish it. Therefore, the law gives you a unique privilege not to speak about the jury's work. [15:25:05] Although you were at liberty to speak with anyone about your deliberations, you are also at liberty to refuse to speak to anyone and request to discuss either your verdict or your deliberations may come from those who are simply curious from those who might seek to find fault with you, from the media, from the attorneys or elsewhere, it will be up to each of you to decide whether to preserve your privacy as a juror. Ladies and gentlemen, I want to again, give me my sincere thanks for your time, effort and energy, 99 percent of the citizens that live in Broward County, a county of 2 million, have no idea what happens when you're actually selected on jury and you actually serve through the process, but now you all know. And I know most people don't say thank you, but I will say thank you because I know the time, effort and energy that went into this. I have a thank you letter and a certificate. I'm going to give that to the court deputy who's going to pass that out when they walk you out because it has your names on them. The reason I normally do this in person in the courtroom, but I'm not going to do it today is because I'm not and have not addressed you by your names that's why we use the numbers in care of your privacy. I did also want to let you all know I will be entering an order today that instructs the clerk of court, the trial court administrator as well as both parties not to disclose your names, okay? So the only way your names are going to be disclosed, is if you choose and you certainly may choose. So if you want to go out there and talk to whoever you want to talk to, you're perfectly entitled to do that. If you want to go out there and never talk to another human being about this ever again, you're perfectly entitled to do that, too. I want to emphasize that it's each of your decisions to make. But momentarily, I'm going to have you step in the back and collect your belongings, the court deputy is going to walk you out to your cars, and that's going to conclude your jury service. I do have two quick pieces of bad news for you. Number one: I'm going to need those lanyards back. So if you take them off and just put them on the ledge in front of you, we'll collect them from you. Number two: Since you actually did serve on a jury, they will not summon you for jury duty for a year, for 12 months. So I'll see you next year. Okay. All right. Unless you all have any questions for me, ladies and gentlemen, your jury service has concluded at this point.
