Kissing the ring, Ron DeSantis throws his support behind Donald Trump after the Florida governor suspends his campaign. That leaves Nikki Haley as the last candidate standing between the former president and his third Republican nomination ahead of tomorrow's New Hampshire primary.Despite growing pressure at home and from Israel's allies abroad, Benjamin Netanyahu rejects a plan from Hamas to release the remaining hostages in Gaza. And controversy over the inauguration of a new temple in India, why the event, which many Hindus will celebrate, could also be a painful reminder for the country's Muslim minority. Good to have you with us. And we begin this hour with New Hampshire's looming Republican primary now just over a day away and a major shakeup in the U.S. presidential race that leaves the GOP with just two main contenders, former President Donald Trump and Nikki Haley, who's hoping she can leverage the Granite State's moderate Republicans and independents. But Trump has consistently dominated the GOP field in polling and in Iowa's caucuses, he beat his nearest competitor, Ron DeSantis by a margin of nearly 30 points. Now Trump has the endorsement of that former rival. DeSantis announcing Sunday that he's dropping out of the race and throwing his support behind Trump. But the former president is doing fine with New Hampshire Republicans already. A new CNN poll finds him with a comfortable 13-point lead over Haley. CNN's Alayna Treene has more now on DeSantis' surprise announcement, as well as Trump's reaction to his sudden endorsement.",

I was in South Carolina. We fought for the people every day. There's a reason that you don't see the legislature lining up behind me in South Carolina. It's because I fought to get them to vote on the record. I fought to have them do ethics reform. I vetoed half a billion dollars' worth of their pork projects and then you see Congress. The reason Congress doesn't support us is I've pushed for term limits; I've pushed for mental competency tests. I've said if they don't give us a budget on time, they don't get paid. I don't get that political elite. That's what we need to be talking about not the corporate stuff that they're talking about.

I'm going to finish this so Joe Biden and Donald Trump are not an issue at all, that we actually put them in the past and we go forward because our country deserves it and Americans want it.

And the secondary part of this, with all due respect to DeSantis, who's clearly a smart guy, and he's had a lot of experience and all the rest, but he doesn't have the kind of personality that sells in politics. For one thing, you genuinely have to like people to succeed in politics. There are a few exceptions.

Look, I think the bottom line here is that it's now been almost two months since the start of that last truce combined with hostage releases, and since then we've seen the death toll in Gaza go up by more than 10,000 people. So, clearly you see domestically and internationally the pressure on Netanyahu is mounting.If anything, his response though has been to toughen his stance, certainly publicly. That's what we're seeing, not just on the issue of talks to release hostages in exchange for some kind of truce, but on the issue of what the situation in Gaza will look like after the war, reiterating over the weekend comments that he also said last week, that he doesn't see any future for a two-state solution that he thinks Israel should control. He said all the territory west of Jordan, and being very open about the fact that is at odds with the U.S. position. [02:20:00] The U.S. has been publicly pushing for a two-state solution. Netanyahu is saying that sometimes you have to even say no to some of your closest friends. So, clearly, he's setting out his store there. But behind the scenes, this \"Wall Street Journal\" reports suggests according to officials briefed on the talks that they are at least engaging in talks with Hamas, which is still being brokered of course by Qatar, the U.S. and Egypt and that those broker countries are pushing for something that could be even bigger than what we saw at the end of November, a more sustained perhaps pause in fighting in exchange for the release in some kind of phased fashion of all of the hostages. We're not close to a deal at this point. We have been in positions where elements of these talks have leaked out before many times. It doesn't necessarily mean that a deal is on the cards, but certainly this report suggests that they are at least engaging. Is Netanyahu vulnerable? Yes, I think he was vulnerable before the war and certainly he's been facing mounting pressure certainly over the last few weeks, mounting calls for -- mounting accusations, I should say, that he's not just balancing, as he says publicly, the goals of bringing the hostages home with eradicating Hamas, but also balancing his own political survival in there and of course publicly saying that he is at odds with the U.S. is also politically risky.

The trucks are carrying food, water, medical supplies and other relief assistance. Israeli officials are offering different numbers saying that 260 humanitarian aid trucks entered the enclave, which would make it the highest number of trucks in a single day since October 7th. Before the conflict, between 400 to 500 trucks entered Gaza with supplies. But regardless of the number of trucks that did get in, the need for food, medicine and other critical supplies is enormous and the death toll continues to climb. According to the Hamas-controlled health ministry in Gaza, more than 25,000 Palestinians have been killed in the enclave since the war began, the vast majority of them women and children, according to the ministry. Tens of thousands more have been wounded.
