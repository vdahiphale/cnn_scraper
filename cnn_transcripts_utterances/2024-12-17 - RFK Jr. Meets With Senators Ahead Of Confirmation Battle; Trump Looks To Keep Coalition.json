Brownstein writes this. \"Above all, the key to Trump's success among these divided voters was their discontent over the economy, and their belief that Trump would improve their financial situation. [05:35:00] Molly Murphy, a lead pollster for Harris, told me she believed voters who thought Trump would improve conditions on the issue they cared the most about -- usually inflation, but also in some cases reinforced by immigration or crime -- minimized any of these other personal or policy concerns about him. 'If they thought that Trump was going to be better on their primary concern they either forgave the other concerns or convinced themselves that' the elements of the Trump agenda they disliked 'just won't happen.'\" And Ron Brownstein joins us now with more on this.

Look, there's no question Donald Trump goes into office the second time in a much stronger position than he did the first time.I mean, it's easy to forget that the leaders of the Republican Party in Congress when he first entered were Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, both of whom were skeptical of him. The Supreme Court that was much more narrowly divided. A business community that was much more leery about being associated with him. In all those ways his position is obviously much stronger. And in some -- to some extent, rooted in the fact that this time he did win the popular vote. But I think what's very clear from looking at both the exit polls and the AP VoteCast, which are two principal surveys of what voters did on Election Day and why, Trump again won because he won support from a significant minority of voters -- a significant slice of voters who held -- still held reservations about him, whether personally or his agenda, but voted for him anyway because they thought he'd be better on the issue they cared most about, as Molly Murphy said, usually the economy. And I think, Kasie, that frames the dynamic going forward. If Trump can deliver what those voters hired him to do, which is a more stable economic situation, they may continue to look past a lot of other things that they're less enthusiastic about. But if he doesn't -- and as you know, there are a lot of economists who think his agenda is more likely to rekindle than suppress inflation -- and if he doesn't, there's plenty of doubt even among people who voted for him that could quickly come back to the surface.",

He agreed that \"if Trump overreads his mandate, he could quickly strain his support among the voters ambivalent about him, including not only the racial minorities he drew into his coalition but white-collar Republicans who reluctantly backed him because they viewed Biden and Harris as too liberal. If Trump provides his most controversial nominees, such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services and Kash Patel as the FBI -- a blank check to pursue polarizing agendas -- Ayres said, 'we are going to be looking at Joe Biden level-job approval numbers before we turn around' for Trump.\"",

After navigating a really tough schedule in the knockout rounds, you've got the Thunder meeting Milwaukee for the championship in Vegas. It's the teams' first meeting this season. And the Bucks, as you know, a veteran-laden squad full of star power. OKC, a really young team on the rise in the hunt for the number one seed in the West for a second-straight season. And do not forget about the pay day here. Each player on the winning team of the in-season tournament finale is going to earn around a half-million dollars. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
