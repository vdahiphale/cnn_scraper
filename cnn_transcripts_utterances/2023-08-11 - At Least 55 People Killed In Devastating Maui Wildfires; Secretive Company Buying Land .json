That, yes, is a staggering number, but it's expected to keep climbing. And it could climb considerably. Right now, search-and-rescue teams from California and Washington are using cadaver dogs to assist in recovery efforts that are really only just starting here. Maui's mayor says the death toll is just the number of people who have been found outside of buildings. They're waiting for FEMA, which is equipped to handle hazmat conditions, before they search inside of buildings that have been burned. The mayor was also asked if the island's famous warning siren system failed. And he called it an impossible situation. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR RICK BISSEN (I-MAUI COUNTY): So everybody happened so quickly, I can't comment on whether or not the sirens sounded or not, but I know the fires came up so quickly and they spread so fast.

A secretive company raising eyebrows after buying hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of land right next to a key Air Force base.Now the company is registered in Delaware, and according to state law, they're not required to publicly list the owners of the company.

As you said, this has been happening for quite some time now. The problem is that the land they have been purchasing is coming right up to the fence of Travis Air Force Base in California. A key base that not only is used for sustainment efforts for the Indo- Pacific, but also used to move munitions and other equipment to Poland for use in the war in Ukraine. A key Air Force base. Importantly, lawmakers don't know who is behind this company, Flannery Associates. They don't know the ownership, because that company is not required to disclose that, because it is registered in Delaware. These lawmakers, according to Representative John Garamendi and Representative Mike Thompson, they asked the FBI and the Committee of Foreign Investment in the United States to look into it. Because they were so secured about the national security implications of someone who is basically unidentifiable by the U.S. government purchasing land so close to such a key U.S. military facility. Here is what Mike Thompson told me regarding the briefings he's gotten in recent weeks and months about this. He said he's had a ton of these briefings, but still he \"doesn't know that we're any closer to figuring out who these folks are or in resolving the problems they're causing for my constitutions and, I believe, the national security of our country.\" He says that they're trying to investigate this but it's a lot harder than anyone might imagine here. We should not that Flannery's attorneys did not return CNN's request for comments. They previously told another media outlet that they're investors are about 97 percent American with the other 3 percent being British and Irish. However, the lawmakers I spoke to and other officials said they could not actually verify that. So for now, it remains a mystery. But with the Treasury Department looking into this, they do have the power to subpoena the company. It's unclear if they have taken the step. But if it came to it and if they did see this as a national security threat, then they could potentially unwind the transaction or prevent this company from purchasing further land near the base and in the area -- Alex?",

Russia is now in a race with India to see who could reach the lunar south police first. With a target landing date of August 23rd. While India's first attempt in 2019, that one ended with a crash. Also, TV and movie writers and the studios they are striking against are going back to the negotiating table for the first time since talks collapsed. That was back in May. The writers deal pushing for changes in pay for streaming shows. They're also calling for new standards on the number of writers assigned to each show, and strong limits on the use of artificial intelligence. And the semifinals taking shape for the women's World Cup. Sweden, which is the team that knocked out the U.S. from the round of 16, Sweden reaching the semis after beating the favorites, Japan. That score, 2:1. They'll be facing off with Spain after the spaniards beat the Netherlands in extra time.

Typically, it affects people over the age of 68. It can lead to movement problems, difficulty walking and talking. What was really known is there was an association between extreme contact sports like boxing and Parkinson's disease. What the researchers sought to find out here is whether that association was also true for football. So they looked at this study of more than 1,800 male participants and 700 of whom had played football, either at the youth level, high school, college or even professionally. What they found is that people who had played football had a 61 percent higher risk of reportings of Parkinson's diagnosis or Parkinson-ism, which is the movement or tremors that can make movement difficult. So that was a pretty significant finding in this study -- Brianna?",

Playing at a higher level, like college or professionally, made you three times more likely than having played at the youth or high school level. Which makes sense. The longer you play, the more intense the play is, it probably makes sense to increase that risk when you have the repeated head injuries.",
