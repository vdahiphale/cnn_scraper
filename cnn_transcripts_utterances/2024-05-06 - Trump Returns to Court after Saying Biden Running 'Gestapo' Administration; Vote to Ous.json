He told Republican donors that President Biden is running a, quote, \"Gestapo administration,\" end quote, while falsely claiming that the White House is behind all of his criminal prosecutions. This is, of course, not the first time that Trump has used Nazi rhetoric in the campaign. And the Biden team wasted little time in responding. They said, quote, \"Trump is once again making despicable and insulting comments about the Holocaust while in the same breath attacking law enforcement, celebrating political violence, and threatening our democracy.\" All right. Our panel's here: former federal prosecutor Elliot Williams; Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell; and Matt Gorman, who is former senior adviser to Tim Scotts presidential campaign. Welcome all. Thank you for being here. Congresswoman, let me start with you on these comments from Trump, where he called -- he said that the Biden administration was using Gestapo tactics. We were just talking about how high emotions are running in other areas of our country. But this kind of language, it's not the first time Donald Trump has used it. What -- what are the ramifications of Trump talking like this? REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D-MI): Well, this is how Donald Trump talks about many things, and I think it's just contributing to a whole culture right now of the kind of way we're treating each other. A culture of hate, a culture of pettiness against each other. And I'm very concerned about what is happening out in our communities and people being pitted against each other. And I do believe that former President Trump fans the flames of it.",

It's just -- it's just -- there's just no place for it. But again, we're -- yesterday on the Internet on Twitter, I think \"idiot\" and \"liar\" were trending terms, right?
