      "sentences": "New today, Secretary of State Tony Blinken has spoken with China's foreign minister and now an in-person meeting is set.The top U.S. diplomat will be traveling to Beijing this weekend in the hopes of tamping down a recent spike in tensions between the two countries. The trip was originally scheduled for this past February but it was rescheduled because of that Chinese spy balloon incident. And that's just one of the close encounters that has ratcheted up the friction here. In May, the Pentagon says a Chinese jet -- you see it here in this video -- made a, quote, \"unnecessarily aggressive maneuver\" of a U.S. spy plane over the South China Sea. Earlier this month, two warships nearly collided in the Taiwan Strait. Pretty amazing. All of this captured on camera. We have CNN's senior national security correspondent, Alex Marquardt, joining us now. Too many things going on. I'm pointing all over the place here. Alex, you are right there, though, so thank you for being with us. How important is this trip now that it's finally happening?",

      "sentences": "Probably not much. The fact of the matter is, Brianna, both countries spend an extraordinary amount of time, of focus, of money trying to spy on each other in all kinds of different ways, from satellites, from planes, human -- what they call human -- so human spies if they possibly can.So this is really a spy versus spy. I mean, we have U.S. ships and planes off the coast of China all the time. That's what China is really getting so angry about. We do know that the Chinese have been spying on the U.S. from Cuba for years. The Biden administration initially rejected or said that the reporting that we and others had last week was incorrect, that China is going to be putting a new facility -- wants to put a new facility in Cuba. But then over the weekend, the administration kind of walked that back, saying, in fact, China has been spying on the U.S. for years from Cuba, but it was an issue that they inherited, they said. It certainly appeared that the administration was not trying to build this up into a major issue before this visit by the secretary of state.",

The Southern Baptist Convention voted to approval that just a few hours ago, saying their use of female pastors goes against the convention's, quote, \"interpretation of Biblical scripture.\" Also, major progress taking place in Philadelphia. Governor Josh Shapiro says the demolition of the collapsed portion of Interstate 95 will be finished tomorrow. This is going to allow travelers to drive over parts of both the north and southbound lanes. All officials want to build a permanent bridge. The secretary said the bridge was structurally sound Sunday morning before a fiery crash led to the collapse. And a California school superintendent is now fired, according to CNN affiliate, KABC, following outrage from teachers and parents over the school board's decision to block a Social Studies lesson that mentions gay rights leader, Harvey Milk. Board officials voted against the curriculum claiming sexually inappropriate content. The board's president even making a controversial claim calling Harvey Milk a, quote, \"pedophile.\" Brianna? KEILAR: An Olympic medalist, a world champion sprinter, Tori Bowie, was a force of nature on the track field. But at the age of 32 and while eight months pregnant, she went into childbirth at home and died alone. Bowie's death was ruled natural. And the report stated there had been possible complications, including respiratory distress and eclampsia. Sadly, her story is not unique. A 2022 study found women in the U.S. face the highest rates of preventable maternal mortality when compared with women in 10 other wealthy nations, 198 deaths per 100,000 patients. That same study found that it's much worse for black women in America. Their maternal death rates are nearly three times as high as those of white women. Joining us with more on this, we have Dr. Suzanne Gilberg-Lenz, who is an OB/GYN in Los Angeles. Doctor, thank you so much for joining us. I do want to start with pre-eclampsia. And I want to add because I know people will be curious that the baby did not survive as well in this. This is a tragic story when we are talking about this woman and this athlete. Can you explain why this condition is so dangerous to the mother and clearly here the child as well? DR. SUZANNE GILBERG-LENZ, OB-GYN: Well, I mean, anything that's going to be dangerous to the mother is going to be dangerous to a fetus.",

      "sentences": "Speak to that. Speak to that about preeclampsia, why we're seeing the racial disparities there. And why we are, overall -- the other factors that are contributing to the racial disparities in these maternal mortality rates.GILBERG-LENZ: Well, there's two -- there's the science, OK? There's the science, right? So we know -- first of all, like I said, preeclampsia about 5 percent to 8 percent of pregnancies can result in preeclampsia and we know very well how to treat that. When people are getting proper care and they have access to care and they are taken seriously, they shouldn't get eclampsia. They should get preeclampsia and be delivered basically, OK? So there is the science. We do know that black women have 60 percent higher rates of preeclampsia, but, again, this is treatable. This should be treatable. So what is the issue? This is a great question. And we are struggling with this question and we are struggling more importantly with solutions. But if you look at the data on just how the disparities that black people and black women specifically are subjected to, even in emergency room care, it takes longer for them to get seen. They have fewer rates of admission from the emergency room. Their complaints of pain are not taken as seriously. And consequently, a normal human reaction would be, well, I'm not taken seriously, I'm not going to go get care. There are so many levels of problem here. I wish I had the solution. I don't have the solution. I will say that having doctors that look like their patients is super important. We do not have enough people of color. We do not have enough black doctors. And that makes a difference. We know outcomes are different when we look like our doctors. This happens with women across the board also, by the way. I'm not here to disparage white male doctors. I have partners that are wonderful humans and doctors that are white men. However, we know that data shows us, demonstrates -- and I do have to say as a white female physician, if we don't take personal accountability, if every person who is a health care provider doesn't take accountability and say, what is my unconscious bias here? Let me overdo it. Let me over-attend to my patients that I know have worse outcomes. And let me look at what I can be doing differently. This is not going to get better. The organizations are trying to address it. But my experience in medicine over 26 years has been that the gross-roots demands are always what makes us change. I'm so personally and professionally upset about this. So I can spit the science at you and tell you my philosophy and my experience. It's converging in the most horrific of ways in this loss. Two human beings. Terrible.",

You know, not classic Beatles stuff.Apparently, the process is the same one or similar one to the one they used in the \"Get Back\" film where voices that were muddled together or obscured by noises or stuff like that, they were able to extract basically in terms of audio and isolate them so you can hear them. So it's probably just a muffled demo recording that they've improved quite a bit. As for the song, none of us know, except for Paul himself and whoever else is involved.",

It's -- it doesn't sound real, I suppose, in a certain sense. How much do we really care about that? So many recordings now are drastically treated and don't sound real already.
