He said that most of his associates, including back home, were from Texas.And the Team Trump was excited until the judge has put together a very detailed, very -- the most I've seen in over 30 years of practicing law, very incisive, until we got to the question about might you be biased?

And you know, again, they're saying they want $1,000 fine for every post. They want Trump to be ordered to take down the post. And they want him to be warned that if he violates it again, he could face not just fines, but also up to 30 days incarceration. So, 30 days in jail. They want the judge to make that. Now, Trump's team has said they don't think he violated the gag order. That he was just -- he wasn't looking to criticize Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels, two key witnesses, and that's why they are protected in this case because they are expected to testify. But saying that they were making comments about Trump. Trump was responding to that.

We know he's willing to go up to the First Department, the appellate court that oversees. He went three times last week. So, the judge is being very careful. I think Trump has a good faith argument that is not a frivolous defense. That, hey, if people are going to talk about me. I need to be able to defend myself. We're in the middle of a presidential campaign for crying out loud. I do think the judge is going to warn him, don't do it again. Do not talk about witnesses in this case.

And then (c)(2) would only pick up conduct that obstructs an official proceeding in a different way.So, there's no duplication or superfluity on our reading.

(C)(2) does so with respect to all other conduct that in a different manner does that.And I think that this has to be the road the court goes down to look at what Congress actually prescribed with respect to similarity. Because in contrast, if you take up petitioner's invitation to come up with some, A, textual gloss from (c)(2) to port over into (c)(2), I don't understand what the court could look at to guide its determination of exactly what the relevant similarity would be. JOHN ROBERTS, U.S. SUPREME COURT CHIEF JUSTICE:  General, I'm sure you've had a chance to read our opinion released Friday in the Bissonnette (ph) case with -- it was unanimous, it was very short.

You know, and it -- what it said is that specific terms, a more general catch all, if you will, term at the end, and it said that the general phrase is controlled and defined by reference to the terms that precede it. The otherwise phrase is more general, and the terms that precede it are alters, destroys, mutilates, or can -- and seals a record and document. And applying the doctrine, as was set forth in that opinion, the specific terms, alters, destroy, and mutilate carry forward into two, and the terms record document or other object carried -- carry forward into two as well.

You know, these are separate prohibitions that have their own complex, non-parallel internal structure.And I think actually, the best evidence that it's hard to figure out how you would define a degree of similarity between them just by based on the word otherwise is that the -- there are multiple competing interpretations at issue in this case.
