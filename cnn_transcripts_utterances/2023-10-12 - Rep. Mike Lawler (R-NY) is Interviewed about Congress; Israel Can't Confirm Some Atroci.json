We're going to play a little bit of sound, some different moments of him. He's criticizing Netanyahu for some action he took years ago when the U.S. hit Iran, but also talking about preparedness and some other things here. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: I'll never forget that Bibi Netanyahu let us down. That was a very terrible thing. I will say that. When I see sometimes the intelligence, you talk about the intelligence, or you talk about some of the things that went wrong over the last week, they've got to straighten it out because they're fighting potentially a very big force. And they said, gee, I hope Hezbollah doesn't attack from the north because that's the most vulnerable spot. I said, wait a minute, you know, Hezbollah's very smart. They're all very smart.

They are at war with a terrorist organization. Hamas, backed and funded by Iran, is hell bent on wiping Israel off the face of the earth. And we need to do everything we can to support Israel, to make sure that they eliminate Hamas, period. And if Hezbollah, or any other bad actor, wants to get engaged in this war, they will regret that. And I think it is imperative that we speak with one voice, united in our support for Israel, for the Israeli people, and that we make sure we are doing everything we can to get American citizens home. Right now you have over 20 Americans that were killed, you have thousands of Americans that are seeking to get out of Israel and come back to the United States right now. I have hundreds of constituents of my own. I've been arguing with the White House for days about the need to get military planes in to help evacuate American citizens. There is a lot to deal with.
