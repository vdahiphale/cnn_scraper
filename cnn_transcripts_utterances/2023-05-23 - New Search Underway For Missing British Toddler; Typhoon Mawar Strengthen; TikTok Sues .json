Well, a much-anticipated meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has come and gone with still no deal on raising the U.S. debt ceiling. Both the president and McCarthy said Monday's talks were productive. But it does nothing for a looming default, which could happen in just a matter of days. McCarthy was adamant they need to strike a deal this week in order to avoid the June 1st deadline when the U.S. could potentially default on its debt.U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has been a constant reminder of the urgency of the matter. In a letter to Congress, she informed lawmakers another week of data and negotiations have done nothing to change the situation. Here's what Speaker McCarthy had to say about the meeting. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): I felt we had a productive discussion. We don't have an agreement yet. But I did feel the discussion was productive in areas that we have differences of opinion. I believe we can still get done. I believe we can get it done. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But no specifics in terms of what kind of progress was actually achieved during a meeting that lasted more than an hour in the Oval Office on Monday.In fact, both sides are clearly still very far apart on some of the major points of discussion here in terms of the spending caps, for example. How long and at what level will those spending caps be set, both sides so far appear to be very far apart. And I also got to ask the Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy about something that President Biden raised at the beginning of that meeting and that is that the President wants revenue increases to be on the table, closing tax loopholes for example. I asked the speaker if that's on the table for him, the speaker was very direct. And he said no, that is off the table for him in terms of discussions. He wants to cut spending. And that's where he thinks the focus should be. He also said that cuts to defense spending are off the table. Something that the White House had also raised. And so, it's clear that there's still a very big gulf between these two sides. Nonetheless, the speaker saying that the tenor of the meeting was more productive and more conducive to reaching an agreement that at any point in the discussions that we've seen over these last three weeks. But the clock is clearly ticking. And the Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday reiterating her assessments that the United States default would likely come in early June. She says \"We estimate that it is highly likely the Treasury will no longer be able to satisfy all of the government's obligations if Congress has not acted to raise or suspend the limit -- the debt limit by early June and potentially as early as June 1st.\" The Secretary said in the letter last week to congressional leaders that she viewed that timeline as likely. So, moving that confidence level up to highly likely only increasing the pressure on the White House and those Republican lawmakers were negotiating this deal to actually get there.
