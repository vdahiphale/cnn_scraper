His name is Mark Muffley and he was flying, Anderson from the Lehigh Valley Airport, which is in Northeastern Pennsylvania on a flight to Orlando.According to the FBI, he checked the bag in the routine screening that was happening by the TSA. They found explosives in this check bag. According to the FBI, this is what they found. They found powder that was in a plastic wrap, they found fuses. The powder appears to be from commercial grade fireworks.   And so the question is, you know, what was he doing with this? The airport tried to page him while he was still at the airport, he left and he was later arrested later that evening on Monday by the FBI. Now, the Court documents that were released today by the US Attorney in Philadelphia don't mention any indication of extremism or his ties to terrorist groups or anything like that. This is something that obviously the FBI was focused on over the last couple of days. Nothing like that appears to have emerged in that investigation. But Anderson, you know, this is a very serious thing. Obviously, if you read the Court documents, the FBI says that this powder that was included in this compound was susceptible to ignite from heat and friction and pose a significant risk to the aircraft and passengers.",

No indications of any leanings or connections to domestic terrorist groups, White supremacist, Neo Nazis any of that stuff.Every indication, Anderson from the local police, we know Mr. Muffley very well from multiple contacts over the years that he is just a local guy who was going to Florida and taking stuff he shouldn't have. So this stuff is packed in wax paper wrapped in plastic. It's flash powder mixed with black powder that you would put in a mortar shell. So it looks like a mortar shell for fireworks, commercial grade fireworks, it was deconstructed. He took the insides and the fuse which is a quick match and a safety fuse. Does it mean he was going to bring it to Florida and set it off somewhere with his pals? There's also a pipe in there with residue in the bottom indicating possible narcotics that they're further examining and testing. It does not appear that it was set to go off on the airplane, but let's put all that aside. Let's say that this was the ultimate terrorist and that it was rigged to explode on the plane.

You know, it's not a high explosive, like TATP or something that we see foreign terrorists use. But it can be a very, very effective and very lethal weapon if used in the right way. It's the way the Tsarnaev brothers armed their pressure cookers that they set off at the finish line of the Boston Marathon.So this is a very serious matter. And you know, as John is absolutely right, it's also a great test of the system. If there can be a good side to somebody trying to smuggle an explosive device on a plane, I guess the good news story here is not only the technology worked, as John mentioned, the machinery that we have in place to find these sorts of residues alerted the personnel, but the people worked. Like you know, their diligent observation of those machines and their signals and you know, the warnings that they get are actually followed up on. In this case also, you have an individual who tried to get a bag on a plane and may have tried to just put the bag in the plane without actually traveling and there is a system in place to look for those sorts of discrepancies as well. So every place where this gentleman could have gotten caught at the airport in the airport process seems to have stood up and worked as intended, which is definitely a good sign.",

There was no altimeter device, there was no timing device. And there was no trigger device. Sometimes it'll link to cell phones or other things. So there wasn't a device that could set them off. However, that's not to diminish the fact that anything explosive or flammable in the luggage could be extremely dangerous in the cargo hold and could bring down the plane.

There is a website that has been created here in Ukraine, Children of War, that is updated daily as parents reach out, put pictures of their missing children up in the hope that somehow they can be found. This is extraordinarily difficult. Getting to the other side of that border, finding the children to begin with in these camps. And bear in mind, Anderson, that a lot of these parents, they are the children that got lost in the fog of war, found themselves on the wrong side of the border, got sent to the camps or put up for adoption. There are also the children who were sent by Ukrainian parents from the occupied territories as the Russians came in, in good faith. They were encouraged to do so because this was a two-week free holiday by the sea sometimes, where the camps are in Crimea. They were encouraged to go by their teachers, their classmates were going. Parents thought they were doing their children a favor, sent them off to these camps, and haven't heard from them since or if they have been lucky enough to hear from them, haven't been able to get them back. Once they are there and we know a bit about what goes on in them, not just from what the parents who get to speak to their children sometimes, but also because Russia makes no secret of this, Anderson. They publicize these videos showing what goes on in these camps. So the kind of activities you would expect in a normal summer camp, but also Russian language lessons.
