And it was a rather testy conversation in which the Chinese Foreign Minister said to show respect. That's what the United States needs to do, show respect to China and to also stay out of China's internal affairs. So obviously they have a lot to discuss, but really the aim of this is to reopen dialogue. We just received a tweet a short time ago from a spokesperson from China's Foreign Affairs Ministry. Let me read it to you. This is from Hua Chunying. She says, hope this meeting can steer China-U.S. relations back to what the two presidents agreed upon in Bali. She of course, is referring to the Summit in Bali, the G20 in November of last year, where the two presidents, they met for more than three hours and basically discussed the importance of continuing the conversation. And that was meant to be Antony Blinken traveling to Beijing back in February. But then of course, there was the Chinese spy balloon that flew over U.S. airspace. So that was postponed abruptly. So as I say, Kim, this is about reestablishing ties, reestablishing relations, and hoping that this may lead to the Treasury Secretary, the Commerce Secretary for the United States visiting China, and then of course, maybe Biden and Xi meeting in the next few months.

They've created synthetic human embryo-like structures from stem cells that are more advanced than any similar structures made so far.Now, what they created doesn't have a beating heart or even a brain, but they raise troubling legal and ethical questions. Scientists say these embryo models could someday improve our understanding of genetic diseases or what causes miscarriages. The embryolike structures are confined to test tubes. Implanting them in a womb would be illegal. For more on this, I'm joined by David Magnus, the Director of the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics. Thank you so much for being here with us. So researchers are generally not allowed to grow human embryos for more than 14 days. So from an ethical point of view, what's the difference between growing a human embryo and growing a human embryo model? DAVID MAGNUS, DIRECTOR. STANFORD CENTER FOR BIOMEDICAL ETHICS: Yeah, so that's actually a tough question to answer, and in a way, we don't really know the answer yet. Scientists are trying to find ways of better understanding the process of development and the current 14-day limits that are mostly self-imposed by the research community, although there are some regulations that impose those limits as well, in some jurisdictions, make it hard to really fully study development. And so there are these efforts to try and create these embryolike structures. This is the first one that's gone much past the blastocyst stage in the last year or two. There were some induced blastomeres things that were able to get actually out to not quite as far as this, but that were not created from embryonic stem cells. And all of these are trying to create things that they think will avoid those problems. The challenge is, we don't really know what to call these things or how to think about these things from either an ethical or regulatory point of view. Insofar as they can't turn into humans. They probably are morally not fully morally -- they don't have the full moral status that embryos do if they don't have the ability to develop ever into humans. And then the question also becomes from a regulatory point of view how do the regulations see them. But the downside is the more they can't develop the less they are like embryos the less valuable they are from a research point of view.",

But as people called out even a couple of years ago when the eyeblasts (ph) were created, we need to really start changing the regulations and start thinking a little bit more broadly about how we capture and think about these kinds of new types of entities that are being created so that we have a systematic framework for asking questions about how organized are they?

There were some record setting, scores the first couple of days, but now the Los Angeles country club is starting to show. That typical U.S. Open drama.The shot of the day from Saturday come from last year's runner up in world number one, Scottie Scheffler. He was six back of the lead on the 17th. Not anymore, 197 yards out, Kim, Scheffler holding out for Eagle. Oh, my goodness. He followed that up with a birdie on 18. And all of a sudden, the 2021 Masters champ is right in it just three back heading into Sunday's action. There is a tie for the lead. Two guys seeking their first major title. Southern California kid,           Rickie Fowler set the two-day scoring record and he drains a 69-foot putt here on 13 for birdie. That put him at 11 under. But he did come back down to earth. He finished with a bogey on 18 for an even par on the day. And that left the door open for Wyndham Clark. Watch the club spin here. That's when you know it was a good shot. Unchartered territory for the 29-year-old from Denver. In six career major appearances, Clark has missed the cut four times and never finished better than 75th. But he sinks the birdie there on 18th to take a share of the lead headed into Sunday. Keep an eye on Rory McIlroy, though. He's just one shot back as he tries to snag his first major in almost a decade. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RORY MCILROY, 4-TIME MAJOR CHAMPION: It's been such a long time since I've done it. I -- you know, I'm going out there to try to execute a game plan, and I feel like over the last three days, I've executed that game plan really, really well. You know, I just need to do that for one more day. SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER, 2021 MASTERS CHAMPION: You're nervous whether or not you're leading or chasing. You know, I want to win the golf tournament, and it doesn't matter what tournament it is. I'm showing up, and I want to play good and I want to win. RICKIE FOWLER, SEEKING 1ST CAREER MAJOR WIN: I would say this week, this is the best I felt, all year, and definitely in a long time. I'm not scared to fail. I've dealt with that. So we're just going to go have fun, continue to try and execute, leave it all out there, and see where we stand on 18. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE: All right, a special moment after the Phoenix Mercury's game in Washington, D.C. This weekend, WNBA Star Brittney Griner meeting with national security officials who helped secure her release from a Russian prison last December. The meet and greet with U.S. State Department and National Security Council members also included other families of wrongfully detained Americans. The iconic Las Vegas strip shutting down for the Stanley Cup champion Vegas Golden Knights and 200,000 of their closest friends. Vegas winning in just their 6th Season. That's faster than any NHL expansion team ever. The celebration in Las Vegas went exactly how you think it might go. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
