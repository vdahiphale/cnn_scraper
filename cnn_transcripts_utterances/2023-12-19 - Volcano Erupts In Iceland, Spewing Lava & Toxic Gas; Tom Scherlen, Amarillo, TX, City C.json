Also, potentially, very dangerous as well!These are dramatic overnight pictures showing the orange glow created by the lava's flow. The molten rock is now pushing through a crack that's about two miles long. You can see aerial footage of it here. Officials say the size of the eruption is starting to diminish. Fortunately, it does not appear to be life-threatening. Nearby residents had already been evacuated weeks ago because of seismic activity. They are urged to stay away because of toxic gases. We want to discuss with Jess Phoenix. She is a volcanologist and geologist, also executive director and co-founder of Blueprint Earth. Jess, thank you so much for being with us. What do you think when you see these images? Fortunately, it is not life-threatening. Is there anything that might change the path of the lava flow? JESS PHOENIX, VOLCANOLOGIST/GEOLOGIST: Boris, it is kind of an old adage in volcanology circles that the only constant is change. That is because volcanoes are not predictable. We know what they have done in the past by looking at previous lava flows that are still -- they have hardened, they've solidified, cooled over a millennium. We get an idea of what a particular volcano has done. That might help us get an idea of what is to come. But it is not 100 percent certain. This volcano is known for less violent eruptions. I know the lava fountains probably got everybody excited because they are very dramatic to see. But this volcano does not produce the big ash clouds, like when the other volcano in Iceland erupted in 2010. We are not likely to see disruptions to air traffic. The biggest threat is actually to property. Because people have been evacuated. That is excellent news.",

They are one of the biggest threats to people in the immediate area because they are largely acid gases, so hydrogen boride, hydrogen sulfide, et cetera. You do not want to breathe those.In fact, when volcanologists go to work opposed to active lava flows, we wear respirators, like professional respirators, not your N-95s. So those gases are very unhealthy to breathe. The sting your eyes. They sting all your mucous membranes in your nose and your throat. And likely, the amount of gas being produced is not going to affect anyone, unless they are right up close, which they shouldn't be there. Hopefully, the gases won't be an issue with this eruption. Honestly, if this one stays the way it is, that is the best-case scenario.",

That workforce, chronically understaffed by about 3,000 controllers. And as a result, controllers are often working mandatory overtime. Here is where that becomes a problem. Back in February, a FedEx flight landing in Austin came within 100 feet of hitting a departing Southwest Airlines flight. That incident took place in dense fog before dawn. The air traffic controller in the tower told investigators he had been working a six-day week of 10-hour shifts. FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker told the FAA exclusively, this is a tough lifestyle, and that this panel intends to identify risks of the job. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
