Right now life is back to normal in Nigeria and back to the regular inconveniences of living in this country, such as what you see here -- a line around people queuing up for cash. This has been a problem for the last couple of weeks after Nigeria redesigned some Naira notes and demonetized all the currencies. It led to a huge cash shortage like what you see here.And these are some of the things that people are trying to change in the country. They saw promise in the youngish man, Peter Obi, who governors young people to register to vote. He came in third. The winner of the election is Bola Ahmed Tinubu who is from the ruling party, and he reached out to his contestants -- listen.

Bola Tinubu led with only nine percent of the registered eligible voters in this country and when you compare it to the country as a whole -- 230 million people -- he was elected by only four percent of Nigerians. So it will be a difficult mandate for him to convince the whole country that he is the man to lead them. And we should hear what happens in the next few days and few weeks.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  The hulking armored mine-clearer lurches into an open field. Over 40 tons, it spews exhaust, its tracks struggling across the muddy ground. Following close behind, the mine-clearance team called sappers. They advance deliberately on the hunt for deadly explosives. This is delicate work. MARQUARDT (on camera):  This was a Russian position, Russian trenches. And now these guys are working through here carefully, methodically looking for mines, for booby traps, and even Ukrainian ordnance -- those fired at the Russians who were here. MARQUARDT (voice-over):  Last September, a Ukrainian counteroffensive pushed the Russians out of these trenches. Now, Col. Maksim Melnyk's team has been charged with clearing any explosives.",

Britain produces a fraction of the food it consumes relying instead on overseas imports.
