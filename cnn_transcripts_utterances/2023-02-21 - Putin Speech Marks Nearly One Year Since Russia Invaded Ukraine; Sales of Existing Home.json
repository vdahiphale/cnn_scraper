He also announced that Russia would officially suspend its participation in the new START nuclear weapons treaty, as it is known. The State Department said last month Russia was already not in compliance. The question is what this means going forward. Will Russia perhaps break the limit on nuclear warheads set by that treaty?We begin this hour in Warsaw where President Biden will speak in the next hour. CNN Chief White House Correspondent Phil Mattingly is there, CNN Senior International Correspondent Sam Kiley, he is in Kharkiv, Ukraine. Phil, first, you there, the White House deliberately saying this will not be a response to Putin's speech. What is the president's message?",

And if anything else, well, White House officials very closely watched what President Putin detailed this morning, that hour and 45-minute speech. Their primary takeaway was something they were very cognizant of before the speech even started, and that is there no near-term endgame right now, there's no sense that Russia is moving off the line or President Putin is moving off the line it has maintained now for more than 365 days.And that drives at the importance of what President Biden will be trying to do today here in Warsaw just days away from the one-year marker of this Russian invasion to try and underscore the importance of what has transpired over the course of the last year and what is necessary in the year ahead. And driving all of that has been kind of the central theory of the case President Biden has had since before this invasion began, and that is the importance of the coalition put together despite the divergent equities both domestic and geopolitically. The 30-plus countries have been able to come together, whether or sanctions, whether on economic aid, whether on significant more than $30 billion on the U.S. side defense assistance and try and underscore the point that only has that been extraordinarily critical in the last year but it is an absolutely essential element of the year and perhaps further along in the year ahead. Perhaps more than anything else, though, Jim, the president wants to broaden this out. If yesterday was a dramatic, symbolic moment, really kind of characterized for full effect on the ground in Kyiv, this is a moment to step back and try and drive at the fact that this is a bigger picture issue than just two countries or the U.S. and Russia, the U.S. and its assistance of Ukraine, but instead an inflection point that the president wants to underscore is critical to drive this going forward, understanding that the durability of that coalition, the durability and resiliency of the Ukrainian people has been critical over the last year, but it is even more essential in the months ahead, guys.",

IAN GARNER, HISTORIAN:  I mean, it's so thoroughly what was expected that it almost could have been the speech that Putin gave last year when he declared at the beginning of the special military operation. There was really nothing. It was a sort of wheel out of the greatest hits, that is that Russia is at war with the west, that it is engaged in this great civilizational conflict, that the war is not really about Ukraine at all, it is about the survival of the nation, that the west is somehow the blame and Ukrainian Nazi is how to somehow to blame for unimagined, of course, genocide that's happening in east of Ukraine.",

He, in fact, will be giving a speech from a frontline state, Poland, and we are working with our NATO allies as the arsenal of democracy to help the Ukrainians regain their sovereignty.It is very important, I believe, for President Biden to continue the focus on Ukrainian sovereignty. As he had mentioned, Russia wants to make this all about an existential western threat to it, and therefore, it is all about Russian sovereignty for Putin, while you know, we all know, those of us who followed this closely understand that this is about Ukrainian sovereignty. And I believe President Biden will continue that focus. It is not in his interest to play Putin's game by making this Washington versus Moscow.

So, home prices have slowed their red hot advance, but they have not really turned lower on average. Of course, real estate is very local, right? So, out west, you saw home prices fall in some of those markets, but pretty much everywhere else, especially in the northeast, home prices staying firm here. Now, one thing we're watching are mortgage rates, mortgage rates at 6.32 percent two weeks in a row here.

But Google says it should not be able to be sued because of section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which is a federal law which protects the right of the websites to moderate their content that's on their platforms as they see fit. A ruling against Google could have really significant effects that just doesn't just apply to YouTube but potentially to other web sites affecting how they could face lawsuits, about how they rank or present content, and it would potentially transform the internet, because even things like upvoting or user contents on a website could be construed as recommendations that might open up a website up to legal action.
