CNN's Rosa Flores has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  As border authorities near a breaking point from the weekslong migrant surge, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas meet with Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in Mexico City to discuss ways to drive down the unprecedented number of illegal migrant crossings. The seven-day average earlier this month, 9,600. Blinken and Mayorkas are expected to ask Mexico to move migrants south, control railways that are used by migrants to move north, and provide migrants incentives to stay in Mexico, like visas. In Eagle Pass, Texas, although migrant apprehensions dropped from about 3,000 daily encounters last week to about 2,000 Monday, according to a law enforcement source, one of two international bridges are still closed to vehicle traffic to redirect personnel to process migrants. The wait time to cross by car Wednesday afternoon an astounding 15 hours. Many Americans who frequently drive back and forth are opting to cross on foot, like (INAUDIBLE).",

They say they've had progress but still no final agreement. But then you've got the House. You've got a slim Republican majority. They want to get something done but there are hardliners that could derail something that has a lot of widespread Republican support, which means the president would have to depend on at least some Democrats to support the plan. But then, Democrats will say well, if you need us to support the plan you can't give Republicans everything they want. You've got to give some things that we want. You've got to pull it back some. And that's -- again, presidents before Biden have not been able to thread that needle.

The problem with that is it goes against her reputation as someone who is a straight talker. She says what she thinks. And it's going to distract now from the story that the Haley campaign would like to tell -- that she's surging in New Hampshire and she is a real threat to Donald Trump. I think we're going to hear her defenders talk about how she was the South Carolina governor who was instrumental in lowering the Confederate flag after that mass shooting in Charleston back in 2015 I think it was. That did follow a long period of equivocating on this issue, which clearly has been a very sensitive one, especially in her home state of South Carolina. This is, I guess, something we're going to hear going into the South Carolina primary where if she wins against Trump in New Hampshire that could end up being a final showdown with the former president in the Republican nominating race.",

Haley's critics in the party and outside the party, as you saw from President Joe Biden -- they're going to seize upon this as what they say is an example of political opportunism -- which is, according to her critics, a running theme throughout her political career.On the question of whether it will hurt her, it seems unlikely in the broader Republican primary, especially in a place like South Carolina, to do her damage in a party that has gone a long way to the right in recent years. We've heard all sorts of controversy about Donald Trump's attitude towards race and his use of that issue. In somewhere like New Hampshire, however, where Haley is probably trying to attract some Independents and even Democratic voters who want to vote in the Republican primary to oppose Trump, it could be a more serious issue in that particular race in that particular context.
