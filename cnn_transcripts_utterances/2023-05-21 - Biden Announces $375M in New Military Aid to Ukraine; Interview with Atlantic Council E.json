You've been following all of this for a few days now. You know, diplomatically, look, it was hard to miss that this G7 was a big win for Zelenskyy, but then, juxtapose that, right, with Russia's news on Bakhmut in the last day, it was sobering, right?

Basically, making the point, they're never going to be able to completely sever themselves from Beijing, but they can try and remove these potential national security risks, things like supply chains, things like sending semiconductors to China that maybe used against those countries.And so, we did see them yesterday, the G7, come out with a statement that, at least, tried to put forward the appearance of common ground when it comes to these economic issues, vis-a-vis China. And so, I think on that front, they do seem like they are collectively getting on the same page. The place where they don't seem as coherent and cohesive is on the security front. You know, Taiwan is a major issue that has been a rising threat in this region. The leaders, particularly in Europe, and you've heard this from French President Emmanuel Macron, don't necessarily want to go alongside the United States in the event of a potential Chinese invasion. So, that remains something of a difference. But it is striking. It was only two years ago that China first came up with the G7 at all. It really wasn't a topic of discussion for this particular block for decades before that.

From the Ukrainian side, it is much more complicated than that.I should also point that this is not the first time the head of the Wagner Group has claimed victory in Bakhmut. It was just in April that he said that, at least in legal terms, Bakhmut has been taken. The enemy is concentrated in the western districts. And right now, that seems to be what Ukrainians continue to say. The deputy defense minister said that the Ukrainians still maintained a toehold in far western edge of Bakhmut. And as you pointed out in the operational update from the military that we got this morning, they say that battles for the City of Bakhmut continue. No one here is disputing though that the Russians, led by Wagner, at least in the city, have made their way through the majority of the town. What is not clear is whether the Ukrainians hold any part of it at all. President Zelenskyy, while he was sitting down with President Biden at the G7 summit in Japan, was asked whether or not the Ukrainians are still in control of Bakhmut.

And Zelenskyy in his approach in Japan seems to be using a tried-and-true method that the Ukrainians have had success with, which is to get one western ally to commit to something and then, hope that the rest will follow. It happened with tanks, it happened with long-range missiles, it happened air defense systems, and now, they are hoping that it will happen with F-16 fighter jets as well. The British minister, Rishi Sunak, says the training on the F-16s for Ukrainian pilots will begin this summer in the U.K. He's already made clear that, along with the Netherlands, the U.K. wants to form an international coalition to try to figure out how to procure these planes for Ukraine.

U.S. President Joe Biden made the announcement as he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the final hours of the G7 summit in Hirosima, Japan. It also follows a deal to train Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 fighter jets. That was welcome news for Mr. Zelenskyy who has been asking for fighter jets for the past year. Have a listen.

Mr. Biden says he'll be talking with House Speaker McCarthy about it in the coming hours hoping to break an impasse in the negotiations.

And at the moment, none of the polls have indicated that any parties are anywhere near that.New Democracy, the governing and the ruling party, is in the lead, the center right party under Prime Minister Mitsotakis. But at the moment, the best we've seen in the polls is about 35, even 37 percent, but not higher. Greeks are fully aware of that, and what we expect to see is people, as a result, maybe giving their vote to smaller parties, protest votes. And if there is a second round, which is what we expect, we expect that this election will go to a second round -- a second election probably in early July, then for them to sort of gather and rally behind the two main contesting parties.",
