American officials reportedly believe Israel is ready to strike Iran before the U.S. election, as Lebanon is hit with a new wave of Israeli strikes. Plus, Donald Trump focusing on women's issues as Kamala Harris tries to appeal to conservatives, all of it happening on the same network, \"Fox\", in the final sprint to election day. And Ukraine's President revealing his victory plan against Russia as CNN gains exclusive access into a secret of a Ukrainian unit targeting deep inside enemy lines. The attack plan is ready. That is what a source tells CNN about Israel's retaliation against Iran. Now, we still do not know exactly when it will happen, nor which sites may be hit, but U.S. officials do believe that counter-strike will come before election day here in the U.S., that of course, now less than three weeks away -- it is November 5th. Israel already, of course, fighting wars on two fronts, unleashing repeated strikes today on the southern city of Nabatieh, killing at least 16 people including the mayor there. Lebanon's Prime Minister says a local government meeting was intentionally hit. Israel says it was targeting Hezbollah infrastructure. The IDF also striking Beirut for the first time in days, and despite U.S. pressure not to bomb the capital, Israel says Hezbollah fired dozens of rockets at Israeli territory overnight, it is not clear the extent of the damage there. Israel though, also tightening its siege of Jabalya in Gaza. Emergency workers describing conditions that are just catastrophic. They're accusing Israel of destroying everything that represents life. At the U.N. Security Council today, the Palestinian ambassador said the world is witnessing to a genocide urging action now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes, and you know, Erica, as you know very well, the Biden White House has been on pins andneedles since October 1st when Iran rained down some 200 ballistic missiles on Israel. The U.S. has not tried to convince Israel to not respond, if anything, it has really tried to urge them in conversations behind closed doors to take action that they have described as proportional. So, there have been ongoing serious consultations between Israeli officials and U.S. officials about exactly what this counter-strike is going to look like. We know for example earlier this week -- last week, excuse me, the Israeli Prime Minister told President Biden that what he is not going to target when it comes to this counter-strike on Iran is nuclear and oil sites. That of course, was welcome news for this White House, that is a scenario that the administration has very much hoped to avoid. And what CNN is reporting today in terms of the potential timing is that U.S. officials do expect this counter-strike to happen sometime before November 5th. That is the date as you said, of the U.S. presidential election. We are told by sources that this is not directly related actually to the timing of the election, but simply, just the fact that there are just three weeks left and Israel is expected again to take action sometime between now and then. And what it does mean, of course, here in the U.S. is that, that issue of this ongoing volatility in the Middle East is going to potentially be very much front and center stage, just days out from a lot of voters heading to the polls to make this important decision. And you know, we have seen this issue be such a politically fraught one for both President Biden and now, of course, Vice President Kamala Harris, who is trying to win the presidency. I should just note just for our viewers, to give them a sense of how important this issue has been. The fact that she is going to be campaigning in a state like Michigan, where there is a very sizable Arab-American community, three times this week. That is not a coincidence. We know that Democrats are very sensitive to the fact that -- and nervous about the fact that this issue of how the administration has handled the situation in Gaza, and now is trying to prevent a second potential full-fledged war from opening up in the Middle East. Those are all issues that have potentially cost them politically, and they are certainly trying to make remedy for that in these final days. Of course, we're not going to know until we actually see the results of the election, how much these kinds of issues end up having an impact on the actual race and the outcome of the presidential election.

It's good to have you with us tonight. So, as we look at where things stand, the fact that CNN does have this reporting, that retaliation from Israel is expected, of course, before the election here in the U.S. on November 5. Part of that reporting is also that, Prime Minister Netanyahu is, quote, \"highly sensitive\" to the political ramifications in the United States when it comes to Israel's actions.

First, the Israelis need to succeed, in the sense thatthey need to destroy whatever it is that they go after. It can't be blocked by Iranian defenses, they can't fail. They want to contrast Israeli hyper competence with Iranian impotence, right? As you pointed out, the Iranians have launched two major missile strikes against Israel, neither has caused much damage to Israel. That's a win for Israel, but they're now trying to double down on that just as they did back in April, mount some kind of response against Iran that contrast their abilities with Iran's inabilities. In addition, the Israelis want to hit something that causes enough pain to the Iranians that they'll think twice or even three times before they launch another missile attack on Israel. But that isn't so painful that it causes the Iranians to suddenly lash out with yet another attack, right? It's very important to understand, the Israelis right now have still some operations in Gaza, although that's lesser, but their main focus right now is on Hezbollah and Lebanon. This is a major undertaking for Israel there, they can't be distracted by a constant tit-for-tat with Iran. So, they want to do something that hurts Iran, but not so much that the Iranians are then going to respond, and they have to defer -- divert their assets away from Lebanon to dealing with Iran.",

They've demonstrated an ability to inflict some damage on Israel in the past, at the end of the day, the Israelis don't fully know what Iran is capable of doing. So, they will certainly, as they have been already, do more in terms of cyber attacks on Iran, they might accompany a conventional strike on Iran with a cyber strike, something they've done before. But they've also got to make sure that what they do to Iran doesn't trigger an Iranian cyber attack on Israel, that's more than the Israelis want to deal with.",

Harris, you mentioned, she's in Philadelphia in the suburbs. They're in Philadelphia, she's appearing with former Republican lawmakers. She's going on \"Fox News\", into the lion's den tonight, the conservative TV network. What she's trying to do is peel off some Republicans who are disdainful of Trump's behavior, worry about what he would do in his second term, and might be open to making the leap and voting for a Democrat.

His messaging on this has been to touch the issue, claim that he is the father of IVF or will -- wants to protect their rights by -- as if turning issues back to the states would be a way to do that.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  Ukrainian drones attacking Southwestern Russia, sowing panic among local residents. Russian air defenses frantically trying to take them down before they slam into their targets. This massive drone strike carried out in late September by Ukraine's Defense Intelligence Agency, the GUR. And they granted CNN unprecedented access to the entire mission. Their target, a Russian ammo depot, the Ukrainians say, is storing missiles supplied to Moscow by Iran, even though Tehran vehemently denies giving Russia ballistic missiles.",

They gave us permission to show a simplified version of the flight path they calculated for this mission, with dozens of way points and changes of direction. But they'll also launch dozens of decoy drones like these, which they want the Russians to detect and to shoot down. They even put tin foil on the wings to give them a bigger radar signature.",

Several mediaoutlets there say the Real Madrid player is suspected of, quote, \"reasonable grounds of rape\" after visiting a nightclub and staying at a hotel in Stockholm. Mbappe's representatives have slammed those reports, calling them totally false and irresponsible. Nearly two dozen members of two brothers who were convicted of killing their parents some 30 years ago are now pushing for their release from prison. Lyle and Erik Menendez, pictured here alongside their parents, Jose and Kitty, are serving life sentences for murdering their parents in California in 1989. The family, a wealthy family, was well known, and the case made global headlines leading up to their convictions in 1996. Prosecutors said the brothers were after their parents' million-dollar estate. The siblings, however, say they were acting in self-defense after years of sexual abuse by their father. Well, flash forward nearly three decades, and social media scrutiny has led to some new interest in the case. It doesn't hurt, too, that there's a new Netflix series out, and -- sentence. Attorneys for the brothers filing a petition last year argued they should be granted relief, and they said a handwritten letter by Erik Menendez details these years of abuse by his father. For more on this my colleague, Jean Casarez, is joining me now. So, we laid out some of that. There are these questions about just how new the evidence really is in terms of how long it's been in their possession and what a difference this could actually make, Jean.",

So, that also is pivotally important here, possibly even more so than the letter, which is undated. So, it's not really known when it was written. But other thing I want to mention, Erica, which is interesting too, even before the murders, the two brothers actually burglarized at night homes in the Beverly Hills area, homes, friends of their parents, and they carted out thousands of dollars of items that they were able to sell and get money for. And they're living a very wealthy life at this time. The district attorney of Los Angeles took on the case. The father, Menendez, got a high-profile defense lawyer and got it so that the sons would just do community service. And the father, Menendez, actually paid back all those homeowners. So, it's interesting because there's so much to this. But now, the momentum is new evidence, rehabilitation, the district attorney of Los Angeles is saying, because they -- he has said publicly there's a law now in California, if you are rehabilitated, then you can look at that to get out of, say, a life sentence. But it's all in the hands of a judge at the end.",
