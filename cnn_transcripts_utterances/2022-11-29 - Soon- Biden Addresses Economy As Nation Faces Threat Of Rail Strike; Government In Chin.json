He criticized the president for allowing negotiations to even get to this point. And that's, of course, very interesting because McCarthy is fighting to get this speakership next year. He's very much trying to reassure the folks on the right wing of his caucus that he has the metal to stand up to the -- to the president in the White House, prove his conservative bona fides so that I think is why you're hearing that kind of language from McCarthy there today.",

      "sentences": "Well, Victor and Alisyn, we thought disaster was averted back in September when a deal -- a tentative deal was reached between union leaders and management. That tentative deal called for pay hikes, bonuses, and a promise not to increase health care copays. President Biden, he held that deal as a win for thousands of union workers. Fortunately, workers though did not see that the same way, you -- rank-and-file members. And for unions, they voted this down.There are still these sticking points, including lack of paid sick time, and there's scheduling issues here. And so if there's no agreement reached, we could have a strike next week. And this would be devastating for the economy. Cost of a billion dollars in just the first week alone. That's according to Anderson Economic Group. This is lost wages, lost production. Also, we see a big impact to inflation. The problem is that rail is just central to supply chains in this economy. Without it, you would see just a wide-ranging impact including gas prices. We would see food impact, commuters. And just give you some key facts about how reliant this economy is on a rail. Nearly 70 percent of U.S. coal production moves by rail. Food, 1.6 million carloads every year go by rail. This is a crazy stat. 75 percent of new cars and trucks purchased in the United States also get delivered by rail. And to the impacts of commuters, about 70 percent of miles traveled by Amtrak trains are on tracks owned by freight rail. So, all of this explains why President Biden, one of the most pro-union presidents in recent memory is calling for Congress to step in here.",
