That's the tough message from a senior official with ECOWAS, the West African regional block. Defense ministers from member nations are meeting today in Ghana discussing whether to intervene militarily to reverse the coup in Niger. ECOWAS agreed to activate a standby force just last week, but an ECOWAS commissioner says the group is still open to a peaceful resolution. Larry Madowo is following the developments from Nairobi, Kenya, and joins us now live. Good to have you with us, Larry. So, it's interesting hearing that ECOWAS say they're going to use all means available to bring this coup to an end. What does that entail? And given we've heard this sort of warnings from ECOWAS before, the coup leader is taking these warnings seriously because we did hear that ECOWAS said had the coup leaders an ultimatum to end the coup or deal with some sort of military action and that deadline well and truly passed. So, what's expected to happen next?",

This is more tough talk from ECOWAS, to be honest, and not a lot of movement, because they gave an ultimatum, which they then allowed to pass, and then they called another extraordinary summit of the heads of state, who called another meeting of the chiefs of defense of staff, which is what's happening in Ghana, in the capital Accra, today and tomorrow. And there will probably be another strongly-worded communique at the end of this meeting on Friday, but so far, not a whole lot of action. So, there's a couple of countries from the bloc, the economic community of West African states that have said they're ready to contribute troops to this military intervention, Senegal, Nigeria, Benin. But there's also countries that are reluctant to do so, partly because they are also military, they also run by the military, notably Mali, Burkina Faso and Guinea. But you hear this statement from this ECOWAS commissioner saying that they will restore constitutional order there by all means available and they're ready to move in. Listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ABDEL-FATAU MUSAH, ECOWAS COMMISSIONER FOR POLITICAL AFFAIRS, PEACE AND SECURITY:  They are pretending, you know, that, oh, now they are ready for talks. But even as they are telling that they are ready for talks, they are still seeking reasons, reasons to justify an unjustifiable coup d'etat. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In fact, the African Union Peace and Security Council met on Monday. Ambassadors from countries representing all the member countries of the African Union were there. They're supposed to have given a communique. They still have not released this communique. And one ambassador telling me that, on a sensitive issue like this, it takes long to try and agree on the language and the wording of this. So, that is a sure sign that there are members of the African Union who do not agree that there should be a military intervention here. We have seen, for instance, Ali Bongo Ondimba of Gabon sent an emissary to Niger to the coup leaders. The coup leaders' prime minister has been to neighboring Chad, Algeria is reluctant to have this military intervention there. So, there is quite some signs that their members of the African Union were not keen to draw Niger into a long conflict that would have destabilizing effects across the wider Sahel region.",

Much of this had essentially two roles. One was training and security cooperation with Niger and the Nigerian military, and the other was ISR, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance for the region. Often, that information was then passed on to either a local national partner like Niger or the French military, which had a larger presence there and was more often carried out a kinetic strike against a violent extremist or Islamist target. So, the U.S. had a very specific role here. Now, that role, at least for now, has been curtailed as the U.S. troops remain restricted to the bases or the embassy. The question, where does this go from here? That ISR was a crucial presence in the region. Officials here have acknowledged that. Now, they could try to do that mission from somewhere else, but the U.S, has invested millions, if not hundreds of millions of dollars and building up their ability to operate out of Niger and there is no close by option and it would be very difficult for example to try to do this mission from another country needing the secure overflight rights if you are going to try to overflight drones to try to monitor what is happening there. So, a lot of this becomes very difficult but crucially the U.S. has not made the decision to move its troops out yet.",
