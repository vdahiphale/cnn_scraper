The chicks were preparing for their rendition of the national anthem tonight, and trust me, you are going to want to hear that.Also tonight, a woman named Kamala Harris is going to take that stage behind me to formally accept her party's presidential nomination and make history as she becomes the first black woman and first Asian American to lead a major party's ticket. It will no doubt be the biggest audience she's ever spoken to, and it comes just 32 days into her unexpected campaign. It's a chance to reintroduce herself to the millions of Americans who know her name, but maybe not much more. We're told that the stakes of this moment are not lost on the vice president, if she needs a pep talk, maybe she could ask her running mate. Governor Walz went back to coach walls to pump up the crowd last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN), 2024 VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's the fourth quarter, we're down a field goal, but we're on offense and we've got the ball. We're driving down the field. And boy, do we have the right team? Kamala Harris is tough. Kamala Harris is experienced, and Kamala Harris is ready. Our job, our job, our job, our job for everyone watching is to get in the trenches and do the blocking and tackling. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I always remember, she got three million more votes than the other guys. There were a lot of people ready to do this.In 2020, we had six women say, I want to run for the top office and put their ideas out there. That changes America, again, didn't make it, but it changes things. And now we've had four years of a woman as vice president of this country. And we've had one more thing, the Dobbs opinion, two years ago. And I think that changed the country again because the majority of Americans -- the overwhelming majority of Americans do not support taking away a constitutional right from the women of this country. And it has energized women and friends of women, also sometimes known as men to say, we just got to do things a little differently around here. And Kamala Harris has been at the forefront of that fight. She has shown her steeliness and her leadership. You know, I just want to remind everyone, we live in an America today where 30 percent of all women are in states that effectively ban abortion. If Donald Trump and J. D. Vance take over the White House, it won't be 30 percent, it will be 100 percent.",

They want to go to an extremist place where nobody is safe. Whether you're in a red state, a purple state, a blue state, Kamala Harris leads that fight.

There's no sitting this one out.The second one we're fighting right now is how we strengthen America's middle class. Donald Trump wants to help the billionaires, big tax cuts, more power. Kamala Harris has always been a person who fights for opportunity in the middle class. And right now, that means cutting costs for families. She's laid out economic plans to do this. I see this as we have an opportunity to make a real difference. And to gather together as Democrats, as Independents and as some Republicans, to say this is a vision we care about. As I said earlier, I've known Kamala Harris for nearly 14 years now. I trust who she fights for. It's not the billionaires.

But even before this convention, Democrats, I thought, and the vice president specifically in her speeches, would lay out the specifics. Say, there were more than a hundred former allies, advisers from the Trump administration that worked on this, developed Project 2025. She would talk about how it would take federal employees, career officials, and replace them with allies as well, breaking down those policies. That's also very much a characteristic of the vice president. She is somebody that somewhat works in the fine print and tries to articulate specific policies. At times it hasn't earlier in her vice presidency, always digested and always sort of resonated with crowds.
