They had about a dozen amendment votes, and one after another Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, was keeping track of how long each vote was taking. I just want to tell the American people, usually the U.S. Senate does not move that quickly. Typically, it takes them about an hour, sometimes even more, to have a single vote. Last night, they kept members on the floor. They were trying to move through about a dozen amendments very expeditiously. Finally, they got there shortly before midnight. But one thing that became very clear last night, this is a bipartisan coalition. You're going to see again at the end of September lawmakers will have to pass their spending bills. We also know they have to pass a farm bill. They made some assurances last night that there could be another supplemental spending bill for Ukraine.

He then goes on to do something his attorneys have done also in the court of public opinion, which is try to conflate his obligations under the Presidential Records Act with his responsibilities to protect classified material and defense information, right? He's saying that we completely complied with the Presidential Records Act, which requires him to return any -- any materials that are produced during his presidency to the government. They're -- they belong to the American people. Now, we know they did not fully comply with that, because they returned 15 boxes on their own to the Archives after the government suggested that, Hey, I think we're missing some things. Then, of course, the FBI also searched his Mar-a-Lago property last August and recovering even more materials. But here on this recording, the concern is that he's suggesting that he's still in the possession of classified materials. Here once again, he suggests he has the power to declassify those. But what our sources tell us in on this recording, he suggested -- suggests that he is aware of the limits of his ability to declassify. So even though he's trying to say I did nothing wrong. It was the Presidential Records Act. I declassified them, that just doesn't comport with the facts or what our sources tell us about this recording.",

The biggest problem is politically. If voters feel that they've heard this again and again and again, they may just sort of tire as some of his competitors on the campaign trail have tried to suggest. There are going to be, quote, \"less drama.\" But there's also a core group of people who believe that the former president is, indeed, the victim of a political, quote, \"witch-hunt,\" right?

And so, look, what he has done -- and I can't believe that the Republican challengers don't quite get this yet. But what he has done since 2015, since 2016, all throughout his political career, what he has done is just redefined and scrambled what politics is. The -- the DeSantises of the world, all of these other traditional politicians are acting as if voters have some list of issues. And if your promises match their list of issues, then they're going to support you. That is not what Trump support is about at all. It is about him and him personally. And woke means whatever he decides it means that day in that moment. And his followers are not particularly interested in any of the rest of it. And I think Ron DeSantis is going to discover that as he fails to close the gap, the 20- to 30-point gap between him and Donald Trump.",

Real or imagined, and mostly imagined in many cases.That all of a sudden, there is this comfort level and almost an encouragement to attack anyone and anything that is different from you, and somehow blame whatever ills you or bothers you on whatever is different. Either how someone feels, or looks, whatever it may be. So it's become also -- when I see it, it's become this effort to run on exclusion as opposed to inclusion, and it seems sadly effective.",

Listen, the election of Donald Trump was the primal scream of the white working class that thinks that Washington is lying to them, Wall Street is exploiting them, and Hollywood is laughing at them.And that hasn't gone away. And really, it just all now consolidates into this idea that we've got these enemies out there, and we're going to support the person who helps us fight against them. And that's what January 6th was about, and that's what the Trump phenomenon is about. And that's what the presidential election is going to be about, at least the Republican primary is going to be about. And so woke is just, like, sort of a nice little buzzword. It consolidates the whole thing. It's them who are causing the problem. That might be immigrants. That might be people of color. That might be the -- the you know, education from K through 12, all the way through the academy about ideas and books that you're not comfortable with, the transgender movement, LGBTQ rights. All of it gets dumped together into one sack, and people say, like, there's this woke stuff, diversity. You know, we don't want diversity. We don't want inclusion. OK, you don't want any of those things, that's fine. But it's a good way to lose a general election, by the way. But it is a very real movement. There are people who feel very put upon. They have good reason to, frankly. There's an economic underpinning to all of this that is very real. People are losing their livelihoods, losing their jobs. The deindustrialization of the country has not stopped. And so, you know, the politicians who want to exploit that are really what we're seeing. They're really kind of driving the bus at this point.",
