It has murdered more Americans and more Frenchmen than any group except bin Laden. It's murdered the citizens of many countries represented in this room. And it has attacked Israel viciously over the last 20 years. In the last year, completely unprovoked, a day after Hamas massacre on October 7th, Hezbollah began attacks against Israel, which forced more than 60,000 Israelis on our northern border to leave their homes, becoming refugees in their own land. Hezbollah turned vibrant towns in the north of Israel into ghost towns. So I want you to think about this in equivalent American terms. Just imagine if terrorists turned El Paso and San Diego into ghost towns. Then ask yourself, how long would the American government tolerate that? A day? A week? A month? I doubt they'd tolerated it even for a single day. Yet Israel has been tolerating this intolerable situation for nearly a year. Well, I've come here today to say enough is enough. (APPLAUSE)",

We will not accept a terror army perched on our northern border ableto perpetrate another October 7th style massacre. For 18 years Hezbollah brazenly refused to implement U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which requires it to move its forces away from our borders. Instead, Hezbollah moved right up to our border. They secretly dug terror tunnels to infiltrate our communities and indiscriminately fired thousands of rockets into our towns and villages. They fired these rockets and missiles not from military sites, not from that -- they do that, too. But they fired those rockets and missiles after they placed them in schools, in hospitals, in apartment buildings, and in the private homes of the citizens of Lebanon. They endanger their own people. They put a missile in every kitchen, a rocket in every garage. I said to the people of Lebanon this week, get out of the deathtrap that Hezbollah has put you in. Don't let Nasrallah drag Lebanon into the abyss. We're not at war with you. We're at war with Hezbollah, which has hijacked your country and threatens to destroy ours. As long as Hezbollah chooses the path of war, Israel has no choice and Israel has every right to remove this threat and return our citizens to their homes safely. And that's exactly what we're doing.

And in mymaiden speech here, I think it's the same podium, by the way. In my maiden speech here I spoke against the proposal to expel Israel from this body. Four decades later I find myself defending Israel against that same preposterous proposal. And who's leading the charge this time? Not Hamas, but Abbas. The Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas. This is the man who claims he wants peace with Israel. Yet he still refuses to condemn the horrific massacre of October 7th. He is still paying hundreds of millions to terrorists who murder Israelis and Americans. It's called pay for slay. The more you murder, the more you get paid. And he still wages unremitting diplomatic warfare against Israel's right to exist and against Israel's right to defend itself. And by the way, they amount to the same thing. Because if you can't defend yourself, you can't exist. Not in our neighborhoods, certainly. And maybe not in yours. Standing in this podium 40 years ago, I told the sponsors of that outrageous resolution to expel Israel, gentlemen, check your fanaticism at the door. Today I tell President Abbas and all of you who would shamefully support that resolution, check your fanaticism at the door. The singling out of the one and only Jewish state continues to be a moral stain on the United Nations. It has made this once respected institution contemptible in the eyes of decent people everywhere. But for the Palestinians, this U.N. house of darkness is home court. They know that in this swamp of antisemitic bile, there's an automatic majority willing to demonize the Jewish state and anything in this anti-Israel flat- earth society. Any false charge, any outlandish allegation can muster a majority. In the last decade there has been more resolutions passed against Israel in this hall at the U.N. General Assembly than against the entire world combined. Actually, more than twice as many. Since 2014 this body condemned Israel 174 times. It condemned all the other countries in the world 73 times, That's more than 100 extra condemnations for the Jewish state. What hypocrisy, what a double standard, what a joke.

He referred tothe United Nations as a swamp of antisemitic bile as an anti-Israeli flat- earthed society. He was applauded on the way in by his supporters. I have to say that was a very empty chamber but his supporters were there and he was cheered at various points throughout his speech. And we're going to pick parts somewhat what he said. To do that and to provide some insight and analysis for you, let's bring in our panel. CNN's Nic Robertson, Gideon Levy of \"Haaretz,\" back with us both in Tel Aviv today. Ben Wedeman is in Southern Lebanon and former hostage negotiator, Gershon Baskin, also with us live. I want to start with my colleague Nic. You just heard what nearly I think around 40 minutes from Benjamin Netanyahu. He said he wasn't going to -- he didn't think he would come this year to the U.N. He said, my country is at war fighting for its life. But after the lies and slanders leveled at Israel I decided to come and set the record straight.

      "sentences": "Becky, if you take into account what you just said and the fact that I don't think I heard theword ceasefire once in that speech, that clearly Israel is set on its current air campaign and perhaps a ground incursion to try to push Hezbollah back. Now, for instance, he did say that Hezbollah has a missile in every kitchen and a rocket in every garage, that sort of sends a rather alarming message to people here because the fact of the matter is in South Lebanon, there is not a missile in every kitchen and a rocket in every garage. But this seems to indicate that Israel considers every house, every kitchen, every garage to be a legitimate target. But broadly speaking this was classic Netanyahu in which he divides the world into black and white, good and evil. He talks about the curse and of course we're in Lebanon, which is part of that curse. I think people would scratch their heads a bit because the fact of the matter is the Middle East is an area of grays. There's no black and white. Certainly take into consideration that Israel has occupied the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Golan Heights and essentially occupied Gaza despite the fact that settlers pulled out in 2005. That is an open wound in the region that Israel has not really done much to treat. There was a peace process at one point, but that didn't go anywhere and certainly the rhetoric that comes out of Israel from some of the extremists sends a very dark message to the region that this is not necessarily a question of good and evil, that there are extremists on both sides of the conflict. And those extremists on both sides are really the ones who are driving this conflict forward. And what we're seeing increasingly is the United States under the current administration in this election season in the United States has really just put the Middle East on a back burner, throwing lots of rhetoric and encouraging words about diplomacy and peace in the Middle East and whatnot. But the fact of the matter is very little is actually being done about it. The U.S. and France put forward what they called was a ceasefire proposal. But it doesn't seem to be going anywhere. And every day in Gaza, in Lebanon, more people are dying, more people are being killed -- Becky.",

This is what the Americans need to know. They know it. They've seen the deal. Hamas has agreed to a three-week deal during which time the war would end, Israel would evacuate Gaza. There would be an agreed upon release of Palestinian prisoners, and Hamas will return all of the hostages. This is not only a deal on the ceasefire, but Hamas has also agreed that they are supporting the establishment of a civilian technocratic professional government in Gaza of which they will not have a part of. They are willing for this government to be empowered because they know that if they rule Gaza, there won't be a single dollar of international aid going in to rebuild Gaza and Gaza is destroyed. There is nothing left in Gaza. Two million homeless people, disease, devastation, no sanitation, no fresh water, no schools, no universities, nothing. Gaza needs to be rebuilt and it needs a responsible Palestinian government to do it. Now, we asked Hamas if they're talking about turning over internal security and their weapons to the new civilian professional technocratic government, and they said yes. But what I say to the Americans, to the Israelis, to everyone is don't listen to me. This is on the table. I have it in writing. I have voice messages from Hamas saying it. The officials need to check it. And President Biden needs to understand in his final months in office that his legacy is either going to be the war in Gaza or ending the war in Gaza. And we all know that the day that the war in Gaza ends, the war in Lebanon ends, and we need to get into the diplomatic path. There is no solution to this conflict without the freedom of Palestine, the establishment of an independent Palestinian state next to Israel, the realization of the two- state solution.

He went on then to squarely put Iran in the crosshairs. But I thought it was really interesting because he came back to the idea of a Middle East which is as far as he was concerned, the blessing and came back to the idea of this peace agreement with Saudi Arabia that he is on the cusp of that peace agreement. Look, Saudi Arabia have said that they are willing to cut a deal of some sort with Israel. But Israel has to provide a viable path to a Palestinian state. I think it's noteworthy to point out that Benjamin Netanyahu never talked about a Palestinian state, never mentioned a Palestinian horizon in his speech today. And when the cameras opened up, Nic, to the floor of the hall, there was no right representative for Saudi Arabia in the room. There were very few people in the room, but very specifically, there was no representative for Saudi Arabia, a country that has signed up to this ceasefire proposal that the U.S. and France have suggested or proposed.

This could be, you know, what we're trying to achieve. I'm so struck by, he used almost similar language in January last year when Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in town or maybe it was a few months before that, because he's used this language before. I think he called it as a golden circle. It's the Netanyahu style to say, don't look at all this stuff that we're accused of, that we reject and all of that. Look at this. I'm offering this great sales pitch here. We could just, let's aim for this. Let's go for that. And he is using those same tactics again here. And by the way, the cost of a deal with Saudi Arabia for him has gone up massively, actually beyond the price that he would pay because Saudi Arabia now says the cost of that is going to be a commitment, an irreversible commitment to recognizing a Palestinian state. And that's something the prime minister has shown no willingness to go down that road whatsoever.

It stayed well to the west, but because of its size and just how strong it was, it was able to push all of these sailboats. We're talking about a storm surge anywhere between four to six feet here. George, if you can pan a little bit to your left I'll show you exactly just how high the water got here. The 5500, that's the address of this building here.
