Voters gearing up for a key Senate debate tonight. Republican Mehmet Oz and Democrat John Fetterman will face-off in their first and only debate. This is a new CNN poll shows Fetterman leading with a narrow margin. We're on the ground in Harrisburg with a preview of tonight's debate. Plus, overnight in Florida, Incumbent Republican Governor Ron DeSantis vying to keep his job facing off against Democratic Challenger Charlie Crist in their debate, the two trading barbs, insults, sparring on a number of topics at their final debate ahead of Election Day. The Democratic candidate, Charlie Crist, will join me in just a moment. But let's begin this morning with what is expected to be that fiery debate tonight in Pennsylvania. CNN Congressional Jessica Dean is on the trail in Harrisburg. And it is important, this will be the only debate for voters between Oz and Fetterman, Jessica. So, what are we expecting them to tackle tonight in addition to the expected fireworks?",

      "sentences": "Right. Well, we're going to see these two men meeting for the very first time when they come together, Erica. This is going to be inside of a local television news station here, no audience, so just the two of them, the moderators. And we also know that Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman, who's been recovering from a stroke that he suffered back in May, will be using that closed captioning throughout the debate to be able to make sure that he's understanding everything he's talked about.This auditory processing issue that he's had left over from that stroke. And so the Oz campaign agreed to allow him to use that closed captioning technology, which he kind of took out for a public spin at an event over the weekend. What you're looking at right there, you're seeing him with Senator Amy Klobuchar. We saw kind of working through that. So, that is kind of an interesting piece of this that will be at play. Of course, Fetterman, who his own campaign has admitted, this isn't like his strongest suit, debating, kind of lowering those expectations, up against celebrity Dr. Mehmet Oz, the Republican nominee who really has pushed for more debates, wanted more time together on the stage. Of course, they ended up with this one 60- minute debate. Oz spending years and years in front of a camera talking to people at home, so it is a place that he feels very comfortable in front of a camera. But what we expect to see from both of them last night is who can kind of land the most arguments and punches. Both of these candidates ironically trying to paint the other as the most extreme, that if you send either of them to Washington, you will be getting the most extreme version of someone in their party. And so we expect to hear more about that. Of course, both of them trying to find where they can kind of get an edge in with any of the voters out there who may still be undecided in this race that continues to tighten and is a critical race. It is most likely going to determine who controls the U.S. Senate, which is incredibly important and it means that there are a lot of eyes on this race, millions and millions and millions of dollars being spent here. I'll tell you in the hotels, you turn on the T.V., you are flooded with ads every commercial break. And one more thing to expect tonight, it will be interesting to see what issues they really try to go to. Of course, the moderators will decide what questions will be asked. But when we asked in our most recent polling what mattered most to the voters, far and away, it's what we've been talking about this entire campaign cycle, it is the economy, it is inflation. And so I talked to one person here who has been monitoring voter trends in this commonwealth for years and years, and he made the case that neither of them have really talked a ton about the economy. So, maybe we'll hear about that tonight as they try again to really single out any of those undecided voters who may be out there or sway anyone who might be persuadable. Erica, of course, Oz leaning in crime as well and the Fetterman campaign really leaning into the issue of abortion rights. So, we expect to hear about all of those topics this evening. HILL:  Yes. But to your point, interesting to see and hear just how much there is when it comes to the economy and inflation. Jessica, I appreciate it, thank you.",

And what the allegations are is there have been people who are basically putting lawn chairs right where I'm standing, and they are watching and photographing people as they return their ballots.But I want you to look at this video of what is happening in Mesa, Arizona. And there is a lot of concern about safety in regards to this because there have been armed men who were showing up at that ballot drop box. There have been a few confrontations that have been captured on some citizen videos and posted on Twitter. The lawsuit that has a status conference today in federal court here in the state of Arizona, the plaintiffs have filed, and this is a group of retirees, as well as a Latino organization, saying that they believe that this is a campaign of vigilante voter intimidation. The lawsuit is against an organization here in Arizona, the Clean Elections USA, as well as its founder, saying that this is being coordinated, that this is being organized and they believe that this is a violation of civil rights for anyone who wants to try to return their ballots. As far as whether anything is illegal in this, on its face, the Maricopa County sheriff says there isn't anything illegal, that there is the right to carry, the Second Amendment is here in Arizona as it is in the rest of the country. There is open carry in the state of Arizona. And as long as they don't directly try to stop somebody from coming in and dropping that ballot, the sheriff says that they don't believe that there is anything illegal. The sheriff did point out, though, that the department is in conversation with the Department of Justice to see if there is any violation of any sort of federal statutes. There have also been six cases referred to the Department of Justice, Erica, because the secretary of state here believes that this is indeed voter intimidation. Erica? HILL:  I have to feel like you would know much better than me based on all of your excellent reporting over the last several years, Kyung. It does feel like this is just the beginning as we look to these incidents. I appreciate it. Thank you. And this morning, a Russian court has upheld American basketball star Brittney Griner's conviction for smuggling drugs into the country, essentially keeping her nine year prison sentence mostly in place. U.S. State Department Spokesperson Ned Price told me last hour the U.S. is still engaging with Russia, trying to bring Griner and her fellow detained American, Paul Whelan, home, say that they're continuing to put that out there, and yet here we are this morning. So, what else can be done, if anything? Joining me now to discuss, Josh Rogin, Washington Post Columnist and CNN Political Analyst. Josh good to see you this morning. I would say, unfortunately, in many respects, this is probably not an unexpected outcome this morning, what we saw out of Russia, but based on what we're hearing publicly from the government, what could potentially be happening behind the scenes. Do you believe there is more that can be done?",

      "sentences": "Well, Erica, it is clear that today's ruling by the appeals court confirmed largely the sentence of Brittney Griner was expected both by her lawyers and by the U.S. government. It could be a signal that the path forward negotiation behind the scenes solution is moving forward because now there are no more legal procedures that the Russians can point to as a reason to delay. So, in that sense, it could mean that there are behind the scenes negotiation actually could have a breakthrough. At the same time, it also means that the Russians will claim they have more leverage in that negotiation because now Brittney Griner has no more appeals to hope for. So, it kind of cuts both ways.What we do know, again, according to CNN's own reporting, is that the trade for Viktor Bout, the merchant of death, serving a 25-year sentence in Illinois federal prison for murder conspiracy and weapons selling to terrorists for Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan was rejected by the Russians. They want more. They are not likely to settle for that. And that's where the rub is. And what more do they want and what more can the U.S. government give? Well, that is exactly the subject of the secret negotiations from this point forward.",

      "sentences": "Right, Erica. Well, there are dozens, if not, hundreds of Americans wrongfully detained in dictatorships all over the world. Some of them get that status from the U.S. government, like Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan. And to be sure, they definitely deserve it. But Saad Almadi, who is rotting away in a Saudi prison for 16 years because of some tweets also clearly fits the definition of wrongfully detained.There is a checklist but you only have to meet 1 out of the 11 things on the checklist, and one of them is freedom of speech, if your freedom of speech is impaired. That clearly seems to be the case with Saad Almadi. Another one is whether or not the sentence outweighs the proportionality of the alleged crime, and 16 years for some tweets definitely fits that. So, it is pretty clear that the State Department is avoiding giving him that wrongfully detained status. Now, according to his son, the reason that they're doing that is because they want to preserve U.S./Saudi relations. It is really easy to see that Americans held in friendly countries, like Saudi Arabia, are supposedly friendly countries don't get the same level of attention from the U.S. government as those in adversary countries, which is ironic. You would think the friendly countries would be nicer to Americans but they are not. And so I think that Brittney Griner is wrongfully detained, that she deserves all of the attention and all of the focus that the U.S. government is giving her case. And Saad Almadi is also wrongfully detained but he's not getting that focus, that attention, that much is clear, and I hope on behalf of the family that the State Department will acknowledge that sooner rather than later.",

Because what happened was the State Department asked Ibrahim, the son, to stay quiet for 11 months, and he did stay quiet. And he thought that that meant that they were working behind the scenes but it turns out they weren't.Brittney Griner, when she had her hearing today, the charge d'affaires, the head U.S. diplomat in Moscow, attended the hearing. When Saad Almadi had his hearing, nobody from the embassy attended at all. They just forgot about it. They had a snafu, a mix-up. That just shows you the difference and the level of attention. So, I think, unfortunately, what a lot of these families are learning, whether or not your family member is in prison in Russia or Saudi Arabia, or Iran or what have you, the best thing that you could do is make a public stink because that is the only thing the U.S. government really responds to. So, again, I think Saad Almadi deserves more attention. I just don't think he's getting it.",

You told me in the break you felt good about the debate. I'm hoping we could, for folks who are watching, get some more specifics on a couple of really important topics that came up. So, let's start with housing in Florida and insurance rates, which, as you know, are astronomical, if you can even get insurance for many homeowners. I believe it is six insurers in Florida that have gone insolvent this year.

And that is why he pulled the stunt that he did, flying people from Texas to Martha's Vineyard who were lied to, to lure them on to a plan.These were Hispanics. These were Venezuelans in particular. And he thought it was a funny stunt to do that to make a point. If you want to change policy, you need to support the policy.

And yet he spent zero time dwelling on either of those milestones in his first speech as prime minister perhaps because there is so much for him to do. He will have to get to work trying to tackle inflation, which is having a very direct impact on a lot of people in this country given that most people's mortgages are only fixed for two or five-year periods. He will have a heck of a task in trying to repair public finances and the tens of billions of dollars in deficits that will be racked over the next couple of years in part because of the massive spending due to the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and, of course, the rising energy prices as well. He also has a big task in uniting his party in reaching out to the other wings of his party, those people who supported Boris Johnson or perhaps Liz Truss.
