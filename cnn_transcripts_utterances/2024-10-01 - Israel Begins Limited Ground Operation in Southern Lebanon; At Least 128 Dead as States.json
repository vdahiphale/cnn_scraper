In fact, the operation itself started a few hours before it was announced by the Israeli military. And it happened also just shortly after the National Security cabinet in Israel agreed the next phases. So sign and off on the next phases. And this clearly is what that next phase was.So what we've heard in a statement, a short statement from the IDF, is that it is a targeted and limited ground operation. It's the first time in 18 years that the Israeli military has gone into southern Lebanon in this kind of format. We know that in recent days there have been special forces going into the area, preparing for this eventuality. Now we have heard that it will be limited. We have Israeli officials telling our team on the ground that they are not interested in a long term occupation, and surprisingly they have not given many details on the operation itself. They could not be pressed on the duration of this operation or in fact how far into Lebanon they would be going. Now we've heard from the military that it would be a number of villages along the border itself which they believe pose a threat to northern Israel. The Israeli prime minister says the operation -- that the goal of this operation is to allow tens of thousands of Israeli residents to be able to move back to their homes in northern Israel. Now, of course, in Lebanon, the feeling about this is very different. There are concerns that a limited operation in Israel's eyes will be nothing like in the eyes of the Lebanese. They remember back in 1982 that Israel publicly said it was going to be a limited operation and they then occupied southern Lebanon. They went as far as Beirut as well, encircling that part, the western part of the city and there was an occupation. And of course just recently we heard from the Israeli military that there would be a limited operation in Rafah in the south of Gaza, as there was much international criticism of that operation and one of our teams has been into Rafah since and has seen that much of this did he has been destroyed. So there are concerns on the Lebanese side of the border as to what this limited operation will look like -- Rosemary.",

So what we think it means is that they're going to go in to specific areas. They say that they're going after specific villages and specific targets, and that they will in essence make those useless for Hezbollah so that Hezbollah cannot use launch sites, that they cannot use staging areas for attacks on northern Israel.The whole idea is to secure the northern part of Israel so that those 60,000 or so Israelis that have been forced to move from that area can go back to their homes. And as far as, you know, what that would look like on a permanent basis really depends on how successful this operation, this targeted operation is. If they find that they cannot mop up Hezbollah positions, get rid of Hezbollah weapons, do things like that, then they will have to find another method and that could include some degree of occupation of the southern part of Lebanon. Whether or not that means that it goes up to the Litani River, that of course is another issue, would be another phase in this conflict if it happens, and would require further government approval in Israel if they were going to do that.",

So the United States definitely knows what it speaks of in this case. Mission creep for the Israelis could very much be a quagmire. In other words, they get entangled in southern Lebanon. They cannot dislodge completely Hezbollah forces and they have to stay there for a long time.It'd be a larger version of what we're kind of seeing in Gaza, or at least risk seeing in Gaza at this particular point in time. For the people of southern Lebanon this could very well mean that they have to abandon their homes and that of course is something that they've already had to do in many cases. And it really risks destabilizing the country from an economic standpoint and certainly a governmental standpoint. And that's a major, major problem for stability in that part of the Middle East. So this type of operation is very risky. It is something that cannot be done very cleanly unless you know exactly what you're going after and you can achieve the results that you're seeking very quickly.

The attack on the pagers and the walkie-talkies, that was something that they did very carefully because what they were trying to do was to disrupt what's known as the command and control system of Hezbollah so if they can't communicate, they can't act, at least that's the theory behind actions like this. And so when it comes to this particular situation, Hezbollah is going to find it very difficult to communicate with each other.They may be able to install landlines at least on a temporary basis to communicate with some elements, but that's not a very flexible communications method, and it's very risky for them to go to cell phones, even satellite phones. So that becomes something that makes it more difficult for them. And then they may have to result to very old- fashion methods, which would include couriers and basically communications methods from the 19th century. And if that is the case, then their operations, their ability to respond to Israeli actions is very much a slowed and if that happens, then they can't really respond to quick movements by Israeli forces.",

They raised their offer from 40 percent to 50 percent raise over six years.The union is demanding 77 percent so they're still wide apart but now the strike is costing both sides significantly. The Longshore workers are losing income so that points to the fact that a settlement is certainly possible. The union wants to make the point and get a better offer.
