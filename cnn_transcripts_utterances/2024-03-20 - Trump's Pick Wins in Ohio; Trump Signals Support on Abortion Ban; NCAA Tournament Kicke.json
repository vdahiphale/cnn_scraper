And some of this is coming from conversations he's been having with people who advise him on this issue. That includes Marjorie Dannenfelser. She's the president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-life, as well as Senator Lindsey Graham, both people who have been talking to Donald Trump about this for over a year now. But look, this language that Donald Trump is using in these interviewsisn't entirely new. For the past year he's been talking about, you know, I've been hearing 15 weeks, I've been hearing 16 weeks. He's been very vague in that language. What is new, though, is that he's starting to say this more in public now and he's saying this in media interviews. And I do want you to just take a listen to how he put it yesterday during that radio interview. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The number of weeks now, people are agreeing on 15, and I'm thinking in terms of that. And it will come out to something that's very reasonable. But people are really - even hard-liners are agreeing, seems to be 15 weeks, seems to be a number that people are agreeing at.

They insist in our conversations that there is no, at least from the campaign side, some sort of policy rollout or national ban that they're going to be rolling out anytime soon.And the interesting thing, though, about this is, you know, all throughout the primary there were a lot of people, including some of his own campaign advisers, who thought that he needed to come out with firm language on abortion, especially as some of his Republican primary challengers were making very clear where they stood. But Donald Trump personally brushed off that pressure and argued that he didn't think it was politically helpful. He recognized that it was better to toe the line, try to, you know, throw red meat to the more conservative side of it and tout what he had done by putting conservative justices on the Supreme Court that helped overturn Roe versus Wade, but then also being vague enough that he doesn't alienate key voting blocs that he knew he would need in a general election. So, it's interesting that we're hearing more of this come out of his own mouth now, even though he is a general election candidate. But again, we're not hearing that any real policy is going to be coming out anytime soon from his campaign. Kate.",

I think what they want to see is clarity. What they want - a lot of those voters want to see is somebody that has - has a position that's on their side. Increasingly we're seeing with the polling that Republicans are sort of at odds with many of these voters on that issue. And many of these voters, independents, even Republican-leaning independents, are starting to align themselves with Democrats. So, it's certainly an issue in those suburban swing areas.",

He talked about, well, he's hearing from people that this is where they're landing on, 15 weeks. What people? Certainly not women. Certainly not the majority of Americans who agree that this is a personal decision that should be in the hands of women, their families, and their doctors, and that's it. But maybe he doesn't consider women people either.And so I think that this will continue to be political kryptonite for the Republican Party who doesn't understand that this is not an issue that they should be deciding. It should be an issue that is private, that should be had with women and with their liberties and their freedoms and it's going to give Democrats the ability to continue making the stark contrast between Joe Biden and the Democrats and, frankly, a lot of independents and Republicans to who agree with us that this is something that should be left in the hands of women. Every woman's position and circumstance is different, and it should not be legislated by men.",

And I think the problem for him has been up until now is that his campaign and he has focused on gathering the full strength of his MAGA supporters. And there's no question that he has that, right? This is a group of supporters that will never leave him.But we all know that for the general election, that is not enough. That was what his downfall was in 2020. It is what is going to be his downfall this November as well because he has yet to make the pivot, or to make any kind of argument, to say to the Nikki Haley supporters, to those in the Republican Party who say, and understand how unfit Donald Trump is for office, he is not going to pivot. His language continues to be more chaotic, more crazy than ever. And so I think those numbers really yell red flags for Donald Trump going into this general election.",

They've just never been happy with the stamp that Donald Trump has put on the party and so they're showing up to register their sort of dissent there. But this is - they are this swing voters that are going to make or break whether or not Republicans have control of the Congress or control of the White House in November. [08:45:04] So, the - it's certainly a charge for the - for the Trump campaign right now is, what are they going to do to get these voters back? The bigger risk, John, I think, is that some of these voters stay home. Donald Trump can afford to have, you know, 50,000 voters in Georgia or, you know, 25,000 voters that are conscientious objectors, Nikki Haley supporters, in the suburbs of places like Wisconsin and Georgia and Arizona, going to need them to show up on Election Day. And so I think that's why you're going to see this campaign really be a hard negative campaign where each candidate is trying to disqualify the other in order to get those voters to come out and vote for them.",
