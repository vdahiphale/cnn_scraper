Here's a live look at flight delays as storms in the west and south put a damper on some of those plans.Meteorologist Elisa Raffa is here. So where is it that this is going to be a problem? It's not across the whole country. And to be fair, it is winter. So, winter storms, pretty normal this time of year.",

      "sentences": "Yes, absolutely. And I think our biggest problem spot the entire week is going to be the Pacific Northwest. We've got an atmospheric river setting up with a series of storms. We're looking at some problems with rain and snow pretty much for the rest of the week. You've got rain and snow right now, from Seattle, down towards Portland. Some lightning strikes coming onshore with some of that snow there too, as this storm again really starts to develop.We have winter alerts in effect, especially these highest elevations, where we can have a foot of snow possible just from this round. Wind gusts could also get over 60 miles per hour. It could cause some problems with downed trees and power lines, could blow around that snow in the highest elevations as well. So, you can see, that rain and snow coming on shore today. And we'll continue as we go into Friday. It's just going to be like train cars, one storm after the next. Through Friday alone we're looking at 2 to 4 inches of rain, a foot or so of snow in some of the highest elevations. But that's just through Friday. We'll still have more rain and snow to contend with through the weekend. So, problem spots again expected, Seattle, Portland and San Francisco. We have another storm that's brewing along the Gulf Coast here. That will cause some problems from Dallas to Houston, Memphis today, where we have showers and storms firing up and they could be strong to severe. We have a level two out of five severe risk today for damaging winds, large hail, and even a couple of tornadoes. That tornado risk could be highest around that Houston area, from Houston to Austin. Something to watch out for today. And then you could see there, the travel headaches that could come with that from the heavy rain and the severe weather. All of this starts to shift east as we go into Friday. That storm moving east. And then by the weekend we could be looking at those travel headaches up and down the eastern seaboard, from Atlanta, up through Nashville and then D.C., New York, Boston, as we go into Sunday, as all of that rain starts to move east.

And that is the president and the first lady boarding Air Force One, where they will be soon taking off for vacation in St. Croix. After that, with just 25 days left in Biden's term, he has still another major international trip in store. Let's get over to CNN's Kayla Tausche. She's tracking all of this for us. So, they've left the White House. Now they're off to St. Croix. But what are you hearing from the White House about Biden's agenda in these final days?",

      "sentences": "Kate, President Biden is expected to spend the next 25 days on events and travel meant to burnish his legacy on causes that have been central, not just to this term, but also to his five plus decade career in public service.The White House has announced that he will be traveling to Rome and to the Vatican in particular for a visit with Pope Francis in mid- January. President Biden, in 2021, met with the pope before attending the G-20 summit in Rome. And at the time it was a very consequential visit because he accepted communion from Pope Francis after questions from the church about whether Biden's position on abortion would disqualify him. So, this is expected to be yet another consequential visit for President Biden. Then we also expect him to deliver what is a continuation of speeches on his record on various topics. He gave a speech at the Brookings Institution back in December on his economic legacy. And we also expect, based on our conversations with aides, for him to highlight his work on climate and foreign policy in the coming weeks. Of course, as the forthcoming Trump administration looms large. But as far as policy. Kate, White House officials don't really expect to be able to advance much policy because of the expectation that anything they do in this 11th hour could be overturned by President- elect Trump and his team. So, certainly, this is going to be more about capstone events and trying to frame the narrative of Biden's presidency rather than trying to check off any last items from his campaign to do list.

Certainly better than most of our peer countries around the world.GDP growth is strong. Investment is strong. Unemployment is not at an all-time low, but - but close to historic lows. Inflation is, you know, always the outlier here. But even that has come down quite a bit. And it's not at the target, but it's - it's far below what its peak had been. And kind of a stone's throw from where the Federal Reserve would like it to be. All of those things suggest that the economy is doing quite well, that, you know, we seem to, you know, knock on wood, have pulled off - potentially pulled off this desired soft landing that the Federal Reserve has been trying to achieve. Now that - that doesn't mean that consumers are making things up, obviously, when they are frustrated by the economy because the price increases that we saw a couple of years ago are still very salient. You know, people are still experiencing price shock every time they go to the grocery store and perhaps wrongly anticipating that grocery prices are going to go back to what they were, which is not going to happen. Basically what the Fed is hoping for is instead that grocery prices and other prices kind of plateau. Not that they revert to what they were pre-pandemic, but that they plateau. So, the way a wonky economist would look at things would be to say, things look pretty good, even if consumers are still frustrated by what they've experienced over the past couple of years.",

You know, be the hype man that this U.S. economy needs because, as I said, it has a lot going for it, even if consumers aren't yet recognizing it. The kinds of policy measures that you just mentioned, you mentioned tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China. Remember, Trump has threatened them on all imports from around the world. And a lot of that, yes, he can do unilaterally. Some of it will be challenged in court. But the president has a lot of discretion to levy tariffs, particularly if he uses excuses or pretexts like national security, which he used quite a lot in his first administration. And so I think it's quite likely that he will do something.Now, we don't know what. We don't know if he's actually going to carry out the exact promises that he made on the campaign trail. Certainly, markets don't think that because if markets did believe him and take him at his word, you would see a lot more turmoil in the stock market because automakers, apparel maker, you know, retailers -",
