[06:05:00] But instead, it is, as you said, a very, very dense news cycle, with ground troops in Lebanon and strikes in Dahieh. And of course, the Iranian strike on Israel yesterday. I think that what the Iranian attack, the second massive Iranian attack on Israel does, it opens up a lot of opportunities. And at this time, I think Israel can choose between different groups of targets, all depending on, really, what the strategy is and what Israel wants to achieve. And, very importantly, what kind of support Israel can get from the U.S. and other Western countries. And in more detail, one group of targets would be -- yes, Erin?",

That's the second group. And then a third group, which of course, is perhaps the most sensitive currently, would be all of the infrastructure related to Iran's illicit nuclear weapons program. I think that Israel has had a lot of time over the years to collect intelligence, to assess and to prepare. Israel definitely has had a lot of time to prepare an air force attack against them. But I think it will boil down to what will Israel' s strategy be in, as in, where do we want to be half a year from now or a year from now?

But I think that there's a big, big opportunity here to perhaps do more regarding Iran's nuclear program than the world has failed to do in the last, I would say, seven to eight years. Perhaps more can be achieved. Yes, albeit with a certain rich [SIC] -- risk attached to it, no doubt.

I mean, you saw someone who was humble. And I don't know the last time we've seen a stage where we had a level of humility. Someone who admitted that he misspoke on a particular question, somebody who approached answering questions with their own life stories, with personable stories. I mean, he looked like Coach Walz. He looked like Tim Walz, the leader of the great state of Minnesota. He is not going to be J.D. Vance. When you read the transcript of this debate, J.D. Vance is a skilled debater. He's a skilled lawyer. But what also came across about J.D. Vance last night is a problem that many people have, which is that he's somewhat dishonest, but he doesn't stand for much.

One, you're going to have to teach me how to read off a teleprompter. Your team is. And two, I don't debate well. And so, that's something that the campaign knew coming into this, that he himself was a soap self-professed individual who does not debate well. J.D. Vance has that skill. Tim Walz does not, which leads to a little of that nervousness. And then the second thing is we have to disabuse ourselves of this notion that, all of a sudden, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are not talking to the media, because that's just fundamentally inaccurate. In every single swing state that Tim Walz goes to, he sits down with local media. He sits down with the press. He sits down with reporters. He does local news interviews. I mean, that is the fact. I mean, Kamala Harris does the same thing. Its funny people say Kamala Harris doesn't talk to the press when the fact is, she talks to the press. She just doesn't talk to the beltway press.

Vance and Donald Trump are doing several times many more interviews than both Kamala Harris and -- and Tim Walz. And that's a deliberate part of the strategy. Maybe it will work. But the fact is that they are getting in front of the media and taking more questions and getting more reps in. J.D.

This is the issues that are affecting their state. They only have a few minutes to do so. So, to your point, we can't be critical of the local media for not asking the very tough questions because they're asking the questions that are important to them at their time.
