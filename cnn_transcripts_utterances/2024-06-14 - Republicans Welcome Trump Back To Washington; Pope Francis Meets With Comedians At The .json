Walk us through this because clearly, they wanted to send this message. They wanted the symbolism. But as you write in your piece in the Times this morning, you say, \"Buried in the fine print of the security agreement they signed with flair lies this paragraph. 'Either party may terminate this agreement by providing a written notification through diplomatic channels that would take effect six months after.'\" DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL AND NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST, AUTHOR, \"NEW COLD WARS: CHINA'S RISE, RUSSIA'S INVASION, AND AMERICA'S STRUGGLE TO DEFEND THE WEST\":  That's absolutely right, Kasie, and that's really the critical thing because this is just an executive agreement. It's not a treaty, which mean it doesn't have to go through U.S. Senate and thus can avoid the kind of fight that you saw the -- just a few months ago over aid to Ukraine. But the bad news about executive agreements like this is that they can be overturned by the next executive. And that's exactly what former President Trump did in 2018 with the Iran nuclear accord. He simply ripped it up and walked away, and you saw the results. Iran is now probably closer to a weapon than it has ever been. So the big question would be can you sign a 10-year agreement and get the confidence it's supposed to build when, of course, you can't predict who is going to be president in just 10 months.",

As for Hezbollah and the north -- I mean, this has long been the fear that Israel would get involved in a second front up there.
