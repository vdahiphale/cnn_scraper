There's three tactical teams down there by the high school -- that's where their base is -- and they're running all the way down to the Androscoggin River here.I spoke with one police officer who says that they're likely going to be setting up a road closure on the other side of this search down the road towards Lewiston.

But last night, I believe, there was a pretty significant operation in north Gaza. What do we know about that?ERIN BURNETT, CNN ANCHOR, \"ERIN BURNETT OUTFRONT\":  Phil, you're right. It was, in fact, the biggest and the deepest ground assault on Gaza since this war began and perhaps, in the past 10 years. So while, of course, Israel is saying it was targeted and they had very specific goals with it -- they said they took out numerous terrorists without elaborating any further on the numbers -- the reality of it is this is extremely significant. There were tanks involved, bulldozers involved. We can see all that from the footage that the IDF provided. That is the footage that we have. Reporters were not on the scene to be able to actually see this. But it is very significant. It also comes as Israel has actually increased the number of people that it says were kidnapped in the October 7 attack, saying that number is now up to 224. This is as they identify more bodies but also as they get more intelligence from what's going on inside Gaza, which was a goal of this assault. But I think, Phil, you put your finger on it exactly. They're trying to say that it is targeted to show restraint internationally. But for the domestic audience here, they are showing that they are going in in a big, visible way -- in an extremely significant way. And those before and after images show you and emphasize that while we focus on a ground assault and what comes next in these next stages that we clearly started to see last night, the reality of it is Gaza has been decimated, specifically northern Gaza, although there are strikes, of course -- all the Gaza Strip. But those before and after images show what happens after what has been a devastating already 20- day war.",

There are homes up and down these streets that are kind of in these woods. And then there are homes kind of where we were before on property where there are multiple homes surrounded by woods. There's a lot, a lot of woods and that's what's, I think, complicating a lot of the search. I mean, there just really is nothing for law enforcement to go on right now. They say they have some intelligence. They have information and they're trying to center their search around that. But I think at this point, it's very clear to everyone here that they have no idea where this person is. And I think as this day goes on we're likely to see the search increase -- the intensity of it increase. Schools here are shut. They're urging people to stay home. There's a shelter-in-place. It's voluntary, obviously. They're not forcing people but they're telling people to stay home. They're telling people not to go to work. We are seeing people out driving.

What does that tell you about either the planning or the intent here?ANDREW MCCABE, CNN SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST  (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, it's hard to say with great clarity at this point, Phil. We know -- you know, if you look back at the -- at the shootings at the dance halls in California a couple of months ago, it almost seems at times these mass shooters who go to multiple locations -- if they're not stopped at the first location oftentimes they then are in a position that they didn't anticipate they would be in. And so, they kind of plan it on the fly as it where and end up at a -- at another spot. So that could be the case here. It's also possible that he picked these locations for some significance to him personally or to family members -- the issues that are driving him right now and had this planned out from advance. We won't know that until law enforcement gets an opportunity to engage with him, and that may never happen, or if we come across writings or a manifesto, or social media posts, or statements or comments to other individuals who in the aftermath may be able to shed some light on exactly why he did this. All of that is secondary to the question right now, which is where is this person. And I think each one of the law enforcement agencies that's engaged here has a unique toolkit to bring to that search.",

It's a very different situation than the escaped prisoner manhunt we had in Pennsylvania a few weeks ago.In this case, this man is from this area. He had access to transportation. He probably has access to funds -- to money or credit cards, debit cards. And he likely also has a cell phone. Any one of those things can provide the tip that law enforcement needs. So if they've identified his bank accounts, his credit cards, and those sorts of things, there's work that you can do with those companies to get alerts as to when those -- when those accounts have been accessed. If he's using a phone that's his -- that's subscribed to him or one that we can identify that he uses -- obviously, when people use cell phones you can sometimes triangulate their location based on the signals that cell towers receive from that phone when it's being used. It's also possible to get locational data from different websites and internet services -- social media and other things -- that collect that kind of data when you're using your account.
