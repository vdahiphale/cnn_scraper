      "sentences": "You are live in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington. My colleague, Jim Sciutto, is joining us live in northern Israel. Good evening, everybody.Just minutes ago, we learned of a new strike outside the borders of Gaza. Israel's military says it struck military infrastructure in Syrian territory. They say it's in response to launches coming from that country. Also new tonight, we're seeing this stunning video from the southern Russia Republic of Dagestan. Russian authorities saying a crowd waving Palestinian flags forced their way into an airport after a flight from Tel Aviv landed earlier tonight. Russian state media says the crowd was protesting the Israel-Hamas war. In Gaza City, an aid organization says nearby Israeli air strikes have caused extensive damage to the second largest hospital. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society says that's endangering the lives of patients, 12,000 displaced civilians are also sheltering there. And gunfire and explosions echo across much of Gaza, as Israel's ground offensive advances. Israeli troops appear to have advanced over two miles into Gaza, according to CNN analysis of video published by Israeli media outlet. Meanwhile, rockets continue to be fired from Gaza into Israel. Earlier today, President Biden spoke to Benjamin Netanyahu. Their phone conversation comes amid a stark warning from National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. He says there is an elevated risk of the conflict expanding across the region, and, quote, the risk is real. Let me bring in my colleague Jim Sciutto to talk about this. Jim, you know, that warning from Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, it is bearing out at least to some extent this evening, as we're getting this news that the Israelis have launched a strike on Syrian territory, running the risk, once again, of this conflict widening. How do you see things from your vantage point where you are, Jim? JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST:  Well, Jim, it's a reminder that what is already happening to some degree, it's a low grade war in the north, at least a conflict. The fire is going back and forth, not just across the border between Israel and Syria to the northeast, but between Israel and Lebanon to the north. We found ourselves in the midst of that today, cross -- in the cross fire of artillery fire from Israel into Lebanon, Lebanon, Hezbollah fighters into Israel. And it's happening multiple times a day, certainly not on the scale of what's happening in Gaza. But it is daily, and it's been sufficient to, in effect, evacuate the northern part of this country. Some of that is mandatory. Some of these towns and villages have been turned into military zones. And some of it is voluntary. Families making the decision that it's just no longer safe in the north. And they've moved south for safety, as many residents of southern Israel have moved north for safety. And, of course, the concern, Jim, is that Iran orders its proxies, such as Hezbollah, to expand that war even more. And then in that situation, Israel's looking at a multi-front war.",

      "sentences": "You know, Jim, thanks for having me. October 10th, the president set a pretty strong frame in which he sent a signal that he was prepared in response to the brutal slaughter on October 7th. And I think frankly is the new point of departure in the president's mind. But he sent an unmistakable message he was going to give the Israeli government the time, space, and support to do whatever it felt it needed to do with effect to Hamas in Gaza.I think that frame has devolved over the course of the last two weeks. The hostages played a role, and he pressed for time and space to seek negotiations on humanitarian issue. It's still unclear to me, Jim, why the trickle of aid coming through Rafah is not a tsunami by now. I think that has a lot to do with Israeli interests, Hamas interests, and Egyptian constraints as well. And he's pressed the Israelis to consider the implications, the consequences of a move to eradicate Hamas, and press them on the day after. So, I think the frame is evolving, particularly in view of the humanitarian catastrophe and the extraordinary loss of life on the Palestinian side, as the Israelis try to strike Hamas. However, let's be clear -- and I mentioned it earlier -- I think the main thrust in the president's mind is sequential. We would not be having this conversation tonight, had the events of October 7th not had occurred. And the world clearly is looking for moral consistency from the Biden administration. That is to say, what happened on October 7th was horrible, but so is what's happening to Palestinians in Gaza. And frankly, the president's demeanor, his temperament, I think he certainly angered and dismayed, I think, by the level of civilian casualties. I think the mainframe is going to remain the same.",

And we should remember, it's only three short weeks ago that the events of October 7th took place.But as you say, in the view of the Arab world, those were Queen Rania's word. Queen Rania of Jordan saying that -- from her perspective and Jordan, of course, is a very close U.S. ally, there's a double standard in terms of how civilian casualties are viewed. Kim Dozier, we saw today one example of where U.S. pressure has worked to some degree. And that is allowing the restoration of communications or at least some communications out of Gaza. Do we have any sense as to what U.S. pressure on the Israeli military to temper its military activities in Gaza, to minimize or reduce civilian casualties? Is there evidence that that pressure has made a difference on those operations?",

To date, they're certainly firing in this direction.By the way, that's having an effect. It's frightened thousands of residents out of the northern part of the country.

When the national security adviser in the United States of America publicly talks about fear and his concern over escalation, it's something that I think we need to take very seriously. They could be getting intel and chatter that Hezbollah's calculations, which for now, Jim, over the last three weeks, have, I think, remained within what I would call the rules of the game that the Israelis and Hezbollah have set since the last big encounter in the summer of 2006.We haven't seen the deployment in Hezbollah's high trajectory weapons, varying range in lethality. Some of those weapons can cover as much as 300, 400 kilometers from the border. I think Hezbollah's calculation is simply this. They know that Israel's international legitimacy is starting to erode. And they're prepared to fight Israel to the last Palestinian. Supporting Hamas to the degree they can. But Hamas has been pressing them, my understanding, for more engagement. And they resisted. And they resisted because, I think, Iran does not want to undermine its key asset in Lebanon. That's reserved for the prospects of an Israeli or an American strike against Iran's military conventional and unconventional sites. So, Hezbollah understands, you have two carrier strike groups with 200 strike aircraft, a position I think Dwight D. Eisenhower is there. And they know that if, in fact, you get into a huge fight, the U.S. may well get involved.",

So, we're seeing this.We saw Jewish students at Cornell not being able to leave the cafeteria. We saw a Jewish student the other day being locked the in a library. So, you know, this is something that we're seeing all across the world, in which Jews are being targeted. Again, this is a debate that has gone from the Mideast conflict, the war that's going on between Hamas and Israel, and this has now gone to dramatic antisemitism to the lengths we have not seen since World War II. The Jewish community had been warning, by the way, that the antisemitic attacks are on the rise. We've been seeing it year over year over year, online, especially on social media.

The warning signs of the former student were everywhere, killing animals, police coming to the house dozens of times, tips to the FBI. He had a file at the school board a mile long.Everyone knew that that kid was in trouble. And yet people who are mentally ill in this country can go and get a weapon. And here in in the state of Florida, we stopped that. We passed red flag laws. We raised the age to 21. Within three weeks on a bipartisan basis, signed by Republican Governor Rick Scott, now U.S. Senator Rick Scott, to make sure that something like that didn't happen again. So, it's deeply troubling, Jim. We have to figure out in this country how we can recognize that, yes, there is a robust Second Amendment that we have to respect. But at the same time can we at least agree that mentally ill people should not be able to get weapons of war. I know what that community is going through. The funerals, the parents that a kid is not coming home, a spouse that now there is an empty chair at the dinner table. Those people will never be the same. That community will never be the same. Six years later, the city of Parkland is not the same. Those families haven't moved on. They've moved forward.

It gives you a sense of the scope of the war, how Israel is fighting this, in effect, on multiple fronts right now. Although of course the principle front remains its expanding military activity inside Gaza in response to the October 7th attacks. Our Nic Robertson is in southern Israel. He's been watching this closely since the beginning. And, Nic, tomorrow, just like on Friday, in fact, when there was a U.N. resolution calling for an immediate truce in Gaza, there will be another gathering at the U.N. Security Council to apply more pressure on Israeli officials to limit their campaign.

There are now two U.S. carrier strike groups in the eastern Mediterranean, and also we learned today about the addition of a marine rapid response force to the region. Our Oren Liebermann is at the Pentagon. And we should be clear, Oren, as we discuss this, that those U.S. forces, they are not involved in Israeli military operations in Gaza.

That includes the land forces, nearly 1,000 troops, as well as a patriot battalion and the FAAD battery, those are air defense systems but also the naval forces we have seen two carrier strike groups, one already in the Eastern Med, and one very close, as well as an amphibious assault group.And that's what we're looking at right now, the U.S. Bataan, an amphibious assault ship, and marine rapid response force, the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit that had been operating in the past several weeks in the waters of the Middle East. Two U.S. officials tell us it's in the Red Sea set to pass through the Suez Canal and will be in the Eastern Mediterranean quite soon, essentially swapping places over the next few days with one of those carrier strike groups. Now, why is this significant? First, it's obviously another show of force here, as the U.S. sends considerable fire power and a considerable show of force to try to send the message to Iran and Iranian proxies as a show of deterrence. But crucially, one of the mission essential tasks of that marine rapid response force, the marine expeditionary unit, known as the MEU in short hand, is not only special operations but also evacuations of non-combatant evacuation operation known as a NEO. Now, earlier last week, John Kirby, the strategic coordinator for the National Security Council said it would be irresponsible and prudent to not plan for a possibility of an evacuation, although there was no execution of that yet. However, the U.S. has warned the region is still at risk of wider escalation. That's perhaps why the marine force response force is moving very close to Israel and Lebanon -- Jim.",
