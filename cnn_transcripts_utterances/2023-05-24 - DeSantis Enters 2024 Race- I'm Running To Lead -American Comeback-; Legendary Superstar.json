The Florida Governor's campaign, they tried to play it off, as breaking the internet, with so much excitement. But political opponents are already pouncing Trump. He posted this, on social media. \"Wow. The DeSanctus TWITTER launch is a DISASTER. His whole campaign will be a disaster. WATCH.\" And Biden's campaign trolled him, on Twitter, tweeting a link, to the campaign's fundraising page, with this message, \"This link works.\" The live launch did finally happen, after about a half an hour.

According to new CNN polling, the Governor has his work cut out for him. He is trailing behind Trump by more than half, among Republicans and Republican-lean voters. Trump is at 53 percent. DeSantis, he's at 26 percent. And we should note that the survey, it was taken before he announced, and also before Senator Tim Scott announced, as well. David Chalian would join us in a moment. To our panel, Molly Ball, recently wrote TIME's cover story, on DeSantis. She is the National Political Correspondent for the magazine. And we're also joined by Jason Osborne, former Trump campaign adviser; and Jamal Simmons, former Communications Director for Vice President Kamala Harris. Molly, who could have seen this coming that Twitter, which has been a place that has been very glitchy, just for the average user, didn't seem to be able to handle this.

But when he has to get, on the national stage, and stumbles right out of the gate, it certainly, I think, puts a dent, in that competence argument, and the argument he's trying to make against Trump, which is that he's the one, who essentially can make the trains run on time, and be, have all of the same policy views, but without the chaos, and without the drama.",

Instead, we got Dana Loesch and Christopher Rufo, both, conservative activist types, asking questions that are basically softballs, at DeSantis. The subs -- they were talking about Dogecoin, Cryptocurrency, and he used the phrase, at one point, \"Accreditation cartels.\" I don't know what that means.

DeSantis has basically passed up the opportunity for all of that. And so, where are the nice pictures, out of his campaign launch that can run with the newspaper story, tomorrow? And I know you want to talk about substance. Where's the message? Where is the meaty sort of thing that he wants to impart to America, right? He says \"Great American comeback.\" So what does that mean? What are people going to take away from this? If you're a rank-and-file Republican voter, who's legit undecided, and really wants to shop around, and understand all the candidates, and where they're coming from?

It's going to go through months and months of engagement, now.But I think what is interesting to look at here as well is where the race has been. So, compare today's snapshot, 53 percent for Trump, DeSantis, 26 percent, to where this was a little over two months ago. In March, it was much closer, between DeSantis and Trump. We know what has happened in the interim there, which is that Donald Trump, and his allies, had been hammering away, at Ron DeSantis, day after day, seeing him as the most significant threat, and wanting to get his numbers down, before today's launch. And they did so, successfully. So now, DeSantis will have to build from an even weaker position than he initially was in. But Abby, take a look, when we asked Republicans. And this, I think, gets to the unsettled nature, of this contest, and why there's opportunity here. We asked folks, who would you consider supporting, beyond just the person you said is your first choice, in the poll? And vast majorities, of Republicans, and Republican leaners, said they're open to both Donald Trump, and Ron DeSantis. 85 percent said they would consider Ron DeSantis, if they, in addition to picking him, as a candidate. 84 percent said that for Trump. And smaller majorities said that for Nikki Haley, 61 percent, or Tim Scott, 60 percent. Even Mike Pence has a slim majority, of Republican and Republican leaders, who say they are open to supporting him. Now, flip that, Abby, and you'll see, we asked, \"How about not willing to consider support at all?\" This is a real trouble sign for some folks, who even aren't in the race yet, like Chris Christie, 60 percent of Republican and Republican leaners say they will not consider him, for support, this cycle. 55 percent say that about Asa Hutchinson, and Chris Sununu. And you see all the way down there. Even Mike Pence, and this is his overall problem, 45 percent of Republicans and leaners say they won't consider him.

And they have raised $30 million, already. $85 million, DeSantis has stacked away, in State Political Committees that he and his team believe they're going to be able to move over, into a presidential campaign that may be tested legally. Donald Trump, as of March 31, at the end of the first quarter, he had $13.9 million. Now, remember, that quarter ended with his criminal indictment, in Manhattan, which by the way, his campaign said, at the time, was helping him raise money, like gangbusters, in the day of the indictment, and the days, thereafter. We won't see those figures though, until the second quarter comes to a close, and they have to file by July 15.

It has been a strange 24 hours, in Texas politics.To take you back to yesterday, really, out of the blue, Attorney General, Ken Paxton, put out a statement, in which he called House Speaker Dade Phelan, called on him to resign, because he alleged that the Speaker was drunk, while presiding, over a late-night session, of the House, couple weeks ago. There's some video in which the Speaker is slurring his words, at a couple points. The Speaker says he was simply tired. We're not entirely sure, what's the bottom of that. Now, it turns out a couple hours, after the Attorney General had made that claim, an Investigative Committee, in the House, announced that it was in fact investigating Attorney General Paxton, had been investigating him, in secret, since March. Now, that Committee met again, this morning. It heard testimony from four investigators it had hired. Three hours of testimony, in which these investigators laid out what, essentially, is a pattern of alleged misconduct, on behalf of the Attorney General, to benefit a friend, and real estate developer, in Austin. So, that raises the prospect of -- we're almost at the end of our legislative session. It ends on Monday. Clearly, the House is taking this seriously. The question now, in the Capitol, is will this committee recommend some sort of punishment, against the Attorney General, the most severe, which would be impeachment?",

He has been under FBI investigation that we know of since 2020, related to the same series of allegations, related to this friend, and real estate developer, in Austin. Voters, repeatedly, in two elections, including the one just in November, have said that they were willing to tolerate these issues, with the Attorney General. They reelected him twice. And so far, nothing has come criminally, in terms of indictments, from the FBI investigation. Now, today's news, it's kind of hard to overstate how stunning it is that this committee, in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, and now is the most serious political threat that the Attorney General has faced, in a long time, they have the power to impeach him. And, of course, then the Senate would have to decide, whether to convict him, and with the House, remove him from office. So, this is a serious issue.",
