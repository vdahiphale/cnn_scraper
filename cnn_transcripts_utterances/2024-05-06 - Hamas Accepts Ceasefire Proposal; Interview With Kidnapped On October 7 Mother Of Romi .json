Hello, everyone, and welcome to \"Amanpour.\" I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour, who will be back next week. Well, big news just into CNN, Hamas says that it has agreed to a ceasefire proposal from Egypt and Qatar. No word yet from the Israeli side. This just after Israel started warning Palestinians in Eastern Rafah to evacuate immediately. The clearest sign yet that an offensive may be soon. Correspondent Jeremy Diamond joins us now live from Jerusalem with the latest. Jeremy, it is a bit like a whiplash here. We were just talking a few minutes ago about how imminent that operation into Rafah would be. It appeared that hostage and ceasefire deals were all but broken. And now, this news from the head of Hamas' political bureau that they have accepted the proposal from Qatar and Egypt. What more are you learning?",

But to your one point as to why perhaps now one could view this as a victory for some on the far-right in the Netanyahu government who say, you see the pressure of going into Rafah is what had them change their mind. That having been said, Jeremy, we have been in a place before where there had been a disagreement within Hamas itself and its leadership on where things stand and what they will and will not agree to. And a lot still rides on where Yahya Sinwar. is on this. Obviously, he's the Hamas leader who is believed to currently still be in Gaza in Rafah. Talk about that component because we've been here before.",

Andyou're right, there is very difficult -- it's very difficult for Hamas' leadership outside of Gaza to contact Yahya Sinwar, Hamas' leader, inside of Gaza. And often, it actually takes days for those messages to go back and forth. And that's why sometimes these negotiations, each step can take quite a significant amount of time. So, it's not impossible, but it is difficult to imagine that Yahya Sinwar would have delivered a message within hours after the Israeli military began to evacuate parts of Rafah, signaling that it was preparing for a major ground offensive there. So, whether or not that actually played a factor here is difficult to say at this point. But certainly, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has always insisted, always believed that it was military pressure that would lead Hamas to -- back to the negotiating table, back to making an agreement. And the Israeli military also believes that that military pressure led to that last ceasefire that we saw at the end of November. So, again, we will have to report it out over the coming hours and days exactly what led to this change of heart from Hamas, apparent change of heart, or perhaps whether other changes have been made here that will therefore make the Israeli government refuse this latest proposal. So, again, just urging a lot of caution, even as we report what is a really significant statement in a really critical moment in time from Hamas.",

Those people that are still alive, the one that are already murdered, they need us to be very strong, even when we see this kind of videos. Yes, it's a proof life.

So, you are so right to point out and continue to send and deliver messages to Romi and the other hostages that are there in Gaza. Let me ask you, Meirav, this news that, again, we keep getting in by the minute about a possible deal and a ceasefire deal of falling apart. Now, it looks like it's back on the table. And all of this, hovering over it, is a possible incursion into Rafah that appears to be more and more imminent.

So, my heart goes out to her in these difficult moments. What we know at this point is what the Hamas statement says, which is that they have agreed to the ceasefire proposal on the table by the Egyptians. We don't know whether it is the same proposal that Israel had a significant input into crafting with the Egyptians, which was submitted to the Egyptians up last week, we don't know whether any changes have been made to that proposal since it was put on the table and what has actually changed since yesterday and over the weekend as this Hamas delegation was in Cairo. You know, they were holding meetings and they ultimately left without an agreement because they were continuing to insist -- according to two of my Israeli sources, they were continuing to insist on an Israeli commitment to end the war as part of this ceasefire agreement, something that the Israeli government has been unwilling to agree to so far. So, a lot of questions, a lot of uncertainty. I've been on the phone trying to reach Israeli officials. So, far sources don't have a ton of information about exactly what Hamas has agreed to, and we are still waiting for an official response from the Israeli government. So, we're going to let that play out for a bit and see where things land.

We think we know what the framework agreement was that the Egyptians presented to the Israelis and to the Hamas leadership. The fact that the announcement came from Ismail Haniyeh, as the head of Hamas, is significant. And it seems to indicate that the exiled leadership in Qatar was able to impose its will on the leadership inside of Gaza on Yahya Sinwar, but that's also not 100 percent known. I would not -- I could not believe that Haniyeh would make such an announcement like that without having the agreement of the Gaza leadership as well. So, I think we can believe that Hamas is genuine. And I think they did the right thing. The ball is now in the court of Israel, and Netanyahu is going to have to bring this deal to his cabinet and get it approved, even though he had temporary approval from the cabinet beforehand. Now, his day of reckoning with his hardliners and his own cabinet are going to come who have threatened to leave the government and bring it down if the agreement doesn't meet their demands.",

And this the great failing of the Israeli government and a disaster for the region, in fact, because there needs to be a Palestinian credible, legitimate body that takes control of Gaza, eventually unites with the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, and eventually, somewhere down the road, leads to new Palestinian elections. And of course, the rebuilding of Gaza.

They have been talking to Arab leaders, from Jordan and Egypt and the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia and perhaps others who have all said that if there is a Palestinian invitation to these countries to send peacekeeping troops to Gaza that they would likely to agree. And this what's necessary also to have a legitimate alternative Palestinian leadership in Gaza in order to raise money from the International Community in order to rebuild Gaza after the horrendous damage that's been done as a result of this war. Israel under Netanyahu will oppose this, which is why we in Israel need to get to new elections as soon as possible. The majority of Israelis want to go to elections.

And what they described to me is a situation where it may be, it may be that Ismail Haniyeh of Hamas has agreed to the terms of an agreement, the one that the Hamas says is the Qatar-Egypt proposition that isn't actually, at the moment, completely to Israel's liking. Now, from my understanding of the situation, we could be at a moment where something could be added on, an amendment, let's say, perhaps, to the agreement, and that could help push things along and get it to where Israel needs it to be. My understanding over the weekend had been that there were certain guarantees that were being sought from Qatar in the process to try to make this agreement work. So, it seemed as not a huge surprise that CIA Director Bill Burns went to Qatar. And we know obviously that the Hamas delegation went there to convene amongst themselves, they said over the weekend. So, the latest reporting that we have from Becky Anderson certainly seems to comport with details that I've been receiving and other colleagues have been receiving that there has been this pressure on Hamas. And as you were mentioning that what appeared this morning as if it was an eminent ground offensive on Hamas could have also been perceived by seasoned negotiators as a pressure tactic on Hamas with Prime Minister Netanyahu, the IDF have said all along, the only way to really free the hostages is to apply military pressure to Hamas. And if that was the intent, then perhaps that additional pressure around the table in Doha was a significant factor. But also in a negotiation, both parties, if they're going to step away from the table, want to make it look as if the other party is failing and wrong foot the other party. So, by Hamas saying that they agree to something that we understand potentially may not be fully what Israel wants and will accept, again, could be a negotiating position their part to try to wrong- foot Israel, because if Israel really was ready for that offensive into Rafah, that's a very forward-leaning military position. A lot of troops will have been moved. A lot of armor will have been moved. A lot of things will have been readied. So, none of that gets moved back easily. So, of course, while we wait for Israel to announce its position and potentially other details are hammered out behind the scenes it is -- it does appear at the moment as if Hamas has put Prime Minister Netanyahu on the back foot.",

Which raises the -- you know, it's not for nothing that Middle East negotiations really only have two speeds, slow and slower. And this negotiation is perversely complicated, by the fact that the primary Palestinian decision maker is sitting in a tunnel, ensconced below Khan Younis, Rafah, or maybe even in a tunnel in Sinai, below ground. And Ismail Haniyeh, the political head of Hamas, is making statements on his behalf. I mean, they're just -- there are a lot of things we don't know. What is the Egyptian-Qatari ceasefire agreement? How closely does it correspond to the want -- to the Israeli position that Secretary of State Blinken, in a sense, locking himself in to supporting Israel described as extremely generous? Is this a commitment to do a, to the first phase, which is 33 hostages, the women whose position is increasingly fraught, the elderly and the infirm in exchange for up to a thousand Palestinian prisoners, a hundred of whom are either accused or charged with killing Israelis? And the Israelis would redeploy from key areas in Gaza and limit their overflight activities during the period where the hostages are being exchanged for prisoners? All set within a 40-day time frame, and then move on to phase two, which would be an indirect negotiation to seek out a more durable period of calm in which all of the hostages would be released in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners.

MILLER: That is 100 percent correct. And Bill Burns, who's established a very close relationship -- CIA director, established a very close relationship with Mossad Director David Barnea. If Bill Burns has been monitoring, reviewing, presiding over this, then he is acutely aware of what the Israelis initially agreed to. He's also acutely aware of what the margin is between what Hamas wants, additional assurances that at least the Egyptians, apparently and the Qataris are willing to provide and what the Biden administration is prepared to do and he'll presumably be briefing Jake Sullivan, Tony Blinken and the president on where that delta is, if in fact there is a delta. Then it comes down to the question of the government of Israel. And to borrow a phrase from one of -- from my -- one of my former bosses, James Baker, who was a master of observing what he called the dead cat on the doorstep strategy, it may well be that Hamas has maneuvered itself into a situation where that dead cat is on the doorstep of Benjamin Netanyahu.

As you know, Director Burns is in the region working on this in real-time. We will be discussing this response with our partners over the coming hours. We continue to believe that a hostage deal is in the works. It's in the best interest of the Israeli people. It's in the best interest of the Palestinian people. It would bring an immediate ceasefire. It would allow increased movement of humanitarian assistance. And so, we're going to continue to work to try to reach one.",

As we have said for some time, there has been a significant offer on the table. The ball has been in Hamas' court. We have made clear that they should accept that offer, that Israel made significant compromises, showed that they wanted to reach an agreement that would lead to the release of hostages, that would bring an immediate ceasefire. And we have hoped that Hamas would take the deal that was on the table. Now, as to what's in their response, what it looks like, we're going to review that and withhold judgment until we've had a chance to conduct a full review. John.",

In the hours before this, there are lots of reports aboutevacuations, not just reports, but Israel is talking about evacuations from Rafah. How does this -- what's the U.S. message of this now? Do you think that Israel should hold off on any operations in Rafah as we discuss this response? M. MILLER: Of course, we do. We've made quite clear our position Rafah for some time, which is that we cannot support an operation in Rafah as it is currently envisioned. We have made clear, the secretary made this clear in his conversations with Prime Minister Netanyahu and other members of the Israeli government last week that we have not seen humanitarian plan that is credible and that is implementable. And we believe a military operation in Rafah right now would dramatically increase the suffering of the Palestinian people, would lead to an increase in loss of civilian life, would dramatically disrupt the delivery of humanitarian assistance, all of which is coming through. I shouldn't say all, but the great majority of which is coming through Kerem Shalom or Rafah and is being distributed inside the Rafah area. If you think about what it would do when you have people moving north to places where internal distribution lines are not currently set up, and you're going to have to try to reestablish those in the middle of conflict in Rafah, we think that would be very difficult, if not impossible to do. So, even absent this latest response, we have made clear that we do not support Israel launching a full-scale military operation in Rafah.",

MILLER: I'm just not going to get into our -- those conversations. As I said, we just literally in the past hour, 90 minutes received that response from Hamas in the first place. Of course, we will be discussing it with Egypt, with Qatar, with Israel, the three countries with whom we have been working throughout this negotiation process. But I don't want to get into the timing of those. But obviously, if we have -- if those conversations have not already started, they will be ongoing in the next several hours.",

We've seen the announcement they made today about evacuation orders for not the entire -- not entire Southern Gaza, not the entire Rafah area, but for a significant portion of it, 100,000 people. And I -- of course, we have concerns that any evacuation at all in such a crowded area, if you see 100,000 people move, you're going to see other people in the next area move as well, which, of course, is something that you want to see happen if there's a military operation. But the problem now is there's such limited places for them to go inside Gaza, and there is no effective way to distribute them -- distribute aid to them and make sure they have access to shelter, access to sanitation in the places that they would go if, say, you had hundreds of thousands of people moving from Rafah.",
