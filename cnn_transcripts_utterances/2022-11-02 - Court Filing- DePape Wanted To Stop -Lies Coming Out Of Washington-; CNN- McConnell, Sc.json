But look, I mean, you know, just what the court documents said yesterday, you know, the irony of this being that the assailant was what he said was he was motivated by the lies coming out of Washington. And the irony is that, you know, the lies that are coming from some of our elected leaders with regard to this attack is what's probably going to fuel additional similar incidents, right?And that's one of the things that the Capitol Police is trying to address. We know, for instance, that they had cameras that captured him getting into the house, into the home of the Pelosi's, but because the Speaker of the House was not there, those cameras are not monitored, you know, at the same time, so they caught it after the fact after they saw the lights of the police cars at the scene. So there's clearly going to be need -- a need for more resources for the Capitol Police to be able to protect members of Congress and perhaps even their family members with the help of local authorities.

And some people including supporters of Rick Scott say too conservatively. Rick Scott, on the other hand, has been sort of standing behind more controversial candidates has been sort of coming in where Senate Leadership Fund, which is the McConnell aligned Super PAC has been pulling out.It's a different strategy. It's a more ambitious. Of course a lot of Republicans think Rick Scott wants to run for president. And some McConnell allies say, essentially, he's used this perch to promote himself and not necessarily the best interests of Senate Republicans.

And listen, you heard Biden sort of make use of one of the things that Rick Scott was saying about maybe they would cut Social Security and Medicare if the Republicans take over. So he's made Republicans a target in some instances. And listen, I do think it's about burnishing his identity, creating an identity in many ways, because I think nationally, he's not very well known among Republicans, certainly not MAGA Republicans.

I went through this late last night reading and reading and reading through the data trying to find, well, there must be a silver lining for Democrats in here somewhere. I can't find it in this poll.

It's not very strong of those who disapprove of him. It's quite strong. And so that intensity is what's fueling this higher enthusiasm on the Republican side.

But if Democrats and Republicans feel a little bit more optimistic about their own economic situation, I think there's an opportunity there to talk about things that are going well, things that are improving, things that were better than a couple years ago, and what our plan is for next and talk about optimism.And I think I also wouldn't think, you know, the notion that things in the country are not going well is that automatically hurt Democrats. And I would push back on that, I don't feel good about the way things are in the country, not because of the way that of what's happening in Congress and what Democrats have been able to do with the President. But because of misinformation and division and negative campaigning from the other side and lies and the fact that people are, you know, trying to promote chaos and doubt of the election results.
