They're still trying to get the agriculture, the food supply, the supply chain disruption from this storm, kind of adding to a weather created mess in this region. There are flights from here in Taiwan to Vietnam that are being canceled today after a ton of flights were canceled in Hong Kong. This storm -- you showed the video from Hainan, it also made landfall in Guangdong. You had almost 600,000 people and counting who were evacuated along with nearly a million power outages, 800,000 plus. So, Vietnam's next on the list here. And we're talking about these storms, as you know, Richard, more and more. And what's scary for people, even in places like here in Taiwan where you get hit by typhoons a lot this time of year, you know, Hainan, it is called China's Hawaii, but this is not the tourist season, that doesn't begin until November, because people here -- around here know that this kind of storms will happen. You know, the coastal areas, after getting walloped repeatedly, they tend to build up, they tend to reinforce themselves. The last, you know, super typhoon back in 2014, you had dozens of deaths, billions in damage, and everybody's hoping that things will be better this time around. But with these storms getting more powerful, Richard, who knows?",

That's the area that really picked up the storm surge. We don't have great pictures yet. And we may not get them for days because the infrastructure may not be in very good shape. Making landfall at 230 kilometers per hour. So, losing 10 kilometers per hour before it made landfall. But there is the eye. There is Haikou right there, right there, and it went right over the top. The people there along the shore may have actually seen blue sky, or stars there in the center of the eye as it went over. Now, watch the last frame here. This is very interesting and we see this a lot. See this stuff in the middle of the eye? Those are likely birds that have been caught in the eye, picked up by the storm. They have nowhere to go and they're not going to get out of that eye until the storm dies. They will end up in Vietnam. Here's the pictures you're talking about. These little cylinders here are actually where people would be sitting in the Ferris wheel. And we're happy that was not working. Here's Yagi right now, 194 kilometers per hour and it is still moving. And I can see the eye again, which means that the storm is not losing much intensity. It's not a super typhoon anymore, but it's not losing anything. It's not really tearing itself up. Look at the winds here at 255 millimeters. That's 10 inches of rainfall. Winds over 151. And I think it went well above that. That just -- that's just one spot that picked up 151. I'm sure there are places that picked up 200 and may not even know it because the wind vane may not even be working anymore. But 213 as it makes landfall later tonight there in Vietnam. Very close to Hanoi. And this is the problem. Yes, Hanoi is a little bit farther inland, but there is still going to be a tremendous amount of rainfall. There will be widespread rain over 250 millimeters. And I know if you played the other English, that's 10 inches of rain and some spots up to 15 inches of rain as we slide almost up there to 500 millimeters. So, a devastating night here for the people are morning -- early morning now for the people of Vietnam. It's still to come. It's lost some intensity, but this was a big storm and it's still a very impressive storm even at this hour. Richard.",

China is halting most foreign adoptions of its children, leaving hundreds of families uncertain about what happens next. The only exceptions will be for those who already have a family connection. For decades, overseas parents have adopted thousands of Chinese children, many of whom were abandoned under the country's draconian one child policy. Now, China is looking to reverse the country's population decline. The former U.S. vice president, Dick Cheney, says he will be voting for the Democrat Kamala Harris in November's election. Mr. Cheney is a Republican who served as former vice president, George W. Bush's vice president. He warned that Donald Trump, in his words, can never be trusted with power again. Mr. Cheney's daughter, the former House Republican, Liz Cheney, also says she will vote for Harris and says she will campaign against Trump in battleground states. Donald Trump will not be sentenced for his criminal hush money conviction until after the presidential election. Judge Juan Merchan said he will not sentence Trump until November the 26th. The delay is, in his words, to avoid the appearance of swaying the vote. Mr. Trump was originally set to be sentenced this month. He was convicted in May on all 34 counts of falsifying business records related to hush money payments to the adult film star Stormy Daniels. Following news of the delay, Mr. Trump talked to social media. He called the case a witch hunt and a political attack. The implications of this decision? I'm joined by James Sample, professor of law at Hofstra University. Interesting. Judge Merchan had been very clear, very hard during -- I mean, you know, fair, but hard during the case that he was going to get on with it regardless. But eventually, it just can't -- it can't withstand the election, can it? It has -- the election has to come first in a sense.",

Donald Trump was held in contempt 10 separate times during the course of the proceedings here. No defendant ever, in any context, gets 10 bites at the contempt apple without suffering consequences. So, yes, Mr. Trump has been treated, in a sense, with greater deference because of who he is politically, but that doesn't mean -- that's not a blank check. At some point, Judge Merchan, who's also been very respectful of the jury and even in his remarks today, noted that that is one of the things that he's taking into account, that the jury's verdict, they devoted their time their energy, they're the ones who saw all of the evidence.
