Theoretically, I mean?MICHAEL SHERWIN, FORMER ACTING U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA: Look, that's a great question. And this just goes to show that divorced of what people are saying about who wants this to go quickly or slowly. Even a regular army officer getting a security clearance or someone at Department of State, sometimes it takes months, it could take six to 12 to 18 months to get clearance. Now, you could expedite that, but this is something that's built into a national security case, a counterintelligence case that divorced of how fast or slow parties want this to move. There are things that have to occur at the pace of the government that is inherent in slowing this case down. And you know, talking about Judge Cannon, you know, right now, I think she's probably the most important actor in this whole thing. It's not Garland, it's not Jack Smith, it's not Trump, it's the judge, because she will set the temper, the tone and the pace of this trial, you know, over the next 12 to -- six to 12 to 18 months. And it's the butterfly effect. It's these small rulings, like the five days for security clearance. What's going to happen with the pretrial motion practice? What's going to happen with the gag order? Is she going to institute a gag order?

And that was just in the last week, since last Thursday when Trump posted that he had been indicted. Of course, that was how we found out that he was actually indicted, is because he alerted us.So they certainly are using it to fundraise. I mean, they're making this is exactly what happened after Manhattan. They used it after he was indicted in Manhattan, I should note. They used it to raise a lot of money. They're doing that here. They had a fundraiser with -- it was bigger donors. Typically, most of his donations are small dollar donations right after he was arraigned in Miami. And so this is something they'll continue to fundraise off of and continue to use as he is on the campaign trail, while he is simultaneously dealing with his attorneys, getting security clearances, figuring out who those attorneys are going to be. COATES: And the prosecutors are going to be salivating in part. I mean, just look back at the town hall when he mentioned E. Jean Carroll. A judge then allowed those statements that he made, obviously, the civil trial, very different than the criminal context to then be a part of an amended complaint in her pursuit of damages. Everything it requires to raise that level of money, the level of bombasticity, the idea of how charismatic, what you have to reference to get the crowds going, big donors to smaller donors, all are going to be little breadcrumbs for a prosecutor to envelop possibly into a case. Remember, the indictment already has the 2016 statements he's made in the past, so they are already well in tune with possible traps. It's a minefield from here on out, his attorneys are going to -- you mention the gag order, whether it's a court ordered one or the attorneys impose one, and say, listen, everything you say is now going to be fair game, every single thing you reference and intimate fair game.

So, under double jeopardy if the government proceeds in South Florida, this is obstruction and this is retention of classified information. So if the government loses in South Florida, they can't just under double jeopardy, not bring the case in New Jersey.Now, New Jersey is interesting because according to press reports and other types of, you know, things we've seen in the media, it appears that Trump -- it's alleged that he showed classified information to individuals. So that's dissemination of classified information that has not been charged in South Florida. So theoretically, if the government loses in Miami, they could bring a dissemination case in New Jersey.

I rewatched the two speeches.In Mar-a-Lago when he was talking after New York, he barely even mentioned that case. It was a few lines, and then he dismissed it and was talking about unrelated grievance. In Bedminster, he spent a lot of time basically laying out his defense for this, talking about the Presidential Records Act, talking about how -- what he believes he had the right to do versus what other presidents had done. He kind of was way more in the weeds. I'm not saying it's a good defense strategy, that's obviously for others to judge, but he was much more going through it, and that's because he's always been much more worried about the documents case. And he understands the peril that he's in, the legal peril he's in this. So, yes, he is talking a lot about it, but it also is revealing of just how much more concerned he is with it.",

And if they do, they're harmful to the United States or could aid in our foreign allies or foreign adversaries work. And so, this underscores the gravitas associated those who have the authority to have documents and either misuse it or never had it to begin with. Remember, the nature of his work as an Air National Guardsman left him able to access the documents, but unrelated to an actual security level of clearance for him. He should not have had access fully to the documents nor to disseminate the way he did. So this just shows you any conversation about, well, no one ever is prosecuted for cases like this.
