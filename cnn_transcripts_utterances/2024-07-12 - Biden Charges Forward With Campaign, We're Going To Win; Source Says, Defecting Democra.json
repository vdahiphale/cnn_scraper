Well, tonight, if Democrats were hoping for death by 213 defections or intimidation by editorial boards, they won't get it. The Washington Post Editorial Board is now joining the likes of The New York Times, calling for Biden to quit and calling for his closest friends to tell him the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth about his electoral prospects. But a source close to Joe Biden telling me tonight that it would require a lot more for the president to forfeit the Democratic nomination beyond Lord Almighty, as Biden puts it. Now, this is all in response to Democrats, among them Nancy Pelosi, who have said Joe Biden needs to decide and decide now about if he's in or out. The quotes from a key Biden ally I spoke to leave little if any wiggle room. Quote, he has decided, he has made up his mind, he is driving. Can governors do anything? Can senators do anything? My source says, well, maybe, but it is a big if, and it would require convincing the campaign that polls have just utterly collapsed, endangering the White House even more, plus the Senate, plus the House. Speaking of Biden's evoking of Lord Almighty, allies of Biden have told him he needs to tone down the indignation and move closer to what my source called his real core. More honey and less vinegar. Perhaps that's what we saw on display at his solo press conference last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: I think I'm the best call -- I know, I believe I'm the best qualified to govern. And I think I'm the best qualified to win.

What was that moment like? REP. NORMA TORRES (D-CA): Well, it's good to be with you today, Pamela. That moment was very unfortunate timing from Congressman Levin. I think it was not the time for him to utilize our time to tell that to the to the president. Any one of us, any member of Congress can put out a press release and tell the president whatever they want to tell. But I think that that was -- that schedule call, in my opinion, we were supposed to be talking about the campaign and how could we help the president in this campaign, and how could we move forward with an endorsement that has already been given to the president over a month or two ago.

So, let's get on the bus and let's continue to work on winning the House, on keeping the Senate and winning back the White House.

It's a matter of making sure he knows -- you pick your time.It's a terrible analogy, but I was thinking, you have a team of producers and people, editorials, and if you had a meeting with them at 2:00 and someone sees there's something in your teeth, they don't need to jump out in the middle of the meeting and say, Pam, you got something in your teeth.

And we looked at the calendar and you know what? He is right. Since the CNN debate on June 27th, take a look at this right here. The day after Donald Trump held an event in Virginia and did a T.V. interview, then all those days you see shaded in yellow, he held zero public events. And on the days you see the phones, well, we didn't see him either, even though he called into radio shows. The only exceptions, a rally at his resort and a meeting with an autocrat at Mar-a-Lago. Both, of course, not much of a travel burden. They came to him. Of course, all that changes next week when the convention starts and Trump is teasing his V.P. finalists, adding a fourth name to the mix.
