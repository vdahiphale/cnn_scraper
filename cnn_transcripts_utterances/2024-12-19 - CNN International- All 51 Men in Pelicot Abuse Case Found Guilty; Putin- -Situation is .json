Also ahead, all 51 defendants in the horrific Pelicot rape trial have been found guilty, although a number of them given sentences that were much shorter than expected and requested. Plus accused CEO killer Luigi Mangione is in court where he is expected to waive extradition to New York. And Russian President Vladimir Putin answering questions about the war in Ukraine in his end of year news conference. The stock market here in New York set to open, of course, just about 30 minutes from now, not a lot of movement. When we look at futures at this hour, investors still digesting, of course, the Fed's revised outlook for rates in 2025 after that Fed news, the DOW dropped, falling for a 10th straight day. We're going to see, of course, what Thursday brings. We do begin this hour, though, in France with just a search for a woman who has become an icon in the fight against sexual violence. Gisele Pelicot was mobbed by supporters and the media leaving court today her former husband, Dominique, and 50 other men found guilty of rape and sexual assault abuse he coordinated for a decade. Dominique Pelicot receiving the maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for repeatedly raping his wife and bringing strangers into their home to join in the abuse. Gisele Pelicot spoke outside court a short time ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GISELE PELICOT, SPEAKS AFTER EX-HUSBAND: I am thinking finally of the unrecognized victims of stories which often unfold in the shadows. I want you to know we share the same fight. I would like to express my most profound gratitude to everyone who supported me throughout this length trial. Your testimonies moved me, and I took strength from them to return every day during these long days of hearings. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And he believes that the premeditated murder was designed to intimidate public citizens and to advance a governmental policy, which are parts of the statute in the State of New York that would allow the charging of in furtherance of terrorism.

In terms of news lines, there were a few, he talked about President elect Trump. He said he would be willing to meet with him at any time, but he hasn't heard from him as of yet, and he hasn't spoken to him. He said in over four years, which continues along the Kremlin's refuting of the reporting that we heard initially in Bob Woodward's but that Trump had called Putin some seven or so times since leaving office. So, he talked about that. He talked about Syria and Assad, who as we know, is now in Moscow, arrived almost two weeks ago. He hasn't met him yet, but he does intend to, he said. And when he does, he is going to bring up the issue of that missing American journalist, Austin Tice. He's also, he said, looking for a solution with the new leadership in Syria, around the Russian bases there. So, he talked fairly extensively about that. But overall, this was really an opportunity. He's not just talking to a domestic audience here. He's talking to a global audience to project Russian strength, to talk up their successes on the battlefield, to talk up the Russian economy, the Russian defense industry. And I think it was also an opportunity to re-establish the deterrent, in particular, nuclear deterrent in the face of continued Western support for Ukraine. He was asked about Western skepticism around that Oreshnik missile, the medium range ballistic missile that Russia fired in November, and the thoughts in the West that Russia's claims that it cannot be shot down are false.

Russia is inching forward, albeit with tactical rather than strategic gains on the battlefield. He did get in, interestingly, into the issue he was asked about whether he would compromise with Ukraine when it comes to peace talks. We know the incoming U.S. Administration has been pushing towards sort of mentioning some kind of peace talks. President Orban of Hungary also talking about possibly a Christmas ceasefire. He did say cryptically that Russia is willing to negotiate, is willing to compromise, but did not give any details on how.
