Hamas has called on all of its members - we're being pushed away (ph) by police here. Hamas has called on all of its members to strike Israel wherever they can. And we have confirmation now that this driver of this car, who then tried to stab pedestrians, is a member of Hamas. Hamas, the militant group, claiming him as one of their fighters in the last few minutes. Police calling this a terror attack. And it seems as though Hamas, when they were praising this attack saying that it's in direct relation and in direct response to what has been happening in Jenin over the last two days, Jenin still an active military operation according to the Israeli military, and they say that they will be there now for at least another day, potentially even longer, guys.",

It comes on the heels of last week's Supreme Court decision to end affirmative action policies at colleges and universities. In a complaint to the Department of Education, a civil rights group alleges Harvard's process discriminates against students of color by giving an unfair boost to the mostly white children of alumni, which the suit claims violates the Civil Rights Act. In part the complaint reads, for the period of 2014 through 2019, the acceptance rate for donor-related applicants was approximately 42 percent, or about seven times higher than the acceptance rate for an applicant with no donor relation. Joining us now is executive director for the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice, Ivan Espinoza-Madrigal. And first I want to talk about this complaint. It almost feels inevitable given how people started to talk about legacy seats in the aftermath of the affirmative action ruling. What is the goal here? Are you trying to get back to the Supreme Court? IVAN ESPINOZA-MADRIGAL, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, LAWYERS FOR CIVIL RIGHTS: Thank you very much for having me this morning. And just to clarify my organization, we branded a few years ago, we are just Lawyers for Civil Rights and we're based in Boston and happy to be bringing this important case on behalf of students of color who will be disproportionately excluded and affected by the recent development in the Supreme Court. Last week the Supreme Court gave us a narrow but exceedingly narrow opportunity to move forward with race- conscious admissions at colleges and universities in the Harvard case. This week --",

I'm looking at that ruling and seeing that universities be going to go back to adjust what they're doing to be in compliance with the latest Supreme Court guidance. And in this new landscape it is critical for us to push for the elimination of doner-based and legacy-based admissions preferences. It's nearly 28 percent of the class at Harvard.

What's kind of the process here I guess is what I'm asking.ESPINOZA-MADRIGAL: We are going to eliminate the ability of students to identify a donor affiliation or family affiliation so that they can get brownie points to get into Harvard. That is unfair. It's also discriminatory. Where currently in the Department of Education, if we are to do this work and do it right, we also have to keep all legal options on the table, including going into federal court, going into other advocacy and other types of protections that will allow students of color to thrive on college campuses despite the Supreme Court's best efforts.",
