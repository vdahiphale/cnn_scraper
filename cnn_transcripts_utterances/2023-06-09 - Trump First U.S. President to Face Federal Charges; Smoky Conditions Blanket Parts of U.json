For the first time ever, a former U.S. President under a federal indictment as Donald Trump faces numerous criminal charges in the classified documents case.Russian artillery fire hindering rescue efforts from that dam breach in southern Ukraine. And air quality slowly improves across parts of the U.S. as smoke from those Canadian wildfires begins to dissipate. And we begin with that unprecedented move from the U.S. Justice Department, indicting former President Donald Trump. His attorney says Trump is facing seven counts, including Espionage Act violations, conspiracy, obstruction, and making false statements. It's all related to the former president's alleged mishandling of classified documents after he left the White House. FBI agents seized about 100 documents marked as classified when they searched his Florida estate last August. Prosecutors previously claimed documents were likely concealed or removed from a Mar-a-Lago storage room as part of an effort to obstruct the FBI investigation. Trump says on social media he's been summoned to appear at the federal courthouse in Miami on Tuesday at 03:00 pm. He claims that the Justice Department is being weaponized against him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: It's called election interference. They're trying to destroy a reputation so they can win an election. That's just as bad as doing any of the other things that have been done over the last number of years. I'm an innocent man. I did nothing wrong. I'm innocent. And we will prove that very soundly and hopefully very quickly. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The White House spokesman Ian Sam's, declining to comment on the news of the former president's indictment, referring questions instead to the Justice Department, which he did note, quote, conducts its criminal investigations independently. And that is ultimately the main message that this White House wants to send with its silence. That is to say that amid these accusations from Republicans that this is a politicization of this Justice Department, that the White House has remained out of criminal affairs as it relates to any active criminal investigations or prosecutorial actions by the Department of Justice. President Biden himself has repeatedly maintained the independence of the Department of Justice, and he did so even earlier on Thursday when he was asked a question before former President Trump was indicted about what he would tell Americans to convince them of the Justice Department's independence.

About 5:00 in the morning here, very heavy smoke here from about Windsor (ph), that's just around Saint Marie (ph) right there and then back across parts of Buffalo, Erie, into parts of Pittsburgh, that would be Sommerset County and then all the way towards Washington D.C. Watch the orange though as I push the button and move this into the evening. The orange begins to disperse a little. There's a little bit of wind in the atmosphere (INAUDIBLE) to try to push this around and not make it so concentrated. And by Saturday afternoon most of the northeast is cleared up. But there're still quite a bit of smoke here across parts of Ohio and into Pennsylvania. Another thing that's going to happen to help us get rid of this is some rain. We need the rain over the fires, obviously but we also could use the rain across part of the areas that have seen so much smoke in the air. But something else that's really going to play a big, big, big help here is the wind. The wind will push this away into the Atlantic and away from the United States and eastern Canada. Here's how much rainfall we could get. Half inch to an inch in some spots especially over those fires. That will definitely be helpful for the firefighters. And then the wind and the wind direction. Coming from the south, bringing in drier air, cleaner air from the Atlantic Ocean and then pushing it all the way by looks like Tuesday, this should all be a bad memory.
