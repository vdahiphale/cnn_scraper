I'm Christine Romans.President Biden is ready to confirm what used to be a given for an incumbent in American politics, that he is running for re-election. The official announcement of his 2024 campaign today comes as polls show a majority of voters and even a majority of Democrats don't want him to run again. CNN's Jasmine Wright joins me bright and early this morning. Jasmine, good morning. What do we know about the Biden's campaign rollout today?",

      "sentences": "Well, Christine, today is the day maybe, that is an important caveat, because we know that President Biden is one that can change his decision especially about his political future. So that caveat is very important, but if President Biden were to go forward with it, today, he would be really in essence launching his final campaign of his decades long political career.Now, it's only official when it's official, but if it happens, we know logistically how it will look. The president will be launching really a campaign-style video that is basically already finished. And it will be attached with a fundraising message. Also today if the president launches this soft launch of his election -- or his re-election bid, we know that he will be naming some key personnel, that includes his campaign manager who is expected to be Julie Chavez Rodriguez, a very trusted West Wing aide, and Quentin Fulks, the former campaign manager for a successful bid of Senator Raphael Warnock. That will be marking the transition between what his officials have been doing behind the scenes to lay the political ground work for his re-election bit to right now, start of basically a months long ramping up of a full-scale operation. But you're right, Christine, that if the president does get into the pool today, he is facing major political headwinds, based on the fact that really Americans are not so interested in seeing a rematch between him and former President Donald Trump who right now is the GOP frontrunner, namely because of age. Polls show us that majority of Americans don't really want President Biden to run because of that. He is 80 years old right now and if he were to win a second term, he'd be 86 by the end of it. But when you talk to White House officials, they feel that they can overcome and really bring the American people to their side when they think about the comparisons between former President Trump and President Biden and really Biden trying to do what he said that he wanted to do last campaign, which was save the soul of America. So, today, we'll see President Biden not in a major campaign style rally, but he will be meeting with a builders trade union conference here in Washington, D.C. really a perfect symmetry to the fact that four years ago when he launched his 2020 bid, president Biden released a video and then met with union officials right after -- Christine.",

      "sentences": "More of the same I think, Christine. What we saw Monday was really just reinforcing of the stark divide between Russia and Ukraine's Western allies. And I think that we saw relations deteriorate even further. Russia, as you say, through Lavrov, railing against the West over sanctions, criticizing the U.S. and its allies for abandoning diplomacy in Ukraine and in turn facing harsh condemnation for not only his actions in Ukraine but being accused of hypocrisy for chairing a session of the U.N. entitled maintenance of peace -- of international peace and security.On the grain deal, which is something that obviously has huge consequence for the world, not a lot of concrete progress there either. He met with the U.N. secretary general and passed a letter to present to Vladimir Putin on a proposed path forward for that deal, but Russia says its interests are not being met in that regard. Today, we expect to see Lavrov in a few hours chair a session on the Middle East, Russia still has considerable interest and influence in that region, still has a military presence in Syria. So we expect to see the complicated relations play out and potentially some Western outrage over Russia chairing a session on potential peace in the Middle East. And he will be giving a wide ranging press conference also later on today, Christine, and I think that we can expect to see more of those divisions coming out on that as well.",

Just last month, she was seen shopping and dancing in the elite French ski resort of Courchevel. But Maniovich is no ordinary Russian socialite. She is the other half of Russia's deputy minister of defense, Timur Ivanov, one of the most senior architects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. And, according to a shocking investigation, Maniovich continues to gallivant around France more than a year into Russia's bloody war, despite the fact that Ivanov was sanctioned by the E.U. in October. The explosive report put out by the Anti-Corruption Foundation, an investigative outfit funded by Russia's jailed opposition leader Alexey Navalny, is based, they say, on a leaked archive of more than 8,000 of Maniovich's emails over the last 12 years and has racked up more than 6 million views on YouTube. It claims that on March 25, 2022, as dozens of missiles rained down on the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, Maniovich spent more than $100,000 in a top Paris jewelry store on the Place Vendome. How was it possible that she can continue to do this? MARIA PEVCHIKH, HEAD OF INVESTIGATIONS, ANTI-CORRUPTION FOUNDATION: It's a very simple trick that they've played. Number one, Svetlana has an Israeli passport through her first husband. And, second of all, six months into the war, they have filed for divorce. They haven't split any assets. Nothing has changed in terms of, like, in the daily life. Whatever they owned, they keep owning together. But, technically, they are not legally married anymore.",
