New details on the final preparations. That's ahead. Plus, we're standing by for a possible huge Supreme Court decision. Many decisions. Major questions involving Trump's immunity and, of course, abortion rights could be on the line. And repeatedly reckless with guns. How prosecutor are planning to go after Alec Baldwin.

It is, though, a slight shift toward Biden since their last poll in May. With us now is Florida Congressman Mike Waltz, a Trump campaign surrogate. Congressman, I saw you on Hannity last time.

We can't lose sight of that.But, secondarily, look, he's focused on, how do we end this war. How do we get Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table in a way that protects Ukraine's sovereignty, protects our NATO allies, but stops the death and destruction that right now, I mean, arguably, there - there is no end in sight. And then, thirdly, he talked a lot about energy. John, if we dropped the price of oil and gas globally down to around $55 a barrel, Putin's done. His war machine is done. His economy is on life support mode and Iran as well for that matter. So, unleashing American cheaper, cleaner oil and gas onto the global market takes care of two adversaries in terms of their ability to prosecute war and, oh, by the way, it helps Americans at the gas pump and helps the inflation problem.

So, you know, really high anticipation, high anxiety in the courtroom this morning.After the nine justices take the bench, they will announce majority decisions. And, Sara, this is the season of oral descends from the bench, when because of the magnitude of the cases, when someone is on the losing side, they usually will read excerpts from their dissenting opinions. That's not the norm. Usually it's just excerpts from the majority opinion. So, a lot of drama expected this morning. But we just don't know which cases. As you said earlier, we've got two that could even affect the election. One will test whether former President Donald Trump will go to trial on election subversion charges arising from the 2020 presidential contest, whether he will go to trial before the 2024 election. And then another one that will test all defendants from the January 6th attack on the Capitol who've been charged with corruptly - corruptly obstructing an official proceeding. And that's a charge that Donald Trump faces also. The justices will look at whether that charge was properly applied. It could mean 20-year sentences for some of the defendants who were convicted under that charge. And then we have - we have a major gun case that will test the range of Second Amendment rights in America and when government can enact regulations. Some very - several social media cases testing governments regulation of, you know, Facebook and Instagram. So, Sara, no matter what, we'll get something that will really affect the law of the land. It's just that we don't know which cases. And they're going to run through at least the end of June. And at this point, Sara, given the number that are remaining, we could actually go into July 1st or 2nd, which the justices do not like to do. So, bottom line, watch for what happens.
