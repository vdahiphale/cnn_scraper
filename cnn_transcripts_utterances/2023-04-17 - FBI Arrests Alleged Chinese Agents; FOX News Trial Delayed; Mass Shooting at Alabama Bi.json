The chief of police in Kansas City had initially said that there was this 24-hour holding period.

Again, this is very interesting and very devastating for the family, because what they're saying here is that a white man shot a teenager, a 16-year-old, who was simply trying to find his siblings.

Rupert Murdoch's \"Wall Street Journal\" reported last night at around the same time this delay was announced that FOX was making a last-minute push to settle this case. And, of course, settling this case would avert a very excruciating weeks-long process for FOX. They don't want to have some of their highest-profile stars, people like Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson, as well as executives like Rupert Murdoch, have to be called before the stand, testify about how FOX promoted election lies in the wake of the 2020 election. It would just be a very uncomfortable several weeks for FOX News. And so you can see why they would want to push to settle this outside of court. Now, whether that settlement happens, we really don't know. And we do know, however, that Dominion and FOX are both preparing for an actual trial if this does not occur.
