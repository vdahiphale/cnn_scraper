I think that gives you the sense that this is not something that's broken down, it's something that's sort of disappeared.The faith that the Palestinian people have that they can get from the United States, the level of support that the Palestinian people feel is going to the Israelis, this sort of parity of, you know -- parity of security guarantees, parity of freedoms. The United States, Palestinians will point out, are very strong in supporting and giving security support to the Israelis, but they don't feel they get that. So, I think that gives you a sense of the heavy lift, the diplomatic lift, that faces Secretary Blinken here. He has talked as well about the two-state solution and he's talked as well about this far right government of Benjamin Netanyahu and the possibility of it building more settlements. And he said, that is a key thing that would destroy the possibility of a two-state solution. But, again, Secretary Blinken aspires to that, wants to keep that idea alive. Yet here in Ramallah, most people would tell you they don't really believe that it's possible to have a two-state solution anymore. And that's particularly true amongst the younger generation.

What White House officials are telling us is that if you look at Biden's schedule, it is being crafted in such a way that he is doing several important things ahead of both of those things, the State of the Union speech, as well as his expected 2024 announcement.One of those things is obviously touting the economic progress of the last two years. We've heard him do that a lot, whether it's talking about the jobs market, being robust, or talking about inflation finally seeming to moderate. And then there's the implementation part of the legislative accomplishments of the last two years. You know, we are going to see him do this when he talks about the infrastructure bill at an event in New York today. And we also saw him do this yesterday as well in Baltimore. Take a listen.

And, of course, don't forget fundraising. That is going to be a huge part of the president's portfolio as well. In fact, he will be headlining a fundraising today in Manhattan.

MARGARET TALEV, SENIOR CONTRIBUTOR, \"AXIOS\": Well, Jim, for now the answer to that question is yes. And I think what you're seeing Biden do with this series of messagings around the infrastructure spending is a couple of things. There are plenty of swing voters and Republicans who do not care about construction under the Hudson River or what happens in New York. But looking at what this is part of, it's more than a billion dollars in those mega grants that also have been dedicated to spending in places like Kentucky and Ohio and North Carolina and Oklahoma and Louisiana and Mississippi. And the jobs that come with them, and this particular project in New York that MJ was just talking about, the promise is the creation of more than 70,000 jobs.

TALEV: Yes. It's really interesting. There's a new Marist poll out that's getting a fair amount of attention. And that poll, you could argue, shows something not good for Biden, which is that more than half the country, six out of ten Americans, say the State of the Union is not strong. If you are the person delivering the State of the Union address, that's not -- those aren't the best numbers. I mean I guess they could be worse, but they're not good. But there is a kind of sub note to that survey. And what that survey also found is that more than half the country says one of the reasons that the State of the Union isn't strong is because of partisan extremism in both parties. And people feel it more acutely on the Republican side, the -- but they -- Republicans see it on the Democratic side as well, the sense that there's too much extremism in both parties. That's why I think you're seeing Biden really lean into this sort of center or pragmatic position because actually when you look at the polling what Americans are saying is, we think extremism is one of the major contributors to the fact that we feel uncertain about the future of the United States right now.",

So, it's not to say it's not important, but I do think there's room for legislation to be done that is proactive.So, for instance, there are body worn camera analytics coming on the market now so that as I, as a chief, I can actually put in key phrases that I want.
