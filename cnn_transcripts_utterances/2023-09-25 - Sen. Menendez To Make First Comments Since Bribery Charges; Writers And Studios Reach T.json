Now in total, the Ukrainian say when they hit the headquarters of the Black Sea Fleet, which what -- with what appear to have been cruise missiles that they killed 34 officers in total and that one of those senior officers was in fact the commander of the Black Sea Fleet Admiral Viktor Sokolov. Now we do have to say that so far, the Ukrainians have not put forward any evidence to confirm that they've actually killed the commander of the Black Sea Fleet. And the Russians so far have not commented on all of this at all. So right now, very difficult to ascertain the extent to which all this is really true. At the same time, though, we do know that there was a massive attack by the Russians on the poor town of Odesa. That happened in the overnight hours. The Ukrainians are saying it was a very complex attack using drones, but also using a lot of cruise missiles of various types. They say that at least 12 caliber cruise missiles were used. Those are subsonic cruise missiles, but ones that can maneuver and the Ukrainians say they shot most of those down. But the Ukrainians also say that the Russians used supersonic Onyx cruise missiles, and some of those appear to have managed to reach some of the targets. Now the Ukrainians say that some grain installations were hit by these strikes, but also a massive hotel complex. And the Ukrainians for their part are saying that this hotel has not been in use for years and so therefore was empty. The Russians for their part had been suggesting that possible -- possibly there was Ukrainian military inside that compound. All we know from the Ukrainian side so far is they say two people were killed in this attack. Fred Pleitgen, CNN in eastern Ukraine.",

First, what needs to happen here is they need to go over the legal language. That's expected to continue throughout the day. And tomorrow, there is this possibility of a leadership vote. After the leadership vote, what happens is it then gets made public or a lot of the points will get made public to the union members. And they'll be able to ask those questions and decide whether or not they want to vote to ratify this agreement. Once that is agreed on, then you're going to start to see some of those changes. So, the first thing you're going to likely see is things like daytime television. So, the talk shows and the late night shows, those will likely go back on air very soon, if there is this deal. The question here is what happens to the rest of the T.V. shows this year. And really the movies next summer, we're running out of time which is part of the reason why both sides really wanted to come to an agreement as soon as possible. But with the actors still in questions, still on strike, then that really leaves a huge question as to what happens next. And even more waiting time. But look, so many people that I've talked to have told me they were willing to wait it out as long as it took. And so, the actors have only been on strike since July. I say only because the other -- the writers were on strike for five months. So really, it's a long time no matter what but we'll have to wait and see how long they're willing to stick it out for. They're also having similar demands when it comes to higher wages and artificial intelligence. That we were told was sort of the last sticking point for the writers.
