Interestingly, I was speaking to a former Israeli general yesterday, and he was telling me that the negotiations that are happening -- or let me backtrack there -- not negotiations, but the talks about negotiations happening, because there is no firm deal on the table just yet -- can be done kind of around about now. Because by the time it's implemented, that will give Israel probably the weeks that it needs in order to finish its operations in and around Khan Younis, so that it can kind of sell that to the Israeli public as being more or less job done in terms of the crushing of Hamas, which it said was one of its primary war objectives.",

It will certainly, if it goes against Israel and it does say that provisional measures or say that Israel needs to stop fighting, never mind the fact that it can't say the same to Hamas, because Hamas isn't a party, isn't a state and therefore isn't a party to the Convention on Genocide.

The Ukrainians haven't denied shooting the plane down, but Kyiv says the Russians never told them they'd be flying the Ukrainian POWs to Belgorod, holding Moscow responsible for the loss of life and the failed exchange. Landing a transport plane in a 30-kilometer combat zone cannot be safe and in any case should be discussed by both sides, because otherwise it jeopardizes the entire exchange process, a military intelligence statement says.
