But as growing populations and densely packed cities stress these systems, innovators around the world are imaginating faster more sustainable ways to get from A to B. From supersonic planes to hyperloop pods, what may seem like a pipe dream today could be the future of transit as early as three decades from now. To envision the future of travel, you should first look to the past. To a city that heralded modern day transportation, innovation.",

It was here thatHenry Ford pioneered the production lines that allowed us to more quickly produce vehicles in a way that improved quality and allowed more people to be able to afford cars. I`m Alisyn Malek and I`m the managing director of Newlab Detroit. I`m working to help bring a better, more prosperous vision of mobility for everyone around the world. When I think about urban mobility, some of the key pillars that are really critical for that to be successful are accessibility, how easy are the mobility solutions to get to how frequent are the services running, what areas are covered. As we look towards 2050, we`re going to be getting up close to 9 billion people. From a transportation perspective, it`s really about options and making sure that everybody has at least two if not more of how they can get around. A lot of the systems that we`re using were great. They are still great, but we actually need to think about what other solutions can we put out that are useful and also create a great user experience.",

Netherlands-based Hardt Hyperloop is aiming to bring this high-speed technology to life. MARS GEUZE, CO-FOUNDER, HARDT HYPERLOOP:  Our vision is to create a world where distance doesn`t matter, where it`s possible for you to be much more free in where you live, work and how you travel, to really shrink the world for people to live in.

Today, hyperloop technology is based on two key mechanisms, removing aerodynamic drag through vacuum-like tubes and removing friction through magnetic levitation or maglev, which makes the pods float and move forward. Together, these systems allow hyperloop to achieve ultra-fast speeds.",
