Her signature tax plan now under the boss of features U.K. leader less easy to sauce however, Liz Truss had apologized on TV for what she called going too far too fast. On her U.N. finance to stimulus program and the ensuing market instability she vowed to fight on. In London skyscraper terms the growth plan is in shorts short. And a conservative politics well, it's in a pickle. And it's called the Gherkin of course but pays close enough what we're looking at although in terms of asset prices are stability. The U.K. pound slightly softer today but context of course is everything Sterling is rebounded some 3 percent over the past week. As the budget crisis eases the bigger point perhaps the U.K. Finance Minister sudden fiscal prudence on Monday helped broader market sentiment contributing to a global stock rally. U.S. tech stocks saw their biggest gains since July. U.S. stocks looking to add further to those gains of course on Tuesday as well in Europe is higher. Despite fresh recession fears more on that shortly but as you can see in front of you green well and truly across the screen there and pre market in the United States. Earnings optimism is also giving us a helping hand. Goldman Sachs raising some 3 percent pre market after its results beat expectations driven by blowout results from his bond trading desk offsetting investment banking, weakness, that's a broad and recurring theme across the entire sector. Goldman CEO David Solomon hailing the results, while also voicing caution over the risk of future recession. At the core of that, of course, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. And that is where we begin today's show with 30 percent of Ukraine's power stations destroyed in just eight days. President Zelenskyy says there are massive blackouts across the nation. In Kyiv three people lost their lives and a missile attack on an energy supply facility that according to the prosecutor's office. Nic Robertson is in the capital for us. Nic, just give us a sense of what it's like being there in terms of seeing this destruction to infrastructure across the country and obviously, the impact on availability of both water and energy supplies.",

And that means there's the water is not pumping properly in many places. So there's low water pressure, or some people don't have water at all, that's in the capital. That's something new in this war for people here. It's happening elsewhere to Dnipro the power station was hit there. Further to the west of Kyiv the power station was hit there as well cockup and in the east, an industrial facility was targeted there. So the Russia really is doubling down it seems on the energy infrastructure now. The energy companies here say that they are being able to repair the damage pretty much get a facility has turned around in the space of about 48 hours. So they are repairing and replacing but of course, their inventory of replacement items will be limited. Russia will have an understanding of these power plants. Because the power plants that are used in Ukraine, built very much on the same sort of Soviet design as they were in Russia. So targeting the power plants means that Russia knows the weak spots, if you will, to go to where it can target the equipment that's going to be harder to replace. So it is an uphill battle for the Ukrainians to keep the country supply with electricity, but they say it's what they're committed to doing.",

Yesterday over Kyiv 28 drones 24 of them shot down at least. Today the power station in Kyiv targeted by missiles so Russia sort of mixes it up between the drones and the missiles to try to get through to the targets.

This underwater video was released by Swedish media claiming to show some pretty extensive damage to Nord Stream one as you can see there. OK, let's move on another recession warning in the United States this time from credit rating agency Fitch. The firm says the U.S. economy will be pushed into a 1990 style recession next spring, thanks to suddenly high inflation and the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hikes. It's just the latest a number of warnings from JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie diamond to the International Monetary Fund to name too. Matt Egan joins us now on this story. Matt, great to have you with us! And just remind us, what are we talking about when we say a 1990-star recession and particularly given we're only what a year out from the last recession, the pandemic induced recession? It's uncomfortable in any form that but 1990 specifically. What are we looking at?",

But Fitch is calling for something a lot more, mild much like the recession that began in the summer of 1990. Now one way to measure just how intense a recession is to look at how much the unemployment rate goes up. And you know, if you look, we saw this massive spike in the unemployment rate that began in the spring of 2020. The rate went up by up something like 11 percentage points. Also another really big and prolonged increase during the great recession but in the 1990 recession; it was a much smaller increase. Now, this is not you should have minimized the pain here. Any job loss, of course, is painful. But you know there are some reasons to be hopeful that maybe this recession might not be quite as destructive. Fitch laid out a couple of reasons for this optimism. One, the economy is sort of entering this period from a position of strength. I mean, the jobs market is historically strong. Consumer balance sheets are pretty sturdy people don't have quite as much debt as they have in the past. The housing market does not appear to be massively over supplied like it was in the mid-2000s. And also the banking system, thankfully, because of regulation is a lot stronger than it has been in the past.",

Selina, we were talking yesterday about how optimistic and powerful that two hour opening speech was from President Xi. We would and we're expecting the GDP statistics to be eye watering.

And the secondquarter we saw Chinese economy barely eke out growth at about point 4 percent growth. And economists expect that in this third quarter, we're going to continue to see weakness. China is expected to fall far short of its own full year economic growth target of 5.5 percent. So the thinking here is, why not delay those numbers so we don't put more attention on all of these harsh economic realities. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WANG (voice over): Migrant workers like Mr. Hue moved from Chinese villages to Beijing in search for better job prospects. On the lucky day, he can make the equivalent of a few dozen U.S. dollars from construction work. Anything left over he sends home to his kids in the village. He says the pandemic has made it harder to find work and China's economy is in bad shape because of all the COVID restrictions. The world's growth engine is sputtering. After decades of unstoppable growth. China's economy is cracking constant COVID lockdowns, wrecking businesses and lives. He shows us his rental home in Beijing, just four square meters. It's really small, he says. Since Chinese leader Xi Jinping took power in 2012. He's pledged to reduce income inequality. But workers like who aren't seeing the benefits. He says I don't think it's a good idea for him to continue to serve. SUSAN SHIRK, CHAIR, 21ST CENTURY CHINA CENTER: I think there are a lot of people in China who have lost confidence and the pragmatic judgment of their leader; it could become a big challenge to Xi Jinping. WANG (voice over): Unemployment is skyrocketing, not just because of the pandemic. China's once vibrant private sector, suffocating under Xi Jinping has cracked out to bring companies under tighter communist party control. Beijing insists the moves protect consumers and reduce economic inequality. But instead, mass layoffs are sending youth unemployment to a record high of nearly 20 percent. Protests also erupted this summer in central China. Thousands of depositors lost access to their savings at several banks in the region. As police violently quashed the protesters they've been arrested hundreds of suspects, allegedly involved in the scandal and promised that depositors would start to get their money back. But many still have not. This is my family's hard earned money over the last 20 years, he says. Our lives depend on it. WANG (on camera): How was this whole experience changed your perception of your country of China's leaders? WANG (voice over): I'm like an ant that they can trample on. I have no hope, he says. Another crisis is unfolding in China's all important property sector. Giant developers have defaulted. Home sales are dropping; homebuyers across the country are boycotting mortgage payments on unfinished homes, fearful that their properties will never get built. These protesters chant evil developer give back my property. KERRY BROWN, LAU CHINA INSTITUTE DIRECTOR, KING'S COLLEGE LONDON: The Chinese property market is probably the world's greatest economic assets, single economic asset. If it does collapse, then we have a full blown recession, maybe even depression. WANG (voice over): Xi Jinping is preparing to be ruler for life, claiming that his brand of authoritarianism will realize the China dream of strength and prosperity.

The sweeping regulations that he has put on the private sector, especially for technology companies it's sparked a lot of fears about the future of growth, entrepreneurship and innovation inside China. And on zero COVID, which is absolutely up into the economy.

So, I think both on as far as inflation is concerned in India, it is essentially attributed to the supply side inflation. And it has not as much to attribute to the demand side inflation. So, on the supply side capacity utilization being just about 71 percent. Crude price inflation likely to get under control, food inflation also likely to be under check so, I think all said and done this August very well, for the economy like India. And we are quite hopeful that we will have a decent growth around 7 percent in the current financial year. And even next year also on with the increase base, the effect would be that it will be somewhere around 6 to 6.5 percent confer growth we expect to be there in the next financial year.",

How worried are you by the global liquidity tightening effect of the strength of the U.S. dollar which is beyond the relative interest rates, as we look around the world?

While in India, the Central Bank of the country, ReserveBank of India has increased the interest rates by about under 90 basis point. So, as I mentioned that the interest rate increases are essentially to. There are two different focus when it comes to U.S. the focus is essentially to contain the demand. Whereas when it comes to India, it is essentially to maintain the parity between Indian rupee and the U.S. dollar. So, I think on that particular count, the way I look at it is that. When it comes to a country like India, we have certain challenges in terms of imbalance on account of crude oil import. Which we have about 85 percent of our domestic oil consumption is imported conjunction. But then also with the softening of the crude prices, the stress on the import will actually come down. And but yes, of course, exports also the global recessionary conditions will also have an impact on our exports. But overall, I expect that with the kind of recession, which is expected, the import will probably come down and the cost of imports will come down. And also we will be in a position to strike a reasonable balance. I think with the demand being very, very robust in the country. We'll have a situation where the FTA and the foreign portfolio investment will once again, look at India as a promising opportunity. And they will all be moving towards India, we already have got the distinction of having 104 unicorns in the country. So I think that is something which will go a long way in terms of attracting capital from across the globe because they're in a position to offer solutions to many of the corporates across the globe. So I think overall, the Foreign Institutional, foreign portfolio investment and foreign direct investment will come into the country. And also, our import will also be softening. So eventually, the pressure, which you're seeing on the currency, as of now, it will ease out and we'll have stability in the rupee-dollar parity too. That why I read the situation.",

And second, of course, there is a very clear focus in the Indian economy in terms of attracting investments into big tech. Already Apple has identified India to a part of its global sourcing locations. And India's economy will be producing for the Apple and also various other big tech entities as well. We have already Foxconn has shown interest. We are having a huge opportunity for manufacturing of solar panels. We also got, we are seeing that when it comes to the solar cells and these kinds of big tech opportunities, there is going to be a huge opportunity. Indian Government is also investing into the performance Lincoln Center for encouraging manufacturing. And similarly, infrastructure is another major growth area for the economy having said that, the real economy has got all these growth potentials. And all these growth potential will also open up many opportunities for us in terms of the credit growth in the economy. Yes, when it comes to deposit, of course, we have to ensure that we should remain relevant for our depositors also. And of the recent past, we have already started seeing that the deposit rates have also started moving up. Though when it comes to the loan rates, it has moved faster but deposit rates have also started moving up. The need is for having incremental savings, which should be on her side. I think with the increased per capita income in the economy when the savings also will go up which will also augment the resources lendable resources for the banking system.",

Now, I think at the same time, we are taking a step backwards in the world. After World War II, every country came together with the Red Cross, and not just made it a moral imperative, but a legal obligation that the military would protect civilians in times of war. And that's been our fundamental plea when we've called for a digital Geneva Convention that in cyberspace, governments need to respect the needs of civilians. We're not seeing that happen on the ground or in the air in Ukraine, we're not seeing it happen in cyberspace. There are many days in many countries where we're not seeing it elsewhere. And we just need to bring ourselves back to that fundamental point, I believe. And I will be optimistic and say there is hope if we can focus on doing the right thing.",

However, however, disheartening at times at the activity suggests, youknow, ever since you've been having these conversations about that the work that Microsoft specifically has been doing in Ukraine, and I mentioned as sort of identification in the mitigation of these cyber threats. I've never asked you the question, though, it's occurred to me afterwards about payment for it. And it's something that's sort of, again, come to the surface over the let's call it noise with regards to the provision of Starlink satellites by Elon Musk, and by SpaceX. And you don't have to talk specifically about that example. But it does raise a question about who pays particularly when it comes down to business and you can never put a price on human life. And I think you said it best with the moral imperative that you often feel to help whether it's on something like this or on things like climate change. How do you even approach that conversation as a board of a business where you're, you're spending money, but you also perhaps do need partnerships, government support, again to that point?",

Let's say it, energy security decisions, perhaps though, at the cost of all our plans necessary plans for hitting climate targets. And Brad, I know you have personal plans at Microsoft, and we often talk about them. But you are, I think, pretty unique in your disclosure in your adherence in your discussion of those targets. Again, I guess I'm looking for the optimist, but one month out from COP 27, what are you thinking and are the alarm calls louder than perhaps they were even a year ago?",

This is a time ofyear and a time in this decade, when people especially across Europe, quite naturally and reasonably will be more focused on getting heat and electricity into their homes, they'll be more worried about their electricity bills. But this is why I'm an optimist. All of these difficult steps are going to accelerate even more the energy transition that is just indispensable to a climate friendly future. So every step that is going to make 2020 to feel more difficult, is going to move us faster to where we need to be in 2030 with more wind power, more solar power, frankly, more use of data and to innovate our way out of this climate mess. And so it will feel like we're going backwards in the short term. But I think at the end of this decade, we will look back. And we will say we move faster because of this difficult period of time.",

So I love this idea of investing in renewables, but also transitioning some of the dirtier forms of electricity production that we have and making them cleaner.

And when you look at a coal plant, a coal firedelectricity plant, there's two ways to look at it. One way is to say this is a plant that needs to close so it stops pumping carbon into the air. The other way to look at it is the way the TerraPraxis is wonderful NGO, and Microsoft and MIT are looking at it and saying this is a coal plant that can be converted to a new generation of nuclear power, small modular reactors. It's already connected to the grid. It has a trained workforce, typically 1200 people in a rural community that know how to run a power plant. It's got water cooling capacity; you can cut the cost of constructing a new nuclear plant by a third by converting these plants.

Final question on this and it is tied, asyou said it's difficult to make important moral, climate related and beyond decisions when economies are slowing and recession risks and fears are genuinely present.

And again, Julia it had been a long time since we'd heard it expressed on the streets of Paris, you'll remember the yellow vest protests had been the most recent then COVID and now the protests and the strikes back had driven really by high inflation and the cost of living with the transport and some public sector workers now demanding higher wages to be able to deal with that, Julia.",
