A building in Northern Gaza, where many displaced people had been sheltering, was destroyed in an apparent Israeli strike on Saturday. CNN's Ben Wedeman has the latest.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Israel carried out a series of devastating strikes on Northern Gaza, Saturday. Striking a multistory building in the Jabalya Refugee Camp. Witnesses say more than a hundred people, many of them displaced, were inside the building at the time. Doctors report dozens were killed, and many more remain under the rubble. Earlier in the day, the Arabic spokesman for the Israeli military over social media had instructed people to leave immediately areas east and north of Gaza City, including Jabalya. But it wasn't clear if anyone got the message. Later, there was another massive strike on the Shuja'iyya District, whose inhabitants had also been instructed to leave. Again, dozens were killed. Israel's war to eliminate Hamas recommenced Friday morning with renewed fury and there has been no let-up since. Saturday, some aid did make it into Gaza. The Palestine Red Crescent Society reported that around 100 trucks crossed over from Egypt carrying food, water, relief assistance and medicine. Good news to the living.

They are still being held by Hamas and other militant groups inside the Gaza Strip. Now, we've had 110 hostages released, including 86 Israelis. The U.S. believes that there are something like eight U.S. citizens still accounted for, seven women and -- sorry, one woman and seven men.Now, the reason it seems for the breakdown off the truce and those hostage negotiations is that Israel said that Hamas was still holding 15 women and two Children. Hamas, as we heard in your introduction, claims that all of those women that it is still holding are all IDF soldiers, something that Israel denies. Hamas also claiming that all the men that it is still holding are all either current or former IDF soldiers as well. What is clear is that Israel's position is that the operations against Hamas will continue until those hostages are release at the very least. Hamas saying that there can be no more negotiations, no more release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian being held in Israeli prisons until there is a ceasefire. So, we seem to be at an impasse. Now, according to a senior administration official who spoke with CNN, he said that it's totally unacceptable what is going on. That Hamas not releasing those hostages. Saying, the onus is on Hamas to live up to the terms of the deal and release the young women without further delay. But at the same time, the U.S., in his words, will pursue every effort to secure the release off those hostages, all the hostages, but in particular those ones who are also U.S. citizens. Kim.",

At one point, he talked about the First Amendment and subpoenaing these social media companies.But the main crux of the argument was really about Donald Trump himself, claiming that President Biden is using his administration to come after the former president. This referring to these multiple charges against President -- Former President Trump, including his attempts to overturn the 2020 election. So, really trying to flip this narrative, but again, using an argument that we have heard over and over again from the former president. But I will note, we are just about six weeks out from those Iowa caucuses and all polling that we have seen shows Trump with a very dominant lead when it comes to those caucuses. And when we were here at this event, there was an earlier speaker who asked the crowd if anyone had ever -- this was their first-time caucusing, and about half the people here raised their hand to say it was, showing that Donald Trump still has a lot of support. But even a lot of new support, despite those charges and his ongoing legal problems here in the State of Iowa. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Every single person in Trump's position in the national polls has gone on to win. And at this particular point I'm not really sure why I would disagree with history.

Well over 600 days, Richmond, Virginia tops out the top four on that list with 684 days. So, just incredible to see. And looking at the forecast, we're not looking at snow anytime soon. Some rain in New York City by Sunday, temperatures below average through a lot of the extended forecast here, but overall, not really looking at any snowmakers anytime soon. Not the case though for the Pacific Northwest. A series of storms will bring heavy rain and snow going through the next several days. We'll find some of this rain and snow really setting up going into Sunday. Some of that rain could be heavy at times from Portland into Seattle. You know, a little bit of a break but again another storm like train cars on its heel going into Monday and Tuesday with the heavy rain and the snow setting up. What's happening is we have an atmospheric river setting up. That's when that jet stream or the path of storminess really just sits over the Pacific Northwest, really pumping that moisture, storms just one after another, level four out of five. This could be hazardous, talking about river rises and mudslides. We're looking at some three to seven inches of rain in the lowlands, but up in the high elevations could be looking at up to 10 inches of rain where it's cold enough. Looking at two to three feet of snow, so we can pretty significant snow totals up in the Pacific Northwest going through the next several days. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
