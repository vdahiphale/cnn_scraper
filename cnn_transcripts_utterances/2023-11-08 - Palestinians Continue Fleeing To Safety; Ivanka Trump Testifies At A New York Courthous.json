But it's not too soon to analyze what happened whenvoters actually went to the polls yesterday. You are right, of course. Donald Trump was not literally on the ballot yesterday. But I have been digging into the down ballot races and a lot of the details, and I think that the candidate to hug Donald Trump the closest were punished by voters. So, let me explain. Let's take a look at Kentucky and Mississippi. Two deep red states Donald Trump won by more than 20 points. Incumbent Governor in Mississippi, re-elected. Incumbent Governor, Democrat, re-elected in Kentucky. But in both cases, these top of the ticket folks really embraced and paraded their Trump endorsement. And yet, the Republicans in both cases did worse then the down ballot Republicans. It means there's a lot of ticket splitting going on. So, in Kentucky, some folks voted for Republican for Attorney General, Republican for Secretary of State, but a Democrat for Governor. In Ohio -- big Republican state in recent years. But it is the seventh time since the overturning of Roe v. Wade that an attempt to, you know, by folks to either protect or crack down on abortion rights, the pro-choice side has won every single time including in counties that Trump won. They voted to preserve abortion rights in the state constitution. So, I think this was a repudiation of Donald Trump. And I don't think that it's going to stop going forward. I think that's what we're seeing again and again. Not just about abortion. It's about the Trump agenda and the people who hug it most tightly.",

And voters are doing a verybasic bit of math, which is it's unlikely to get better in a second term, as he gets older. That's a problem that Biden -- it's a trap. He can't get out of that. It's baked in the cake, so to speak. Now, what the Biden people will tell you is keep on looking at how Democrats are out performing the polls and expectations in every special election, in the midterms. And, that you know, it's one of Biden's favorite lines, don't compare me to the almighty. Compare me to the alternative. And Donald Trump, while he's doing very well in a lot of polls, has a 29, 30 percent approval rating nationwide. That is not setting up to be a success in the general election. But I don't think Democrats can't afford to ignore the concerns people have about Biden simply because the stakes are too high with Donald Trump running for re-election. What it means for our democracy, and frankly, democracy around the world. So, you know, I agree with it to some extent. I could say it simultaneously, I think Biden has been a consequential precedent. Many of his policies that he's accomplished have been very popular. And polls show that they are not as widely known as they should be. But I don't think Democrats should take too much comfort in the idea they can re-brand and promote his accomplishments, because they haven't succeeded in doing so to date, despite a lot to work with, frankly.",

I continue to have thedefiantly optimistic perspective that you know, polls are interesting. But the poll I care about most is when people actually begin to vote. And while Donald Trump isn't in a dominant position in the side the Republican party, not nationally, you, know he is just a deeply unpopular polarizing figure when it comes to a general election. I think there is still room for things to shake out differently inside the Republican party. Nikki Haley, for example. Over the course of these two debates, former South Carolina Governor, and the only woman in the race, has steadily increased her approval. DeSantis has declined slightly and in some ways, you could say it's really a Trump-DeSantis-Haley race right now. Chris Christie has got a lane. You know, but it's a pretty narrow lane. I think the fact that, you know, what people watching tonight is whether Nikki Haley can continue to have a break at performance, and really take out the, what is left of DeSantis's momentum who got a boost from Kim Reynolds, the Governor of Iowa endorsing him the other day. So, I just think, you know, what the debates. These things matter. The Republican party, you know, plurality of Republicans are either open to or don't want Donald Trump, or are open to someone else. A third of the party is not going anywhere, no matter what he does. So, debates matter. Pay attention, Nikki Haley, see if she can continue the momentum, because she could carve out a place that's a real alternative to Donald Trump inside the Republican party.",

We -- it's all been said, and the whole world has condemned that. But not the Palestinian Authority. The Palestinian Authority in Ramallah has refused to condemn Hamas. And for Israelis, that's a problem. Because you can't say you are a partner in some sort of, you know, live and let live, a partner in peace even, and at the same time refused to condemn the Hamas atrocities. Atrocities against innocent civilians. Today, as we speak, Hamas is still holding 240 Israeli hostages. Of them, 32 children. Of them, babies. Toddlers under three, under four years old. It's gruesome. It's disgusting. And it needs to be condemned. And yet, people who claim to be the moderate Palestinian voices, people who claim to be the international communities interlocutors on the Palestinian question, they are silent.

He has not done so. He has come out and said look, the focus right now is on dismantling and defeating Hamas. We can have that conversation later. However, the head of Shin Bet has come out and taken responsibility. The head of IDF military intelligence has come out and taken responsibility. Even Naftali Bennett, who wasn't even in power for that long, on our show, came out also and took responsibility.

Hamas will make a power calculation. And that we have to keep the military pressure up on Hamas, beef that pressure up, ratcheted up until Hamas starts to feel that it has to do something and starts to release the hostages. At the same time in parallel, you talked about Egypt, there's also in Qatar, there are talks going on behind the scenes to see is it possible to facilitate a release of hostages. And Israel is open to an arrangement which sees our people getting out, obviously. The Qataris, you know, in Qatar they host the Hamas leadership. They are under criticism. How can you host people who murder babies? How can you host these terrible terrorists? And Hamas says, sorry, Qatar says, we host them because that gives us leverage, that gives us influence, and that gives the West a way to speak to Hamas, and we can moderate their behavior. OK. We say to the Qatar -- the Qataris government, if you believe that you can deliver the release of hostages, now is the time to put up.

What we do know is that those fleeing across the border into Chad have said that there has been a targeted ethnic killings that some have called ethnic cleansing over the past few months. As you say, it's part of a disturbing pattern that shows that these RSF fighters that are locked in a brutal battle with the Sudan armed forces have been targeting those in the parts of western and northern Darfur over months.
