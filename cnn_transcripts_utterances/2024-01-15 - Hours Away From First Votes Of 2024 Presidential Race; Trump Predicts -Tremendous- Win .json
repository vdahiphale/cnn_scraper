The record- breaking cold weather here in Iowa will make that even harder than ever before.Take a look at the scene outside right now. Sub-zero temperatures, dangerous conditions complicating travel to the caucus sites, 1657 separate caucus sites across the state. It is a crucial night where we'll learn how strong Donald Trump's grip on the Republican Party really is. And if any of his rivals can beat expectations and change the nature of this race. CNN is covering these Iowa caucuses from all angles. I want to start with Alayna Treene, who's been following the Trump campaign. Alayna? ALAYNA TREENE, CNN REPORTER: Well, good afternoon, Dana. I really want to focus on Donald Trump's closing arguments to Iowans over the weekend. And his main message was to please turnout any caucus. We know that over the past several days that Donald Trump's team has been a bit concerned about turnout. That's in part due to the frigid temperatures here in Iowa, the record cold that we are seeing for a caucus. But it's also in part due to his commanding lead in the polls. His advisors tell us that they are a bit concerned that people may look at his lead in the polls and assume that they can stay home that Donald Trump is going to win this regardless. And really Trump has been saying don't do that. I need you to turnout and show up for me. Take a listen to what he told his supporters in Indianola yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I will say you can't see my feet, but I'm wearing the same boots that I wore in 2000 when I covered the Bradley campaign here, and you guys need some new trends on these snowbirds.Let's just start by setting the table with a little bit of history. And that is the winning margins here in Iowa over the past several cycles, starting in competitive caucuses for Republicans. Ted Cruz won by just a little bit more than 3 percent. Rick Santorum, not even a full percentage point 0.1 percent. Mike Huckabee had a pretty big win by Iowa standards over 9 percent. George W. Bush even bigger 10, Bob Dole three. And then Bob Dole in 1988 even bigger. I don't think you go all the way back to Bob Dole. Jeff Zeleny, but I think what you started covering back in 2000, right, mixing (Ph) all of those.",

Bush won here in Iowa with 41 percent of the vote. That was extraordinary. I'm not sure that history is our best guide for this because there is a former incumbent president who's running.And one thing has been stable throughout the turn of the season here in Iowa. From spring to summer to fall now back to winter, is that Donald Trump has had this commanding lead of this race. So yes, this campaign is pointing to that 1988 figure with Bob Dole. But that is not the expectation. The reality is the final one registered poll yesterday, the gold standard of polling showed him 28 points up. He doesn't necessarily have to hit that. But 12 points would be considered a big setback. So, look, as we're looking tonight is the former president going to go beyond 50 percent. If he does, that is a remarkable figure. One other thing we're looking at, Nikki Haley. She's been on the move here. But what if that poll raised her expectations? So, the bottom line is I've been checking around with some undecided voters and there really have been a lot of overlap several days as you've met between Haley and DeSantis. There actually are some people who aren't turning out. I talked to one person this morning in western Iowa. She said her street is still not clear. So, for all those caucus sites we talked about, 28 counties in Iowa, only have one caucus location. People will be driving a long distance in some rural areas. Will that hurt Trump? Will it help Haley here in the suburbs? All those things we're thinking about as the day goes on.",

It's something that's still bothersome. It's something that's still he fears could happen again. His team has told him repeatedly that your supporters are more devoted than any other supporters. Meaning, that if the weather is a impact on some people turning out, it is likely to impact other campaigns and not yours, but it's not easing his concern.And they aren't -- you just really brought up a really good point here, which is they have been leading by 30 points, 28 points.

They know the communities that have those kinds of untapped. Trump supporters are specifically looking at first time caucus goers to try to change the makeup of that electorate.
