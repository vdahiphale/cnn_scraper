Trump said that some migrants are quote, \"not people\", end quote. He called undocumented immigrants who commit crimes, quote, \"animals\", and he warned of a quote, \"bloodbath\" if he loses in November.

There's no shelter, there's no healthcare prepared for them outside Rafah, and already in Rafah, it's absolutely desperate -- you know, already. So, no one can really understand how Netanyahu can go in, carry out military operations without putting civilians in harm's way, or if he has some sort of plan to get them out, it's -- no one could really understand how that's going to work.

This is the last time you'll be able to see some of these beautiful cherry blossoms along the tidal basin and into the West Potomac Park, for instance, is because there's going to be a major rehabilitation effort that's going to reinforce the seawalls around that area because of the rising sea levels that have occurred, thanks to climate change as well. Longer growing seasons, longer Winters, not as many cold snaps, that's a problem, and then of course, that impacts the earlier peak bloom of these cherry blossoms that are so beautiful. Now, it won't feel like Spring or Summer across the east coast, and much of the eastern half in the U.S., 57 percent of the lower 48, we're talking about 185 million people have the potential to drop below freezing.
