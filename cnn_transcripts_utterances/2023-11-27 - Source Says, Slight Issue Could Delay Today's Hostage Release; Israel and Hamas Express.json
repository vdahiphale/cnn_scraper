And as we've heard from a source, there are some issues here. So, there's an open question about whether we may see the same sorts of roadblocks and delays that we saw two days ago that delayed the release of hostages by several hours. Instead of happening in the early or mid-evening, it ended up happening pretty much in the middle of the night. However, yesterday, the transfer itself went smoothly. And by early evening, the hostages were welcomed back in Israel. We saw people lining the roads, waving Israeli flags, that same sort of welcome playing out at the hospital. I, in fact, was at a hotel where families from Kfar Aza were celebrating the release of some of their friends, because many of those released were from that community. That's the anticipating right now, that the process will continue to play out.

      "sentences": "Yes. So, Phil, on Sunday, a commercial tanker carrying phosphoric acid with some apparent public links to an Israeli-owned company sent out a distress call while it was operating in the Gulf of Aden, saying that it was under attack. The USS Mason, a guided missile destroyer that also operates in the Gulf of Aden and off of the coast of Somalia as part of a counter- piracy task force, responded to that call. When they arrived at the commercial tanker, five armed hijackers jumped off of the ship into a smaller boat of their own and sped away. The Mason pursued those attackers and ultimately were able to gain their surrender.Now, the United States has not publicly identified who those hijackers were, but what we do know is that in several hours after this episode, a pair of ballistic missiles were fired from Houthi-controlled territory in Yemen in the general direction of the USS Mason. Now, those missiles did land harmlessly in the Gulf of Aden, about ten nautical miles away from the American ship. There were no casualties or injuries of any kind, but this is also obviously hugely concerning for U.S. officials because the Houthis are an Iran-aligned, an Iran- backed, an Iran-supported group that has launched numerous attacks against both U.S. interests in the region, as well as Israel since the events of October 7th, both using missiles as well as drones. And so the concern, of course, is that this is yet another troubling sign of an effort by the Houthis to try to sort of escalate this broader conflict. The U.S. broadly believes that Iran itself is seeking to kind of calibrate the response to the Israeli invasion of Gaza in such a way that it will avoid a broader escalation, but the Houthis are a little bit more independent than some of the other Iranian proxies. They don't always act under perfect command and control from Iran. And so, again, this attack yet another concern of a potential escalation by the Houthis.",
