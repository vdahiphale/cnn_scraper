The second thing I'll say is that his poll numbers are up because now were in a general election. And so what we're seeing now is actually this push into a general election where he's actually going and taking his message to the people. And Obama and Clinton are popular, unlike the GOP, who really have no one to campaign with. I mean, this is a completely different party. George W. Bush has nothing to do with Trump. And let me just read a list here -- Mike Pence, John Kelly, Mark Milley, John Bolton, Mark Esper. These were all people who were in the Trump administration and now disavow former President Trump.
