      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, Israeli airstrikes pound Lebanon andGaza as Antony Blinken holds talks with Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel, the details of their meeting shortly ahead. Also this hour, we're just two weeks until the U.S. election, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump make their pitches to voters in a very tight race. We'll have the latest for you from the campaign trail. And Russian President Vladimir Putin welcomes dozens of world leaders to the BRICS Summit with Ukraine and the Middle East sharply in focus. But first, tonight, the Biden administration is making what could be its last big push to get a ceasefire in Middle East before those U.S. elections. But there's no end in sight to the wars in both Gaza and Lebanon. The Lebanese Health Ministry says at least 18 people have been killed in an Israeli strike outside the main public hospital in Beirut. Four children are among the dead. The IDF says it was targeting quote, \"a Hezbollah terrorist site across the border.\" The IDF says about 15 projectiles were fired from Lebanon into Israel today, as you can see there. It says some were intercepted, others fell in open areas. And in northern Gaza, U.N. aid workers say the smell of death is everywhere after weeks of relentless Israeli bombardment. A senior U.N. official warns that people cannot get food, water or medical care, saying that, yes, quote, \"just waiting to die\". And U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken pressed Israel's Prime Minister today for a ceasefire in Gaza. Again, he said Israel should quote, \"capitalize\" on the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar by securing the release of the hostages and ending the war. I want to bring in Jeremy Diamond in Tel Aviv, Alex Marquardt is in Washington. And Jeremy, we can talk about that meeting in just a moment. I'm wondering whether you've got any more information. The news just coming in to CNN that Netanyahu is holding a meeting, a military headquarters to discuss the response to Iran. What more are you learning on that front first of all?",

And each time we've been told something very similar that there are security consultations happening with the Prime Minister often at the Israeli military headquarters here in Tel Aviv to discuss a potential response to Iran. We have been told in the past that those plans are ready to go, and that they simply require the go-ahead from the Israeli Prime Minister. And so, it seems that we are once again kind of in this same position where it seems like the timeline is getting closer to the point where Israel would actually carry out those strikes.

      "sentences": "Well, it's clear that the topics are at least agreed to between these two sides. There was certainly a focus on the fighting in Gaza, on anopportunity in the wake of the killing of Yahya Sinwar to bring that war to an end, to seek a deal to free the hostages. Also talking, of course, about Israel's anticipated retaliation for that barrage of ballistic missiles that Iran fired a couple of weeks ago as well as of course, the conflict in Lebanon. But beyond the topics, there is clearly some divergence on how both sides approach these issues. And at the forefront of that is the extent to which the killing of Sinwar will actually present an opportunity to end the war in Gaza and to reach a deal to free the hostages. We have heard from the Israeli Prime Minister in recent days some kind of continued defiance, making clear that Israel's war in Gaza will continue until victory, even as he acknowledged that the killing of Sinwar was an inflection point. In the latest statement today, from the Prime Minister's office, they say that the Prime Minister, quote, \"emphasized that the elimination of Sinwar is likely to have a positive influence on the return of the hostages and achieving the objectives of the war.\" That's not going quite as far as the United States would like in terms of saying that there is clearly a very clear window of opportunity. Now, to achieve those goals, but it is at least a fig leaf perhaps from the Prime Minister's office, indicating that at least, he believes it will take things in a positive direction. But how much time and space will exist between that intention of something heading in a positive direction, and it actually landing there is another question altogether.",

I don't think that's going to change in the next two weeks. He is really leaning into more of those personal attacks. But then as far as messaging on courting some of the Hispanic vote, he talked a lot about the economy, about energy, classic Trump issues that they believe he polls better on than Kamala Harris and the Democrats. But he also talked a lot about the border, which was interesting. He made some very harsh comments particularly about undocumented migrants crossing over the southern border, which isn't surprising when it's coming from Donald Trump. But some people had reached out to me, asking, does that actually help when he is targeting Hispanic voters? What the Trump campaign argues is yes, it does. They believe that, that issue is just as important to Hispanic voters in this country   as anyone else, any other Americans that they are targeting. And that's in part because they believe that many of these people are here legally, they were able to immigrant -- immigrate and not just -- you know, the ones who did immigrate into the U.S. illegally, that is actually very important issue for them.

And this is very similar to what we saw at the Harris campaign do, when they were trying to appeal to black men, especially young black men. So, it's a similar strategy that they are deploying to -- again, more detail, essentially, how these proposals could help Latino voters because when you look at the polling, she is still outpacing former President Donald Trump when it comes to support among Latinos. But if you look at it, historically, she is lagging where the Democratic nominees have been. In addition to that, if you break down the polling, she is doing far better with Hispanic women than she is with Hispanic men, with Hispanic men, she's pretty evenly-split. So, the campaign realizes that they still need to shore up support among Latinos, and they are trying to walk down this part of the coalition, not only through these public overtures, but also in private with their surrogates. So, certainly, that's going to be part of her focus when she participates in the interview later today. And again, as you heard there from Alayna, there's a broad range of issues that matter to Latino voters. It's not just focused on immigration, but economy like many other voters, is still top of mind.

And observers say, one of its aims is to show that western attempts to isolate the Russian President have failed. This is the first meeting of the group since it expanded earlier this year to include Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia and Iran. It's also the largest international gathering President Putin has hosted since the start of the war in Ukraine nearly three years ago. Our Clare Sebastian has more now on the day's events. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  Well, Russia had trailed this summit as possibly the largest foreign policy event it had ever hosted, promising that representatives of 36 countries would be there, the first meeting of this expanded BRICS group, now nine members strong. And Russia wasted no time rolling out the red carpet. This was a Russian fighter jet even escorting Chinese Premier Xi Jinping's plane as he landed in the southern Russian city of Kazan. Well, these optics, the handshakes, the photo-ops, the 17 bilateral meetings that Putin said it'd be holding during these few days. All of this, a way for Russia to show the West just two weeks before the U.S. election, not only that it attempts to isolate Putin over the invasion of Ukraine have failed, but that this group offers a bigger, better, faster growing alternative to the U.S. and western-led world order. China's Xi Jinping saying the BRICS would be systemically important in the formation of a multi-polar world. Well, Russia to that end is hoping to rally BRICS members to back a new cross-border payment system, part of a strategy to erode the U.S. dominance over global finances and circumvent sanctions. And of course, there's no way to avoid the issue of war as dignitaries arrived in Kazan. Russian shells killed three people, including a child in Ukraine's border region of Sumy. Well, India's Prime Minister who was attempting to balance relations with Russia and the West urged Russia to work for peace. NARENDRA MODI, PRIME MINISTER, INDIA (through translator):  Your Excellency, regarding the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, we are in regular contact.

The indictment alleges that Jeffries and two associates engaged in a sex-trafficking scheme involving young men with model-run aspirations between 2008 and 2015. A source also says that they would engage in sex-themed parties involving drugs, alcohol and Viagra. All three defendants were arrested early on Tuesday and will be arraigned in the Eastern District of New York at a later date. Jeffries served as CEO of Abercrombie and Fitch from 1992 until 2014 when the company announced his retirement. I want to get the latest from Brynn Gingras who joins us from New York. So, Brynn, just talk us through these alleged charges here. BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, well, you laid out those dates nicely, Isa. Those dates that you gave the seven-year period or what's alleged in this indictment, and during that time Jeffries was CEO of Abercrombie and Fitch, and prosecutors here in the Eastern District of New York essentially say he used that power, he used that wealth to recruit young men, some as young as 19 years old, and bring them, fly them sometimes globally, sometimes even pay them to come to hotel rooms and houses and engage in these sort of sex themed parties. And all of these men are most of them or more of them, at least, had some sort of aspiration to be a model or to have some sort of employment with Abercrombie and Fitch or somehow further their careers with knowing, of course, Jeffries. Now, one of those defendants is also Jeffries' partner. And these alleged sex themed parties. Prosecutors say that those two men would feed these young men, aspiring models, you know, drugs and alcohol, Viagra, muscle relaxers and essentially make them perform a sex acts. Now, this first came to light, these allegations, last year when the BBC had a documentary when some of the men came forward. And since then, a federal investigation opened up and this is the fruits of that labor now criminal indictments against Jeffries, his romantic partner and also a third man who they described as sort of a middleman with this operation. But it does seem like a widespread global sex trafficking scheme that prosecutors have now placed criminal charges on Jeffries and others for.",

For more I'm joined now by Rym Momtaz. He is the editor in chief of Carnegie Europe's blog \"Strategic Europe\" and specializes in foreign relations between the Middle East and Europe. A well-known face here on the show. Rym, great to have you back in the show. As we've just laid out there for our viewers, you know, France is expected to hold this international conference over the crisis in Lebanon this week. What is France, in your view, and what you are hearing hoping to get out of this? And more importantly, what is Macron been doing behind the scenes diplomatically? RYM MOMTAZ, EDITOR IN CHIEF OF CARNEGIE EUROPE'S BLOG \"STRATEGIC EUROPE\":  Good to be with you, Isa. France has basically three objectives in holding this conference on Thursday, they want to use their convening, basically, diplomatic power in order to push three things. The first one is to try to corral enough diplomatic support for a ceasefire, at least in Lebanon. Unfortunately, right now, there isn't that kind of consensus, even from the U.S. side. For example, the U.S. doesn't seem to be in an extreme hurry to reach a ceasefire in Lebanon. Second of all, France is trying to coordinate and mobilize massive material support for the Lebanese Armed Forces and the Internal Security Forces because they will be very important in making sure that the Lebanese State doesn't further fail and is able to get through this aggression by Israel. And then lastly, of course, they need to coordinate massive humanitarian aid, because, just to give a sense to our viewers, in two weeks of Israeli aggression at this level of escalation, about 20 percent of the Lebanese population was forcibly displaced. That's the equivalence of basically eight times the population of New York City. In a territory, the entire country of Lebanon is as big as basically Connecticut State. So, the humanitarian needs are massive, especially given that the Lebanese State is basically bankrupt and has been since 2019.",

I wonder why that -- you know, what you're hearing in terms of diplomatic circles. Why a ceasefire in Lebanon's proved so difficult from -- just from the French perspective? Because I asked this, Rym, because almost a month ago on the -- let me get my date, on the 24th of September, senior U.S. officials were basically telling CNN that President Biden and President Macron together with other nations were going to announce the ceasefire proposal between Israel and Hezbollah. That clearly didn't happen. Do we know now? Just give us a sense of what you're hearing behind the scenes.",

One, because no matter what, Israel is very dependent on theU.S. But of course, France doesn't provide any kind of vital weapons that would be necessary for Israel to continue its war in Gaza and in Lebanon. And so, it costs less for Netanyahu to basically turn Macron into an international punching bag in order to gain points with his own domestic public among others.",

We saw theprime minister, Meloni, go to Lebanon this week. Spain, Poland and actually Slovenia have been very active. But the issue with the E.U., as always, is its internal division. You have countries like Germany or Austria that clearly, are very much against any kind of pressure, any kind of diplomatic initiative by the Europeans to try to get Israel to change course. And, of course, there's a need also to put that pressure and exert that pressure on Iran on the other side that is continuing to make sure that Hezbollah continues this war, for example, in Lebanon. Unfortunately, the Europeans can't seem to decide, but that's also part of the stakes for Macron's conference on Thursday, trying to get a bit more consensus among the Europeans, who seem to at least agree on the need to protect the U.N. peacekeepers at the Lebanese-Israeli border that have come under attack over the past couple of weeks by Israel, but that were also attacked by Hezbollah in the past. And one has to remember that these European countries, 13 European countries contribute about a third of the U.N. Peacekeepers in that mission, UNIFIL.",
