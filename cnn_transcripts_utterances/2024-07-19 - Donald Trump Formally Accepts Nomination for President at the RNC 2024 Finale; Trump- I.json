His third convention speech, accepting his third Republican presidential nomination was a massive moment, especially after nearly losing his own life just a few days ago.

And this is a speech that was 90-minutes long, the longest in modern political history. He went into that same rhetoric that we expect from Trump. If you spend any time at his rallies, it felt like a Trump rally. It was rambling, a little incoherent. He made some strange reference to Hannibal Lecter, as he's done in the past from \"Silence of the Lambs.\" Still can't figure that one out. He went after Nancy Pelosi. He called the coronavirus the China virus, a xenophobic reference. So we saw kind of vintage Trump in the second part of it, which didn't help him.

It's probably one of the worst convention speeches I've seen in 30 years in the business. What he was trying to accomplish was trying to show that he was a steady hand moving away from the extremism that has defined his persona, his political brand. And what he did was he reminded voters of why they rejected him in 2020. He's not competent. There's clearly cognitive decline. And his inability to stay disciplined at the biggest moment of his political career demonstrates, again, why people sent him packing after four years in the White House.

You've got Joe Biden behind Trump in seven out of seven key swing states.He's losing ground in 14 states. Only 28 percent of Americans think that he has the mental and physical fitness to be president, let alone run a campaign. And this is a man who, you know, we now have some internal rumblings that he might be replaced with folks who are polling higher. I wouldn't be surprised if that were the case. I think his decline has that debate was just undeniable in terms of his cognitive limitations, and he hasn't been able to convince folks since that time. So as we're seeing, you know, everything go right for Donald Trump, whether it's a case getting dismissed or, you know, essentially surviving an assassination attempt and then being able to essentially say you're a messiah.

The base, as long as the base remains intact, and every bit of evidence suggests that it is, there's absolutely no reason to behave with the panic that's kind of consumed more of the elites in the party.

Republicans are united behind an insurrectionist, an inveterate liar, a convicted criminal. But what we've been seeing recently is Democrats at their most spineless and self-defeating. At the first sign of trouble, they have publicly trashed their incumbent president, who was nominated not by members of Congress, not by James Comey, not by the pundits, not by the pollsters, but by the Democratic voters. Of course, his poll numbers are going to go down. If his own party is attacking him, why would voters think that they ought to support him? And what all of these critics have in common is they have zero track record in predicting election results, yet they claim to know what the Democrats need to do. They are pushing the Democrats into disaster by eliminating the incumbency advantage and promoting a party contest. Since 1900, the White House party has never been reelected under those circumstances. They are, in effect, recreating the situation in 2016 that led to the election of Donald Trump in the first place. But I do have a plan B for Democrats. If the feckless, spineless Democrats do push Biden out, what he should do is resign the presidency for the good of the country, contrasting him with Donald Trump, who's only in it for himself and whose speech tonight totally violated his notion of promoting unity. Then Harris would become president, ticking off the incumbency key and become the consensus nominee, ticking off the party contest key. That would create circumstances under which the party holding the White House usually wins rather than the disaster of an open seat and a party fight.",

Bush was 17 points behind Michael Dukakis in 1988. In the late spring, he went on to win by almost eight points, a 25-point swing. Barack Obama had, in many ways, a more disastrous debate than Joe Biden. Only 20 percent in the CNN poll thought he won. 33 percent thought Biden won in a Republican-tilted poll. But to listen to the media, you would think nobody thought Biden won. The polls shifted 12 points after the Obama debate. He was eight points up. He went to four points down. And the same pundits were saying, oh, my God, he's finished. And of course, all the polls were showing that Donald Trump was going to lose in 2016. So if every candidate behind in the polls quits, Bush, H.W. would have quit, Obama would have quit, and Trump would have quit. And yet they all won. Plus, as I explained, almost immediately after the debate, the polls didn't move at all. There was a big headline, I think it was the \"New York Times,\" saying race static. Moreover, you know, we have seen the worst kind of ableism and ageism from the Democrats, the pundits, the operatives like James Carville. Yes, Joe Biden has a slight disability. He does commit gas, he stutters, he's not that quick in debates. But he's always had that, even back in the 1980s.

He said, we have the worst inflation ever, not even close. It's 3 percent right now. The record is 23.7 percent. Trump said there was no inflation a few short years ago, it was low, yes. But not nonexistent when he left office, and it was 8 percent total for his presidency. Trump also said the price of groceries is up 57 percent under Joe Biden, its actually 21 percent. He exaggerated about gas prices, about taxations. He wrongly said he ended North Korean missile launches. He said Democrats are proposing to quadruple people's taxes, which is totally imaginary.

The Biden administration tried to get Congress to pass a bill tightening the border. And after Trump helped kill that bill, Biden took executive action to tighten the border. Trump said he stopped human trafficking, just not true. He said China's stop buying oil from Iran under him, also did not happen. He said foreign governments are deliberately sending criminals and mental health patients from insane asylums to the U.S. as migrants. His own campaign has been unable to provide proof for that. I certainly cannot find any. He said we defeated 100 percent of ISIS in a couple of months. In fact, the ISIS caliphate was declared fully liberated, more than in two years into his presidency. And he said Russian warships are, in present tense, are operating in Cuba. And that the media refuses to write about this. The ships were there, but they left last month and media outlets, including this one, CNN, covered it quite a bit. Daniel Dale, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Democrats have ignored for many months the consistent finding and polls at most do Americans think that Biden is too old?But if Joe Biden had delivered that speech tonight, can you imagine the outcry among Democrats? It reminded me in some ways of the debate, where Trump was unfocused, rambling, grievance-filled, all the same things he was again tonight. [02:40:03] He has clearly lost a step as a candidate as well. I mean, we heard all week, including often on our air that there was a new Trump and it was going to be different Trump. This is the same Trump. I mean, this is the Trump who says his greatest regret of his first term is he didn't send federal force into blue cities over the objections of their mayors. I mean or who calls his opponents communists and fascists and vermin. There's a limit to how much he can go beyond who he is again, still on a strong position given the weakness of Biden, but I don't think there's anything tonight. And again, much like the debate that cause Democrats to believe they could not beat him if they had a stronger opponent.",

And that is kind of the road the path that is still out there for Democrats. I mean, you know, there's a lot of center right suburban voters who don't feel at home, even in the party that Republicans tried to put forward this week, they're not necessarily willing to vote for Biden, given all their concerns about him, Democrats are going through an exercise trying to figure out if they'd be more willing to vote for someone else, particularly the vice president. You know, look, Donald Trump has strengths as a candidate. He can mobilize his base. He has shown so far in pulling the capacity to cut into Democratic groups, African American voters, Hispanic voters. But ultimately, he is still a grievance politician, and that puts a ceiling I think on his potential support in a way that again, leaves an opening for Democrats, though, it's a harder and harder to see Biden being able to take advantage of that.",

But he is within range in most polling, although not necessarily in the very latest in the three Rust Belt states that were part of what I ones called the blue wall, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. And there argument is that among the voters who are not fully committed to either side at this point in those states, there are enough of them left and those voters tend to be even more negative on Trump than on Biden. And there is some evidence that that is true. The problem is A, they are really negative on Biden as well. And B, does Biden have the campaigning skills to kind of move them in his direction. I mean, he really has only one path, which is winning, sweeping those three states and one congressional district in Omaha, which we get into exactly to 270, Kim.
