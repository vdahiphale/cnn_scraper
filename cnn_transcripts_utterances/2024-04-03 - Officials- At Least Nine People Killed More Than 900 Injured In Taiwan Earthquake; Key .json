Live from New York, it is Wednesday, April 3rd, and Julia Chatterley, in for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Good evening once more. Multiple aftershocks are hampering rescue efforts in Taiwan as crews there try to reach people trapped after a powerful earthquake. At least nine people have lost their lives and hundreds have been hurt. The heaviest damage was reported near the epicenter in Hualien County. Dozens of buildings there are damaged or have collapsed, more than 70 people have been trapped in two mines. Ivan Watson is there in Taiwan. Ivan, they are familiar with the damage, the pressure, the dangers of earthquakes given their positioning. How has that played into what we are seeing today and what can you tell us about the latest in the rescue efforts?",

And it is also clear that there are a number of reasons why these vehicles should not have been struck, starting with the fact that they had given the Israeli military warning beforehand about the convoys' movements, the logo that appeared on at least two of the vehicles of the World Central Kitchen, and then of course going beyond that, the fact that they were traveling on this road, which was a deconfliction route and which the Israeli military already controlled and had a visibility of. So, a number of questions that the Israeli military still has yet to answer, even as they are accepting responsibility for this, acknowledging that it was a grave mistake and going so far as to how have the Israeli military's top general, Herzi Halevi delivering a video statement publicly apologizing on behalf of the military for this strike. Going forward, the military says that they are going to establish a joint command center to coordinate, to better coordinate the delivery of humanitarian aid in deconflicted with Israeli military operations in the area, but of course we know that humanitarian aid agencies for months now have been talking about the problems with that deconfliction, the lack of coordination with the military, which put their workers in danger.

That is the first time and that he has done so, and it is obviously a very public step for him to take, one that he does not take lightly. We know that his team has been considering for months the possibility of him leaving the emergency War Cabinet, so far, he has decided to remain in it for the sake of unity in the country. But now, we are seeing him take at least one step out in the open in defiance of the Israeli prime minister, making it known that he believes it is time for new elections, time for the Israeli people to show that they have confidence in their government and for Israel's political leaders to face their reckoning.",

Now, they thought they were going to win this, particularly because Disney to your point, has far more retail shareholders, meeting everyday investors than most average companies do, 40 percent of their investor pool comes from everyday people. And because of the strength of the brand, they thought that would help them to pull the win, but still, they didn't want to move forward with a lot of projects until this was off the plate.

I think this relieves a lot of pressure, Bob Iger doesn't have to address every little thing to prevent another activist push, but I think what this shows by the way, overwhelmingly is that there is just a lot of confidence in Bob Iger. You know, this was a board vote, but really it was about Iger's strategy, that was on the line here, and I think a lot of people think that Bob Iger has got this under control. You know, it is not going to be pretty, this is a company who has dealt with a lot, not just the pandemic and the closure of the parks, not just with the transition to streaming and the core cutting, but also trying to now figure out what is their future in an AI world, right?

About as far as the models go out, as faras I felt comfortable, because I saw in the forecast, you know, 21 days ago. But the forecast really have not changed much and it does look like parts of South Texas could not be probably the best place to be. And that's what we typically in the summertime, you get sunshine, it's a clear day in Texas right now. There's not a cloud in the sky, but that eclipse going right through the heart of Texas. And then all the way up even into Atlantic Canada. So here it goes. Across Waco, millions and millions in the path of this. They don't even have to move. This is 122-mile-wide darkness across the globe all the way up just to the east of St. Louis. You'd have to go off to Indianapolis, perfect viewing there. Across Cleveland, across my hometown of Buffalo, New York, and then up into upstate New York, and then across Maine and even into New Brunswick. So, yes, a long path of this. So many millions in the path, but so many millions here down across the deep south in the way, especially after 4:00. Now the good news is, it's over after 4:00, but there could be severe weather building there for people trying to get home. These puffy clouds, we call them cumulus, are sometimes -- as they go higher, they become more than cumulus. It could be cumulonimbus. That would completely block your view. There would be nothing to see if you're under one of those clouds. A cirrus cloud, no big deal. But, hey, we're still going to watch, we still have about four to five days whether this changes. But the models haven't changed for the past six days. So this is our real threat. Now, the total eclipse typically will run through this area of the northeast, which is a cloudy time. I lived in Columbus, Ohio, for a while in my career, we had 61 days in a row where the sun did not come out. A cloud stayed in that Scioto River Valley and they never left. So do we have that kind of scenario? No, not really because the pattern is moving. But here's the American model showing so many clouds down here where I was pointing because of the rain possibilities and a little bit less, a little bit thinner on up toward upstate New York. The European model has stayed right on its money, too, saying, this is exactly what I think. So models haven't changed much, and I think this is the problem. We're going to see some rain showers across parts of the Great Lakes early in the day. And then these storms could fire up across parts of Texas, Arkansas, and even as far north as about St. Louis, you just don't want to be under one of those big thick clouds. You just want to be under a thin cirrus clouds and sometimes it's only three minutes, I understand. But it can be so cool that the clouds can actually evaporate. So don't give up on it if you can't move. But this is going to be difficult for some people to get out of the way of these clouds. If can stay on the blue line here, you're in good shape at least for now. You know what, you're still going to have to wait another two or three days for a perfect forecast because we can't do perfect. It's just not five days out just yet. We'll see -- Julia.",

The duties went as high as 218 percent. They were enacted more than three and a half years ago during a tense period between the two nations. Australian officials welcomed the news and for good reason, too. The Chinese market for Australian wine was once worth more than $653 million. Nikki Palun is an Australian winemaker, and she joins us now from Melbourne. Nikki, fantastic to have you on the show. You've had a fascinating and challenging time over the last three and a half years. You're fluent in Mandarin, I believe. Your business before this all happened was 95 percent exports to China, and then the tariffs hit. It was during the pandemic. And you totally had to transition. How tough was that?",

And so I'm finding that there's -- I feel personally there'll probably be a little of a (INAUDIBLE) happen. So, initially, I'll be able to get back into the market. I'm hopeful within the next four, five weeks you start shipping containers over there. And then after that, I think we'll see. It might settle down a little bit as, you know, people start to find their feet in the new dynamics of the market. You know, as you said, there's a -- you know, there's an economic slowdown in China at the moment. So we'll see. However, that said, I really feel that I'm going to approach the market differently this time. You know, this is what's given me an opportunity of not being there for three and a half years.

So I'm quite very, you know, comfortable with the culture and the way China works. So I plan to go to China and really look for partners that I think want to work slowly and in a very long sense in the market because I think that's what's really important is to slowly build up the brand, build up the customer base, and just build a very nice foundation. But the other thing is really looking at two-way trade because I think that one of the things in the past that Australia did, we exported a lot of our wines to China but I just want to start exploring well, what -- how can we work more closely together in a two-way trade perspective.

I mean, what we learned through that period was a false word, a false phrase. You say the wrong thing, you accuse someone of doing something where COVID-19 is concerned, and that can create real geopolitical tensions and sort of overnight tariffs can go from very low to being punitively high.

So it's certainly something I've very much learned is that, as I said, don't put all the eggs in one basket, and really just try and make sure that you have that very diversified portfolio of different channels, different markets, different countries, because it could happen again. And that's something that I think every winemaker in Australia is aware of. But that said, you know, I hope it doesn't happen again. I feel -- I'm hoping that that was just one moment in time and that future governments can learn from, you know, the mistakes of the past.
