Trump traveled to his golf club just outside Miami Monday. We're supposed to say he spent the day speaking with potential candidates to join his team. Trump is pushing for his attorneys to take a more aggressive stance against the Justice Department as they defend him against allegations of mishandling classified documents. The former president is facing in total 37 counts, including 31 counts of willful retention of National Defense Information under the Espionage Act. Trump is denying all wrongdoing and claims the investigation is a politically motivated sham, intended to derail his plans to return to the White House. But Trump says he has no plans of dropping out of the 2024 race. Even as he faces a number of charges is subjected to more criminal inquiries. Despite all that, supporters of the former president are still pledging their unwavering support. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He had every opportunity to return these documents and he didn't.

In total, the Russians say they've already destroyed a large number of Western provided armor, including German made leopard two main battle tanks and U.S. donated Bradley infantry fighting vehicles.

Wagner boss Yevgeny Pregorgen refusing to abide by a defense ministry decree to sign a contract with the Russian army saying his mercenaries are more efficient than regular troops. Unfortunately, most military units do not have such efficiency, he says, precisely because Shoigu cannot manage military formations well.
