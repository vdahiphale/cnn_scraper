Today, Harris and Walz on their way to Wisconsin for some key stops in swing states.With us now, CNN political commentator Paul Begala, and former deputy communications director for the Trump-Pence campaign, Bryan Lanza. Gentlemen, I'm so glad you're here mostly because I intend to take this segment off and let you two just have an informed, intelligent discussion. But let me start it off with this, Paul. The rollout, so far, the best and worst parts of it? PAUL BEGALA, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST (via Webex by Cisco):  There hasn't been a worst part yet. Everybody makes mistakes and I'm sure Gov. Walz will, but he hasn't yet. The best part is they rejected this whole myth that your vice presidential pick should be based on electoral help, right? The Democrats haven't lost Minnesota in a presidential year in 50 years, so you didn't (INAUDIBLE) that. Vice President Harris picked Gov. Walz I believe because of who he is and what he represents. What he represents is the best of middle-class middle America. I mean, he's a coach. He's a teacher. He's a soldier. He's -- by the way, he's a hunter, which means guys like me still have a place in the Democratic Party. I love that this race is now -- it couldn't be a better contrast. I've complained for years about the Democrats becoming the party of the faculty lounge instead of the factory floor. This is a -- this is a farm guy. He grew up on a farm in Nebraska. He's comfortable wearing a Carhartt coat and a -- and a blaze orange hat. You know, the only blaze orange you're doing to see Donald Trump in is maybe a prison jumpsuit.",

But instead, she buckled to liberal progressive pressure and went against -- you know, went against somebody who would have almost guaranteed her presidential victory. That just goes to show you a) who Kamala Harris is, and b) who Tim Walz is. This is somebody who governed from the far left -- not the center. He's not a moderate Democrat. He governed as a far-left person. He didn't see a single whacky liberal Democratic bill that passed the Legislature he didn't sign. So extreme -- the guy has become so extreme that he actually signed legislation to put tampons in boy's bathrooms in elementary school. That's not mainstream America. That's not Michigan, that's not Pennsylvania, and that's not Wisconsin. So I think with their pick they decided to go full-on left, sort of double-downing on whacky San Francisco values.

We have shown you this before. This is the footage of what happened that day. Court documents say hotel workers held Mitchell down -- you see there -- after they say he entered the building in sort of a frantic state and tried to lock himself inside a women's bathroom and became combative with security. The autopsy revealed Mitchell died from restraint asphyxia and toxic effects of cocaine and methamphetamine. The manner of death was determined to be homicide. His mother said she believes Mitchell was suffering from a mental health episode that day. And Squad member Cori Bush loses her Democratic primary against St. Louis County prosecutor Wesley Bell. This secures another win for the pro-Israel group that also helped oust Rep. Jamal Bowman just weeks ago in New York but were critical of Israel's war against Hamas. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.
