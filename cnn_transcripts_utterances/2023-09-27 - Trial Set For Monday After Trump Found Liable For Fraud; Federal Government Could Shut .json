But I'm not talking about any of the four criminal cases he's facing, the 91 criminal charges laid out in those four indictments. I'm not -- not talking about the Manhattan district attorney's case about hush money paid to a porn star. I'm not talking about the special counsel's case in Florida about Trump's handling of classified documents. I'm not talking about the special counsel case in D.C. about Trump attempting to subvert the Constitution by trying to over turn the election. I'm not talking about the case down in Fulton County, Georgia, about Trump trying to allegedly steal the state's electoral votes, nor, by the way, am I talking about the civil defamation case brought by E. Jean Carroll who already won a sexual assault and defamation case against Mr. Trump. No, no, no, I'm talking about the New York attorney general's civil case against Trump. It is a legal blow that takes aim both at the former's president's legacy and, frankly, his wallet. Today, New York Judge Arthur Engoron announced the civil case against Trump, his adult sons and the Trump Organization. He said it will move forward on Monday. This is the same judge who just yesterday ruled that Donald Trump, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. are liable for fraud. The judge said they repeatedly lied about how much their properties are worth. They did that in order to get more loans, he said. The judge also canceled the Trump Organization's business certification, what some legal experts refer to as the corporate death penalty. Now, the former president, who has spent decades bragging about his wealth, and building a persona of an ultra accomplished real estate tycoon, a persona that helped propel him to a top rated network TV show and then, of course, to the presidency. He will see some of that same fortune put in the hands of a New York jury. The state's attorney general is seeking $250 million in damages, and a ban on the Trump's ever doing business in New York ever again. Now Trump's excuse on social media this morning, as I alluded to earlier, is this, quote: There is a powerful disclaimer clause on the first pages of the financial statements. It states that nothing in the financial statement should be accepted as fact. This is what seems an open admission of misrepresentation, though, assuredly stronger defenses for Mr. Trump and his family are to come. CNN's Brynn Gingras starts up our coverage today with a closer look at how prosecutors say a network of lies helped the Trumps build their wealth and their reputations.

At the moment, Speaker McCarthy does not have the votes but Speaker McCarthy is also opposed to what the Senate is planning to move forward with. That is a plan that Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, cut with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer that would extend government funding until mid-November to include aid to Ukraine, about $6 billion, a disaster relief as well. It does not have money for the border. Those are things that the House Republicans say they will not move forward unless Ukraine has pulled out of it and unless, they add border security money. So at the moment, there is an impasse. And there's also concerns within the top Senate Republicans that Speaker McCarthy himself backed away from a funding bill that he cut earlier this summer to raise the national debt limit that sets spending bill, and as a result of that decision they say has contributed to the mess they find themselves in, all raising questions about whether they could avoid a shut down, but some say a shutdown is inevitable.

Because it is not secure, they go on this journey and one of the arguments that is made and maybe you disagree with it, is that the border should be secure so as to discourage people from making this journey.
