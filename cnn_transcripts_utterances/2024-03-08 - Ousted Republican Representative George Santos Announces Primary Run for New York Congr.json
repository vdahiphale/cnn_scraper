That person, Nick LaLota of New York's first district.In a tweet, LaLota made clear he's not afraid of challenging George Santos. George Santos responding, \"Pathetic little man. Since you refused to move to the district, I'm coming in hot. LaLota is a Democrat RINO with an abysmal record.\" Now, obviously George Santos facing a series of allegations against him, 23 federal charges. He has pleaded not guilty, but this is something, as the fabricator, as someone who lied about his resume, as someone who is now facing these charges, it's going to be hard to beat LaLota in a primary, but George Santos making a little news last night at the State of the Union.",

The president also tackled head on the concerns about his age, trying to defuse it with a bit of humor while arguing that this campaign is not about someone's age. But whether they're presenting old ideas.Now today, the president will hit the trail, taking this message directly to the voters. That'll be in the critical suburbs of the Philadelphia area. You'll have Vice President Harris out west and Arizona and Nevada. The president tomorrow heading down to Georgia, and they're fanning out administration officials throughout the month of march, really trying to promote the policies of the Biden administration. Of course, the president will be out there trying to bring that direct contrast with Trump. I imagine when he's in a campaign setting, he might be saying Trump's name more directly. But really, time will tell how much this strategy is resonating with voters as polls has recently shown that he's in a very close contest, a hypothetical contest at this point, against the former president in November.",

Betsy Klein over at the White House just learned that there was no official invitation from this White House, and we've also learned that Orban didn't request to meet with Joe Biden or anyone from the administration.On the Trump side, there is a lot of significance against now, because one, Donald Trump is the former president hosting a world leader who is not meeting with the current president. Two, as you mentioned, he is now the presumptive GOP nominee. He could be a world leader again. And this gives us some insight into how Donald Trump wants to run the country. Donald Trump has long been a fan of a strongman, which Viktor Orban is. He has said and rallies, I'm going to read one thing he said, \"Some people don't like him because he's too strong. But it's nice to have a strong man in control of the country.\" He has praised him for his various policies, and the two seem to be playing out of the same political playbook. Now, what we expect today, closed-door meeting, told that they might release some photos, they might give us some sort of readout.

This individual, Conspirator A allegedly a foreign national, he was asking Korbein Schultz, who is this Army sergeant for information relating to advanced American weapons systems and interestingly, information related to the lessons that the US has learned from supporting Ukraine and its war against Russia that could then be applied to supporting Taiwan against a potential invasion by China. And so this was according to prosecutors, a really developed scheme here in which ultimately, Korbein Schultz was paid $42,000.00 for these documents that he was providing to this foreign national. Over the course of a year, those payments got larger and larger, according to which kinds of documents he would be providing. This handler, Conspirator A, he was asking for more and more secret information that he could then use for his own purposes. And so what we're learning, of course, is that this appear to be motivated simply by money. And also, apparently by ego, as you said he wanted to be Jason Bourne, and he also made reference to needing to get back his BMW. And so a lot at play here, but as you said, this does come just days after other individuals were charged with leaking classified information to foreign nationals, including on a dating site, and of course, just days after Jack Teixeira, who leaked all of that classified information online pleaded guilty to doing so and is going to be sentenced very soon for that -- Kate.",
