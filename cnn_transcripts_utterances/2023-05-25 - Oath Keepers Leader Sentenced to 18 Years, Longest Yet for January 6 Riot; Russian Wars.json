The Justice Department was very successful in making many of their arguments, including that one that you just mentioned, that the judge agreed with them that it was a crime of domestic terrorism and that Stewart was engaged in when he was engaging to seditiously conspire with others, leading the Oath Keepers on January 6th.Even though he didn't go in the building and was not personally violent. The judge noted that he believed Rhodes did want violence to happen that day and did believe that was the way to affect democracy. And the judge, Judge Amit Mehta, also spoke directly to Rhodes during the sentencing just before he told him he would be spending 18 years in total in federal prison. Judge Mehta said, \"You are not a political prisoner, Mr. Rhodes. That is not why you are here. It is not because of your beliefs. It is not because Joe Biden is the president right now.\" Rhodes also spoke on his own behalf and clearly was still of the belief that the election was illegal in 2020 and that the right-wing extremism was the answer for him and he would continue that belief system on even while he was in prison serving his time. Now, the - what is happening in court today, it is not done yet today, Brianna. We have another Oath Keeper seditious conspiracy defendant, Kelly Meggs. He is facing his sentencing right now and we are waiting for him to speak on his own behalf to the judge. It looks like he also is going to be found that the crimes he engaged in are part of domestic terrorism crimes as well, although the judge says that he's not going to be as harsh related to that for Kelly Meggs as he was with Stewart Rhodes. But we still don't have a number on exactly how long Kelly Meggs essentially the deputy to Stewart Rhodes will have for his sentence, how long he will be spending in prison, Brianna.",

We know this from the January 6 Committee that they conspired to plan this attack or this - the rally at the Capitol.But what's really interesting are two aspects of what Rhodes said. The first is Rhodes has - he has an education, Yale. He's always wanted to present himself as like the non-racist right winger. Like that's very important to him. So he has described the Proud Boys as the racist ones and the Oath Keepers are somehow not, not right wing, sort of Nazi extremist. They're just right winger. So he's always wanted this separation, just given his own sense of himself. He doesn't like who the Proud Boys are. He thinks that they don't do enough vetting of their membership. It's a distinction without a difference from the perspective of the insurrection. But the more important thing is in terms of the future. As the judge said, this is an ongoing threat. These organizations recruit, they get money, they organize around a notion that there's an overall movement with the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers now sort of really at each other. They've been at each other before but so publicly when Rhodes is getting sentenced. It's a good division. It's a good moment. You want the opposition to be divided. They will go against each other, so it's a good day overall.",

I think all the other Oath Keepers will also get that kind of enhancement, although perhaps not six levels. The judge actually has some flexibility there. But what the judge was trying to do is placed this sentence in context, not just with the rest of the Oath Keepers, who are being sentenced to now and in the days to come and the Proud Boys and so on, but also in the history of seditious conspiracy defendants. There aren't all that many seditious conspiracy convictions to look at, but many of them had lengthy sentences having to do with terrorist attacks where people actually were killed. So the judge is looking at the context, not just of this case, not just of the January 6 cases as a whole, but even beyond that to January - to seditious conspiracy cases as a whole. So there's a lot for him to consider. And given all of that, I think 18 years actually was a very fair sentence.",

It's a new video, a remarkable video, shows the moments just before a critical Russian warship ship was struck by an unmanned surface vessel in effect a naval drone in the Black Sea. The video shared with CNN by Ukraine appears to contradict claims by Moscow that the ship had been able to thwart a Ukrainian attack using drones and it's remarkable to watch them.And as you see it here, this is a camera from that drone. It only stops just as it appears to make contact with the hull. Our Fred Pleitgen is in Kyiv, Ukraine. I wonder what you're hearing from Ukrainian officials. Are they saying this was a successful attack? And do they have any sense of damage to the Russian ship?",

One of the things they don't know is how extensive the damage was.But, of course, the fact that they managed to get to that ship to the Ivan Khurs which, as you correctly pointed out, is an intelligence ship from the Russians that was in the Black Sea. That in itself to them is, of course, a big success, especially since it contradicts those claims that we heard yesterday from the Russians. And the Russians didn't only claim that the attack was unsuccessful, they even put out video of the ship, apparently destroying one of those surface vessels. And now it seems it turns out that actually the ship was indeed a hit. And you can see on that video how that surface drone - you can only see the tip of it, it's coming towards the ship. You see the ship apparently firing into the water in front of the drone, but then the last frame is, of course, the drone getting right up to that ship. And this in many ways is really remarkable on the part of the Ukrainians, because of course, it shows that the Russian warships in the Black Sea are not safe from these kinds of attacks from the Ukrainians. That's a big deal for the Ukrainians. But also the ship itself, this intelligence ship is a really important one for the Russians as well. It's one of the most modern intelligence ships that the Russians have. It only went into service in 2018, obviously a lot of sophisticated electronics. Again, they're not sure what the damage is, but certainly a big blow it seems once again to the Russian Navy, Jim.",

And yes, I do think that the Republicans have the right to head home to their districts and represent the people that elected them. The fact of the matter is we did our part, we passed the Limit, Save, Grow Act a couple months ago. And while Democrats remained silent and they didn't want to negotiate while President Biden ignored speaker McCarthy and him extending that olive branch to talk, nothing was done until the last couple of days.
