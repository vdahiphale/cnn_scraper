So, after the House Speaker made those comments to our colleague Manu Raju about possibly filing lawsuits and litigating this issue of who can appear on the ballot, we reached out to all 50 states, reached out to election officials to ask if there was any possibility that she could be prevented from appearing on the ballot.We heard back from 48 states that all said conclusively there's no issue here. I'm going to give an example of some of the things that we heard back from, for example, in Georgia. They said, \"Biden dropping out will not impact Georgia ballots.\" In Kentucky, they said there's no issue. West Virginia said, the candidate that will appear on that state's ballot will be the candidate that is nominated by the DNC. And Alabama said, that major parties have until late August to tell the state who should appear on the ballot. Now, the two states that did not respond to CNN, Florida and Montana, we looked at their rules and regulations and found no indication that she would have a problem in those states either. We've reached out to the Speaker's office to ask for clarification on exactly what he meant when he suggested there could be legal impediments, they have not responded. But I will note that even though these lawsuits are unlikely to be successful, it doesn't mean that we won't see any over the next few months, because just by filing a lawsuit, you can sow chaos and confusion, potentially even raise money off of some of these questions. We've seen that in the past, and I expect here again, even though they won't be successful legally, politically, this still could be a strategy that we see employed by some Republican allies.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [07:35:47] BLACKWELL: New economic data this week shows the economy is muscling forward, defying historical expectations. Second quarter growth jumped close to three percent. Prices last month rose at the slowest clip in more than three years. But how are Americans feeling about their personal finances, particularly, as we head into the election? Let's discuss now with CNN's economics and political commentator, and Washington Post opinion columnist Catherine Rampell, good morning to you. So -- we just got the PCE index.",

Most traders seem to be betting on the idea that September will be the next rate cut. And, you know, maybe something will change between now and next week, but the main indicators that the Fed will be looking at have already rolled in.

He tries to be very careful and make as little news as possible. That's basically the job of every fed official, every Fed Chair in particular.But there have been some clues. So, I think you mentioned that Powell has indicated that he doesn't necessarily need to wait until we are down to two percent inflation before the next cut. If they do wait, if the Federal Reserve at the FOMC does wait until then, it might be too late. Fed actions, interest rate changes tend to work with the phrases long and variable lags. So, if they wait until they're at their target, it may be too late. It may mean that we overshoot and that we do tip into a recession. So, you know, everybody will be watching what Powell says to get a sense of where he thinks we are on that trajectory. But, you know, he is -- he is made a bunch of public comments recently, as have other Fed officials. I think they have been -- they have tried to be relatively transparent about where they stand, but there is just so much uncertainty in this economy. That even if they are fully transparent, that doesn't necessarily mean even they know we know exactly when they will next move.",

Depending on how you measure it, we've maybe had one instance in the last, I don't know, 50 years, where the Fed was able to get inflation down without tipping the economy into a recession.And you are right. A year ago, I looked it up, the consensus forecast among Wall Street economists was that we would have a recession within the 12 months. The next 12 months, lo and behold, we're 12 months later, no recession, thankfully. And I remember at the time that there was this suspicion that this was like a -- I don't know, a conspiracy against Biden and the Democrats to make the economy look bad, to pretend that a recession was coming, you know, to kind of convince everyone that it was coming, and it would become a self-fulfilling prophecy. No, that's not what happened here. These Wall Street economists are paid to get their forecasts right. The reason why they were predicting a recession is because that's what usually happens. It is extraordinarily rare that the Fed is able to navigate us out of a really hot economic period with high inflation without causing a downturn. And look, if we make it, and, you know, knock on wood, we will. I think we should be very grateful, in fact, to the Federal Reserve and other economic policymakers for being able to navigate us through this.

I certainly cannot top Celine Dion in the voice days, after I've watched those clips over and over again this morning, and you can't help but get emotional. It was one of those iconic moments that will very much be the standout image of the opening ceremony from here.I mean, she'd said, in the midst of her struggles with dealing with the Stiff Person Syndrome that she is been dealing with. She just wanted to see the Eiffel Tower again. And last night, not only did she see it, she stood on it, performed and smashed it. And of course, did it in style, wearing Dior as well. And they promised an opening ceremony with a difference. It certainly was that. The scale of it, the pouring rain, the emergency ponchos, and if social media is to be believed, the athletes absolutely loved it. Coco Gauff and LeBron and the team very much, embracing their flag bearing moment, even with the pouring rain. But today, it is down to business. Katie Ledecky begins her fourth Olympics so with what is being billed as the Race of Champions against Ariarne Titmus and Summer McIntosh, three world record holders, three swimming superstars, going head-to-head in the 400-freestyle. Caeleb Dressel makes what is expected to be an emotional return after his time away in the 100-freestyle relay. Idaho's Chloe Dygert, looking to add Olympic gold to her World Time Trial medal. And what a moment it is said to be to -- for Giannis Antetokounmpo. He takes to the court for the first time at an Olympic Games. The one honor missing from his resume, having led Greece to their first games since 2008. But I have to say, in the style of saving the best until last, Team USA have already won their first medal, Sarah Bacon and Kassidy Cook, taking silver in the women's synchronized three meters springboard. Behind China, the USA's first medal in the event since London 2012. So, that celebrations have already started.",
