That's because three Republicans are leaving, Matt Gaetz of -- Matt Gaetz retired after withdrawing from consideration for attorney general. Plus, Elise Stefanik and Michael Waltz are expected to leave Congress for posts in the Trump administration. I'm joined now by May Mailman. She is a former White House associate counsel under President Trump. And also with us, CNN political commentator Karen Finney. What do you think, Karen, about these numbers? It is fascinating where this might break down, with a one-seat majority potentially for the Republicans in the House?",

And putting my partisan hat on, of course, I'd love to have a huge, a supermajority. But I think just putting my American hat on, I'm less concerned about that and more concerned that California is still counting votes. This is something that California really has to figure out. The election was almost a month ago. There are still more than 100,000 votes outstanding. Some of the tight races, the Republican was up by more than 1,000 votes and now they're losing.

It's about understanding -- because what Trump did was he understood, like, then the manosphere that we have talked about. He understood, they understood who his voters were, where they were, what message they needed to hear, and what channel they needed to hear it in. And we just didn't do as good a job on that. I mean, to some degree, think about in the South, where people were voting for candidates who were against segregation and they lost for a long time.

You can cook your turkey on the outdoor grill. You can use the electric countertop roaster, so many different ways. But I like the tried-and-true method, which is simply roasting your turkey breast side up in the open pan method. It's simple. It's a 325 oven from start to finish. Ideally, if you have a flat rack to place at the bottom of the pan, that helps to elevate the turkey up off the pan. But your best friend on Thanksgiving Day, Jim, is that meat thermometer.
