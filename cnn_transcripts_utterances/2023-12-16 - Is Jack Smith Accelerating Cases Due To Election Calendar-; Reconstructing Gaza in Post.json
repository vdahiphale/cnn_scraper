Just look at Jack Smith's conduct in this case, the motivating principle behind every procedural request he's made has been speed, has been getting this trial in before the election. Let's take a couple examples. The trial date, the average federal conspiracy and fraud trial takes about a year and a half to two years between indictment and trial.In this case, we have dozens, hundreds of January 6 rioters caught on video straightforward cases they two were given about a year and a half to two years between indictment and trial. Jack Smith originally requested a trial date for Donald Trump a far more complex case five months out, he wanted a January trial it was set for two months later. So Donald Trump was being given far less time to prepare than other defendants. And the actions this week, Jack Smith won an argument on immunity in the district court and then went right to the Supreme Court. I think the right move, I think the smart move. The only reason you ask the Supreme Court to do that on an expedited basis is if you're racing against the clock and Jack Smith clearly is doing that here.",

Two reasons, first of all, DOJ rules unwritten and written both say you are not supposed to do anything that could impact an election. In fact, you're supposed to affirmatively try not to take steps that might impact an election. And the second thing and I think Jack Smith is right about this is if he is to say, OK, judge, we really need to try this case before the election. Donald Trump is going to seize on that aggressively.He's going to say, see, folks, when I tell you this is political, Jack Smith is now admitted that he wants me tried before the election and that's political.

CNN's Clarissa Ward filed an amazing insightful report from inside Gaza this week after bearing witness to the devastating wreckage of buildings and infrastructure destroyed from the war and visiting a field hospital established by the United Arab Emirates.And on Friday, the IDF said it accidentally shot and killed three Israeli hostages who were shirtless and waving a white flag in Gaza. U.S. officials say Israel is transitioning into another phase of the war that's focused more on precise attacks against Hamas leaders. This comes after President Biden warned that Israel is losing international support. [09:20:05] As the destruction and civilian death toll in Gaza continues to rise, it's unclear how much it would cost to rebuild Gaza with no ceasefire in sight. My next guest argues that no Arab nation, European Union member or lawmakers on Capitol Hill will support funding a reconstruction of Gaza unless Israel has committed to a two state solution.

In his latest piece, \"New York Times,\" Pulitzer Prize winning author Thomas Friedman writes, \"Israel has skilled (ph) and wounded -- has killed and wounded 1000s of innocent Gazan civilians. Hamas knew this would happen and did not care a whit, Israel must. It will inherit responsibility for a gigantic humanitarian disaster that will require a global coalition yours to fix and manage.Joining me now is the three time Pulitzer Prize winning \"New York Times\" columnist and author of seven bestselling books, including, \"Thank you for Being Late. And from Beirut to Jerusalem,\" Thomas Friedman. Tom, thank you for coming back. I read the most recent column couldn't help but conclude that this is all going according to plan for Hamas. Am I right? And please explain. THOMAS FRIEDMAN, 3-TIME PULITZER PRIZE WINNER: Well, thank you for having me, Michael. Yes, I believe from the very beginning, Hamas's goal, Iran's goal has always been to enmesh Israel as deeply as possible in Gaza, and the West Bank, in fact. They think as long as Israel is enmeshed in Gaza and the West Bank, it will be an economic disaster, a moral disaster and militarily huge problem. They want Israel overstretch. That's the Iranian objective here, morally, economically and physically. Obviously, Israel faced a huge military dilemma after the attacks, the barbarism of the attack. But you know, from the very beginning, I argued that Israel should ask what its worst enemies wanted to do, and do the opposite. But unfortunately, it went in now it's in extremely deeply. It's committed to ultimately taking over all of Gaza. And what I was arguing the last piece is that if you're going to control, if 7 million Jews are going to control 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank, and 2.1 million Palestinians in Gaza, without any a political horizon, we're not talking about a new state tomorrow, but without a political horizon, you will never get the international support. You need to maintain that. And you'll be isolated, and ultimately, economically, militarily, and morally overstretched. So, that's been my concern.",

What's happening in the world is that Ukraine has been trying to join the west and Israel was trying to join the east through normalization with Saudi Arabia, which would open the way to the rest of the Muslim world. Russia and Iran and Hamas understood that, and they've been seeking to block both.So that's the sort of the geopolitical frame here. And it seems to me that we need a counter strategy to that. Now the Saudis are ready to go ahead. Obviously, you know, it depends how the war ends, but they're still committed to a security alliance with the United States and normalization with Israel. But they understand, you know, this is the first sort of omnichannel war, it has a deep military component, it has a deep digital component. And I would argue that while Israel may be winning on the physical component, Hamas has basically lowered it into radicalizing a whole new generation around the world that was not either emotionally or politically involved in this issue, including in the Arab world. Now in the Arab world is very complicated, because you also have a lot of young Arabs who are really focused on developing their own countries now. They're fed up with the Palestinian question, but they also are deeply wounded by emotionally what's going on in Gaza and they're affected by it. And so you've got all these conflicting emotions going on today, you know, across, I would say, the Arab world.",

This growing rift continues to garner more and more headlines. It seems like Netanyahu has completely, my words, not yours, sold out to those extreme forces that around him. What position does that put Biden in?[09:25:22] FRIEDMAN: Those are my words, not yours, I would say, because I totally agree. Look, Israel cannot win this war with Benjamin Netanyahu as Prime Minister holding the position politically that he's holding, which is that he will not talk about any kind of, forget Palestinian state, any kind of political horizon for the Palestinians after this war. And again, no one expects a state to be born tomorrow. But it's sitting down, figuring out what the Palestinians need, they need to get their act together. The PA is a corrupt, ineffective organization, for both Palestinian reasons and Israeli reasons, quite frankly, things Israel has done, but also much more with Palestinians have done. We need a new PA. We need a new legitimate moderate Palestinian Authority. That can only come I believe, with help from Israel, from the UAE, from Saudi Arabia, from Egypt, from Jordan. That effective PA can be the answer to a lot of questions, Michael. It can be the answer to who can govern Gaza, first in partnership and then later alone with Israel, they're not going to withdraw overnight. And ultimately, who can be the partner for a two state solution? It's not going to happen overnight. But if your position, which is Netanyahu's position, he is to run against Joe Biden. That's what Netanyahu is doing. He's running against Joe Biden, because Biden is calling for that kind of PA. You're never going to have the American partner, the global partner, you need Israel for transitioning out of Gaza. You will end up with 7 million Jews controlling 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank, 2 million in Gaza alone, and that is politically unsustainable.",

[09:35:01] The reason relates to circumstances surrounding an investigation of her husband, Florida GOP chair Christian Ziegler, who is being accused of rape by another woman. He has not been charged. And Bridget has not been accused of any criminal wrong doing. Here's the back story. According to an affidavit obtained by CNN, a woman told police that on October 2nd, there was a planned sexual encounter between her and both Christian and Bridget Ziegler. Bridget cancelled leading the other woman to also cancel, but Christian still showed up at the woman's home. The woman says that she told Christian she was -- quote -- \"Not in a place to consent because she had been drinking tequila all day.\" But she says he nevertheless had sex with her and she later called her sister and said that she had been raped. Christian Ziegler says the encounter was consensual and has refused requests to step down including from Governor Ron DeSantis. His lawyer says that he will be exonerated. So, why has this one-time private life choice touched a particular public nerve? In Bridget's interview with detectives, she admitted that the couple had a previous three-way sexual encounter with the woman over a year ago and that it only happened one time. And her group, Moms for Liberty, has led efforts in the state and beyond to remove books from classrooms they deem inappropriate for kids including those with LGBTQ themes. Bridget also helped author Florida's Parents' Bill of Rights, which Governor DeSantis signed in 2022, and DeSantis appointed her to the board that manages Disney's special tax district.

Correct me if I'm wrong in terms of the allegation. And when I watched it, I said to myself, who the hell is going to serve on a local school board other than some fringe type? Because the decent people that I can think of are going to say, I don't need it. You know, I'll go give to my community in some other respect. So, my point is larger than Sarasota. I'm worried that decent people are bypassing community involvement.",

I was that adolescent, that young person in the '70s, trying to figure out their identity. And it was a very different world at that time. And my self-esteem was constantly challenged.Now look at what has happened to those communities, those marginalized communities across the United States. And your point is so valid. It didn't just happen in Sarasota. It didn't just happen in the state of Florida. Governor DeSantis took those policies on the road deliberately and deliberately harmed children with Mrs. Ziegler only for their own personal political gain. And many of it, as you know, is being rejected as Mr. DeSantis is on that political trail. People are very angry. And you can look at the public comments that happened just recently in our school board and grandparents and parents and students came out to chastise Mrs. Ziegler for that very damage and that very real pain that was done.",
