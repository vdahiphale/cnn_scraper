So, that -- the agency says, four cars containing ethanol, a highly flammable product, caught fire and continue to burn. Four additional cars carrying ethanol may also release. The local fire department is currently the lead for the response and ordered a mandatory evacuation of the city and that evacuation remains in place.And as you mentioned, Jim, ethanol is this very dangerous chemical. Exposure can lead to coughing, dizziness, burning eyes, drowsiness. And so, first responders are really taking this seriously at the scene. To be clear, at this point, there are no injuries reported and the cause of that derailment is still under investigation. We have learned that the NTSB is now sending their own team to investigate. But as you can see on your screen, several cars were ignited in this derailment and have burned for hours and forced those evacuations, everyone within a half mile of this site in this small town in Raymond, Minnesota. The population there less than 1,000 people. And this comes nearly two months after that derailment in East Palestine. Several incidents, but that one the highest profile, which also caused a large fire and an evacuation and, of course, those concerns, health concerns environmental concerns. And so, this is a very active scene. We know the governor is heading there now, and we'll have more updates throughout the morning. Jim, Jessica.",

So, help us understand where we stand now, because there's been a gradual watering down of nuclear agreements, the pulling out of the nuke -- the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty, the pulling back from some of the notifications as required under START, but also open threats to use nuclear weapons, right, in and around Ukraine. What actually remains of the notifications and the other parts of the START Treaty right now in the wake of this?",

      "sentences": "So, very little, unfortunately. Both Russia and the United States have said that even though they won't be providing the notifications every six months of how many nuclear forces they have, where they're located, and movements of those forces, that both sides will stay under the limits established by the treaty. Under New START, both sides will have no more than 1,550 offensive strategic nuclear weapons deployed. And we believe -- the U.S. government has said, we believe that Russia continues to be under that limit.But Natasha was exactly right, that the transparency, the predictability that the information the two sides of exchanged is important, both for tracking how many they have and what they're trying to do with them. And the loss of that information is dangerous. Russia's behavior really undermines its own security and our security. And we have to recognize this is a tactic that Vladimir Putin is trying to use to scare Europe, to divide the west, so that we don't support Ukraine. And I think we have to be cautious not to play into that narrative. I think President Biden has been very, very cautious about this. But at the same time, I don't think we should race to the bottom and just replicate Russia's behavior because I don't think that's in our interest. SCIUTTO:  These treaties were designed partly to limit nuclear forces, deployed warheads, et cetera, but also to reduce the chances for miscalculation. That one side reads another side's move, exercise, test as an actual threat offensive operation. Does this put us closer, the two nations closer to this reading each other?",

      "sentences": "Absolutely. Look, we have spent the last 50 years trying to build up a pattern of behavior, levels of transparency, exchanges of information, norms of acting that Russia is now actively undermining. And to be fair, the Trump administration also pulled out of a number of treaties. They made it easier for Russia to actually behave this way and not suffer international condemnation.But the reality is that, in my view, we are at the most dangerous point in terms of our nuclear relationship with Russia than we were since before Gorbachev in the mid-1980s. We no longer have confidence that Russia is going to act in a reasonable way. And Russia is increasingly flying blind because their intelligence is not as good as ours. Their satellites aren't as good as ours. So, they need this information in fact more than we do. And in fact, I would argue and have mentioned to my friends in government that I don't think we should just say to Russia, OK. You're going to pull back. We're going to pull back. Because they're the ones who'll benefit if the world gets closer to the nuclear brink, not us.",

      "sentences": "Well first, I think we have to be cautious. China is building up its nuclear forces. But the U.S. has about 4,000 nuclear weapons and China has about 400. So, we still outnumber them 10 to one. Now, that may not be the case in 20 years, but right now, that is the case. We can deter China at the nuclear level. But it's, I think, another reason why we shouldn't just adopt Russia's now very opaque lack of transparency.What we want to do is establish a high bar and be able to go to Russia and China and say, look, this is the way of responsible country behaves. You actually notify each other when you have nuclear operations. When you test missiles. When you move these things from one place to another, because things can get out of hand. It wasn't that long ago that a Russian aircraft bumped a U.S. drone over the Black Sea. And it wasn't that long ago when a Chinese aircraft down a U.S. aircraft over Hainan Island. So, these things can spiral quickly and the U.S. should be trying to create the flow of information that avoids that are possible.

It's a little bit before 10Now, she calls a suicide prevention hotline and someone there tells her, look, you should probably call the sheriff's office. She finally gets ahold of someone at the sheriff's office and they tell her, you need to call a non-emergency phone number. By the time she reaches someone at that phone number, it is now 10:21 in the morning and the shooting is well underway. Now, what's unclear at this hour is exactly why Patton (ph) kept being passed from one department to another. It's quite possible that she just had very little information to pass along. She did not know the shooter's name and did not have an address for where the shooter lived. Here now is just a part of that phone call.
