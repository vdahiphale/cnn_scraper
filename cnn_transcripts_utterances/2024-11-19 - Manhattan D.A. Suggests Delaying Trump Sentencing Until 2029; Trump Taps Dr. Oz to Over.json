Donald Trump taps his friend for a new job inside the administration. This is the drama around his picks seems to ramp up to all new levels. Plus, millions of users ditching Elon Musk's X for Bluesky. The company's CEO joins me for our first television interview tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\"All right, get your calendars out. I want you to circle this date, January 20th, 2029. I know it seems like a lifetime away because it frankly is, but stick with me, because as of right now, that could theoretically be when a judge considers sentencing Donald Trump in his hush money case, the end of Trump's second term, which is four years, two months, and one day from right now, but who's counting? Manhattan D.A. Alvin Bragg is acknowledging to Judge Juan Merchan that even after a jury found him guilty of 34 counts on May 30th of this year, January 20th, 2029 may very well be how it all plays out. But should it a freeze of the case? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They argued his conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records should be thrown out because he's about to become the president yet again and return to the White House. And well, because of that Supreme Court presidential immunity decision.But Bragg is putting his foot down. He says maybe justice deferred, but not dismissed. Dismissed, apparently, is entirely off his table. So, now, Judge Merchan finds himself between a rock and a hard place, delay sentencing until 2029, say that again, and dole out a punishment to a former president more than four years removed from the verdict and maybe over a decade from the actual alleged conduct, or dismiss the conviction and go against the D.A. and the Manhattan jury that found him guilty. We're going to find out what the judge decides to do in the weeks ahead. But one thing is certainly for sure. It is a huge turnaround for Trump's legal fortunes. On top of the unknown outcome in New York now, the two federal cases against him are now winding down. And the Georgia case has been delayed indefinitely as Trump and his co- defendants tried to remove the Fulton County D.A., Fani Willis, recently re-elected from the case. Now, Trump is rewarding the allies that stood by his side. Many of them trotted in and around that Manhattan courthouse to defend him. Among them, J.D. Vance, the vice president-elect. Well, that worked out well for him. Matt Gaetz, Trump's pick for attorney general. Mike Waltz, the National Security advisor pick. Doug Burgum, up for Interior secretary. I'm seeing a pattern here, are you? Vivek Ramaswamy, co-leader of the Department of Government Efficiency. Pronounced DOGE, by the way. Now, Trump is even rewarding his lawyers, Emile Bove and Todd Blanche, both of them picked for high-ranking posts, you guessed it, in the Department of Justice. The show of force, by the way, wasn't just a visual show of force. It was vocal, too. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) J.D.

So, we are going to be finding out very soon whether or not Mr. Penny takes a stand. Now, there's a number of reasons why he should or should not do that, but I imagine that his defense is weighing that exactly right now. Remember, their defense, so far, has been justification. Daniel Penny was afraid that Jordan Neely was going to attack people. Therefore, he felt the need to intervene. And causation, that the chokehold did not kill Jordan Penny, but rather a combination of factors. That part of their defense has run into some issues in the last few days after the medical examiner said that the chokehold, without a doubt, according to her findings, had killed Neely.",
