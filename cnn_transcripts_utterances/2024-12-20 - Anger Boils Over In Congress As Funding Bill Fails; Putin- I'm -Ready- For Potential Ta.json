You're going to have -- it's almost impossible to get down to 38 Republicans to get them to vote for some CR.And this was -- I mean, they this was as much as a pared down conservative CR that could pass and even get signed into law, because you still have a Democrat Senate and Democrat White House. And J.D. Vance said while he was leaving yesterday that trying to pin on Democrats basically saying, like they've asked for a shutdown, they might get one.

And here's how \"Politico\" wrote it this morning. This is their lead on their story. They write, quote, the collapse of Speaker Mike Johnsons spending plan illustrates a painful lesson that other politicians have already learned. Absolute loyalty to Donald Trump is a one way street. As the U.S. teeters on the edge of a government shutdown, bitterly divided Republicans are struggling to find a way forward, and Johnsons hold on his job is in Trumps mercurial hands.

He was not aware of all the things that were stacked in it that Republicans were against. And because Johnson but also, I mean, Trump has been -- he's not -- doesn't really like to negotiate that much or he wants to get his way most of the time. And he Johnson has to give Democrats stuff they wanted or to pass because they have legitimately one half of one branch of government. And so, Johnson is going to have to negotiate with Democrats.

Donald Trump appears to be emerging as the negotiator there. But he even said he would talk to Zelenskyy. But there are conditions in the background here to any potential deal because Putin has also made it pretty clear that he doesn't want to give up any of the territory he's gained. He doesn't want Ukraine to join NATO. These are things that obviously Ukraine will want. He's also suggested yesterday that he wouldn't be able to sign a deal with President Zelenskyy in his current role, because they would it would have to be a -- you know, he's currently ruling through an emergency, you know, wartime procedure. Putin suggested that he would only deal with whoever parliament had appointed, so they'd want to see fresh elections, it seems, before they would actually sign a deal with Zelenskyy.

So, you know, there's a practical difficulties there of actually making it happen.But certainly, there's a huge fear, particularly in the European Union, of a trade war with the United States. And it is really sort of looming over everything. And it's interesting, lots of reports coming out from the UK that Peter Mandelson will be appointed by the United Kingdom as the ambassador to the U.S. He's a huge figure in trade negotiations. He was the E.U.'s trade commissioner as well. It goes to show how even the UK is very concerned about this as well. We'll wait to see whether or not that appointment is announced today. But that gives, you know, Donald Trump, someone potentially could work with certainly to do some sort of trade deal with the UK as the UK would like, but also would understand how the EU works. But I mean, I think this is really going to define the relationship with between the whole of Europe, really, and the U.S. into next year.
