The former president and current candidate for president in 2024 is now facing more than 30 counts related to business fraud. And if convicted, Trump could be sentenced to a maximum of four years in prison.Our reporters, correspondents and guests are all standing by to bring us the latest. We're going to get to everyone there. But let's begin first this hour with CNN Correspondent Kara Scannell, who's outside that Manhattan courthouse. Kara, we start with you because we want you to walk us through what happens now.",

      "sentences": "Good morning, Jim and Jessica. So, now we understand from sources that former President Trump is expected to be arraigned on Tuesday. That means he will surrender. They will work out a time because of the big security issues around a former president coming to appear in court. So, there's going to be discussions about security. They will set a time for him to come and surrender.He will surrender to the building behind me, around the corner where the D.A.'s office is. There he will be processed, just like any other defendant. He will have a mug shot taken. He will be fingerprinted. He'll be read his rights. Then, at some point, he will be brought down to the judge in that courtroom where the judge will read the police the charges to him. And we expect the charges to be unsealed only on Tuesday. That's according to sources. So, we will not get a sense of what the specific charges are or what kind of evidence the prosecution has to support that. That will all become public on Tuesday, according to sources. So, once in the courtroom, it's unclear if the former president will be handcuffed. We heard his attorney saying that he wouldn't be but that will be at the discretion of the district attorney's office. So, he will appear in court. The judge will go over the charges, and then the president will be asked to enter a plea. Now, his lawyers are saying he is going to fight this case. He will enter a plea of not guilty, we expect, and then he'll be released because this is not a violent crime, there's not a bail issue here. That is the mechanics of how this will work. Of course, because he is a former president, there's going to be a lot of logistics involved. Will they bring him in through a secret underground tunnel? You know, the Secret Service has to be careful about potential protests. So, there are a lot of bigger issues at play here. But, in general, the process even though this is an extraordinary moment, will be normal. Jim, Jessica?",

      "sentences": "Right. So, this grand jury is a six-month grand jury. They started hearing evidence in this case in January. We saw people from Trump's campaign come in. His longtime friend, David Pecker, the former chairman of The National Enquirer, was in. And then the D.A.'s office had asked Trump did he want to come in. That's required under New York law. That was a big signal that two weeks ago that this was moving towards the end zone.A lawyer for the former president -- lawyers for the former president asked the D.A. to bring in Michael Cohen, Trump's former fixer, attorney. Prosecutors then, one week later, brought in Pecker again as a rebuttal witness. Now, we're also learning that the grand jury had heard questions asked of witnesses about other hush money payments. We have been talking about how this involves Stormy Daniels. We're learning now that they were asked about some of these other catch and kill deals that Trump had orchestrated over the years with David Pecker. Now, those deals themselves are not illegal, but there are questions there about how they were put together. And that's the essence of what we understand that this case is going to be about. The potential charges here, we're going to be learning from sources more than 30 charges relating to falsified business records and falsifying business records to commit or conceal another crime. As I said, all of those details will become public on Tuesday. Jim, Jessica?",

And if the indictment develops, as we expect, there is powerful evidence that Donald Trump issued 11 checks, Trump and those associated with him, recording what were hush money payments as legal fees. So, that, to me, that is a very powerful, open and shut violation of these financial records. And if you do it to cover up a campaign finance violation, it becomes a felon.",

And there's associated recordkeeping that goes with each one of those checks. That could also constitute each one a separate books and records violation to cover up this alleged campaign finance fraud.But I think it's important until we see the indictment not to jump to conclusions about what those 30-plus counts are.

To suggest that anybody understands how this is going to play out politically would mean that this must have happened in someplace before and, look, it hasn't, we're in totally unprecedented territory here.What we know the Trump campaign is doing is employing a tactic that at times has proven successful for them before, which is the former president portraying himself as a victim of a political prosecution here, that this is purely political, is an attempt to galvanize and fortify support around the Republican Party. And we see it happening at the elected official level. We see all the members of Congress largely coming to his side. We see his 2024 opponents and potential opponents stepping out and taking on Alvin Bragg and taking on Trump's script, saying this is a political prosecution. So, right now, we see Trump's campaign eager to employ this as a as a short term political tactic. How it plays out long-term in the nomination race and then potentially in general election, I just don't think we know yet.",

And, S.E., you're hearing in New York with me, and it's interesting because David mentioned the fellow 2024 candidates or some that maybe candidates and haven't announced yet, I think we have a graphic that shows some of their reactions. We know that former Vice President Pence was on our air. He said that no one should be above the law, but he criticized this case. DeSantis called it a, quote, weaponization of the legal system. Nikki haley saying this is more about revenge than justice and so on and so forth.How do they thread the needle here? And what do you do if you're a potential rival because you need the base support, but at the same time, this is a chance to kind of needle at Donald Trump with all the baggage that he brings, right? S.E. CUPP, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  I think you let the court of public opinion do that for you. I think if you're running against Donald Trump, David Chalian is right. But the field is frozen. There's really nowhere for them to go. You're not going to win any voters on the right, and we're still in a primary, by applauding this decision or, you know, dunking on Donald Trump right now. So, I think they're doing the right thing. But I think when it comes to the politics of this, it's really important to remember. I think that this indictment is coming in spite of politics, because if you were trying to orchestrate a political takedown of Donald Trump, you wouldn't start with this charge. But also it's important to look at the people who are outraged, right, the folks running against Donald Trump, the Tucker Carlsons, the Fox News, the Republican Trump surrogates. These are people who are outraged by this indictment. They were not outraged by Trump's attempt to overturn a democratic election. They were not outraged by the violence on January 6th. They were not outraged by an illegal phone call to the Georgia secretary of state, an illegal phone call to Volodymyr Zelenskyy. They're not outraged by multiple, credible accusations of sexual harassment, assault and rape. They're not outraged by Trump's sexist, bigoted, homophobic, xenophobic rhetoric. They're not outraged by his white nationalism. They're not outraged by his defense of anti-Semitism and neo-Nazis. They're not outraged by all that stuff. So, with all due respect, no one should care that these people are outraged by this indictment.",

It's another to say, and we're willing to say no to the kinds of voters that he courted so that he could win, the white nationalists, the Oath Keepers, the QAnon, the conspiracy theorists, the bigots. This wing of the Republican Party that Donald Trump said, come one, come all. Previous Republican Parties would say, you're not welcome here. I'm not going to court you. I'm not going to pretend I don't know who you are.

He even suggested that there would be death and destruction if indeed he is indicted.Now, Mike Pence, just to note, in that interview last night with Wolf Blitzer, while he called this indictment outrageous, he did say that rhetoric of Donald Trump's is out of bounds and that that is totally unacceptable rhetoric. And so we will watch as New York prepares for this moment on Tuesday. Marjorie Taylor Greene tweeting that she's going to go there and join in a protest, to me, would be an immediate level of concern of a high- profile member with a following. How large does a potential protest come? This is something for security officials to watch, but you're right to note what happened over the summer in the aftermath of that. And, obviously, this is not something that anybody would hope would happen, but it seems that the security officials are engaged in very real conversations about dealing with it, if it does.",
