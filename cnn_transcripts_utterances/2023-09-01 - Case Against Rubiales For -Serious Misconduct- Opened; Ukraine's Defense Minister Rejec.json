Tonight, breaking news in the last few minutes.Spain has opened a case against Spanish football chief, Luis Rubiales for serious misconduct. What does that mean? We are live in Madrid in just a moment. Then Ukraine's Defense Minister hits back claims that Ukraine's counteroffensive is failing. We'll have more from Dmytro Kuleba's interview with Christiane Amanpour just ahead. Plus, 200 kilometers an hour wind are battering Hong Kong this hour. We have the very latest on Typhoon Saola and where it's   headed next. But first, this just coming into us. Spain has opened a case against Luis Rubiales for what it deems serious misconduct, but not very serious misconduct. And that basically means the National Sports Council cannot suspend him for the time being. Meanwhile, the coach for the men's national team in Spain, Luis de la Fuente is apologizing for giving, if you remember, standing ovation to football federation boss, Rubiales a week ago. Rubiales was giving a speech saying, he would not resign, if you remember, that was last Friday, and not resign for grabbing and kissing star player on the mouth during the award ceremony at the Women's World Cup. That player of course, that we've been talking about here on the show is Jenny Hermoso, who said, she did not want to be kissed. The women's team coach also gave Rubiales a standing ovation that day, leading to calls for him and de la Fuente to step down. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LUIS DE LA FUENTE, MANAGER, SPANISH MEN'S NATIONAL TEAM:  I don't have to resign. I have to ask for forgiveness. I made a mistake. A human mistake. I said it was inexcusable, but right now, if I could go back, I wouldn't do that. I'm sure of it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, all they can do at this point is to request to the tribunal, to suspend Rubiales. Basically, Rubiales' fate is still in limbo.

And that it has opened more than 3,200 related criminal cases. The allegations include murder, torture, kidnapping, sexual violence and more. Russia's treatment of Ukraine's children has long faced international scrutiny. And Russia has repeatedly denied accusations of human rights abuses. Let's bring in CNN's Melissa Bell for more, she's live for us in Zaporizhzhia. And Melissa, I'm keen to delve a bit deeper into these allegations, heinous crimes being committed there.

And then when you look at the range of allegations that have been made against Russian soldiers, and they go from instances where towns or villages have been occupied, people have been held in basements and tortured and no difference has been made between the children and the adults. So children who have been tortured. Allegations of sexual crimes against very young children. And then they go also to the question of the deportations that we've covered so extensively over the course of the last year. And for which war crimes, investigations been opened even at The Hague against Vladimir Putin and the woman in charge of these mass deportation of Ukrainian children towards Russian territories. So, a vast array of alleged crimes that have been committed again against very young children. The point of the Ukrainians from the very start, within just a couple of months of the start of the invasion has been to seek, to prosecute these crimes aggressively because, Isa, it's a difficult thing to do in wartime. But their point was that if they could do it and show that the justice system was functioning, that there could be no impunity, they might be sending a very strong message to those Russian soldiers who are even now occupying Ukrainian territories, that what they do, they will be held accountable for. And so, you see the result of this strategy where the judiciary has continued to prosecute these cases aggressively. Looking not alone, because there are the Ukrainian prosecutor's offices across the country. But also, the jurisdictions of many other countries that have gotten involved in trying to investigate and prosecute the crimes that have been alleged to have been committed here, and of course, the international tribunal at The Hague as well. So, there's a lot of work that's been done and that is ongoing. And the understanding is that these crimes, the 3,200 that are now been opened here in Ukraine will first of all, if they're allowed to continue and be brought to some sort of resolution, allow for some sort of justice to be served. But again, to serve as a reminder and a warning to those still occupying the lands here in Ukraine. That what you do when it is against international law, when it is against even the rules and the rules that apply in a war zone and to war, that you will be prosecuted and sort out, not just --",

And while Trump did cover the defense costs of advisors, aides, as well as employees during the House Select Committee's probe into the January 6 insurrection, it is not clear if he will get those charge in the Georgia case, a source close to Trump tells CNN the Georgia defendants have not asked him for help. For more, let's bring in our Kristen Holmes in Washington, D.C. So, Kristen, I mean, this legal battle, these co-defendants are facing, I mean, this could be very costly indeed. Just talk us through how they are finding the funds for this. KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, the costs here are really enormous. I mean, we even know that one of these co-defendants spent a week in jail already because they couldn't afford an attorney. And so, we're starting to see these co-defendants raise money in really creative ways. And part of that is crowdfunding, several of them taking to a Christian-based crowdfunding site to raise money and that includes Jenna Ellis. These are the lawyers, a John Eastman, who raised $500,000, Jeffrey Clark, who is a former DOJ official, as well as Cathy Latham, who is a fake elector. Now, on top of that, we know Rudy Giuliani, who has had significant financial problems, is getting some help from Donald Trump.

We also know that for Giuliani, his son has started a PAC in order to help him pay off those legal bills. Now, again, this is expected to be an extraordinary fee. And for most of his aides, advisors, employees, former and current, who have been caught up either in the January 6 Committee investigation or in these federal investigations, Trump has voted the bill, particularly through his Save America PAC. That's a leadership PAC. Now, they have spent more than $41 million in legal fees since 2021. Because of that, they actually requested a refund on $60 million that that group had given to a super PAC supporting Trump for the campaign. They are expected to get that money back. But that goes to show you just how much money they are spending on these legal bills. And the other thing I want to note is that this is also why Trump's team started a legal defense fund in July. Now, this was made for those aides and advisors, really to help offset the cost of these enormous legal bills. And I am told that Don Jr. and Eric Trump are both helping fundraise for this nonprofit, that they have a lot of pledges out. But it's not clear how many of those pledges have actually turned into real money. They're not sure if they've even collected on them. And I was told by one of Trump's advisors that if any of these Georgia code defendants want to get help, they should apply to the legal defense fund. But again, it's not really clear how much money is in this legal defense fund or if they'd even be able to help right now.",

And at this point today, we're actually awaiting the sentencing of that fourth Proud Boy, Ethan Nordean. He was the leader of the Seattle chapter and he was convicted, like the others have, of seditious conspiracy. So, he was on the Capitol grounds January 6th. He was convicted, you know, in helping to plot the violence, also in helping to encourage all of the violence that day. His conviction came down just a few months ago in May along with four other members. So, Isa, his lawyers have asked for a lighter sentence than the 27 years federal prosecutors are asking for. The sentencing is ongoing right now. And it's interesting because in a statement that he submitted to the court, Ethan Nordean, he said it was Trump who left his group on the battlefield as he put it, bloody and alone. So really pointing the finger at the former president who himself is facing multiple indictments. So, the judge, Isa, is considering that sentencing right now. And then earlier today, we saw another member of the Proud Boys, as you mentioned, Dominic Pezzola. What was interesting is, he was sentenced to 10 years and as the sentence -- the sentencing finished and the federal judge actually left the courtroom, that's when Dominic Pezzola actually raised his fist and said Trump won. That despite the fact that during the sentencing itself, Pezzola had said, you know, I'm a humble and changed man. And the judge kind of had said, I think you may have turned a corner here, but then he did that at the end of sentencing. So there's a lot unfolding in the courtroom and federal court now. These Proud Boys being brought to justice after a lengthy, you know, indictment. Two years -- more than two years after January 6th, Isa.",

I mean, he talked to the judge. Members of his family were in the courtroom as well. And they are all expressing great remorse saying that this was the worst, most regrettable, maybe decisions of their lives. But then the fact that Dominic Pezzola kind of turned around and showed that defiance as he was being left out of the - - let out of the courtroom after the judge has left saying Trump won, it really does show maybe this either internal conflict within these Proud Boy members, or maybe they're just playing to the judge, saying what their lawyers want them to say, but there's a lot of conflict, maybe still feeling strongly in support of the former president and some not as in support, obviously, of the former president.",

Almost 90 percent of voters were in favor of the ban, although overall voter turnout was very low. This vote came after hundreds of e-scooter related accidents last year. The ban only impacts rentals and not privately owned scooters. Well, Paris is scheduled, as you know, to hold the Paralympic game, let's just say, in less than one year and that is bringing increased focus on how accessible the host city actually is. Our Jim Bittermann went around the city to investigate further. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JIM BITTERMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): With less than a year to go before Paris hosts the next Paralympics, officials have been showing off how much work has been done, with President Emmanuel Macron having promised 1.5 billion Euros. \"To assure the accessibility of the competition to athletes, visitors and tourists.\" But \"accessible\" is a word scoffed at by some disabled like Franck Maille. Go for a tour with Maille, a Paralympic medal winner himself on Paris' most accessible public transport systems and you see the problems, which face the 350,000 disabled visitors expected to attend next year's games. When Mai comes into the city for instance, he uses a renovated train line equipped with elevators making it accessible, but he points out not accessible without help. And while there are elevators, they're sometimes hard to find or not functioning, as a disabled British visitor found out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
