Frankly, somebody who is going to purposefully murder as many people as possible is not really going to worry about whether he is going to get a ticket for going around the police car, so that was inadequate. Bourbon Street is complicated in that the barriers that they used, the bollards that go up and down, the delta barriers as some of them are called, have mechanical issues. Sometimes they get stuck in the up position, sometimes they get stuck in the down position, sometimes they remove them on the idea that they're going to get new barriers, but then things slow down. They need those streets to be openable because, one of the things about Bourbon Street is it can be a tinderbox. These buildings are all attached. Many of them are wooden. If there is a fire, they can't have the fire trucks kind of waiting at the barrier for the person who has the key. So that was just really underestimating the threat of a ramming attack.",

We spoke to a couple that were staying, actually in one of the higher floors above the 40th floor, and they said they could hear that bomb sound go off and they could feel the windows shaking.
