There have been parents and activists from urban areas and rural areas who have been impacted. I was in high school when Columbine happened, which was one of the first school shootings, and now three decades later, Sandy, Hook Parkland and Uvalde.

I think the only way to convey change is to get local community influencers to talk it up, not elected officials. Look what's happening in Tennessee. For goodness sakes, right now, they want to throw out, as I understand it, three members of the legislature because they were standing up for kids who were unhappy about the fact that schools weren't safe. So, I think elected officials are not the people to do this. Sorry, I just wanted to add something. A key to crime reform in the 90s were police unions. I don't understand, except from the side of identity and culture, why police unions who are the frontline of defense, who have to be standing in front of the AR-15, why they are not holding hands with families and saying, enough is enough, because they're the ones who could get killed too.",

So, you know, generally a tornado is going to travel in a pretty linear or straight line in the direction it's traveling, but they do change directions as this storm, the tornado starts to rope out. It will start to turn to the north back into the core of the storm.But also, this particular tornado if you watch closely, you in my video, I'm coming up fast on the tornado. And as I got close to it, actually, I slowed down a little bit like a judge. It's what it's doing. The vortex on the ground was actually at one moment started backtracking towards me, maybe 10 yards and when I was only about 20 yards from the tornado at that point. And it quickly slingshot it off to the northeast away from me. So, very fast-moving tornado so that also made it a little -- you have to be much more careful trying to gauge what this tornado is going to do.",
