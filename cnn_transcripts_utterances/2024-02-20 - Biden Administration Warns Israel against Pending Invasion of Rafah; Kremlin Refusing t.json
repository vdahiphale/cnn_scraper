Because in essence, the United States is heading off or providing an alternative resolution to the one that Algeria is putting forward which has wide international support for an immediate ceasefire. The prime minister here hasn't responded, publicly, yet, at least, to the U.S. version. But the U.S. version is still very, very clear. It says the conditions right now for a military incursion into Rafah would quite literally result in more civilian deaths, potentially push people across the border, weaken international security and peace, certainly in the region around here. So it's with very high levels of caution and guidance for the Israeli government, but the prime minister here is likely to read this as he is being given more time, because the wording from the United States is not a permanent ceasefire, and it says, when it is practicably possible.",

There's this fascination in part of the American right. CPAC has hosted Viktor Orban. They see him as sort of this Christian nationalist who is taking Hungary that direction.The reality is this -- this is a man who has tried to block aid from the E.U. to Ukraine, finally had to give in on that, tried to block Sweden's membership. I think the fascination probably comes much more from a place of siding with Russia against Ukraine in this war effort. This, this is -- Donald Trump is very much cut from the same cloth as Viktor Orban. It's this strongman type way of leading, the way the rhetoric that he uses, the way that he appeals to his audience is very similar.

He likes the way they lead and they present. And again, that is why he liked strongmen. He praises Xi. He praises Kim Jong-un. He sees them as strong leaders who challenge their people and try to rule with an iron fist. That does resonate with him.I think that this comes down to the fact he's always hesitated to criticize the Kremlin. He's always hesitated to criticize Putin. And this goes bit deeper. There is a brain rot and a moral rot on some of the American right, right now.
