I'm Rahel Solomon here with John Berman, and this is CNN News Central.Well, it hasn't happened in nearly 150 years, but this morning Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has officially been impeached by the House of Representatives. In a narrow 214 to 213 vote largely along party lines, Republicans made Mayorkas only the second U.S. cabinet secretary to ever be impeached. Now, you might remember this was their second attempt to impeach Mayorkas over his handling of the southern border. The first vote, well, that failed in a stunning and embarrassing fashion just last week. Now the GOP-led effort moves to the Senate where Mayorkas will stand trial. Let's go to CNN's Eva McKend, who joins us from Capitol Hill this morning. So Eva walk us through, good morning, walk us through what happens next for Mayorkas.",

They just eat this out by one vote.But not all Republicans went along with this. You had Congressman Gallagher, Buck and McClintock, who essentially argued that a policy dispute that it didn't amount to an impeachable offense that Mayorkas didn't engage in things that you traditionally think of as impeachable offenses like public corruption or abusing power. Still Republicans, they felt strongly enough about this to move forward with this effort. They've been talking about it a long time and they argue that Mayorkas is breaking the law. Let's listen to these lawmakers. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA), MAJORITY LEADER: The Senate really ought to take seriously the message that was said that we're serious about securing the border and the Secretary has failed to do his job. REP. KEN BUCK (R-CO): You can try to put lipstick on this pig, it is still a pig. And this is a terrible impeachment. It sets a terrible precedent. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You know, with the massive influx of migrants into New York City and other big cities from the border, you need to be a candidate that can really address that. And Suozzi did while he is a centrist candidate, he did advocate for border security. And that is an issue that resonates with voters there.And the other question is the impact of Biden and Trump. Both candidates in this race, Republicans and Democrats, really kept their cards close to the vest on this, neither one really embracing Trump or Biden. And of course, now Donald Trump is saying that if the Republican candidate Pilip would have done that earlier, she would have won. I'm not certain if that's the case. But the reality is, this is a litmus test for Republicans to realize we need to be strong on immigration, which is a big issue for voters here and need to make sure we have the right messaging on how to embrace the candidate at the top of the ticket as we head into November.",

That's who I am. That's who I think tens of millions of Republicans are.I worry that the protest vote if this ends up being Joe Biden and Donald Trump that folks protest vote is just not to vote. And I worry that that ends up happening. And we've got a short window here as Republicans to correct this with Nikki Haley. It doesn't seem like we're catching on fast enough.

And if you take a look at that map of the area, the Black Sea where Russian -- Ukrainian forces rather have been concentrating many of their efforts with the land frontlines, so static over the course of the last few months, so difficult for them to make progress there.They've been shifting instead their focus to the Black Sea Fleet with remarkable success. These sea drones that they've used again, homemade, remarkable for their long range ability 800 kilometers, allowing them to get to these ships unseen, undetected. These are not ships that are designed to withstand these sorts of highly maneuverable sea drones. So an effective strategy, tactically, and if you look at that map, you can see why also beyond the symbolism of Crimea and the strategic importance of taking out Russian capabilities, it is also a part of the world that they hope will allow them simply to cut off Russia's ability to continue finding, bringing men equipment into their frontlines. So it is now as you say, a third of Russia's once formidable Black Sea Fleet has essentially been disabled or destroyed, says Kyiv. And of course, that John, also has important consequences for Ukraine's ability to get grain in and out of its ports.

But what is happening that we should really be paying attention to is the fallout of Trump, the businessman. Donald Trump as a defendant in the criminal case where he's accused of making these false business recordings because of the hush money payments to Stormy Daniels before the 2016 presidential election, that is the hearing that's taking place on Thursday before the judge.There's going to be some talk about when that case will go to trial. And it could be the first case where Donald Trump sits for trial as a criminal defendant in March if that date holds. And then Friday, that decision from Judge Engoron in New York related to civil fraud findings, the penalties that Donald Trump and his business should have to face for these fraudulently inflated business records of his. So that's the focus on Trump, the businessman, in court. But Rahel, there is so much else happening here. Every piece of Donald Trump's most significant cases on the lawsuit side as well as all four of his criminal cases have check-ins this week. He's before the Supreme Court related to his federal January 6th criminal case waiting for that response from the Special Counsel's office and we will watch to see how quickly the Supreme Court takes action if they send him on to trial in federal court related to the 2020 election. There are also some filings due from Trump related to lawsuits where he's offend -- a defendant in the January 6th cases due at the Supreme Court this week. Also, there will be testimony very likely about the prosecution team in Georgia in his criminal case there. And finally, there's a lot of work being done in his Mar-a-Lago criminal documents case in Florida. He was in court on Monday in his proceeding under seal and there's a lot that's going to be happening in the coming weeks there as that too progresses toward trial. So a very serious moment for Donald Trump as the defendant, the wheels of justice, they're turning. And there are many, many situations where he's not only having to show up in court, but where the justice system is trying to hold him accountable, especially in these lawsuits and having him show up in court and face these judges.",
