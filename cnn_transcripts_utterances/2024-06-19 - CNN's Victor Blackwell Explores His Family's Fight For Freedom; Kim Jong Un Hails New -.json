Willie Mays, one of the greatest and most important baseball players in history, passed away last night at the age of 93 -- a legend not just as an athlete but as a human being.Mays made one of the most famous plays of all time known as 'The Catch,' leading the Giants to the 1954 championship, their last in New York before moving to San Francisco. Mays was a military veteran, a two-time MVP, 24-time All-Star, 12-time Gold Glove winner, Rookie of the Year, World Series champion -- an absolute giant of the game. All right. A Texas megachurch pastor has resigned after a woman came forward to accuse him of molesting her when she was just 12 years old. Robert Morris admitted to what he called an inappropriate relationship with a young lady. Mind you, she was 12. This happened in the '80s when he was 20 and already married. Now the board of elders of Gateway Church says it's appalled to learn the full details and expressed sympathy to the victim. In a statement obtained by CNN affiliate WFAA, they say, \"The elders' prior understanding was that Morris's extramarital relationship, which he discussed many times throughout his ministry, was with 'a young lady' and not abuse of a 12-year-old child.\" The accuser told WFAA she informed the church of what happened back in 2005. The current elders say they have retained a law firm for an independent review. And new this morning, a Russian court has sentenced a U.S. soldier to nearly four years in a Russian penal colony. State media reporting Staff Sgt. Gordon Black was found guilty on charges of theft and threatening murder. He was arrested back in May accused of stealing about $112 from a woman believed to be his girlfriend. Sgt. Black's lawyer says he will appeal his sentence. And this morning, the most expensive House Republican primary of the election cycle remains too early to call. House Freedom Caucus chair and Virginia Congressman Bob Good trying to hold onto his seat. Less than a point separates Good from his challenger, State Sen. John McGuire, who ran with the support of Donald Trump. Good angered fellow Republicans as one of the chief architects of the effort to push out former House Speaker Mike McCarthy (sic). And he also lost Trump's support after endorsing Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the Republican presidential primary. CNN's Daniel Strauss joining us now from Washington. Wow, this could not be closer. Give us a sense of just how close we are here.",

And that anger has spurred Donald Trump to endorse his opponent. Yet, at this point in time, this is really an indication or a test also about Donald Trump's power in his endorsement. It's not enough to give the challenger a strong overwhelming victory in this Republican primary, which says a lot about the rivalry and how close this race really is.",

And what's telling here is that Trump, in his past actions that have led to his impeachment are still on the minds of voters as we go into 2024. And I -- look, right now, overall, what we're seeing across the country is a very, very close race at the presidential level.

[07:35:00] JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR:  All right. With us now, former deputy communications director for Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, Bryan Lanza. And CNN political commentator and Democratic strategist, Maria Cardona. It's great to have you both here. I see your Instagrams and you guys, like, have a roadshow right now traveling the country doing political panels. So it's great for me to get a chance to talk to both of you. Bryan, I want to talk about this Virginia congressional race here. It's so interesting. Bob Good -- honestly, you couldn't get a more conservative member of Congress. You know, Freedom Caucus chair. He is so Trump -- yet, because he endorsed Ron DeSantis in the primary, Trump world turns on him and won't take him back. Is that the right way to grow the party? BRYAN LANZA, FORMER DEPUTY COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, TRUMP 2016 CAMPAIGN:  Yeah, first of all, good morning, and thank you for having me. The answer is Bob Good is alienating nearly every faction of the Republican Party. I think that's the challenge here because in politics, personalities matter, and he's managed to sort of rub sharp elbows with personalities that do matter in electoral politics. One was against President Trump. You have to keep in mind President Trump endorsed this guy two years ago -- or actually, four years ago when he ran. So for him to sort of reverse and endorse Gov. DeSantis, that was disloyal. That was seen as something that was just a thing too far for President Trump. Then, Good has his problems with McCarthy. So you had two factions of the Republican Party that carry a lot of weight with the Republican Party. You've got McCarthy's money; you've got Donald Trump's support. It was just a bad recipe. But I will say this. You know, Bob Good ran with trying to fake the voters that he had Donald Trump's endorsement. He had yard signs all over his district with Donald Trump. So I think it just goes to show you where his -- the election is really close, but at the end of the day, the primary voters and even Bob Good knows that Donald Trump is the Republican Party and voters look to see what he's doing.",

It's the Donald Trump party.And what Bob Good did was the biggest cardinal sin in Donald Trump's party and that is to have a mind of his own and -- especially when that mind I think understands that you probably don't want to have, now, a criminal -- a 34-times convicted felon at the top of the ticket. He probably saw this coming, which is why at the very beginning -- and he wasn't the only one. Let's remember that way back then at the beginning of the -- of the GOP primary, a lot of Republicans were trying to get behind Ron DeSantis. He was the golden boy. He was the one who was going to push Donald Trump aside. Because I think so many Republicans understand that at the end of the day, Donald Trump is going to be the end of the Republican Party, and that's exactly what has happened. And Bob Good had the gall to have a mind of his own and now he's paying for it. And so, I think that message, John, that the Donald Trump party is totally focused on being much more like a dictator than a Republican nominee, I think is a message that works for Democrats.",

Putin got a red-carpet welcome, a big parade, and a ride with Kim Jong Un in an open-top limo as thousands of North Koreans yelled \"Welcome, Putin.\"The North Korean leader -- he's hailing his new \"alliance\" with Russia as a watershed moment. CNN's Mike Valerio in Seoul, South Korea for more. A watershed moment. Is this how the West is also seeing this?",

It was signed between Khrushchev and Kim Il-sung, the founder of North Korea, back in 1961 -- July of 1961. It's wording very strong. It said both militaries shall come to the immediate assistance of either country if either of them came under aggression or under attack.So we're really going to be looking to the Pentagon and Western alliances to respond to this agreement in Pyongyang, which just wrapped up. What does this mean for how we -- for our government's react to this new agreement -- this new alliance? That remains to be seen. The dust here -- it's fair to say, Sara -- is just settling, so there's a lot to work through in the next couple of hours.",

      "sentences": "Good morning, John.Yeah, this is being painstakingly debated ahead of next month's really historic NATO summit here in Washington, D.C., with U.S. and German officials, we're told, pushing for language tat provides Ukraine with a \"bridge\" to NATO membership and not as strong as what Jens Stoltenberg, who is the secretary general of NATO, had said in April, which is that Ukraine's path to NATO membership should be \"irreversible,\" which is language that is supported by the U.K. and some central and eastern European countries. Now, why does this matter? It really matters because, of course, during this NATO summit, the alliance is going to submit a communique to the world that is going to signal just what Ukraine's place in NATO ultimately is going to be. It's not binding but it is a deeply symbolic document that really lays out the path that Ukraine has to becoming a full member of NATO -- something that they have aspired to really for decades now because of the constant threat posed by Russia. Now, eastern and central European countries -- of course, they are disappointed at this point because they believe that the U.S. is not willing to go far enough to signal to Vladimir Putin that Ukraine's ultimate place is in NATO. But the U.S., we're told -- they are reluctant to use that word \"irreversible\" because they say Ukraine has not necessarily finalized all of the commitments that it needs to do to actually become a full NATO member, including some democratic and anticorruption reform. So one central European diplomat told us that \"They are disappointed by the Biden administration's ambiguity and procrastination\" when it comes to outlining this concrete pathway for Ukraine. So, Vladimir Putin, of course, will be watching this very closely next month. But the language here still being very painstakingly debated, John.",
