His attorneys also liable to get an earful from the judge in this case who last night threatened them with sanctions for lying to the court clerk's office. The judge in a written order accused a staffer for Hunter Biden's lawyers of misrepresenting herself as working for House Republican lawyers saying that they wanted a legal filing removed from the court docket.

Hunter Biden is expected to plead guilty in federal court in Delaware to two misdemeanor tax charges for not paying federal taxes on time in 2017 and 2018. During the course of the investigation, Hunter paid back the federal tax bill along with interest and penalties his lawyers have said.Hunter Biden is also going to enter a deal with prosecutors to resolve a felony gun charge. Now, as part of this plea deal, prosecutors are expected to recommend probation, but the judge in this case will ultimately have the final say over accepting a plea deal as well as the sentence. And we expect her to set a date in Wednesday's hearing. And, of course, all of this is happening as House Republicans are clamoring for more information about this investigation, some IRS whistleblowers who worked on the case claim there was political interference in the probe though the U.S. attorney overseeing the case, David Weiss, has already debunked some of those claims and says he is willing to come to the hill to testify in the coming months.

The national defense ministry has called for three days of mourning in order to honor these two firefighters that died yesterday.

The incident took place right behind me on the island of Evia. You can see it a bit in the background. It is very hazy here, so I'm not sure if you can see it because of the smoke, because of the really hot temperatures that we're having and the heat that is actually rising. But this is the closest point to where we are now to this island from greater Athens. Now, fires continue to rage in Rhodes and Corfu. The situation there is not looking good. The island of Rhodes has now been placed under a state of emergency. And at the moment, winds are picking up all across Greece. Just here where I'm standing now, as we speak, the wind is really picking up as Greece is about to experience its warmest day this summer yet with temperatures of 46 degrees Celsius.

No one knows. Perhaps they are dotting I's and crossing T's.

I think the essence of it was the Republican filing by the Ways and Means Committee chair in amicus briefs saying, hey, this is too lenient and gave some personal tax information, right, and when you do that with courts, anyone if it is personal should be filed under seal so that the public does not get access to it.
