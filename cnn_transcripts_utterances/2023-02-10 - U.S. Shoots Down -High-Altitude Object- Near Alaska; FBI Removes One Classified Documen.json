U.S. officials say it was flying off Alaska's northern coast at an altitude of 40,000 feet and was approximately the size of a small car.

Judd if he had comment on the shoot-down of this object. He called it a success. He didn't say anything further than that, I think in part because there's still a significant number of outstanding questions.But the timeline here is important. The broader timeline is six days ago, the U.S. fighters shot down the Chinese surveillance balloon. This is very much a different object in terms of how it's been described on size, on capabilities, what it actually has on its -- in the object itself. But last night the U.S. became aware of the existence of this object. Late yesterday evening, fighter jets were sent up to actually kind of basically view the object, try and get a sense of what it actually was. It was not responsive. They determined it was unmanned. But they did not get a lot of information because it was in the evening. They were sent up again this morning to try to get a better sense of what the object actually was. After that effort by the two U.S. fighter jets, the president who had been briefed on Thursday night, the recommendation was given to the president by the Pentagon that they should shoot the object down. Given the lack of information, given the lack of responsiveness, the president ordered the shoot-down of the object. And at 1:45 p.m., that object was shot down. Recovery efforts are under way. They believe that it landed in the Arctic Ocean which is currently frozen, so that process is under way right now, but still a significant number of questions, and obviously a very different approach than we saw with the Chinese spy balloon. One thing officials have made clear, though, they saw no indication of any military risk to U.S. civilians from this object itself. Clearly, moved to action very quickly.",

U.S. army helicopters have been launched as parts of this recovery effort. And ultimately when they are able to kind of pick up that debris, it will likely go through very much the same process that we are seeing taking place now with the Chinese balloon. It will likely go to an FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia, to be analyzed, and they will have to see whether there is anything significant in terms of an intelligence capability that the U.S. could potentially gather on.You know, it remains unclear, of course, whether or not this is actually something that is significant in terms of the U.S.' capability to collect intelligence on it because it apparently was not transmitting at the time that it was shot down. But ultimately, you know, the U.S. decided that this was the right call because it posed a threat to civilian aircraft. And moving forward, I think they are going to try to do this in a faster way because there is not the -- the complication that we saw with the Chinese balloon in terms of its being under water. This is kind of sitting on top of the surface, and the U.S. has been able to launch that recovery effort already. It is also, we should note, very small. It is only the size of a small car. Not the size of three buses as we saw with the Chinese balloon, and the payload, the part of the object that actually carries the key equipment there, it is also very small. So, this should not be an overly complicated recovery effort, but, of course, we'll have to see how it goes.",

But U.S. officials are saying they don't know who's responsible for this, if it's a state-owned actor or if it's a private actor. And we are expecting, however, that there's going to be some confrontation between the United States and whomever is responsible for this object going into U.S. airspace once they figure out who that person or who that entity actually is. What's becoming clear, Jake, however, given the context of what's happened over the last week is that the Biden administration, the U.S. government is treating U.S. airspace with incredibly intelligence vigilance right now. And the question going forward is what does that policy look like when any kind of identified objects comes into the U.S. airspace, are they going to shoot it down immediately?

He's on the Intelligence Committee, the Armed Services Committee, the Foreign Affairs Committee, and he's a former Green Beret who served in the U.S. Army for more than two decades. So, Congressman, what's your reaction to hearing this object was just shot out of the sky just a couple of hours ago? REP. MIKE WALTZ (R-FL):  Well, I think it's going to continue to beg more policy questions. Okay, so this one was at 40,000 feet, the president determined it was a safety of flight risk, does that then imply that if this happen at 60,000, 65,000 feet like the first balloon, we would have continued to let it traverse into Canada and possibly the United States? Is that the new criteria now? Is some type of interference with civilian aircraft? So that's kind of question one. I still have the question if it had not been for some enterprising photographers in Montana, whether we would be taking this more decisive action at all. Was it really kind of the public outcry, the violation of our sovereignty and airspace that's driving this change in policy? And then finally, I think, Jake, you know, that the big outstanding question is why if this was a -- yet another Chinese balloon, why are -- is Xi deciding to do this now? You know, right on the heels of his meeting with Biden, there was kind of an attempt for a reset button there in the relationship. Obviously, Blinken's canceled his trip. And yet they're either going to double down, or the Chinese military's making moves that their leadership weren't fully apprised of. Either way, that's credibly disturbing, and we have more and more questions.",

It turns out they did. We still have yet to learn what they collected with that first one that hovered over not just our missiles but one of our stealth bomber bases and the strategic command responsible for all command and control over all of our nuclear arsenal. That's incredibly significant. We want to know what was transmitted back real time, what were they able to collect.
