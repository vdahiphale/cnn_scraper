      "sentences": "Hi, Kaitlan. Thank you very much for that. Good evening, everyone. I'm Alisyn Camerota. Welcome to CNN Tonight.So what happened with the Mar-a-Lago pool? In a CNN exclusive, sources say an employee of Donald Trump's drained the swimming pool last October and ended up flooding a room in the resort. That's the room where the computer servers containing surveillance video logs were kept. So, was this just a messy mistake? Maybe. But it aroused investigators suspicions because it happened amid a series of events that they found curious. So, tonight, we're going to look at those key events at Mar- a-Lago. Also today, Donald Trump's lawyers went to the Justice Department and met with Special Counsel Jack Smith. Our panel explains what that tells us. Plus, you've heard how school districts are banning controversial books. So, what about the Bible or the Book of Mormon? That is happening in one Utah school district, and our panel has a lot of thoughts on that. And do you always give your Uber driver a five star rating? It turns out a lot of us do. And it's not because we think they're great drivers. It's because we're scared. Tonight, we'll see what ratings they give us. Okay. But let's begin with our CNN exclusive reporting on the Trump investigation at Mar-a-Lago and the flood at the resort's swimming pool. This happened last October as prosecutors obtained evidence that boxes of White House records were being moved around by Donald Trump's staff. Prosecutors are examining whether there was any effort to obstruct the DOJ's investigation after the former president was subpoenaed in May 2022 for classified documents. Joining me with her reporting on this is CNN's Senior Crime and Justice Reporter Caitlin Polantz, we also have Marc Caputo, National Political Reporter for The Messenger, who can give us a lay of the land at Mar-a-Lago, and senior legal analyst Ellie Honig, as well as former Watergate Prosecutor John Sale. Great to have all of you. Okay. So, Katelyn, what makes prosecutors think that this flood at the pool at Mar-a-Lago is anything more than just an accident?",

And they're asking about it because they have been trying to get to the bottom of the possibility that people may have wanted to obstruct justice.So, at the top of the pyramid would be Donald Trump. And the question is, did Donald Trump -- was he directing people to potentially take steps that would investigators as they were trying to locate all of the documents at Mar-a-Lago and find out where everything went as they were failing to get those documents back up leading up to that search in August? And so this particular situation in October of last year, this is a maintenance worker draining the pool at Mar-a-Lago, and then that pool water causing a flood in the very room where video surveillance footage and equipment was being kept at the resort. That is just a piece of a constellation of activity that investigators are asking out about, especially about the actions of this particular maintenance worker. This is someone who was captured on surveillance tape helping another Trump employee move boxes. And we know that investigators are also asking about conversations that these men were having with others in the Trump universe about the surveillance tape. So, they're asking this question because there's just a number of different things that happened that when you take it all together, it is a lot of stuff happening around surveillance tapes that the Justice Department was trying to lock down as part of this investigation, surveillance tapes that would show that boxes had been moved within the resort at a time whenever the Trump team was not fully able to hand over all of the documents at Mar-a-Lago.",

So, I don't think it's the kind of place you can really walk in.Now, as a member of the press, I would have to get credentialed ahead of time. Other people have been able to kind of slip in as guests of guests or of members, I should say, at Mar-a-Lago, but it doesn't and it didn't strike me as a place where you could just kind of wander around and look around willy-nilly without someone asking you what's going on.",

But what I can say is, in talking to the Trump campaign about this and prior to it being campaign, his advisers and some of his attorneys, one of the arguments that they've made about Mar-a-Lago, and understand this is their argument, is that it was designated as a SCIF, as a secure facility for the time he was president.Remember, actually, on the Mar-a-Lago patio, he had a meeting with Japan's prime minister at one point to discuss some sort of international crisis. So, there's been a lot of history that's unfolded there since Donald Trump has been president and while he's been a presidential candidate. But for the period of time, I was there, as I said, I didn't really have a lot of free movement. But then, again, I'm not a member. I'm not a guest of a member. I'm a member of the press.

      "sentences": "Yes. So, in order for this to mean anything to prosecutors, they have to prove this was intentional as opposed to an accident. I would start with a bunch of questions that I have, and maybe these are more from my experience with pools than as a prosecutor, right?Like how often are they draining this pool? Was this scheduled or not scheduled maintenance? How did it end up that usually like pool engineering, it would drain away from sensitive areas and not into areas where servers are? And what you're also looking for is any sort of testimony or statement showing that somebody said, hey, get down there. Let the pool loose. Let's see where it goes, that kind of thing. And that's why they seize the phones, which they're surely analyzing.  CAMEROTA:  Jon, part of why prosecutors have some reason to be concerned about how forthcoming the Trump team is, is because they have a history of trying to get back these documents and them not being turned over readily. We had the timeline up a moment ago. I'll just quickly recap it for everybody. It was in May 2021, okay, that the National Archives first contacts the Trump team to locate missing items. Eight months later, they finally, the National Archives, received 15 boxes of White House records from Mar-a-Lago. They're assured that that's all there is. Okay? Then another five months later, they have to subpoena Donald Trump because they realize that there are still missing documents. Then in August, three months later, the FBI has to execute search warrant at Mar-a-Lago because they still have not turned stuff over. Then the DOJ requested the Trump Organization preserve additional footage. That's in October. And then in October, there's this Mar-a- Lago, maybe pool accident, maybe something else.",

So, Jon knows, of course, that this is very common, where prosecutors will sit down with defense lawyers.I know it may sound unusual to people who think it's all just adversarial. No. You give defense lawyers a chance to come in and make a pitch. We call it a reverse proffer. Because the defense lawyer is usually saying, here's problems in your case, here's why it's a bad idea for you to charge. Now, sometimes as a prosecutor, you make them defense lawyers go through the levels. Well, you have to start with the guys on the line, like what I was. Then you can work your way up to the boss. And here, we know they met with the boss. This is Jack Smith's case, and I do not think DOJ is going to grant a second meeting with Merrick Garland. So, naturally, this kind of meeting would happen at the end of a case. So, it tells me they're really getting into the closing stages here.",

There are also words that are created in order to be electric, like the word grooming, which was a big deal last year and which was weaponized against my community. And it does seem as though talking about systemic issues, that word systemic is a block. I guess where I slightly disagree is I just wished that if we took the word systemic out, but we still looked at policies that tried to address the sort of recurring patterns that are, I'm trying to avoid saying the word systemic, but that come generation after generation for people of color in this country, if we actually looked at some of the policies, there is a disagreement between the two major parties, and we're going to see that in the Supreme Court.
