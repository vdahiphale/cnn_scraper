Japan says the missile likely fell in the sea near Hokkaido inside the economic exclusion zone. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida condemned the launch as provocative and unacceptable. It's a second suspected ICBM test by North Korea this month, the 34th day of missile launches so far this year. Pyongyang fired a short-range ballistic missile on Thursday. CNN's Will Ripley following these developments, live this hour in Bangkok. So I guess the message is pretty unmistakable.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, it's a message, and there's also purpose, which is to gain scientific knowledge and advance North Korea's ballistic missile and nuclear program, because remember, they had attempted to launch an ICBM several weeks ago, and that launch is believed to have failed. It actually was on a trajectory that may have taken it right over Japan, but then it disappeared off radar.North Korea never actually acknowledged that launch. It was part of a barrage of around 80 missiles that North Korea launched during a period of just a few days. Basically, what North Korea has been demonstrating is what it would look like, experts say, if there was some sort of a nuclear war with them. They could overwhelm, they claim, U.S. missile defense systems, South Korean defense systems, Japan missile defense systems. And they were showcasing missiles that had a variety of different ranges. Yesterday, it was a short-range ballistic missile, which is a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions, just like today's launch, which is obviously incredibly more dangerous, more highly provocative than the previous launches, because you have this ICBM that shot up more than 6,000 kilometers in altitude. That is well into space. And then a traveled around a thousand kilometers and splashed down, believed to be within Japan's exclusive economic zone. And so close, in fact, to Japan's Northern island of Hokkaido that one at the U.S. military American bases in that vicinity, they received a shelter in place alert, because the missile was detected and until it was clear that the missile was no longer in the air. If flew for more than one hour: One hour and nine minutes, as a matter of fact. But until it was clear that the missile was down, they didn't want U.S. service personnel to be out and potentially in the path of falling debris. Clearly, this type of missile, when they tested it, doesn't have a warhead in it. But still, it demonstrates a -- you know, an advancement, a remarkable advancement for a country that is so heavily sanctioned that it's very difficult for leaders here in Bangkok. And certainly, they talked about the North Korea nuclear threat in Cambodia last week at the ASEAN summit. Remember it was President Joe Biden that held a trilateral meeting with the prime minister, Kishida, of Japan, President Yoon of South Korea. They talked about extended deterrence. North Korea just yesterday put out a statement blasting the U.S. for this extended deterrent strategy. And here we are now, one day later, with this suspected ICBM launch, an intercontinental ballistic missile, that North Korea wants to show could potentially reach most cities in the mainland United States: Los Angeles, Washington, New York. And what they want to prove by launching so many missiles is that they have an arsenal big enough that they can launch them at once, they could launch them in some sort of an attack. It would be very difficult for missile defense systems to shoot all of them down. They could overwhelm those defense systems, John. VAUSE: If we look at the year in its entirety and the number of short- range, medium-range, long-range missiles which have been fired, developmental ballistic missiles, as well as, you know, everything else, what does the current stockpile look like? What is their capability of replenishing that stockpile as they move forward? How quickly can they do it?",

And we know that there are people who work at those colonies, who try to get certain prisoners to bully other prisoners. It's not a great environment. So that is extremely concerning for Brittney Griner's family and all of her loved ones in the United States. Now, the State Department has said that they have not received official confirmation from Russian authorities that Brittney Griner has been moved. They strongly protest the fact that Russia hasn't given them an update. And this all comes after President Biden just last week said that he was hopeful that, after the midterm elections here in the United States, that there could be some forward progress on trying to get Brittney Griner home, that Russia may engage more seriously in discussions about a prisoner swap for Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan, who's another American wrongfully detained in Russia. But so far, we haven't heard any updates on that front. Kylie Atwood, CNN, the State Department. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
