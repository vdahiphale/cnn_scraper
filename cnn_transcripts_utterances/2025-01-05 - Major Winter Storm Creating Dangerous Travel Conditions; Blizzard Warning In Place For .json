      "sentences": "Right. So imminently, the biggest concern is going to be across the Central Plains, as well as portions of the Midwest. This is a look at Kansas City right now. And it's a little blurry on the right-hand side. It's not the camera that's broken. That is a thin layer of ice that has formed on the camera, making it very difficult to see. The temperature right there in 21 degrees.Now, we talked about this yesterday. There was going to be a thin layer of ice coming down in a lot of these places, and then the snow on top of it, making it more dangerous on the roadways because you just can't see that ice. Look at some of these numbers coming in several locations. We are talking at least a quarter of an inch of ice that can bring down trees, power lines, not to mention coat the roadways. But you even have Colby, Kansas, getting dangerously close to half an inch of ice. And keep in mind, in a lot of these places, it's still coming down. Look at this. You've got the white indicating snow. You've also got ice. We've got rain. We've got thunderstorms. We even have thunder sleet coming down in a few spots right now. So, a lot going on on this map. When we zoom in a little bit closer, again, you can see for a lot of these areas like Wichita it's going back and forth. So, you're getting some snow. You're getting some freezing rain back and forth. Kansas City also getting some. Saint Louis now transitioning to snow. But again, you've still got some of that freezing rain component there in some of those southern suburbs. When you look at how widespread a lot of these alerts go, look at this. It stretches 1,500 miles for all of these winter weather alerts across portions of the Central U.S. as well as the Ohio Valley and into the mid-Atlantic. The biggest concerns we have, the two top concerns, are really going to be the very dangerous, if not impossible travel in some spots, and also the potential for widespread power outages in some of these locations. Especially, this spot right here where you're talking portions of southern Indiana where it meets that Kentucky state line. This is where we have a level four out of four, the extreme category, the highest you can get. Where we're looking at potentially substantial disruptions to daily life in some of those areas. Now, the system right now is in the Central U.S. By the time we get to this evening, it really kind of focuses that target right over the Ohio Valley. Then by early tomorrow morning, centered over the mid- Atlantic, including places like Washington, D.C. and Baltimore. Then finally, by tomorrow night, the low-pressure system moves back out over the water. But you still have some of that residual moisture on the back edge of it that's really going to continue to cause some problems there. Widespread totals likely about four to six inches at least, but there will be some spots that could easily pick up over a foot of snow from what they have over the next couple of days, so about 24 to 48 hours from now. Keep in mind some of those locations, especially if you saw maybe the lower totals, say two, four, five inches of snow, it may be on top of a layer of ice. In some of these spots quarter inch, half an inch, even a few locations of three quarters of an inch of ice underneath that snow. That's what we're talking about. These treacherous conditions on the roadways making it very dangerous. Now, on the southern end, it's going to be warmer. So, you don't have the snow or the ice component to worry about. But we do have severe thunderstorms potential, especially right through here. This area where Mississippi, Arkansas and Louisiana come together, we have the potential there not only for damaging winds, but also even potentially a few tornadoes, especially late this afternoon and into the evening.

They believe that the Biden administration has dropped the ball when it comes to security. And so, they want to see Congress quickly rush to confirm some of these nominees, like Pete Hegseth for defense secretary, Tulsi Gabbard for the director of national intelligence, Kash Patel for the FBI.And some of these folks are really controversial. And there have been questions about them. But we're starting to see some hearings on the calendar, particularly for Hegseth on January 14th. And I think that's when we're going to really see what Republicans, particularly in the Senate, feel about some of these candidates. A lot of the dissent is still happening behind closed doors. And once we see that hearing, we'll be able to hear in questioning, even people just verbally saying where they stand on these nominees, because as we've seen in some of these fights in Congress, there are quiet dissenters. There are people who are willing to buck Donald Trump. And so, we're just going to have to see those hearings play out in the weeks to come.",

But again, he is far from out of the water here. We saw these warnings, particularly from the House Freedom Caucus, that they're going to be willing to go to bat with him, particularly on spending, particularly on the debt limit. And because Republicans do not saw that in the last spending fight, Democrats are going to be looking to hold that over Johnson's head. And I think any negotiations that he does across the aisle is certainly going to put him in hot water with some of those conservatives, people on that far right flank of the party. But he has a huge debt to owe to Donald Trump, who helped him get out of situation. And certainly, we're going to have to see if that lasts here, if Donald Trump will continue to go to bat for him, because I think a huge part of that was you had the certification coming up on Monday. Trump is very keen to get his agenda hit the ground running here. But again, that loyalty might not last for the next two years.",

Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is scheduled to visit South Korea later today, the first high-level U.S. official to do so since the political crisis began. Body cam footage shows U.S. Olympic sprinter Fred Kerley being arrested and tased. And we want to warn you, the video you're about to see may be disturbing. Now, the incident happened Thursday in Miami, after police say Kerley approached officers about his vehicle while they were investigating an unrelated case. Police claim Kerley pushed an officer and resisted arrest. In court Friday, his attorney criticized the officer's actions in a statement to CNN. The attorney called the footage, quote, obscene.

This role has been held by former UK deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, who joined the company in 2018 and has helped Meta navigate some really thorny issues, everything from concerns that its products were harming young people to questions about foreign election interference, regulatory pressures from the U.S. and the EU. But Clegg says he is now stepping down and handing the role to his deputy, Joel Kaplan, who is one of the company's most prominent Republican leaders. Kaplan has been working on policy at Meta since 2011, but he previously held several key roles, including deputy chief of staff of policy during the George W. Bush administration.Also moving up into Kaplan's current role, VP of global policy, is Kevin Martin, who has been with the company for a long time, but also previously served as FCC chairman under George W. Bush. This of course all comes as Meta is preparing for a second Trump presidency and as CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been seeking to cozy up to Trump. We did see Zuckerberg visit Trump at Mar-a-Lago after the election. Meta has said it plans to donate a million dollars to Trump's inaugural fund. And the company has said that Zuckerberg wants an active role in policy discussions, tech policy discussions with the Trump White House. The Trump White House is going to have some big decisions to make around tech policy, including presumably deciding whether and how to move forward with an antitrust lawsuit against Meta, as well as whether and how to regulate and to regulate artificial intelligence, which of course Meta wants to be a global leader in. So, there may have been a decision made that Kaplan would be better suited to navigate and to help the company navigate a Republican- controlled White House and Congress. Clare Duffy, CNN, New York.

After a relatively slow start to the respiratory virus season, COVID-19 and flu cases are ramping up once again.Joining me now for a look at why this may be happening, the chair of the Department of Medicine at Emory University, Dr. Carlos Del Rio. Thank you so much for getting up so early this morning. Doctor, as we were saying, the flu got off to a later start in 2024, which usually picks up around Halloween, peaks in February, and the flu has been on the rise in recent weeks. Take a look at this map from the CDC, and you can see just in recent days that the influenza-like illnesses are very high. It's highlighted in purple and dark red, so you can see those colors across the south, the southwest, New York and New Jersey. Doctor, what do we need to know about this flu season, and why are we seeing cases rise?",

This is a time of the year where we see an increase in flu cases, and as the virus changes, as the virus every year gives a different strain of the virus floating around, we're more likely to get infected and to get reinfected, and that's why you've got to get vaccinated every year, because as the virus changes, you need a different vaccine to protect you.The virus, as you know, spreads from person-to-person contact, so during the wintertime, we're more likely to be indoors. We're more likely to be at parties with people, hanging out with other individuals. We're more likely to travel. So, for all those reasons, we're more likely to get exposed to the flu and therefore get infected with the flu. So, the first thing people should do is obviously get vaccinated, and the second thing, you know, the most important thing is if you are sick, you should stay at home. You should not be out with people, because many times you'll go to a party, you'll go to a restaurant, you're coughing, and you're infecting other people unknowingly.",

So, the other concern we have about seeing the transitive influenza is, and we don't know what's going to happen, what is going to be the interaction with the avian flu, if it happens in some parts of the country.",

You know, as little as 10 viral particles are enough to infect an individual. And the typical symptoms of norovirus are diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, you know, fever. You don't feel good for several days. There's no therapy for norovirus, but there's no really a vaccine for norovirus. So, the most effective thing you can do to prevent norovirus is to wash your hands. Don't use a hand sanitizer. Hand sanitizer is not good enough to prevent norovirus. So, if you're going to cook food, if you're going to be touching individuals, touching services, keep your hands really clean. Avoid touching your mouth after you touch your hand, you know, touch some object or something else. And if you get sick, avoid contaminating food or other individuals in your family because it transmits very effectively. And that's why we see outbreak.
