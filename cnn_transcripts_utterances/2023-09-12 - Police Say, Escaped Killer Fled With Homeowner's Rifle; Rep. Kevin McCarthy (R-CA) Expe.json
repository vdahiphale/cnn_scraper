Moments ago, we learned that Danelo Cavalcante stole a 0.22 caliber rifle with a scope and a mounted flashlight from a Pennsylvania garage, stole it from the home overnight. The resident actually fired on him as Cavalcante ran away.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. GEORGE BIVENS, PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE:  And at 10:10 P.M., a call was received from a resident on Coventry Road indicating a short Hispanic male, no shirt and wearing dark pants, had entered his garage while the homeowner was in it, and that he grabbed a 0.22 rifle leaning in the garage. The homeowner drew a pistol and fired at Cavalcante as he fled with the rifle. We have no reason to believe that he is injured as a result of that shooting. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Let's go now to CNN's Danny Freeman, who has been following all these developments. Danny, I know that not much has changed in the last few minutes, but what has changed is this man is now arm and even more dangerous than he was when the police were first starting to search for him.

How long might this go on, though? Because you get the sense that things have changed even though they're saying, look, we're still doing things tactically the same. Things have changed.

You know, I go back to 2014, Andy McCabe remember this. You know, he was in the FBI. I was in the NYPD. But there was a domestic terrorist in Pennsylvania, Eric Frein. He opened fire on state police.

But it went on for 48 days. It cost $12 million. And it ended with a long and bloody shootout.Frein was armed with essentially an elephant gun that could penetrate the body armor of police. He killed a young state trooper. Biven said at the time it was the most intense gun battle he had ever seen in his police career, and remains so. So, when you think of the effect on the people involved in this hunt, especially those who were there for the first version of this or the last version of this, in July, they had a hunt for a military-trained survivalist who was hiding in the woods, it went on ten days. So, this has exceeded that. But it's certainly not out of range given the terrain. And never forget Eric Rudolph, the Olympic Park Bomber who disappeared into the Nantahala National Forest being sought by the FBI, the state police, the ATF and the National Guard. And they caught him when he came out five years later to find some food in a dumpster with a rookie cop who did a stop on routine patrol. So, these things will take the shape they take.",

And it's not the only issue that McCarthy is having to juggle now. There's also the threat of a government shutdown looming at the end of the month, at about 18 days, I think. CNN's Lauren Fox is joining us now from Capitol Hill to share her reporting with us.

That is because despite the fact that a large number of Republicans in the conference do support moving forward with an impeachment inquiry, arguing it would embolden them to get more documents and information in their quest for their investigations into President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.There are some Republican members, some of them in swing districts, who don't think that that is the appropriate step, that the committees have not gathered enough evidence, that the Oversight and Judiciary Committees could continue to do their work without launching this formal impeachment inquiry. Because, despite the fact that, yes, this is a preliminary step, there is a sense that once you open that inquiry, it's very hard not to eventually move forward with impeaching President Joe Biden. So, Kevin McCarthy has been trying to argue to members on the fence that this is just a preliminary step, this is just a baby step, and yet it is still going to be a very difficult vote for some of those members in swing districts. So, no, he doesn't have the votes that he needs right now but he is expected in this Thursday meeting with his Republican conference to make it clear that this is the logical next step. Now, this is happening in a broader context, because House Republicans are still struggling to find a path forward to fund the government after September 30th. And there are a number of Republicans who have argued that they want their support for any government funding bill, even a short-term bill, to be contingent on opening this impeachment inquiry. So, a lot happening up here on Capitol Hill, Kevin McCarthy expected to address reporters later this morning in just a few minutes. Sara?",

They are in the Senate, thankfully. And just three months ago, we negotiated, as part of the debt ceiling, a solution to all of this. A majority, over 300 or so members of the House of Representatives and a majority of the Senate voted for a funding deal.

This man is clearly a dictator. He's clearly one who engages in violence. A plane -- his political enemy gets on a plane and, lo and behold, it falls out of the sky. How did that happen? Every one of his opponents, political opponents, seems to wind up in prison or wind up dead. As for Kim Jong-un and now shaking hands with Putin, this is not new. In the Korean War, that was funded and supported by Russia. They've always been close. It's not new. What does Kim Jong-un have to offer? Poverty? What else? Well, let's see. His people are dying of starvation and yet he continues to pursue nuclear weapons, rockets and the like. That's really one fine partnership. I'm sure Mr. Putin will enjoy that partnership.",
