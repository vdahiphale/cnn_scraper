That's about 90 minutes from now. A court is expected to hear Griner's challenge against her 9-year prison sentence. She was arrested at Moscow airport in February and accused of having cannabis oil in her luggage. U.S. President Joe Biden is amongst U.S. officials who have said Griner and U.S. Marine veteran Paul Whelan are being unjustly detained by Russia. The State Department says there are active discussions to secure their release.Let's get more this from CNN's Fred Pleitgen in Ukraine, Clare is here as well following the Griner case. Fred, in terms of what's happening on the ground, just explain what it means when we're talking about false flag operations and you know, pre-moves in terms of what might happen next, it's very confusing, this dirty bomb story.",

Now obviously they say that all of the allegations that Russia is making are false. That the Ukrainians are allegedly are working on some sort of dirty bomb.And you know, just to explain to our viewers what that would mean essentially a conventional explosive laced with radioactive material that could release a lot of radioactivity in a large area if it was, indeed, exploded. Now the Russians claim that the Ukrainians are working on something like this. That they have information indicating that. The Ukrainians say it's absolutely untrue. It is totally right to point out that there's no evidence whatsoever that was given by the Russians. And what the Ukrainians have now done is they specifically invited the International Atomic Energy Agency to the sites that the Russians mentioned in a recent briefing by their military to inspect those sites and see that there is no illicit activity going on. I did hear from the International Atomic Energy Agency saying that they visited one of those sites about a month ago and didn't find anything suspicious there. We do have to note that the IAEA is actually very active here in Ukraine. They're obviously right now trying to come to terms with a situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant which is held by the Russians but has had some serious incidents happening over the past couple of months. So, the IAEA certainly has a presence here and certainly has the capacity to check it out those sites that the Ukrainians are talking about. At the same time the Ukrainians are saying they believe that the Russians might use this as a pretexts to escalate the entire war here and it might be the Russians themselves who are plotting something like this. The energy provider for Ukraine, they put out a fact sheet earlier today claiming that the Russians have been undertaking some illicit construction work at the Zaporizhzhia power plant especially at the spent fuel section of that, which they believe could be sort of the area where a strike like that could emanate. So, right now, you're absolutely right, so is a very fluid situation. It's a very difficult situation. Both sides sort of accusing one another but certainly the U.S., its allies, most Western nations are saying they don't believe what the Russians are saying about the Ukrainians actually working on all this. And the Ukrainians certainly saying they want to be as transparent as possible -- Max.",

We know that Brittney Griner, who we have seen appear in court several times throughout her trial, wouldn't have been there anyway. She was going to appear via video link. We know, according to her lawyers, that she was severely stressed ahead of this that despite the fact they said she's a very strong person. That it was starting to take a toll on her. Because this is sort of the end of the road as far as the Russian legal system is concerned.There are three potential outcomes today. They could leave the sentence as it is and she would then sort of go off and serve it. They could overrule it or they could reduce it. Clearly, she was desperately hoping for at least some kind of at least reduction because after this the only hope to get her home before the end of that was some kind of prisoner swap. We know while the U.S. has said certainly, and the administration officials last week said that discussions on this were pretty persistent. There is still according to the U.S. they had no serious counter offer from the Russians on a prisoner swap. And so, that work is still ongoing. Still no real progress there.",

The Russians had countered and asked for a convicted murderer as well as Viktor Bout. They didn't want to do a sort of two for one deal. They asked for someone else as well. We don't think that was acceptable to the U.S. side. And they are also saying that they haven't had a serious counter offer from Russia. But apparently, they are still talking.",

Now the Senator has argued that these calls, these were all part of his duty as a Senator, that they are constitutionally protected legislative activity. But lower court judges have not agreed with that and they have ruled that he should be able to potentially be questioned about certain aspects of these conversations. Now this temporary stay will be in place until the Supreme Court finally rules on this matter. Now the justice has given the investigators in Georgia until Thursday to respond and it is expected then the larger questions in this case will go to the full Supreme Court for a final answer on the questions raised in this case.
