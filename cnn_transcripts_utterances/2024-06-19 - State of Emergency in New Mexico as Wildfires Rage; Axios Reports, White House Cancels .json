We've got two main fires in parts of southern New Mexico, neither of which are really all that contained. You can see when we put it on top of the drought monitor, we have extreme and exceptional drought condition. So, that's not helping you dry fuel.The good news is some rain could as we go through the next day or two because of that tropical system that will make landfall near Mexico and Texas. You can see the rain is not much. It's scattered. But at least that humidity will increase a little bit, so the air is not quite as dry. That could help with some of the firefighting. On top of this, we're tracking a heat wave that is unprecedented for some parts of the country. 82 percent of the lower 48 will have temperatures above 90 degrees, 260 million people. We're talking about records falling both daytime highs and overnight lows, more than 150 of them as we go through the next couple of days. Look at the high temperatures for today. We're talking about 95 degrees in Caribou. If they hit 96 degrees, that would be their hottest temperature ever recorded period on record, 90 stretch back towards Columbus, Cincinnati, I mean, again, sweltering up in places that typically don't get this hot. You've got watches, warnings and advisory stretching for a lot of New England. The warnings that are issued for parts of Maine are the first of its kind, again, unprecedented. The overnight temperatures don't even fall too much. We're looking at overnight temperatures in the middle and upper 70s, and that has that climate change fingerprint, these overnight temperatures four to five times more likely because of our climate changing.

You can see some of the waves crashing on the beach. We are live here in an area this street that leads to the beach that does have some flooding, some ponding.I can actually measure exactly how much water we have here. It's about eight inches. Earlier this morning, it was more like five. So, we can see that there is some of that surge coming in. And according to the National Weather Service, this area is supposed to get between one and three feet of surge. But if you keep on looking this street, you can see leads up to the interstate, and it's partially flooded. I've talked to officials here, both city officials and county officials, and they say that they take every weather event very seriously, that they are not expecting to issue evacuations. They're expecting between six to eight inches of rain. They say that they get very concerned once it's about 15 inches of rain, but they're not expecting that right now. But they do say that out of an abundance of caution, they have pre- positioned assets, high water vehicles, rescue boats, just in case. And, look, city officials and county officials know exactly where the low lying areas are in Corpus Christi. And so they've also pre- positioned barricades to make sure that they barricade streets if there is some flooding. But, again, they're keeping an eye on the situation. John, from talking to these officials, they don't seem too concerned. And, again, we are hundreds of miles away from the center of that storm that's going to hit Mexico, but they always, always prepare for the worst. And that's what we're seeing here, just a lot of preparation by city officials, just in case, just to make sure that residents are okay. Back to you.",

It's worth noting, he also said, that there is still another meeting between Jake Sullivan and his counterpart in Israel that is expected to happen a bit later tomorrow. But in this reporting, he also noted that Amos Hochstein, a key adviser to President Biden, who has been traveling in Israel and Lebanon, told Netanyahu directly that his comments were inaccurate and out of line. Now, it's unclear what exactly Netanyahu was referring to. In May, it was revealed that the U.S. was putting a pause on a shipment of heavy bombs to Israel out of concern about their operations in Rafah. Just yesterday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that that is still under review, while also noting he would not comment on his diplomatic conversations with Netanyahu, who had said that Blinken had offered him assurances that they were trying to free up some of these bottlenecks. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

No comment from him, his reps and not even from his attorney, who he appeared in court just this time yesterday morning with that local attorney. What we do know, though, is what we're learning from the court documents that were released after that court date and it details a lot of what police say happened during that DWI stop.What they say is that Justin Timberlake was at a hotel just on the street from where we are here in Sag Harbor, leaving there at about 12:30 in the morning. Police say that he blew through a stop sign and then he was seen about swerving through lanes for about six blocks or so before they eventually pulled him over. And according to the police officer who wore body camera footage, they said during that stop, they noticed that Justin Timberlake was slurring his speech, was talking a little bit slow when he was reaching for his vehicle registration. And then they did a field sobriety test where they said he had unsteady footing and he failed that field sobriety test. And according to that court paperwork and police, once they actually brought him into custody for this charge of one count of DWI, they said that he refused a breathalyzer test three times. And so, of course, he spent the night in jail and he was arraigned yesterday morning and released on his own recognizance. Now, he does have another court date, and that is going to be set for about a month from now, July 26. That will be a virtual appearance, so he won't have to appear in person here in Sag Harbor again. One thing else that police say he said when they pulled him over, he said, quote, I had one martini and I followed my friend's home. So, that is the most that we have gotten out of Justin Timberlake at this point. Important to note, he is on tour right now, John. I mean, a world tour. He is supposed to be in Chicago for some concerts this weekend, coming back to New York for Madison Square Garden next week. And then on that court date, he's actually in Poland with a concert date.
