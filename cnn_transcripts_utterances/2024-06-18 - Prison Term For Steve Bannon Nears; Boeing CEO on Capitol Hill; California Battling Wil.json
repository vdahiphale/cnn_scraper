Can you let me in?That's a fundamental piece of America, right? And I think that we, as a democracy, must always provide asylum for Ukrainians, for people fleeing communist regimes, for people fleeing violence in a war-torn country or in a country gripped by gang violence. This is so important to the American experience. I'm not willing to sell that out, absolutely not, not anything that has to do with immigration, because I'm an immigrant.

This popped up at 9:00 local time yesterday and now we are up to 13,000 acres. That is the size of Manhattan that has burned in just 26 hours. The wind's not going to die down for them, though, 15 to 20 today. And then we have a tropical storm that may make wind in an opposite direction, but that's a story for a few more maps later. Twenty-nine active wildfires, as you said, most of them in the West, very hot weather across the eastern half of the country, most of the eastern half of the country above 90. Look at Toledo. Got to 99 degrees yesterday, and that's not adding in the humidity; 150 more record highs are going to be broken before the weekend. And the heat is on. It's even on in New England, where places in Vermont will get very close to 100. That's the state with the fewest number of air conditioners in the whole U.S. And then look at the heat index for Syracuse, 102. Yes, right now, today, it's in parts of the Ohio Valley. That's where the heat is. Pittsburgh, you're going to see 90s. Then we talk about this potential tropical storm which will likely become Tropical Storm Alberto later today, and that will push some rainfall into Mexico. And if you have been paying attention the past couple of days about our story here about the water wars going on, man, could this really help. Well, you don't need 10 inches anywhere, but if you get rain right where they need it, this could be a big help -- Boris.",

Now, he's been ordered to surrender by July 1 to begin serving his four-month sentence for not complying with a House subpoena in the January 6 investigation.

Instead, we have learned he's going to be headed to a low-security federal prison in Danbury, Connecticut. So, you could have plenty of white-collar criminals there, but you could also have some potentially violent offenders. And part of this is because of the nature of Steve Bannon's conviction. He defied a subpoena from the House January 6 Committee for documents and testimony. He was sentenced to four months behind bars. But he also has these criminal charges in New York for allegedly defrauding donors as part of this build the wall scheme along the southern border. They basically said he raised this money and then funneled it to himself and his friends. And, as part of that, he may face some pretty uncomfortable conditions. If that still goes to trial later this year, and Bannon is in custody, he could have to spend some time in Rikers Island in jail there, certainly not something that anyone is looking forward to.",
