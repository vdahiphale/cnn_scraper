Again, if you're just joining, CNN's reporting is that the Wagner boss, Prigozhin, who led a failed coup against Putin was among the passengers on board. That plane you see there falling to the ground and a cloud of smoke bursting into flames. Four bodies already recovered from that wreckage.Russian state media reporting that Prigozhin, seen there broadcasting in a video just released two days ago, that he was on board that plane. A truly remarkable event among a series of remarkable events that we've covered on this broadcast and on this network in recent months, including that day, two months ago, when it looked like Prigozhin was carrying out the biggest challenge to Putin's leadership since he took power. And now, that burning wreckage on the ground -- that burning wreckage on the ground. I believe our Jill Dougherty is also with us now. Jill Dougherty, who's covered Russia extensively through the years. Jill Dougherty, tell us your reaction. You know as well as anyone that Putin has killed other rivals before many of them both inside Russian territory and outside Russian territory. With the proviso that we don't know for certain, Prigozhin was on this plane, what is your reaction to seeing this news as reported by state media?",

Many people were predicting that it was just a matter of time, not knowing exactly how it would happen.But Prigozhin had a rebellion against Putin. And no matter which way you slice it, Putin does not forgive. And so, I think this period of a couple of months, where they were able -- the Kremlin was able to dismantle Prigozhin's you know industry that he had, which included troll farms, and the Wagner of forces, etcetera, that is pretty much underway. So, I think this was a good moment to say goodbye to him. Of course, we don't know, you know, details. But other people have died. I'm thinking of the -- at least one person who back in the 90s, who died in a plane crash. He was a very important political figure. So this is not rare. And it will be very, very interesting to see what happens to Wagner because the other report, although I haven't been in communication, so I don't know whether the second in command was killed as well. But that would give total control to Wagner. And its work in Africa and many other places back to the Kremlin supporting people.",

Russia has an open-windows policy. And it needs to be very focused to that.

So, it was just a matter of when.And what was a bit curious was given all of the circumstances which led up to that failed mutiny, and then the details and the intelligence that we learned after the fact that Putin essentially froze for a good 48 -- 24 hours, such to 48 hours where we saw nothing really transpire in Russia. Wondering why he was -- he and his troops were able to get as far as they did, not only in Rostov-on-Don but also marching towards Moscow. Essentially, this was a situation, it appears. And again, we don't know many of the details, just the news information that we're getting from Russian state media. It appears that Putin and the Kremlin decided to take their time here to not look like they panicked and to not make Prigozhin look like a martyr, which in the early days following that failed mutiny, his popularity and approval numbers went up in Russia. Prigozhin on all along, said that this wasn't a mutiny or a coup against Vladimir Putin. It was just against the military leadership, which he believed and many others would assess, were doing a poor job in this war. That having been said, he was somebody who could not be contained and controlled. And that is something Putin liked. And it worked in his favor for all of these years as he was an independent quasi-entity controlling the Wagner group. And it took that failed mutiny for Putin to say what we had all along suspected, and that was that Wagner had been an arm of the Russian military. We know that Prigozhin, just a few weeks ago, met with African leaders in St. Petersburg, another curious situation where we saw photos of him shaking hands with African leaders.

I was myself quite surprised to hear that, but this is a former adviser to Vladimir Putin, who was close to Prigozhin. He said that he believed that this could be a Ukrainian intelligence operation on Ukrainian Independence Day. Another Russian also telling me \"Budanov did it,\" who is, of course, the head of Ukrainian military intelligence. They point to former plots that the Russians have said the Ukrainians were behind.

This airplane that was registered to Prigozhin, the tail number, RA-02795. So, you can deduce that this was very likely an airplane belonging to Prigozhin the Wagner boss. And the data is really interesting. It tells a lot here. You've talked a bit about it. But the data from Flight Radar 24 says that this airplane was flying at 28,000 feet level.",

Not descending.So, not something where there would be some sort of catastrophic emergency where you would need to descend very quickly and get down to breathable air, maybe. The air is not breathable at 28,000 feet. And was headed northwest on a 360-degree heading. So, that's west- northwest and wasn't turning. Wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary. So, this sort of says that this airplane was in a normal cruising position. That nothing was really going wrong. And so, of course, not only will there be an investigation here by the federal authorities in Russia, the Federal Air Transport Agency, but also we'll wait to see what other agencies ultimately glom on to this. I've reached out to the Federal Aviation Administration here in the U.S. I've reached out to the National Transportation Safety Board. Sometimes they're party to especially international investigations that have a lot of heft. And so, they have not necessarily been contacted just yet. We'll wait to hear from them as the sort of unfolds. But a lot of key data here. The one caveat that I've put on this from Flight Radar 24 is that they're still analyzing this data, and it's potentially incomplete, only because the way that they gathered data using sensors at transponder centers out there in -- near Moscow can be a little spotty. So, there may be more data here out there that could really bring in some answers to these questions.",
