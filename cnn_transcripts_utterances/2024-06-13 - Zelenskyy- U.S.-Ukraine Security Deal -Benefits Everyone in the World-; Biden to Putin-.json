He said that he was proud of his son. He said that he was okay with how the judicial system worked. But then we heard him saying the words, I will not pardon him, which is just really so different from that one- word answer he had given in a recent interview. He said yes in response to the question of, would you rule out pardoning him. And then, as he was walking away, when reporters shouted the question of, would you consider commuting your son's sentence, he clearly heard and he said the word no. I just have to imagine you are having the world's eyes on you at such a high-stakes diplomatic moment, and you are having to address something that is so incredibly deeply sensitive and painful for your family. As any parent knows, you know, you want to try to do anything to help your child when they're going through a difficult situation. The President, obviously, in a unique situation and having to sort of utter the words in this kind of setting, I will not pardon him, I just -- it's hard to imagine sort of being in his shoes right now. The other moment that really stood out as a little interesting to me was when a reporter asked him a question about the ongoing cease-fire and hostages negotiations. Earlier in the day, he had said that he was not hopeful that a deal was going to be reached soon. But when a reporter pressed him on that, he initially responded by saying, I wish you guys would play by the rules a little bit, saying that he wished that the questions could be on the topic of Ukraine. Obviously, we all know there are no rules at these kinds of press conferences. If you get a question to the president, you can ask about any topic you would like. But that did sort of seem to me and strike me as the President expressing a little bit of frustration. And I think that clearly captures the moment that we are in, in these negotiations, something that the President has been pressing on for months and months. And as he has made clear and other U.S. officials have made clear, those talks are very much stalled right now. And I think you definitely sense that frustration on the stage behind me.",

      "speaker": "MARGARET TALEV, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST",
      "sentences": "Yes, it's certainly understandable why President Biden would want the questions to focus on today's news and the questions with Zelenskyy. However, just as a small point, yes, that's right. I mean, the expectation for a news conference is that a president is going to take, you know, eight, nine, 10 questions. When it becomes a two-and-two, it greatly reduces the number of questions that one can ask and what will happen a lot of the times is that the reporters who are all there, nobody knows who's going to get the question, will kind of talk with each other, what are the most important questions that need to be asked if we're only going to get, you know, two questions here.So that's the way these things go. And, of course, the President and his team all know that it's a free press. You can ask any questions that you want to. So that's just sort of a little bit of theater. But I do think what we have seen today in terms of this agreement that's been announced, again, why is it important that this is a 10-year agreement. It is important because 10 years basically covers the end of the term of this presidency and two terms of the next president or presidents, whoever he or they may be. And so, yes, it's not binding, it's not a treaty, but an old rule in politics, it's much harder to take something away after it's out there than it is to block something from happening when it hasn't happened yet. Certainly, we've seen that domestically with things that the American people can keep or may want for themselves, things like the Affordable Care Act. Remember, there were dozens and dozens of efforts to repeal that. None of them has worked. One question is: Does that apply in foreign policy? Does that apply vis-a-vis policies to other countries?

CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, the key thing, Boris, about those is that they should not be seen as a panacea. The training for the F-16s has to be world class. The actual airframes are not going to be the same that the U.S. uses or even most of the European countries use and they're not as capable.
