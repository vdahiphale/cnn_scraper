He was cardinal and Pope during the years when the Catholic Church's sex abuse scandals came to light, and he spearheaded the Vatican's efforts towards a zero tolerance policy. However, after his retirement, he suffered a reputational blow when the church commissioned report found he knew and failed to act against a pedophile priest while he was archbishop in Munich 40 years ago. Benedict denied the allegations. Even after his resignation, he continues to be a towering figure in the Catholic Church.

The statement was released on the fourth anniversary of his arrest in Moscow. The former U. S. Marine was sentenced to 16 years in prison for alleged espionage which he denies. Whelan was not included in two prisoner swaps in the U.S. conducted with Russia this year. In a message on Wednesday, his brother said, it's hard to mark the anniversary without any resolution in sight. U. S.

That, of course, is causes problems not just in developed countries, but particularly in developing countries where it can lead to famine. In the Horn of Africa, they've been dealing with below average rainfall now for four years in a row. That's causing increased stress on their food supplies and raising the risks of famine greatly.So, this is all due to climate change. Unless we cut our emissions of greenhouse gases rapidly and strongly, it's going to get worse. It's going to get worse until we get all of our emissions of greenhouse gases around the world essentially to zero.

On Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court decided to temporarily keep a Trump era policy called Title 42 under which many of them could be expelled without an immigration hearing.But officials are now putting up ten temporary processing centers along the border in anticipation of more migrants coming in. CNN has also learned that the U.S. is concerned about possible extremist attacks on migrants if Title 42 is revoked. Benjamin Netanyahu's stunning political comeback in Israel culminated on Thursday when he will be formally sworn in as prime minister for a record sixth time. But before that happens, parliament will vote on his new cabinet that's set to begin in just a few hours. It's expected to be the most far-right government in Israeli history. Israel's new hardline government comes at one of the most volatile periods in years and many of the flash points have been the holy places that are sacred to Jews, Muslims and Christians. CNN's Becky Anderson recently sat down with Jordan's King Abdullah, at one of those sites along the Jordan River. And in this exclusive interview, he shares his thoughts about Israel's new government and offers his vision for improving long term stability in the region. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
