In 1876, Rutherford B. Hayes was elected president, on the back of three alternate slates of electors.

Selling nuclear secrets to a foreign adversary. We have a president, who stole classified documents, which is the subject of another piece of litigation.

Trump's lawyers argued that this particular statute, using a state violation, state business recording -- misrecording, to upgrade it for the concealing of another crime, it has to be within New York jurisdiction. There a lot of good reasons why that might be. The Manhattan D.A.'s response, they couldn't cite a single precedent of a judge validating that use, means that that's an untested use. And the third problem is that there has never been an application of intent to defraud, which is a key element of this case. It's never been used this broadly. It's never been used as an intent to defraud the general public, never used as election interference, whatever that means legally.

That appears to be the primary theory of the underlying crime that the D.A. says the falsification of business records was intended to conceal and aid. So, that statute that he's relying on is a very broad statute, under New York law. And it seems to me, it can be read plausibly to cover violations even of federal election law.

The case is about a fed -- the only way to understand the intent to defraud, and the whatever this unlawful conduct is, is that it's a federal campaign finance filing, which the Biden administration deserves more credit for bending over backward not to charge it. So, the idea that this is a, you know, Trump has claimed and alleged that this is Biden election campaign interference? To the -- it actually belies that claim that the Biden administration didn't charge it.
