But given the warnings that we are hearing about the perceptions of election fraud leading to heightened threats of violence, what struck you most about this attack? RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SR. POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, that it was both extraordinary and somehow feels inevitable. This us a different country than it was a few years ago before, frankly, Donald Trump came down the escalator. We've seen far more proliferation of threats of violence and actual violence against local public health officials, school board officials, obviously against election officials. We've seen all the resignations of election officials who have faced threats -- a kidnapping attempt against the governor of Michigan. There have been some instances from the Left, for instance aimed at the Supreme Court justices. But by and large we are seeing what we saw today, which are individuals who are marinating in the kind of hermetically sealed world of right-wing conspiracy theories, who are taking those sentiments out of the cyber world and into the real world.

We have seen so many Republican leaders, who have tried to normalize and minimize the January 6th attack. We've seen Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader and likely next Speaker of the House, say -- defend the members of his caucus, like Marjorie Taylor Greene, who have used extremist and belligerent language.

We are not seeing the unequivocal condemnation of this kind of extremism, which I believe is largely because they fear that would anger Trump.

Now reports of so-called war weapons being used by special forces stationed on rooftops of local government buildings prompting an outcry from human rights groups. Amnesty saying on Thursday, Iran's security authorities are unlawfully using firearms against thousands in Mahabad. Iran's authorities must immediately rein in the security forces. The regime, however, says police forces have moved in when protesters targeted government buildings after this burial ceremony. While state media has claimed without evidence that protesters were acting under instruction of the separatist terror organization. The incident follows an eight weeks-long campaign of state action violence against peaceful protesters, one which already claimed the lives of 240 people, according to the United Nations. JAVAID REHMAN, U.N. SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR ON IRAN:  I denounced the crackdown on protesters and I urge the authorities to immediately stop the use of lethal force in policing peaceful assemblies.",
