So, when you look at the area that we've got around here, there's a lot going on and the tensions, of course, given the fact that you've got systems going up in this area, you've got fighting all along here, and in the bigger map, you have all of these different areas right in here.

It's hard to figure out how to connect the dots, except to say this appears to be a system that is blinking red, flashing red lights, indicating there is a system that is on the edge of something much worse. You know, there is an expression in aviation, the rules are written in blood. It's kind of a morbid expression. But the idea is that accidents lead to rules, which make things safer.

We're not talking about something the size of mosquito. We're talking the size of an aircraft crossing over runway. How is that even possible?O'BRIEN:  There's really no excuse for a pilot to do this, period. It is a pilot inattention. It's not really understanding where you are in the runway environment. It's perhaps just not paying close enough attention. Being on the ground, among other airplanes on taxiways, some airports are very complicated with the way the taxiways and the runways intersect. But there's plenty of technology and warning signs built into the system to try to keep pilots from straying onto the wrong piece of concrete. But this point out an important thing, Laura. We talk about improving the technology of the system. What we don't have the capability of doing in this country is adding concrete, making new runways, making more space for planes to land at these very busy airports. That's kind of a nonstarter in most locations. And that is where the choke point is right now.

We've had cases where air traffic control gave clearances which were not a good idea and pilots have saved the day. We've had situations where ground crews (INAUDIBLE) planes and other planes. It appears to be a system that has become a little bit complacent. And let's face, post-COVID, the airline industry is still running absolutely at the max, trying to recover a lack of personnel and full planes and capacity everywhere you look.

I think they walked a line, they're both from South Carolina, but obviously, they're fundamentally diverse. They made a case. Tim Scott and -- we are talking about the country doesn't -- you know, we don't need to whitewash the past, bur that doesn't mean you can have a more optimistic view of America. But what I think is troubling, obviously, is that 40% in a primary, that is real weight and that accounts for the disconnect we've got in our politics between the primaries and the general election. It accounts for a lot of these more divisive policies. The good news, if you go to the cross tabs, the younger the Republicans are, the less likely they are to support this stuff.

Now, obviously, these issues can have cultural elements. They can have elements that relate to racial divides. But they are not made-up issues. They are really core issues that people care about. And I think when republican candidates ran on those things, they tend to do pretty well. When you instead had weirdo candidates who ran on weirdo ideas, you saw them lose, especially in Senate races.

And yet somehow, when we have those conversations, it's never a conversation about saying how has the left weaponized the pain and suffering of Black people.

But fundamentally, it doesn't really change our policy towards guns. And more broadly, I mean, look, we are in a country with an enormous gun ownership rate, with a constitutional right to gun ownership, and with a political culture that strongly supports policies that allow for a lot of gun ownership. Even if you had an assault weapons ban and you had very -- increased background checks and that sort of thing, it would still be generally permissible to own a handgun in the United States. There is a lot of other countries where that is not the rule, where it's much harder to get a gun, you have much lower rates of gun death. But not only is that not a case here. It cannot be the case here. People do not want set of policies that is similar to Japan or the United Kingdom or some of these places where that is the case. And so, there are things we can do at the margin if there is a willingness to do certain legislation. We see some of this in the states.

West Virginia, striking down a prohibition aimed at ghost guns because in 1791, firearms didn't have serial numbers.And also, in Texas, a judge ruled that it was unconstitutional to take guns from domestic abusers because apparently, that wasn't a part of our history in this country. When you think about where things stand right now and the idea of trying to look exclusively to history to figure out where we are now, with the technological advances and where we think about gun culture today, is it still appropriate to be so backward-looking?",

The problem that we have in guns in this country overwhelmingly are illegal guns that effectively become illegal through the black market and hand up in the hands of criminals who have no respect for God-given laws. So, until we are going to get serious about passing laws that actually prevent the crimes that we are trying to stop, I think there are going to be people who believe in that Second Amendment constitutional right that are not going to engage in good faith because if we are being honest, the people on the other side of the aisle are not engaging in good faith.",

You can make changes at the margin. You will stop some people who are having mental health crisis from obtaining a gun. It just not works all the time. It can't work all the time because you start from the presumption that the person is not having a mental health crisis and is entitled to a gun.
