      "sentences": "Well, so Anderson, as you said \"The New York Times\" is reporting that Donald Trump was offered to appear before the New York Grand Jury investigating this hush money payments scheme. Now that is required under the law when there is a criminal investigation. So that step certainly indicates and tells us that this investigation is wrapping up. And that's also evident by the parade of witnesses that have met with prosecutors and appeared before the grand jury.We reported yesterday that Kellyanne Conway had met with the Manhattan prosecutors, Hope Hicks has also been in, as well as some top executives at the Trump Organization. Michael Cohen has met multiple times with prosecutors although he has not yet appeared before the grand jury. But all of this signaling that the investigation is wrapping up and that a decision on whether or not to charge is likely soon. Now, as a reminder, as you said, they are investigating the hush money payments. Now hush money payment is not illegal. So what prosecutors are looking at and weighing is whether to charge the former President and possibly the company with falsifying business records. That's because what we've learned through the Federal investigation into Michael Cohen, remember he pleaded guilty to campaign finance charges there, is that the Trump organization had treated this reimbursement payment to Michael Cohen in their books as a legal expense, and Federal prosecutor said that was incorrect and not true. That's when the Manhattan District Attorney's office picked up this investigation and looked at whether it violated State charges. So the State charge that they've isolated here is falsifying business records, and that's a misdemeanor. In order to make it a felony, it has to be falsifying records to commit another crime. So what they're looking at here is whether any campaign finance laws, State laws were violated, that's according to sources. You know, that is an uphill battle, though. That's not a given. That's not a slam dunk kind of case and it is the type of thing that the former President's attorneys could really work with here and try to knock down back to a misdemeanor, which would carry you know, a zero prison sentence to up to 364 days -- Anderson.",

I mean, I think it's pretty unlikely that he would go in and testify before the grand jury, you know, wait to see what kind of decision that the prosecutors are going to make here. But he did issue a statement according to Trump's spokesperson, they said the Manhattan District Attorney's threat to indict President Trump is simply insane.For the past five years, the DA's office has been on a witch hunt investigating every aspect of President Trump's life, and they've come up empty at every turn and now this. And I should also add a source has told us that Trump's lawyers have recently met with the Manhattan District Attorney's prosecutors, because of their concern about all of this activity before the grand jury. It certainly does seem like things are coming to a head. COOPER: Kara Scannell, appreciate it. I want to talk about it now, the implications with CNN senior political analyst, \"New York Times\" senior political correspondent, Maggie Haberman. She's also author of \"Confidence Man: The Making of Donald Trump and the breaking of America;\" also CNN senior legal analyst and former Federal prosecutor, Elie Honig. His book is titled \"Untouchable: How Powerful People Get Away With It.\" With us as well, CNN chief political analyst, Gloria Borger. So Elie, what does this signal to you about the grand jury?",

      "sentences": "Well, Anderson, this tells me that a decision on whether to seek an indictment is very close at hand. And, frankly, that an indictment is quite likely here. This is an unusual feature of New York State law that says when prosecutors are getting close to indicting someone, you have to give that person a chance to testify in the grand jury. That's actually different from Federal law.And you would not do this tactically as a prosecutor until you're at the very end stage because on the off chance, close to zero here, but on the off chance that the person accepts and comes in to testify, you need to have all your ammo arrayed to question that person. So this tells me we're really in the closing phases of this.",

So this is not a smooth fit between the law and the facts. And then there's also the potential problems posed by having Michael Cohen as your star witness. He's a convicted perjurer. He has a very public white hot hatred of Donald Trump that will impact his impartiality. And remember, the Feds across the street, the Southern District of New York rejected him as a cooperator.

I do think it's worth noting here, putting aside issues of Michael Cohen specifically or you know, prospective thinness of the case.

He has been treated for concussion, is expected to stay hospitalized for a number of days.The senator had a bad fall back in 2019. He broke his shoulder on that occasion. Kind wishes have been coming in all across the political spectrum. Given the 51 to 49 split in the Senate, any absence on either side, obviously is significant. We're joined tonight by CNN chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta. So what kind of treatment might Senator McConnell be receiving for a concussion? How serious is a concussion, I mean, for anybody, but somebody who is his age. DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: It can be serious, I mean, there's still some details that we need to understand and know about him. First thing they would do is just do an overall assessment of how he is doing and then increasingly focus on the neurological exam and just see, what is his neurological status? Did he lose consciousness as a result of this fall? We don't know that. Does he have any other neurological symptoms? Is he oriented to person, place and time? Does he have any amnesia? What we call retrograde amnesia, amnesia of things in the past or is he having trouble remembering things now? These are the sorts of things they would do immediately. Depending on how he looks at that point, if he has qa headache or something, they would determine whether or not he might get a CT scan of his brain to see if there's any kind of bleeding or anything that's of greater concern. Again, we don't know that and more times than not, there is not an issue of having bleeding on the brain. But keep in mind, we do know several things about his health. First of all, he is 81 years old. That's going to heighten the level of concern overall. He survived polio as a child. He had bypass surgery 20 years ago, back in 2003. You mentioned that fall that he had four years ago back in 2019. Pretty significant fall, you may remember, Anderson. He fractured his shoulder at that point. He also, a couple years ago, was seen with these bruised and bandaged hands as well. We don't know what was causing that. But, you know, it gives you an idea sort of his overall health. Right now, doctors, I'm sure focused on his neurological exam overall, trying to determine if there is anything that more needs to be done. More likely than not, there won't be, but that's how they approach it.",

You know, was he starting to develop any kind of weakness on one side or something? It sounds like he was speaking coherently and it would suggest that he tripped and fell, just like what was described as opposed to something more. I think maybe that's what they were referring to.You know, as far as how long have you'd be in the hospital, it's interesting, most people, even with a mild concussion, can go home the same day. But again, he is 81 years old. They may be a bit more cautious with him. But also, if he did get a scan, a CT scan of the brain and it showed anything at all, it might warrant him staying more days in the hospital. He is continuing to have symptoms, even mild headache would constitute a symptom in this case, that might warrant him staying in the hospital as well. You know, Anderson falls are a big deal, you know, especially in the elderly. We don't probably talk about it enough, but it's essentially taking a lifetime of risk of so many other medical problems and consolidating it into a split second. So you know, in the hospital, doctors take falls in the elderly very seriously, and I think that's probably why they're erring on the side of caution with him.",

But notice the other half, and that is when Moody's crunched the numbers, they said as well, if you give in to the Republican cuts into the budget, what that's going to do is push the country into a recession, and costs 2.5 million jobs. So either way, the Republicans go, either default on the debt, even short term, or forced these cuts on the economy, both of them, put people out of work and push the economy into a recession. If the Republicans want to sit down and negotiate, what they got to do is, first, they need to vote to raise the debt ceiling. And now let's sit down and negotiate over the budget.
