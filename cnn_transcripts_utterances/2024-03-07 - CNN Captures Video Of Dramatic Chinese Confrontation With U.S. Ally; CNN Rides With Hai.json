If you said Haiti, you are correct. Between 1791 and 1804, freed and enslaved Africans waged the Haitian Revolution, resulting in an independent country free from French rule. Our next story takes us to Haiti. The United Nations has tracked waves of crime and unrest across the country ever since the assassination of its former President Jovenel Moise back in 2021. Ever since, societal conditions in the Caribbean country have deteriorated, with anti-government protests increasing and many Haitians calling for a general election to install new leadership. But Prime Minister Ariel Henry, who came to power after a power-sharing agreement was brokered in 2022 says he can`t step down until the country is secure enough to hold an election. Meanwhile, gangs control nearly 80 percent of Port-au-Prince, Haiti`s capital, and are fighting for more control according to the U.N. A recent surge of coordinated attacks featured armed groups burning down police stations and freeing prisoners while the prime minister traveled out of the country. These latest attacks prompted Haiti`s government to declare a state of emergency as 15,000 people were forced to flee their homes, adding to the more than 300,000 people already displaced by gang violence. This is just a brief high level view of what`s going on in Haiti. So let`s go to our David Culver who has witnessed this situation firsthand. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

These flames have been burning for several hours. Haiti has been engulfed in turmoil for years. We don`t have a home to live them. We don`t have food to eat. That`s what they`re shouting.

They want Henry to go, but he says he`s not yet ready to step down. This as panicked street shootouts like this one have become a near daily occurrence. It`s often a clash between police and the gangs, which have essentially taken Haiti hostage. They flaunt their weapons and wealth on TikTok, threatening police and basking in lawlessness. Many residents now living behind barricades. This is not the gangs doing this the folks that live in these neighborhoods who are putting these up to prevent gangs from coming in and kidnapping. Using whatever might stop or slow the kidnappers, efforts to protect families and preserve innocence. In recent months, gangs have seized more and more control over this country, including the roads leading to Port-au-Prince. Officials estimate that gangs now control as much as 80 percent of the capital, even the U.S. embassy and international airport are mostly surrounded by rival gang territories. It`s led the Haitian national police to create an undercover unit. We go with them to the front lines.",

And beyond here is what they consider to be their front lines. From here, you can see the battlefield, no signs of any suspected gang members for now. Police are not the only ones trying to gain the upper hand here. In a fractured state, alternatives to the gangs and government surface. We`re headed to meet a commander of BSAP, Haiti`s armed environmental protection agency that has splintered from the Henry government, challenging its legitimacy. We pulled up to a gated compound. The man in the purple shirt leads us in. He then changes into his BSAP uniform. It`s the commander. He`s in hiding from police. His message echoes the anti-government protester. He flexes BSAP`s strength and numbers and its potential to help bring stability. But when it comes to his own family -- You mentioned you have four kids. What do you think their future is in this country? He fears their future is best served leaving Haiti. The question that no doubt people in the U.S. will ask is, well, why should we help? JEAN-MARTIN BAUER, WFP HAITI DIRECTOR:  Well, there are two reasons why you need to help. First of all, there -- on humanitarian grounds. But then there`s also your own self-interest in the U.S. So the longer you wait to act on Haiti, the more migrants there will be on your southern border. It`s that simple. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
