UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): They were all innocent civilians, women, children. The airstrikes came suddenly and destroyed all our homes with children still inside and now we don't even know where we can bury our dead. Enough, please, enough. BASHIR (voice-over): In less than one week, Israel has dropped more than 6,000 bombs on Gaza, the equivalent to the total number of airstrikes carried out during the 2014 Israel-Gaza War, which lasted 50 days. And while there continues to be widespread condemnation of the collective punishment the people of Gaza are being subjected to, there is every indication that this war will only intensify.

Meanwhile, Israeli warplanes kept up their bombardment of Gaza and Israeli forces conducted raids inside the enclave, searching for perhaps as many as 150 hostages still held by Hamas. The raids are the latest sign that Israel is ramping up operations against Hamas after the militant group's terror attacks inside Israel one week ago. CNN's Nic Robertson reports.

This has been the case and the norm over the past 75 years. I want to remind you that the blockade, the inhumane, illegal, longest- ever blockade on civilian population 16 years ago, have been imposed on Gaza. Hamas has been in negotiations after 2012 and 2014 to mitigate, actually, to lift the blockade to give Palestinians their freedom or at least freedom of movement. But what was happening at the Israeli side, they enjoyed the freedom (INAUDIBLE). And Palestinians stayed caged in Gaza, in open air prison, deprived from the basics, really the basics in everything. Let's also remind everyone that Gaza population, over 50 percent are children. They have never set a foot outside the Gaza Strip. The water there already contaminated, I'm told. It's not because of Hamas. It's because of Israel. The border is closed and this blockade is not imposed because of Hamas. It's because of punishment, political punishment by Israel as the occupying power, as the state that control everything inside Gaza Strip.

When Kevin McCarthy was ousted in that historic vote, becoming the first speaker ever to be kicked out of that position by his own colleagues. Since then, the House has been paralyzed. No legislation can be acted upon until the Speaker is elected.The question is, can the Republicans, who are in the majority but barely, get behind a consensus candidate? So far the answer is no. Steve Scalise, the House majority leader, was elevated as the nominee to become the next Speaker of the House. But he decided to withdraw because he did not have the votes to move forward. You need 217 votes in the House. That means you cannot afford as a speaker candidate to lose more than four Republican votes. Then Friday, Republicans nominated Jim Jordan, the House Judiciary Committee chairman, to be the next Speaker of the House. But this was his problem. When he put the question to his conference, saying how many of you would vote against me on the floor, 55 of them said they would. So he's going to spend the next days over the weekend, trying to convince 51 members to somehow come to his side. If he can't, then he'll have to confront this issue all over again. There are fresh concerns from a wide range of members about how this reflects on the GOP and whether this can affect their ability to hang on to the House in next year's elections.
