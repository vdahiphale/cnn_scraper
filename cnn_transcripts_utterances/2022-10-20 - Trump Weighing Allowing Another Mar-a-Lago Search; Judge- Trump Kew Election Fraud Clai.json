Sources telling CNN former President Donald Trump and his legal team are considering allowing federal agents to conduct a new supervised search of Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Still part of an effort to save Trump from potential legal jeopardy amid the Justice Department's investigation into thousands of classified documents that were recently seized from Trump's home. We're also learning about another investigation into the former president. A federal judge has ordered the release of more emails from Trump's former attorney John Eastman to the house committee investigating the January 6 Capitol riot. The judge says those emails show Trump knew his voter fraud claims were wrong but continued to push them in an effort to overturn the 2020 election. Much more on that in just a moment.We're going to start though with CNN's Sara Murray with more on that potential new search at Mar-a-Lago. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

This would be designed to help satisfy the Justice Department's demands that that Trump return any sensitive government documents that he still has from his time in the White House.Now there are people around the former president who don't necessarily believe that he still has documents from that period, but the Justice Department has made clear both in private conversations with Trump's team as well as in court filings they think that there were some documents missing. They believe the former president may still have documents in his possession. Now Trump has taken a very adversarial approach when it comes to the Justice Department -- certainly after the August search at Mar-a-Lago but sources are saying he's considering being more accommodating. That all of these investigations are beginning to wear on him and that the people around him are advocating perhaps for being more accommodating to the Justice Department to try to get some sort of swift resolution to this case. Now it's still unclear whether this could be what happens. This is just one of the options on the table. When we asked Trump's spokesperson for comment, he declined to comment.

Because if you look at what the judge describes here of these emails is, they fire off a lawsuit, a state court lawsuit in early December, December 4th, making various allegations about dead people voting, about felons voting, about unregistered voters voting. And by the end of December, they're aware that these allegations are false and that's the email that the judge quotes here. One of the emails where Eastman says, the president has since been made aware that some of the allegations have been inaccurate. And then they go and they make -- they actually -- the lawyers go and they have him file a federal lawsuit where Trump certifies under oath, verifies under oath that these allegations were in fact, true. You know, that's perjury and that's certainly evidence of federal crimes. But remember when Eastman makes this statement it's December 31st. What happens three days later, two days later?

He'll be making those remarks at a bridge that collapsed back in January. Ahead of a scheduled visit from Mr. Biden it's now weeks away from reopening with repairs funded by the infrastructure legislation the president signed into law last year. The $1.2 trillion measure was passed in a rare show of bipartisanship delivering billions of dollars in new federal investments in America's infrastructure over the next five years. President Biden is also taking action to stem the rising gas prices. On Wednesday he authorized the release of 15 million barrels of oil from the U.S. strategic reserves for December and said it might not be the last time. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

MARCO RUBIO (R-FL): I'm 100 percent pro-life. Because -- not because I want to deny anyone their rights but because I believe that innocent human life is worthy of the protection of our laws. REP. VAL DEMINGS (D-FL): You have been clear that you support no exceptions, even including rape and incest.

Those challenges come alive in competitive contests like Michigan's eight district, where Congressman Dan Kildee acknowledges the pain of inflation but tells CNN the election should still be seen as a stark choice between Democratic and Republican policies. REP. DAN KILDEE (D-MI): Is it a challenge for us? Absolutely. People tend to hold the party that holds the White House responsible for everything. We just ask folks to really think carefully about what the alternatives are. Look at the current condition of the Republican Party. Look at their policies.",

Various other measures being taken across the country. It gets real and it's gotten cold. I can tell you this standing here. This is gotten cold the past couple of days. So, this is going to impact people's lives. But despite the president having a crisis meeting last night and asking for people for their support, there isn't a sense that this is, you know, a country on its knees at all. People are listening to what the president is saying and they're keeping their lights off when they don't need them, not using heavy energy drawing products, appliances during the day when the draw is greatest. The government's advising them to use these devices, washing machines, that sort of thing, use them overnight when there's more electricity available. The government is doing its best. And the president says he'll try keep critical infrastructure going. It appears that he'll use a system of generators -- that's what he seems to imply -- to keep those things going, keep the emergency services working and all the critical functions of the country.

What it means on a day-to-day level of people living there, not that much probably. Because they are in a war zone. This is, you know, enshrined in Marshall law are things like mobilization. Ukraine has already accused Russia of doing that in these regions, movement of people, seizure of property likely already happening. I think more impactful are these regions that you see here on the map in Russia, the ones closest to Ukraine who are facing what many are calling mobilization like rules.
