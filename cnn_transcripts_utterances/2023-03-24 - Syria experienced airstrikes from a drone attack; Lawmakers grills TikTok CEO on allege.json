The Pentagon says the drone is likely of Iranian origin, which suggests it would be a Iranian proxy in the region that carried out this attack, and that's why we see the follow-on action from the United States carrying out what it called a precision strike, a proportionate attack against forces affiliated with Iran's Islamic revolutionary guard corps. According to a pentagon statement, the U.S., quote, \"Took proportionate and deliberate action intended to limit the risk of escalation and minimize casualties.\" General Eric Perilla, the commander of U.S. Central command says that, if there were further Iranian attacks on US forces, there might be further U.S. responses. In a short statement this evening, he said, we are postured for scalable options in the face of any additional Iranian attacks. In terms of how frequently this happened, in fact, Perrilla, again the commander of U.S. Central command, testified just earlier today, that there have been 78 rocket attacks or UNV attacks against U.S. forces in Syria just to the beginning of 2021 by his count, Kohn. Average averages out to nearly one attack every 10 days, but not all of them have this sort of tragic result. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now such a speech by the defense minister would have been a major- major blow to Netanyahu, politically, who has long touted that he is strong and national security.
