I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.This morning at the White House, I'm President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will hold a critical meeting with the U.S. hostage negotiating team in hopes of crafting a ceasefire deal to free the people Hamas took captive during the October 7th terror attack on Israel. 97 hostages are still being held, including seven Americans. Of those Americans, four are believed to still be alive. This weekend's discovery of six hostages killed in a Hamas tunnel underscores the sense of urgency. Israel calls it, quote, cold blooded murder. Minutes ago, a funeral began for the young man on your far left, Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg Polin. Israel's president apologized to the family in his eulogy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He has changed our world and woven his essence of light and love into the story of the Jewish people and into our human story forever.JON POLIN, FATHER OF HERSH GOLDBERG-POLIN:  This morning, I saw a clip of a vigil that took place in New York last night. How appropriate that the crowd was singing, Ani v'ata nishane et ha'olam, you and I will change the world. The 23 years of life that we had with you were a blessing. We now will work to make your legacy a similar blessing. You were a really great guy. I love you. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

What happened in Israel now that everybody at the streets, there was a strike today, everyone was just screaming and being with the family and just to make sure that they're going to seal the deal, they're going to bring our loved ones home, safety, like, right, they're doing whatever they can just to make a noise. It's not a political issue. It's humanitarian issue. And to see all the crowds in on the streets, we are not alone. You know, we are fighting this fight for 332 days.

And he said, look, I am really sorry that we weren't able to bring them home and ask for forgiveness. It's the sort of thing that people want to hear from the prime minister at the moment, and they're not hearing it, and that's why the protests are out. I have to say, the protests are smaller than yesterday. This area, we were here yesterday, around this time, and it was an absolute throng of people, a sea of people here. So, there are smaller protests around Tel Aviv, and no doubt they're absolutely going to continue. But, yes, you're right, the country is not hearing from the prime minister the things that publicly they want him to say, and most importantly, not hearing that he's changing tactics to actually get the other hostages home safe and alive.",

And the point that the prime minister makes is simply that if we're going to beat Hamas and defeat them and contain them in the future, we have to have control over it. And the logic is really simple.Look, the Philadelphia corridor, as it's called, is that almost nine- mile long border between Gaza and Egypt. And a few months ago the IDF took control of it and they found massive tunnels underneath it into Egypt. And that's where Hamas gets a lot of its weapons from, smuggles them in from Iran or other countries through that tunnel in Gaza. The prime minister's point is, and his supporters in the cabinet, if you don't control that, then how are you going to be able to stop all the weapons coming in, in the future? The point that Hamas is making, and this is the big sticking point in the negotiations, is they don't want any Israeli troops inside of Gaza, including on the Philadelphia corridor in the terms of the deal. So, the prime minister has, you know, changed his plans a little bit, offered a map that shows fewer Israeli troops along that border. But here's another point. Even his defense minister is saying, Mr. Prime Minister, you're micromanaging. This is your map. This is not what we need. We could get away without having any troops along that borderline just to get the ceasefire, just to get the hostages home. It is the biggest of all sticking points at the moment, it appears. Jim?",
