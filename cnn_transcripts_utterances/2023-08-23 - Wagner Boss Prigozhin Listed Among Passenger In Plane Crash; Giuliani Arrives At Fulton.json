We have shocking footage of the plane falling from the sky with an apparently damaged wing. There are graphic videos circulating of the damage as you've often seen Jim when it comes to air crashes utterly horrific at times showing bodies on the floor.But even an open transparent investigation using DNA would struggle to go through a scene like that and be clear about every single person who'd lost their life there who indeed they were. But instead we have Russian state media Russian state investigators launching into this investigation. Remember these are the people in the pay of Vladimir Putin who often channel his every word and wish. Sometimes there's chaos, sometimes we don't always see a perfectly orchestrated plot. It's unclear what we're seeing here, but the messaging is coming thick and fast and it's all pointing towards the possibility that Yevgeny Prigozhin is indeed dead. Now, he's a - frankly, a seminal figure in Putin's Russia. He was the chef who then turned the military food supplier, who then turned the man who ran the internet troll factory that caused havoc in the U.S. elections. He's openly admitted recently to being involved in trying to meddle in the United States electoral procedures but also too, in this war in Ukraine, in charge of the bitterest most brutal, most savage part of the Russian military fighting here. The Wagner Group fought bitterly in Bakhmut behind repeated atrocities here in Ukraine, also in Syria too, also in Africa as well, part of the deniable military paramilitary wing of the Kremlin working around the world. The demise of Prigozhin already being welcomed by some within the Ukrainian government. It's important to point out since he led that extraordinary rebellion over (inaudible) ...",

      "sentences": "Yes it just is so astonishing to see Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell both over at the jail apparently at the same time. We really have no idea the last two times these two people may have interacted. Sidney Powell after the election was alongside Rudy Giuliani in those press conferences in many of those public statements that they were making on behalf of Donald Trump to try and undermine the public's faith in the election. And they were just these two prominent voices that became quite infamous for what they were doing for Trump during his administration not just after the election. Giuliani, his personal lawyer, during the Mueller investigation, Sidney Powell being the - carrying the banner for Michael Flynn trying to fight his case getting his guilty plea unraveled and really coming to quite fame on doing that in a way that got her very close to Donald Trump and his inner circle of lawyers.And so having those two people who had essentially been purged out of the Trump universe after the 2020 election because of how the court plan that they had launched where they brought court cases to challenge the election results, to throw out popular votes, how that just totally failed across the board in 60 cases or so that after that Sidney Powell really had split from what we know of was the Trump inner circle of lawyers around, Rudy Giuliani has clearly not been as closely kept by the president as someone in his inner circle since then since Donald Trump has not been paying for either of their legal bills. But now to notice that they are in that jail in Fulton County at the same time. But one thing that I should be really clear on with this is that what Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani are both charged with here is the racketeering charge, the same as Donald Trump is facing as part of that whole group. But when you look at their individual felony charges that they're facing, Rudy Giuliani is facing as many charges as Donald Trump ultimately and is the man that the prosecutors in this case say was behind so many pieces of the effort in Georgia to unravel Trump's loss whereas Sidney Powell what she's charged with here in Georgia outside of racketeering is specifically about what was happening in Coffee County, the computer access to the voting machines that that scheme was one that the prosecutors want to give her ownership of as they prosecute this case. Now, both of them in the federal investigation around January 6 are co-conspirators and we haven't seen what will happen with them. But there has been - there have been quite a lot of people on tenterhooks wondering are these two people going to face some sort of fallout from the federal system, too, as that investigation clearly continues on.",

He was the U.S. Attorney for the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office of Southern District of New York in the 1980s. I had the honor of working there about 20 years later. And Rudy was a figure who was venerated inside the Justice Department and inside the Southern District of New York.And as you said one of his signatures was that he really pioneered an expansive use of the RICO Act, the racketeering act to go after organized crime figures and others here in New York City and now here he is surrendering into a state at county level jail facing charges of RICO violations of his own. So it's really quite a remarkable turnaround and fall for Rudy Giuliani. Now, of course, he has - he is presumed innocent, he has made clear he intends to fight this case, but he will be sitting on the other side of the courtroom to where he's used to.",

He has gone hat in hand to the former president looking for assistance with that. He hasn't gotten it outright, though perhaps some overtures to help fundraise to get him some help.But I just wonder what you think about the possibility that Rudy Giuliani might be someone who could flip on the former president or do you think that just isn't in the cards?",

He is an indicted defense (inaudible) case that we see him surrendering on out of Fulton County, Georgia. He is co conspirator one in Jack Smith's federal indictment that could well result in him being indicted there as well he's facing various civil suits including a defamation suit from the two Georgia election workers who he allegedly defamed and he has essentially conceded now that he wrongly spread lies about them. He has all sorts of financial trouble.Ordinarily, I would say the table set for someone in this position to flip. This is why people flip. They're facing potential imprisonment. They're having financial problems. However, Rudy himself has shown zero inclination to do that. He's remained defiant as recently as this morning when he was leaving his Manhattan apartment. He was quite defiant towards prosecutors and seemed to have no interest towards accepting responsibility. And on the flip side of that, I'm not so sure if prosecutor would ever really want to cooperate Rudy Giuliani and present him as a witness that you're asking a jury to rely on. I know I would have a great hesitation about doing that as a prosecutor just given his thorough lack of credibility. So it looks to me like Rudy intends to dig in and fight this case and I think that's what we're in for in the next several months.",

It's not ideal as a prosecutor you'd rather have somebody who comes clean from day one. But this happens and as a prosecutor as long as you're convinced that, A, the person has now come clean; B, you can rely on them in front of a jury and C, you have some explanation. They're going to need to explain to a jury, well, here's why he lied the first time.And I think the very reasonable and quite common explanation is he had a lawyer who wasn't really working for him. He had a lawyer who was being paid for and was loyal to The Trump Organization. And so I think jurors can understand that type of pressure to not come fully clean.

As much as it's remarkable, surreal, bizarre in a way to see people who were once powerful public officials, people who were once respected in the legal and political community, Rudy Giuliani, perhaps Sidney Powell, eventually Donald Trump go into a prison to surrender, the way this has been playing out has been very routine and I mean that in a good way. This is the way it's supposed to work. This is what happens. It's all day every day in prosecutors' offices across the country. You get together prosecutors and defense lawyers, you work out hopefully a reasonable bail package if you can. People go in, they go through the motions. They're processed in, they're fingerprinted, they're - they have their mugshots taken.I guess, we're still not entirely sure whether Donald Trump will have his taken, and then you're into the court system. And in a few weeks we will have an arraignment. They'll be advised of their rights and the charges against them, and they will presumably enter not guilty pleas and go from there. So there's a bit of dissonance, I guess, watching this play out between seeing these people who are powerful, well-respected people who've now had had precipitous falls in their lives but, of course, are entitled to fight their cases and yet they're entered into the most routine aspect of our criminal justice system now.",

The truthful answer is it's an imperfect process, prosecutors and judges really are the only ones who can police it. So I think Rudy Giuliani is going to have to walk a pretty narrow tightrope as Donald Trump is as well and the restrictions that have been placed on him. And if people are wondering about these numbers by the way, $200,000 for Trump, apparently $150,000 for Rudy, a couple things to know. One is they don't have to post all of that in cash, typically you have to post 10 percent. There are some ways in Georgia that you can just sort of sign a surety without posting any of it. And if you're wondering how they arrive at these numbers, it's based in part on the nature and number of the charges but it's really just negotiated between the prosecutor and the defense attorney. You come to a number that you think will be reasonable to ensure that the person comes back and that's how I'm sure they resulted in this $150,000 number.",

And I think those last two questions have now been answered.It is interesting that it took Putin two months to do this and I don't really think that there's any doubt that the Russian government was somehow involved in this, directly involved I would argue. It did take two months and that's kind of going to be an interesting question going forward. I think it might have something to do with concerns on the Kremlin side by Putin that Prigozhin has certain level of - basically enjoyed a certain level of support certainly from people in Rostov who saw the footage on that. But I think if he had turned around and murdered him, killed him quite obviously soon after that mutiny, perhaps he was concerned about some pushback from the Russian people. But again, I don't - this is really no surprise. It's interesting - it will be interesting to see how the Russians spin this.

That's certainly true as I was just saying. I think Putin felt the need to put a little distance between the mutiny and the repercussions, the inevitable end for Prigozhin. Again, if he had done it very quickly, I think that there could have been some sort of backlash from the Russian populace themselves and people in the streets. And indeed, that shows, I think, how weakened Putin has become. Simply because he appears to have been able to successfully off Yevgeny Prigozhin doesn't mean that he is returning or has returned to the status of - that he had before of being a really all in control, strong man of Russia.I think he's significantly weakened, but he needs to send the message.
