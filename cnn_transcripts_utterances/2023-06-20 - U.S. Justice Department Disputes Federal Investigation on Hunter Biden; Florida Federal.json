After an exhaustive five-year federal investigation, anattorney for Hunter Biden says the criminal probe against his client is now resolved. But the U.S. Justice Department disputes that and claims that this probe is still ongoing. According to DOJ court filings, the President's son, Hunter Biden, will admit that he broke the law and plead guilty to two tax misdemeanors, and he'll face a charge, but likely won't be prosecuted for illegally purchasing a handgun. This is all part of a plea deal. Sources also tell CNN the DOJ is expected to recommend probation for the tax crimes. Top Republicans are slamming this agreement. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KEVIN MCCARTHY (R), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  It continues to show the two- tier system in America. If you are the President's leading opponent, DOJ tries to literally to put you in jail and give you prison time. If you are the President's son, you get a sweetheart deal. Now, this does nothing to our investigation. It actually should enhance our investigation because the DOJ should not be able to withhold any information now. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

What more can you tell us about the deal? EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR U.S. JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, this is a culmination of an investigation certainly that has hung over Hunter Biden and, by extension, his father, right, who is now running for reelection as president. And so at least for now, this resolves this matter with the U.S. Attorney's Office in Delaware, who is a Trump appointee. He's the one who's been overseeing this investigation, has stayed on the job in order to manage this investigation for the Justice Department. And I'll read you just a part of what the Justice Department says this resolves. It says that Hunter Biden has agreed to plead guilty to two tax charges. This is for failing to pay his taxes on time in 2017 and in 2018. There is a separate charge for possession of a gun while addicted to drugs. This is something that Hunter Biden has written about in his, in a book, an autobiography that talked about his struggles with substance abuse. And in connection with that the Justice Department is allowing him to enter into a pre-trial diversion program. This essentially is for him to seek some counseling, again, some drug treatment and at the end of that if he satisfies the rules that he has agreed to, then this charge goes away. The gun charge goes away. According to his lawyer, what Hunter is trying to do here is to get past this. I'll read you just a part of what he says, I know Hunter believes it is important to take responsibility for these mistakes he made during a period of turmoil and addiction in his life. He looks forward to continuing his recovery and moving forward. But in keeping with what you opened with, Zain, we expect that this is far from over, especially because Republicans in Congress have the power to do investigations, and they have already vowed that they're going to continue to look into matters related to this. For instance, they believe that there's still some questions to be answered about Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine. This is during the time that Joe Biden was vice president. There's also questions about what Hunter Biden did with millions of dollars that he was paid by a Chinese energy company, again, during the same period that this plea agreement, these tax charges cover for -- cover the period for. So, again, we expect that Republicans are gonna keep investigating especially because we are in a reelection season here in the United States and so this is far from over as far as that's concerned.

The Israeli defense forces set up roadblocks across the West Bank and we got word, something about an hour ago or so that it had captured after a pursuit the second Palestinian gunman, that he tried to flee and that he was shot dead at the scene, as well. They also say that they found the weapon that was allegedly used as part of this attack, as well inside the vehicle. And just for some context, this is the worst attack on Israelis, the deadliest attack on Israelis since January the 27th when seven were killed outside a synagogue in the -- in the eastern part of Jerusalem. So, this is being taken very seriously by the Israeli security services. We've heard from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu already. He said all options are open. We will continue to fight terrorism with all our strength and we will defeat it. And of course, this -- this attack on Israeli civilians comes just a day after we were talking about this violent gunfight between Israelis and Palestinian militants in Jenin which left six Palestinians dead.

      "sentences": "There are a tremendous number of challenges, which is part of what makes this search so difficult. Ajoint effort between the U.S. Coast Guard and the Canadian Coast Guard and Canadian Armed Forces to search not only on the surface of the water, but also below the surface of the water. In terms of searching on the surface, there are and have been C-130s, so long-range, long-endurance patrol aircraft from both the Americans and the Canadians that have essentially likely just been flying back and forth searching the surface of the water for any sort of debris, or perhaps if the submersible is floating on top of the water without communications. So, that would be likely the role of C-130s in this case. Again, they can stay up for a tremendously long amount of time, searching a large area of the surface of the water. But of course, the far more challenging search is underneath the surface of the water. And that's where the U.S. and the Canadians have used P-8s and our colleague Jason Carroll has reported P-3s. Those are anti-submarine aircraft able to essentially detect the mass of an enemy submarine below the surface of the water using different means, either detecting it magnetically or detecting the sound of it. The challenge here, of course, is that this submersible is far smaller than an enemy submarine, even if this submersible wants to be found. In terms of how the P-8 would search, it would drop what are called sonobuoys in different spots throughout the search area. Sound travels very well underwater, so if there's any sound coming from the submersible itself, not only would it be able to hear it with these sonobuoys, but it can figure out if a few of them pick up any sort of acoustic signature, where it is based on sort of a triangulation of where that sound came from. That of course assumes that there is any sort of sound coming from the submersible itself and that just adds to the challenge here. You can also use sonar to scan the bottom of the water. Of course, that too, comes with its own challenges because there's already the wreckage of the Titanic down there and you'd have to somehow differentiate between that and the submersible. So, Zain, there are a whole host of challenges presented in trying to find this submersible. Challenges that the military is here, the Coast Guards are trying to figure out in terms of how to search as efficiently and as quickly as possible, knowing the limitations of the submersible itself.",

And in 2018,I actually did a story about Titan, about this submersible that's now missing. We went out to the Ocean Gate headquarters, and we were able not just to interview the crew but also, as you can see, sit inside the vessel. And I was struck first by how simple, almost rudimentary, a lot of the technology onboard really seemed. You know, this is a tiny vessel. It's quite cramped. It can only fit five people and it's operated by a gaming controller, actually piloted with a gaming controller, what looks like a PlayStation controller. And yet the company Ocean Gate was confident -- extremely confident that they could safely make this journey to the Titanic inside that vessel dive 13,000 feet down in the ocean, and they said that its frame could handle the 150 million pounds of pressure that it would feel at the ocean floor. The company CEO Stockton Rush who CNN has confirmed is one of the people on board this missing vessel, according to a source with knowledge of the mission plan. He told me that the pressure vessel, with its carbon fiber structure, that it could handle the pressure of the ocean. Of course, at this point, we don't know what went wrong, but a lot of work went into designing Titan. OceanGate worked with NASA, they say, and Boeing to design the vessel and said they did not cut any corners when it came to costs or safety.",

      "sentences": "Hi there, Zain. Well, that's, I think, a key point with the Russians trying to focus onthose military infrastructure installations, especially if you look at those strikes that took place in the western part of Ukraine in the Lviv area, where, of course, a lot of that infrastructure there is key, critical infrastructure for the Ukrainians. But then you have the situation here in the capital of Kyiv, which, of course, very often has these air raid alerts pretty much every night that they go off. And last night, they were indeed very long, going on for several hours. And the Ukrainians are saying that they detected 35 drones coming towards the area of the Ukrainian capital and that they were able to take down 32 of those. So, that obviously seems to very much indicate that the air defenses here in the Ukrainian capital are very strong, but the Russians certainly trying to bring those drones here into the city and hit targets in the city with the Russians would call command and control structures of the Ukrainian military, but of course of the Ukrainian state, as well. And then of course, this is also for the population, something that can also be very traumatic. Nevertheless, the Ukrainians are very confident, they continue to take these drones down and protect the capital and protect other areas as well. Nevertheless, all this does, of course, tie in with Ukraine's counteroffensive. One of the things that we have seen is a lot of these aerial attacks have been even more increasing since the Ukrainians have been pushing the Russians on several areas in the front. And one of the places that you mentioned, Zaporizhzhia, is of course fairly close to the frontline. I would say about 40 to 45 kilometers away from the actual frontline areas and that was targeted by a barrage of missiles overnight. The Ukrainians on those frontlines are indeed saying that they are the ones who have the initiative. The president of this country, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, did indeed say that the Ukrainians were not losing territory anywhere but gaining territory in a lot of places and that's certainly the main focal point where that is happening, is the south of the country where the going is pretty tough for the Ukrainians there. It's something that they have acknowledged. They say the battles are very tough. Russian air power is very strong and the defenses are very strong, as well. There's a lot of minefields, a lot of barriers, and of course also a lot of troops that are down there from the Russians. Nevertheless, when we were down in that region, it certainly seemed to us that the morale of the Ukrainian troops who were fighting down there was very hard. They acknowledged it was extremely difficult. It's very difficult for them to move forward, especially when they're being targeted by Russian air power. But they did believe that in the end they were going to be able to make this counteroffensive a success. So, that's certainly listening to the Ukrainian soldiers who are down there on the ground right now, they certainly seem to believe that this is something that they can see through at the same time that is extremely difficult. And the Ukrainians also say they are under no illusions that this is going to be something that can happen quickly. In fact, they say this counteroffensive is going to take a very long time, Zain",

Walk us through what has to go wrong, right? What has to go wrong for a sub-like this to lose contact for this situation that we're all talking about to happen? BOBBIE SCHOLLEY, RETIRED U.S. NAVY CAPTAIN:  Thanks for having me, Zain. And I just want to say my heart goes out to the crew and their families of the submersible at this time. There's any number of things that can go wrong on a vessel that is going under the sea, especially to these depths where the pressure is so intense when you get to these depths. And so, we usually build redundancies into all the systems that we put on these types of vessels. We want to have redundancy in our life support, in our propulsion, in our communications, in every system. And so, the smallest thing can go wrong. You can get water into a system which, you know, heaven forbid, in a vessel like this that's going into the deep ocean. So, just any small thing can cause a problem. And we don't know in this case whether it's just a communications problem, a propulsion problem that prevents them from coming up to the surface, a ballasting problem, which is how the submersible would get up or down through the water column. So, that's something that, you know, will have to be addressed once we get through the search and recovery phase of this operation, which is what everybody's focused on at this point. So, just in terms of what happens next, I mean, assuming that this vessel is eventually located, hopefully within the next day or two, given just how much oxygen they have left, what's the process of actually toeing the vessel to the ocean's surface?
