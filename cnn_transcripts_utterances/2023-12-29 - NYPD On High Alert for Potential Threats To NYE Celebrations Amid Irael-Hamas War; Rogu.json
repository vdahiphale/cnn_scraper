Staff and bystanders from a nearby brawl where there. They were trying to apprehend Johnson after he allegedly assaulted a bar manager. But the video shows an Oxford police officer arriving on the scene while the student is pinned on the ground. The officer is then seen hitting the student in the head at least three times, as he is being restrained, held down by several people. Also, the chancellor at the University of Wisconsin lacrosse has been fired after he and his wife posted pornographic videos online. The school has not publicly detailed the reason they removed 63-year-old Joe Gow from his leadership role.

At least eight people here went to the hospital. The National Weather Service has issued coastal flooding and high-surf warnings for much of the California coast, with waves up to 40 feet possible for San Francisco.

But still, just as a precaution, authorities -- there we go. It's actually moving closer to where I'm standing. And I will move a little bit away. Authorities actually closed this pier as a precaution. But you can still see there are folks out here grabbing photos, taking pictures, despite the closest signs. Obviously, they're not enforcing that. But the unpredictability of just how close it keeps coming to you is part of the concern. Now, in terms of the rest of the coast, Ventura and Santa Cruz counties very much impacted the most as of yesterday, where we saw dramatic flooding of the areas. There was powerful footage of a restaurant that was completely engulfed by flames. A lot of businesses and homes were hurt. You played that dramatic footage of people getting swept away. Nothing that dangerous here in the Manhattan Beach area for now. But onlookers who experienced the worst of it in the other areas describe those harrowing moments. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
