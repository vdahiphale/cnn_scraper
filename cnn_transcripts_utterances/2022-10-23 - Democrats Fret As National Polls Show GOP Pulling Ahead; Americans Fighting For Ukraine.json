And you are live in the CNN NEWSROOM on this Sunday.Just 16 days from now Americans will cast ballots in midterm elections that are becoming more about the economy with each passing day. House and Senate control are at stake as Americans deal with higher inflation and fears of a looming recession. Polls show voter interest at record highs along with alarming levels of division and anger. A new NBC News survey shows that more than 80 percent of both Republicans and Democrats believe that the other party is a threat to destroy America. Soaring prices and other economic fears are mobilizing voters and that is hurting Democrats, the party in power. And I spent the last week in my beloved home state of Kentucky talking to a wide spectrum of voters from rural areas that tend to be reliably red to Lexington, which is a more blue pocket of the blue grass state. And here is some of what they told me about how issues like the economy factor into their own vote and the vote of folks in their circles. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

You know, this is the reason why the White House usually has such a tough time in these midterm elections after an incoming president is because it's much easier to be the other side to make that insurgent argument, to make that kind of challenge or pitch rather than to say the current state does point back to Democrats.We have seen voter confidence level in the party basically trimmed with gas prices, basically trimmed with those other economic pinches that are looming on voters' pocketbooks and wallets. But the White House is trying to say that those are things outside of their control. And that might be true. That's very well true. The issue is that when voters have a chance to express their frustration that is only going to point at the party in power. And as you said from the congressional actions to the White House that is all the Democratic Party who was very proud of where the economy was and in some parts of the economy are now that issue is very much turned from them and it's been harder for them to be able to defend the current landscape.",

It can go from just a cold to something like Bronchiolitis which is typically what RSV is, when it gets into later stage. And so some of the things that we want people to be aware of is just kind of how your kid looks and is acting. You know, when you look at what a cold is, you know, kids will have fever, they'll have runny nose, congestion, some cough but they won't have respiratory distress.When you start to make the distinction as to what is going on and are things getting worse typically you're going to see that change in your children where they're having trouble breathing, they're breathing harder, they're breathing faster. Their belly may be moving up and down. Maybe have nasal flaring as well. And so when you start to see those constellation of symptoms we want you guys to get checked out. Have your -- you know, call your pediatrician. Visit your local emergency room if you're seeing those other symptoms as well.",

Then we definitely want you to come to the ER for an evaluation. But definitely if you don't feel like -- you don't have those symptoms we want you to follow up with your pediatrician. BROWN: Yes. Is there anything else that you think is important to know about this and about COVID and just the overall concern about kids getting sick right now and the flu of course?

Definitely if you're sick stay home. Kind of don't expose young children to anyone that is sick. And most importantly, you want to make sure you're washing your hands, you're covering your cough, and your sneezes, so that you don't infect someone else.",

Johnson resigned in July after a series of scandals and then he was replaced by Liz Truss who stepped down on Thursday. Press reports say Johnson today claimed to have the minimum support among conservative party members but declined to run, saying this simply would not be the right thing to do.Meanwhile, former finance minister Rishi Sunak formally declared his candidacy today. Sunak tried to become the Conservative Party leader seven weeks ago following the departure of Boris Johnson. And Liz Truss resigned as prime minister just six weeks into her term that threw Britain into political and economic turmoil. CNN correspondent Bianca Nobilo joins us now from just outside London. So, Bianca, this is something of a surprise. Boris Johnson hastily returns to the U.K., claims to have the support he needs in parliament, gives every impression that he is all in and then pulls out tonight. What changed? [18:40:05] BIACA NOBILO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It is a surprise. And I hear that the members of parliament who were backing him publicly are privately pretty angry at this about face. The former prime minister returned back from his holiday in the Caribbean. All of the indicators were that he was taking running very seriously. He was hitting the phones along with his closest confidantes in parliament trying to garner support. Hit that magic number of 100 MPs which would get him through to the next stage of the leadership contest. But then he obviously had a change of heart on Sunday. So why might that be if he did in fact have the numbers? It could be simply that he realized that even if he met the threshold that was needed to stand in this leadership contest that it simply wouldn't be possible for him to govern. Let's remember that when he had to step down as prime minister 148 of his own lawmakers had voted against him in a vote of no confidence in his leadership. Around 60 of his ministers resigned saying things like they thought he was unfit for office. The very thought to a lot of those people that he would be returning just mere months later was an anathema. Some of them threatened to resign, some of them would say they'd rather a general election than having to serve Boris Johnson again. So perhaps he just looked at this reality and thought I'd get nothing done and that isn't the kind of premiership that he dreamed of.",

The economy is in a tailspin with soaring inflation, into the double-digits now, 10.1 percent were the latest figures. People in this country are worried about being able to afford their heating and their food bills this winter, not to mention the fact that there is a war on the continent of Europe.And Rishi Sunak would be taking the helm of a party that has never been more divided. It might even be ungovernable. So that would be an incredibly difficult job for the most shrewd, experienced, charismatic, talented politician. And Sunak is quite untested but he does seem like he is the man to beat. You see Boris Johnson was a problematic and in some people's view toxic known quantity. Rishi Sunak is a known quantity but less problematic. Less toxic. He is the lesser evil for a lot within the Conservative -- a lot of people within the Conservative Party. So he seems to have the best shot. An outside chance would be Penny Mordaunt, somebody else who's declared. She was the first ever female secretary of state for defense here in the United Kingdom but her candidacy looks unlikely. So I think Britain is looking at a coronation of Rishi Sunak at some point this week. He might not even have to contest against anybody else because he does seem to be gathering a lot of momentum and he seems to be the lawmakers' favorite in parliament. Whether he'll be able to unite the party, get the country on course, and pass any big legislation through parliament, is an entirely different question. They are in deep trouble indeed, Pamela.",
