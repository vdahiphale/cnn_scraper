And essentially not just the frustration now, but the disbelief that the U.S. government either can't or won't explain who or what is behind this mystery. DHS, FBI, the agency is really leading this investigation maintaining that at this point, everything that they've seen, they have not concluded, or they've been able to conclude that this does not present any sort of safety threat.

I have a lot of trouble believing that the federal government is doing enough here because there is a near total absence of relevant and significant information. And that gap in disclosure is causing or contributing to the alarm that people are feeling. There is technology that can be deployed to follow these drones, to trace them. The Robin System of drone specific radar can provide answers to a lot of the questions that have been asked, but there's no evidence that the federal government has been using it so far. And so these kinds of assurances from the secretary of Homeland Security fall flat. They leave people with even greater alarm. And the agency that's really responsible for our airspace, the FAA, has been completely silent. And what we need here is not only a focus on the present problem, but also more broadly on the system, the regiment of scrutiny and oversight itself, which right now is really lacking. If you want to fly from New York to Washington, D.C., even in a small private plane, a two-seater, you need to file a flight plan. The same ought to be true of some of these bigger drones that are used commercially and even recreationally, and the registration requirements, the altitude restrictions, the certificate mandates all need to be upgraded because there are now a plethora of these drones out there, and they are dangerous, not just because they represent potential surveillance and intrusion on privacy, but also at airports and other sensitive locations.

Put aside the reports of sexual assault and alcohol abuse. His managerial incompetence is shown by his running two nonprofits, veterans organizations, into the ground, and potentially his exploiting financially those nonprofits. So there is a background check investigation underway by the FBI. My hope is that it will be made available. Theres a danger that the Trump administration may withhold that FBI investigation. I call on Donald Trump to provide that FBI background check, complete and unredacted, to the Armed Services Committee, so we can really consider all of the potential downsides of Hegseth's nomination.

Number two, it establishes probable cause for the crimes of which you're wanted in new York State. And number three, it's your identity. And so all that does is delay the process, but ultimately, he'd be here. Now, why the court appearance? If his going to waive, it has to be a knowing and intelligent waiver. The judge has to ask, sir, you know what your rights are? You understand those rights? You're waiving your right to go to New York.
