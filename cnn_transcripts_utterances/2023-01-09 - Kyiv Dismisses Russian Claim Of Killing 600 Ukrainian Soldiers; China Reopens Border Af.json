They're calling the claim simply nonsense.Senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman is live in Kramatorsk, Ukraine. This is where the attack is supposed to have happened. But, Ben, you're there on the ground. Are there any signs of a huge Russian there recently, or is this Russian disinformation for a domestic audience?",

Now, this is one of the sites of those explosions. Apparently, an S- 300 anti-aircraft missile was used here. Now, right in front of me, this is a high school -- a high school that hasn't been in session, essentially, for months, basically going back to the beginning of the war. Now, our crew went inside just hours later. What they saw was desks and blackboards, and whatnot -- lots of broken glass. But no sign whatsoever of any casualties. Now, if we just step over here, my cameraman Tom Nicholson will show you it's a very large crater. Now what we see are some municipal workers are inside throwing debris down into this pit. But Ukrainian officials have flatly denied it. Now, it's believed the Russian strike was in revenge for a Ukrainian strike on a vocational school in Makiivka in the Donetsk, which even according to Russian sources, official sources killed 89 of their soldiers. The Ukrainians saying as many as 400 were killed in that strike and 300 wounded. But as I said, all evidence points to a baseless claim by the Russians -- an attempt to save face --",

      "sentences": "Yes, Christine, it depends on who you ask. Officials here obviously insist they did this proactively because they have always adopted a quote-unquote scientific approach to the evolving pandemic. But others would certainly point to those widespread protests against an increasingly unsustainable zero-COVID policy back in November. Those protests, at the very minimum, providing the leadership with a political off-ramp from the policy.But the way they did it -- that sudden U-turn without much preparation both in terms of medical resources but also in terms of government messaging has resulted in surging infections and deaths, both which not being reflected in official government data. And that lack of transparency obviously being noted both around the world but here at home as well. That's why the reopening border is actually being met with very mixed feelings from the public. Some welcoming it with open arms, especially those separated from loved ones for a long time, and also those with desire or need to travel abroad. But others, after being told their government state media for three years how scary the virus was and how disastrous other governments' response had been, remain very skeptical, very -- even very angry with the reopening. But the biggest concern right now is actually with domestic travel with millions of Chinese again on the move to go home ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday. Remember, this is the first time this has happened in three years and with likely, consequences being the virus being brought from wealthy cities to the vast countryside where the medical resources are very much lacking. So that is potentially going to cause even more deadly consequences with global implications -- Christine.",
