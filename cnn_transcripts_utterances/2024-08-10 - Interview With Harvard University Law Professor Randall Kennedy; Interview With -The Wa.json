And it has animated American politics dating back centuries. With me to break down what a Kamala Harris presidency means for racism in America is Harvard law professor and racial politics experts, Randall Kennedy. Randall Kennedy, welcome to the program. And it's notable that in your 2021 book, \"Say It Out Loud\", you wrote this. \"I do not expect in the remainder of my life to glimpse, much less enjoy, a progressive racial promised land. And here we are. Now we have Kamala Harris, a biracial woman, half African-American, half-Indian, who was named the new Democratic presidential nominee to challenge Donald Trump. I'm wondering, given this, does that progressive racial promise land that you said now looked out of reach, is it once again in reach in your view?",

And obviously, we have the element of social media as well. And Nicholas, let me start with you. Because here you have Elon Musk weighing in to what's unfolding on the streets in the U.K. and saying, \"civil war is inevitable\". That was met with a response from the U.K. prime minister's office saying there was no justification for these comments. What do you make of it?

I think they labeled roughly 300,000 posts and that it significantly decreased the spread of that type of information. That's obviously changed as Elon Musk has bought this company. You know, it's private. He's running it. He's shaping the activities.

You know, Musk is now viewed as this edge lord (ph) figure of the right, but this is a man who has done more to combat climate change than any other inventor in America. He clearly, as he said, I believe it was in the Lex Fridman Podcast, he talked about Trump's masculinity, anger, standing up for America, but I wouldn't be surprised if Musk's politics flip back. And I also think some of Musk's regard for Trump was due to his tension with Biden, over Biden's comments about electric cars and excluding Tesla. So it's very, very complicated.

In the U.S., you have the Democrats and the Republicans, right? You mentioned that I won elections with just a short margin, as could happen in any country. But 1.5 percent of difference. And look what I did. Look what I did. [11:49:44] MADURO: Immediately I called upon the mayors, governors of the opposition. We met in December twice; in January, we were drafting a plan. The plan was ready to fight crime, drug trafficking, a global plan. And all of a sudden, there was this call to go against the rule of law, a coup d'etat, the right-wing extremists, and this postponed all the plans that we had as plans through national dialogue that I convened.",
