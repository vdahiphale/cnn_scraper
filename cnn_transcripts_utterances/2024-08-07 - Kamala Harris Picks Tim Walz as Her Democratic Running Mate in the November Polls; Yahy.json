Uncertainty and fear grip the Middle East as Israel prepares for a retaliatory strike from Iran and the U.S. and its allies race to avert an all-out war.

And now Tim Walz is officially U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate. His meteoric rise thanks in part to his description of Donald Trump as weird, a criticism which seems to have stuck.The pair took to the stage in Philadelphia for their first rally since the election. Today, they will attend a rally in Wisconsin and Michigan as part of a campaign swing through several battleground states. Walz is a former teacher and football coach who spent more than two decades in the Army National Guard. He served 12 years in Congress before he was elected governor. Well, more now on the Democratic ticket's big debut from CNN's MJ Lee in Philadelphia. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MJ LEE, CNN SR. WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: This was an incredibly raucous and energized political rally, the first formal introduction of the Harris-Walz ticket. And we saw from this evening how much the Harris campaign is going to be leaning into that contrast between Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, both of them as they took the stage, really talking about the biography of Tim Walz, as they were trying to introduce him to so many people around the country that don't have a great sense of who he even is, his Midwestern roots, the fact that he was born in Nebraska, the fact that he was a football coach and a teacher and served in the Army National Guard. These are all factors that the Harris campaign is hoping will make him an appealing person on the Democratic ticket, particularly in the critical blue wall states. Here's a little bit of how the vice president introduced her new running mate in Philadelphia. Take a listen. KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: To those who know him best, Tim is more than a governor. To his wife, Gwen, he is a husband. To his kids, Hope and Gus, he is a dad. To his fellow veterans, he is Sergeant Major Walz. (APPLAUSE)",

Take a listen to that. GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN), U.S. VICE-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He mocks our laws. He sows chaos and division. And that's to say nothing of his record as president.

And one of the things that people said about him is that he's very authentic. He is supposed to bring back some of the working class Democrats who voted for Reagan in the '80s and then voted for Trump in 2016 and '20. If he can bring some of those people back into the fold, he'll have done a great job for the Democrats. But he's got a very buoyant personality and he was introduced at a rally that just was wonderfully successful.

The same way that Donald Trump doubled down by bringing a hard-right conservative vice president onto the hard-right Republican ticket. And so a lot of times people say, oh, there's no contrast. There's no reason to vote. There is a contrast this time around. There's going to be major differences between these two parties and voters will have a choice.",

Harris and Walz have gotten Trump off center stage. They've shown that they have this kind of pizzazz, kind of appeal to voters. And so for years, Donald Trump benefited from an enthusiasm gap. His supporters were very enthusiastic about him. Biden's lukewarm. I think this may be the closing of the enthusiasm gap, maybe even the reversal of it.

Yahya Sinwar was already the militant group's leader in Gaza and one of the main targets in Israel's war against Hamas.It's believed Sinwar has often been consulted in the ceasefire and hostage release talks, even while he's been hiding in the vast network of tunnels beneath Gaza. Sinwar takes over from Ismail Haniyeh, who was assassinated in Tehran last week. Both Hezbollah and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, two of the main allies of Hamas, have welcomed the news of Sinwar's new role. Well meanwhile, Israel and Hezbollah intensified their cross-border fighting on Tuesday. Israeli officials say Hezbollah drones injured several people in northern Israel and a Hezbollah rocket barrage caused several fires. The IDF says it struck a building in southern Lebanon used by Hezbollah, killing five people. Israel has been bracing for further retaliation from both Hezbollah and Iran for the assassinations of key militant figures last week. The leader of Hezbollah on Tuesday promised a response is coming and Tehran has made similar threats.

Sinwar is also the military head of Hamas. So this makes him even more of a target for Israel than he was before. But he'll also take a more central role in efforts to reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal. Where do you see those efforts going since they were recently derailed and what's Sinwar's likely next move, do you think?EL-GAMAL: Right. Well, this -- this was a really fascinating move. It was an unexpected move to have Sinwar, you know, suddenly be vaulted to this position of both the head of the military and the political arms of Hamas, which have traditionally been separate. Sinwar's history is quite different from the previous leader of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, who he just replaced. You know, he's someone who has lived his entire life in Gaza. He was not like Sinwar or Khaled Mishal, who had been exiled and sort of living the good life in a lot of ways in exile. He, his parents and grandparents were -- were living in what is now Ashkelon in Israel before 1948. He was born in the Khan Younis refugee camp and he had been imprisoned since the age of 25, spent 11 years in military in prison in Israel. So someone who is hardened, someone who has been on the ground for all of it. And so one thing that his ascension does to this leadership position, to this total leadership position, it kind of brings it closer to people in Gaza who have been suffering, you know, in over the last 10 months, unable to leave Gaza. It -- it sort of removes that criticism that Ismail Haniyeh and others liked him faced of being too removed, too comfortable from the suffering going on in Gaza. So that's just one point I wanted to -- to bring out in terms of the negotiations. Now, he has always been involved in the negotiations way back from when he was in prison. He had always been involved in what was happening negotiations wise, prisoner exchange wise between Israel and Hamas. He was involved notably in the negotiations that -- that released the then-captive soldier Gilad Shalit back to Israel and that resulted in his own release from Israeli prison. So that just gives you a sense of how much he's been involved in these kinds of negotiations for years and will continue to be moving forward.",

A Pakistani man is accused of having ties to the Iranian government. He was charged on Tuesday by the Justice Department for looking to carry out political assassinations here in the United States.According to an American official, FBI investigators believe that Trump and other current as well as former U.S. government officials were the intended targets of the plot, and security by the U.S. government was increased around them. The man's name is Asif Merchant. He's 46 years old and was arrested on July 12, trying to leave the United States. There's no evidence that this Pakistani man had any connection to the shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks, who did try to assassinate Trump on July 13. He was then killed by Secret Service. Merchant was allegedly looking to carry out killings in late August and in September. That's according to the court documents that just came out on Tuesday. After arriving in the U.S. in April, he met with people he believed were hit men but were actually undercover law enforcement. According to the court documents, Merchant wanted to target people who, quote, \"hurt Pakistan and the world, the Muslim world.\" Now, this adds to a list of Iranian plots, a growing list, to kill Trump and some of those around him in his administration in retribution for the killing of the head of the Quds Force, General Qasem Soleimani, in early 2020.
