That's how Kamala Harris is boiling down Donald Trump's campaign, in the final three weeks of the 2024 election, as the former President is refusing to commit to a peaceful transfer of power, again. Senator Bernie Sanders will join me live. And Donald Trump is not denying Bob Woodward's new reporting that he has spoken with Russian President Putin, numerous times since he left office. But he says, if he did, this is what it means. We'll talk about it with The New York Times' Maggie Haberman. And the election is happening right now, before our very eyes. CNN's tally shows that well over 5 million people have already cast their ballots. One of the most critical battlegrounds that we'll be watching, on Election Night, actually shattered records today. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Three weeks from tonight, polls will be closing, votes will be counted, states will be called, and we could know who will be the next President of the United States. Or we may not. A nail-biter is playing out as one of the candidates, tonight, is again refusing to commit to a peaceful transfer of power. Donald Trump's opponent, tonight, is unloading on him about that, and his closing message in this campaign that has been full of bluster, falsehoods and a fondness for dictators. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S., (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Donald Trump through his -- his -- his way of trying to name-call and demean and divide, tries to project as though those things are a sign of strength, when in fact the man is really quite weak. He's weak. It's a sign of weakness that you want to please dictators, and seek their flattery and favor. It's a sign of weakness that you would demean America's military and America's service members. It's a sign of weakness that you don't have the courage to stand up for the Constitution of the United States and the principles upon which it stands. This man is weak and he is unfit.

Now, I go all over the country. I can tell you, in my own State of Vermont, and wherever I go, people are talking about the housing crisis. And it's not only 600,000 people who are homeless. It's that people are paying 40 percent, 50 percent, 60 percent of their limited incomes for housing. Kamala is talking about building 3 million units of affordable and lower-income housing, desperately needed. And I will also tell you, I talked to working parents. It is expensive today to bring up a kid. And when she's talking about expanding and making permanent, the Child Tax Credit, man, that's going to make life easier for a whole lot of working families in this country. And I was especially pleased that last week -- because this is something I've been working on for a long time. She is now talking and will implement an expansion of Medicare to cover home health care. Kaitlan, I can't tell you how many people I talk to, who have elderly people in their homes, or disabled people in their homes, who want to stay in their homes. They don't want to go to a nursing home. But they can't afford the help that they need to take care of that individual. So, expanding Medicare, to include home health care, is a huge step forward.

I happen to believe that on domestic issues, President Biden has probably been the most progressive president, since Franklin Delano Roosevelt. And I think he's done a lot of good work, on a lot of areas, which I think he's not getting the kind of credit that he deserves. And Kamala Harris has been at his side throughout that whole process, and she deserves the credit.I mean, I think it's no great secret that the area that I and a lot of folks do have disagreements with, in the Biden administration, is the war in Gaza. I happen to think that both Netanyahu, and Sinwar, who is the leader of Hamas, are war criminals. And what started this war with a terrible terrorist attack against Israel. And now, Netanyahu has gone to war, all-out war against the Palestinian people, killing 42,000, two-thirds of whom are women, children and the elderly, injuring a 100,000, now stopping humanitarian aid so that people are starving there. I think that is not where American money should be going. And I don't think another nickel should go to Netanyahu, so long as he continues those policies. That's my view. But I would have hoped that Kamala might have diverted a little bit from the Biden administration on that. COLLINS: OK. So, you think that that should have been a course correction she could have offered there. I got to ask you, though, because you have been out on the campaign trail so much, in the last several days. When Vice President Harris has been talking about her middle-class background, which she said tonight, I'm repeating this a lot because people need to get to know me better. One thing that she has mentioned is working at McDonald's, when she was in college in her early 20s. Trump has repeatedly accused her of lying about it, because, I guess she didn't talk about it enough, for him, before. And CNN is being told tonight, we're reporting -- well, I just -- let me -- let me ask you this, because we're being told that Trump is going to visit a McDonald's in Pennsylvania, and work the fry cooker. That's according to a source to our Kristen Holmes. What do you make of that, Senator?",

She had 10,000 -- 15,000 people out. It was covered. It was live-streamed, covered by all the media. And Donald Trump alone perceived that there was nobody there, it was artificial intelligence.

You're seeing OB-GYNs decide to get out. You're seeing insurance costs go up. These are all things that are getting in the way. And so, women are having this problem.

Now, this was symbolic, more than anything, given those roads have not been used in years.But this is all coming at a really important moment, and in the wake of escalating rhetoric between those two nations. As North Korea's dictator, Kim Jong Un, is threatening to use nuclear weapons to destroy South Korea, after South Korea's President Yoon, warned that the North will face the end of its regime, if it tries to do so. My source tonight is The Washington Post columnist, Josh Rogin. And Josh, this is really interesting, because North Korea has spent months, trying to fortify it's already heavily-armed border. Obviously, there are about 30,000 -- 28,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea. I just wonder what you read into this move by North Korea, on top of everything that we've been seeing lately.",

And now, that's no longer the case.And by blowing up the roads, he's literally blowing up the connections, the last remaining connections he has with the South. This means that North Korea is no longer trying to unify with the South. They're looking towards other actors for their future. They're looking towards Russia. They're looking towards China. They're looking towards Iran. They're not looking towards Seoul anymore, and they're definitely not looking towards the United States.",

And this has implications not just for Ukraine, but all over the world. The transfer of high technology from Russia to North Korea. The transfer of munitions from North Korea to Russia. Both countries are ramping up production for what they think will be a long struggle, militarily, against the West, in conjunction with Iran and China, by the way.
