Complicating what Israel has promised will be a devastating response to the Hamas' attacks. The Palestinian Ministry of Health says that the death toll there is at least 370. And as Israel has massed forces and continued airstrikes ahead of a likely ground assault, Hamas has called for regional conflagration. In the Lebanon, Hezbollah launched a token attack on Israeli forces who responded in kind.

Appreciate it.Well, at the United Nations, the Security Council has just wrapped up its emergency meeting as the fighting continues between Israel and Hamas. The Deputy U.S. Ambassador strongly condemned the attack by Hamas and called the current situation a very difficult time. Earlier, Israel's ambassador to the U.N. said his country's suffering ruthless terrorist attacks and referred to Saturday's assault as Israel's 9/11. Our Senior U.N. Correspondent Richard Roth joins me now. So, Richard, we've heard international condemnation from many leaders around the world, but what can we realistically expect here from this Security Council emergency meeting? RICHARD ROTH, CNN SENIOR U.N. CORRESPONDENT: Well, the one hour, 45- minute session is over. The U.S. said afterwards that it really wasn't counting on a statement. There are still major divisions, especially on the Middle East. But he was happy that, as Robert Wood was happy, that several countries spoke out against the actions of Hamas. The two face-off ambassadors, one from Israel, one from the Palestinians, spoke before the council meeting, giving their issue a strong pitch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GILAD ERDAN, ISRAEL AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.: Look at this grandmother being forced to hold a Hamas terrorist rifle as he takes a picture with her. This is inhumane. Inhumane. Mothers and their babies, as well as babies separated from their mothers were brutally taken hostage. RIYAD MANSOUR, PALESTINIAN OBSERVER TO THE U.N.: Israel expects and demands political and military support while advancing goals that are fundamentally at odds with international legitimacy and consensus. Its policies are an assault on our humanity. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But they demonstrated that they have all this.But one simple thing, it's not a rocket science, is the hand gliders, the motorized hand gliders that were so successful yesterday in penetrating Israeli territory and getting into Israeli neighborhoods and capturing Israelis and killing and et cetera. So it's a -- it's very sort of asymmetric to see Hamas as a militant terrorist organization succeeding on the battlefield with one of the world's strongest military establishments. Now, I think there are many reasons I mentioned, I think the timing of this, but one thing is that I think Hamas and its supporters proceed that there's a weakness in Israeli society now because of the major confrontation within Israel between the right-wing extremist government ministers and Bibi Netanyahu's cabinet and the more secular sectors of Israeli society. It's been going on in months, as you know. So the Israeli government is not perceived to be a unified force. I think that's one factor. Another factor, I think, is that with this government -- it's plausible that attention was taken away from the southern border, Israel's southern border, with Gaza and military assets of the IDF concentrated more on the West Bank and protecting settlers and the settlement enterprise. So I think that's another factor. And the other one is the regional developments. The so-called expansion of the Abraham Accords and whether or not there's a geopolitical game being played here to stymie that from going forward.",

      "sentences": "Yes, we've been able to see in the past 20 minutes or so, maybe 30 minutes, a couple of missiles that were fired out of Gaza that weren't intercepted immediately. If they're fired towards this area, they're intercepted super quickly.If they're fired up the coast towards Ashkelon, we can see those interceptions. So there were a few missiles that were fired, it appears, intercepted, fired, it appears towards central Israel. Not as many as Hamas is claiming. But the missiles that were fired towards Ashkelon, absolutely, we saw the Iron Dome intercepting those missiles. Now, we are aware that some or one of those missiles may have impacted in Ashkelon. And that's Hamas's tactics to fire a big cluster of rockets, to try to penetrate and at least get a couple of the rockets past the Iron Dome, which defends system, which tries to intercept all those incoming missiles. So that's what we've seen. So from where we are here, Gaza is literally just over that -- over the hill up here, over the horizon there. And as soon as you have those rockets fired out and the intercepts taking place, then we heard Israeli jet fighter activity overhead, a helicopter, a gunship, we could hear that overhead as well, though. There was more intense drone activity going on. So when Hamas puts out rockets, you not only have that defensive shield springing into action, which we heard, but also there is an effort by Israel to get eyes on those launch sites to see if there's anything, anybody that they can -- they can target there. It's cat and mouse, I mean, Hamas and the Israeli Defense Force have been chasing each other on rocket attacks for over a decade now. So both sides know what the other is going to do and Hamas will come out at night, under the cover of darkness and hope that that's an opportunity to get some of its missiles through. I think the big takeaway here is that these salvos of missiles we're seeing tonight are not as big as the salvos last night and certainly nowhere in comparison to the huge salvos of missiles that were fired on the -- when this offensive operation by Hamas began.",

We could see that interceptor missiles from iron dome intercepting as those rockets were coming out of the northern end of Gaza, shooting them down before they could get through to their targets. It seems that this is the way that the night is going. This night is going to operate. I'm hearing fighter jets again in the air. You know the situation sort of goes through a lull, it goes quiet, then there's a salvo of rockets, then the interceptors fire off and then you hear the jets overhead again with the potential for explosions in Gaza following that. There's really forces trying to figure out if they can see or pinpoint, and I'm hearing a helicopter in the distance now as well, if they can pinpoint where those rockets were fired from in Gaza. That's the mission. What you're seeing here at the moment is the police here are moving back in. It was only less than 24 hours ago they took back control of the police station here and stood up some police officers here, turning up here to begin to sort of re-establish physical presence around the police station here again.",
