I'm Christiane Amanpour in New York this week.It is an uneasy time here in the United States as the fate of the country, and in fact, much of the world hangs to a great extent in the balance, just months away from yet another Biden-Trump matchup. President Biden hopes that his strong commitment to democracy and his record on the economy, climate, and women's rights will win out. And he hopes to overcome dissent in his own party that's mounting over the war in Gaza. Every week, more and more Democrats are expressing frustration with American policy. Some heavyweights, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, are now even joining the call for U.S. to stop arms transfers to Israel. And of course, protesters continue to mount what is really a growing peace movement. Senator Bernie Sanders has been one of the loudest voices on this issue. At 82 years old, he manages to be the voice of young liberals and many others. And he warns that if Biden doesn't change tack on the Israel war and doesn't expand his economic policy for working families at home, he could lose in November.

He boasts, that he appointed three right-wing Supreme Court justices, who overturned Roe v. Wade.

You have got a working class which is really hurting, 60 percent of our people living paycheck to paycheck. You have got people all over America who cannot afford the rising costs of housing. You have a health care system which is broken and dysfunctional. We pay twice as much per capita for health care as people of any other country, and yet 85 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured. Our childcare system is a disaster. People don't have pensions. So we have enormous problems. Bottom line is, you have got a country and an economy today that is working really, really, really good for billionaires and the 1 percent, not working for the middle class or the working class of this country. And the president understands that. But he's got to get out in front and say, look, this is my agenda. We're going to raise the minimum wage to a living wage. We're going to make it easier for workers to support unions. We're going to do away with college -- with student debt. And he's making some progress on that.

So 30 years, the Irish taoiseach, I mean he could have stuck in a fairly traditional Irish position on everything, but he didn't and that we each kind of liberated each other.
