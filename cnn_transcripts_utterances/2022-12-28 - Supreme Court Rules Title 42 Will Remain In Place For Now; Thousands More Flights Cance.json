It ultimately means that this authority which was invoked at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic will remain in effect for several more months.The White House responded to the order saying that they will comply with it but they also pointed the finger at congress saying that it is on them to pass immigration reform. They also made their position clear saying \"Title 42\" is a public health measure, not an immigration enforcement measure and it should not be extended indefinitely. Now immigrant advocates and groups have been trying to disseminate information to migrants as to what the Supreme Court said on Tuesday.

For example, He says, I have a problem with my spine. It is clear what one has to do to make the problem worse, keep me immobile as much as possible, making the point that they are using his health as a way to pressure him. He said that he asked to see a doctor, he had to file a request for that it took a month and a half the person arrived. He wasn't allowed to see his diagnosis. He then had to file another request for his medical records. During that time he was also he says injected with an unknown substance. He asked what it was and was sort of given a vague answer that it was B vitamins, but it did nothing to help him. He says he'll continue to fight if necessary, in the courts.

All travelers from China will be tested for the virus upon entering Japan and India, and will have to quarantine if they test positive. India has expanded the restriction beyond just the mainland China. Also, requiring anyone coming from Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, or Thailand to undergo testing. Italian officials are also testing every traveler from China who comes through the Milan Malpensa International Airport in the north.Well, the change in China's restrictions also means some Chinese citizens will finally be able to return home after years away due to the pandemic. CNN's Selina Wang has more. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover):  The world's harshest quarantine is no more. As COVID sweeps through China, the country is scrapping quarantines for inbound travelers from January 8th and promising to gradually restart outbound tourism. Since the start of the pandemic, China has severely limited who can go in and out of the country. Drastically cutting the number of flights and forcing all incoming arrivals into government facilities. I went through multiple quarantines in China this year, lasting as long as 21 days. There's no choice in where you go or what room you get. Once the doors closed. You can only open them for COVID tests and food pickups. Workers sprayed disinfectant in the hallways every few hours. Food deliver is not allowed. But breakfast, lunch, and dinner are part of quarantine fees. All of that is now soon going away. It's a huge relief for Chinese nationals living overseas like this woman in New York City.",

Fever and cold medicine are nearly impossible to get at drugstores across the country. Antivirals are also extremely hard to get. But in a major move, Beijing has announced it's going to start distributing Paxlovid to community health centers in the coming days. So, there is chaos and confusion. But with zero-COVID in the past, finally there is light at the end of the tunnel. Selina Wang, CNN, Beijing. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
