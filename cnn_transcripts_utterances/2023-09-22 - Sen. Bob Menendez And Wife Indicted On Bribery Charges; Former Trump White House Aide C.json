Plus, the very latest on Ophelia now a huge tropical storm and heading for the East Coast with hurricane watches already in force. We begin tonight with breaking news. Phil Murphy, New Jersey's Democratic governor is now calling a New Jersey senior US senator, Bob Menendez to step down. It is the latest blow after the latest indictment for Menendez who chairs the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee and yes, I did say latest indictment because Senator Menendez has been federally indicted before the last time around, the government failed to secure convictions. The allegations this time are remarkable and came with pictures. Authorities say the senator traded his influence for hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, gold bars, and a Mercedes convertible. His wife is accused of working in the words of the indictment, to introduce Egyptian intelligence and military officials to Menendez for the purpose of establishing and solidifying a \"corrupt agreement\" with an American Egyptian businessman. Senator Menendez today notified Majority Leader Chuck Schumer that he is stepping down from his committee chairmanship. Schumer for his part said Menendez \"has a right to due process and a fair trial.\" All of this comes of course in the middle of Republican efforts to show that the Justice Department is tilted against conservatives, with Exhibit A for them being two federal indictments of the former president, a case that might be harder to make now the latest two big indictments from the Biden DOJ or of the powerful Senate committee chairman and the president's son, Hunter. We're going to take that up in a moment with former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe. First, CNN's Kara Scannell. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And the reason why is because of what she was saying, right? We can remember the things that we didn't know before Cassidy Hutchinson testified that Donald Trump knew that there were weapons in the crowd during his Ellipse speech, and so when he said, let's march over to the Capitol, he knew that those people had weapons, right? That was what we learned because of Cassidy Hutchinson. We learned that Donald Trump lunged forward when he was in the car, after his Ellipse speech to the Secret Service driver because of Cassidy Hutchinson. And so that day when she was rehearsing, getting ready for her debut as a witness live in one of our hearings, she was really nervous. And I mean, I can understand why. Cassidy and I are of similar ages, which is why I was with her that day, but I was so impressed with how she came across during that hearing.

The news comes the same day that Ukraine launched one of its most audacious attacks yet, a direct strike on the headquarters of Russia's Black Sea fleet in Crimea. Our Fred Pleitgen spoke with the commander leading Ukraine's counteroffensive about that attack and the war ahead. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL (voice-over): Smoke billowing from Russia's Black Sea Fleet headquarters in Sevastopol. Moscow blaming Ukrainian launched cruise missiles, Kyiv only confirming they hit the building. I sat down with the commanding general for Ukraine's counteroffensive in the south, Oleksandr Tarnovsky and he tells me strikes like these are invaluable for his troops. BRIG. GEN. OLEKSANDR TARNOVSKY, UKRAINIAN ARMED FORCE (through translator): A destroyed commander means a destroyed command link. And if there is no command, then there are no coordinated actions. Hitting infrastructure like factories, bases, warehouses containing weapons is also a factor for victory. PLEITGEN (voice-over): In the past weeks alone, the Ukrainians say they've hit a Russian ship, a submarine, an airbase, and a surface to air missile system in occupied Crimea. Still, Ukraine's president faces skepticism both from many Republican lawmakers and the public about the U.S.'s continued support for Ukraine. Tarnovsky asking for patience. TARNOVSKY (through translator): We have one goal, liberation of our territories. However hard it is, we will keep on working. And I want to thank even the skeptics. Their criticism also influences our task success. PLEITGEN (voice-over): It's been a slow grind for the Ukrainians on the southern front. Progress, so far, incremental. But the U.S. has cautioned time might be running out as fall progresses, making the earth here soggy and movement difficult. (on-camera): How much do you think that you can achieve before the winter sets in? How far do you think your forces can get realistically? TARNOVSKY (through translator): The weather can be a serious obstacle during an advance, but considering how we move forward mostly without using vehicles, I don't think the weather will heavily influence the counteroffensive. PLEITGEN (voice-over): General Tarnovsky says he remains optimistic that Ukraine's counteroffensive will be a success, especially if Ukraine continues its campaign targeting Russian forces in the rear, like Crimea.

The Russians claiming that five of the cruise missiles, as they put it, that were fired towards that headquarters had been shot down. But, of course, if we see some of the video that came out later, it does appear as though at least two of those cruise missiles did hit that headquarters.
