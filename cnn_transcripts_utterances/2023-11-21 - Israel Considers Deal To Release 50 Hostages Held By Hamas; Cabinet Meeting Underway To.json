      "sentences": "We are monitoring breaking news. Right now, the full Israeli cabinet is meeting behind closed doors, going over a deal that could bring home dozens of hostages taken by Hamas. The well-being of those hostages potentially hanging on this decision. It comes after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met earlier today with key officials about the negotiations. The deal would end the torment of so many of these hostages and their families who've been demanding their safe return for more than a month now. Let's get the latest from CNN. Chief National Security Correspondent Alex Marquardt has been tracking these developments and the makings of this deal along the way. Alex, how soon can we see a deal announced?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think, Boris, that could be actually quite soon. We believe that the ball is in Israel's court, that they are going through their legal and political process to approve this deal, that on the Hamas side of things, it has been approved. So, an expectation, once all is said and done, is that Israel would announce that they have agreed to this deal, but it would also be announced by Qatar. And they have been the key mediator on this because they have a direct conversation, direct line into Hamas.They also speak with the U.S. and Israel as well. So, these are the broad strokes of what we expect the deal to entail. An immediate group of 50 people being released from Hamas custody, all civilians, all women and children. This would take, of course, over 4 to 5 days, during which time there would be a pause. The fighting would stop. Israel would stop. Fighting against Hamas. Hamas would stop firing against Israel. In theory, the guns would fall silent. Now, what's also interesting is this will be a swap if this happens, in that for the 50 women and children who we understand are Israeli or dual national, so they're all Israelis, but some have other passports as well, around 150 Palestinians would be released at the same time from Israeli prisons. There is a possibility, Boris, that if all of this goes according to plan over this 4- or 5-day period, the pause could be extended and more of these hostages could be released by Hamas, and in turn, more of these Palestinian prisoners could be released by Israel.",

      "sentences": "The key, if it goes according to plan, a tenuous proposition, right? You and I, from early on, were trying to figure out exactly how many hostages were being held by Hamas. And as the stories played out, we've learned that it's not just Hamas holding onto hostages, but other rival factions, potentially even criminal enterprises. What do we know about the exact number of how many folks are being held in Gaza right now?",

      "sentences": "The numbers have been all over the place for the course of the year. The past few weeks, the fluctuations have changed as the Israeli authorities and other countries like the United States have figured out, essentially, who is still missing. So, the number that has been settled on right now is just shy of 240 hostages in Gaza. It's 237. Again, it's a mix of all different kinds of nationalities. You have Israelis, you have at least 10 American citizens are missing as well. There was -- there's that three-year-old toddler who is being held. She has -- little Abigail, has American citizenship. We understand that she's going to turn 4 years old later this week on Friday.There's an expectation that she would hopefully be part of this first batch of hostages to come out again, some 50 of them. But there are also other nationalities, Nepalese and Thai. There are a lot of migrant workers from Southeast Asia who go to Israel to work. Right now, Boris, what is not being mentioned is the release of any of the men. And I think a major question is what Hamas intends to do, particularly with the Israeli men who are of fighting age. If they're not IDF soldiers, they could be reservists, in which case Hamas would almost certainly be looking to trade them for a large number of likely men in Israeli custody.",

      "sentences": "Right. So, if we see these 50 released in the coming days, this would be the third group of hostages, by far the biggest. And that is something that Israel really wants to see. They said if we are going to agree to a pause, a real stop in the fighting, that you, Hamas, have to release a large group of prisoners. That's why we believe it's going to be at least 50 in this first wave. But there have been releases already. Two, in fact. Natalie and Judith Raanan, they are American citizens. They were the first to be released by Hamas on October 20th. Yocheved Lifshitz and Nurit Cooper, older Israeli women who were released three days later on October 23rd.The way that they were released was that they were handed over by Hamas to the International Red Cross. They were then taken to the border crossing, handed over to Egyptian and Israeli forces. And then taken to doctors to get a medical checkup. It's unclear the mechanics of how we understand this latest hostage release to unfold, but it may happen in a very similar fashion.",

      "sentences": "So, there's a huge number of Palestinians who are in Israeli prisons in the West Bank, in East Jerusalem, in Israel proper. The vast majority of them are men. And again, we're not talking about the release on either side of men right now. One important note, Boris, is that of the 8,300, 3,000 are being held in what's called administrative detention, which is this in-between area where they don't know what the charges are against them. They're being held without trial. They can be held for months or even years. And that can be extended for reasons unknown to them.But the Palestinians, the ones that we're talking about right now to be released are, again, the women and children. There are, at last count, some 463 women and children who are being held by children. I mean, mainly teenagers who are under the age of 18. And those are the ones who would be released in exchange for these Hamas hostages. Again, 3 of them for every 1 to be released by Hamas. Yeah, we'll keep an eye on how it plays out. Again, the full cabinet in Israel meeting right now to discuss the details. Finalizing the deal. And potentially this swap. Alex Marquardt, thank you so much for the reporting. Of course, CNN is covering this from every angle. So, we want to take you now live to the region with CNN's Oren Liebermann, Matthew Chance and Becky Anderson, all of them live with the very latest. First, Oren, to you, we don't know exactly how Israel's government is going to vote on all of this, but there have been indications at least two far right groups of the government saying they will vote against this deal. How do you see this playing out?",

      "speaker": "OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT",
      "sentences": "Yeah, 2 of the far right groups are saying they will vote against this deal. How do you see this All right, members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government have come out against the deal, but they don't have the numbers to sink this on their own. And it's very much in Netanyahu's interest to make sure this gets across the finish line. He is well aware that he is deeply unpopular here. And if this falls apart because of his coalition, he will get even more unpopular.We have also heard from families that were in a meeting with the war cabinet yesterday. They say they were promised if it gets to this point, that it will get over the line. Ministers in the government said, once it gets to the point where it's in front of them, they will make sure that this gets approved. So, with that promise, they are more confident than they've ever been before that they will see a prisoner release here or a hostage release, I should say, announcement perhaps sometime imminently here. So, it's already gone through a couple of the stages necessary here. First, the war cabinet, which is just Netanyahu and a very few others. Then the slightly wider security cabinet, which includes other critical ministries. And now it's at the full cabinet. And that's the last step in the approval process that's necessary because of what this deal entails. And that is the release of Palestinian prisoners, which can't simply be done unilaterally by the prime minister. He needs the support of the government. And that's why this is critical. There is there is a bit more. There is then a 24-hour window in which appeals can be filed at the Supreme Court to try to stop this. So that also has to start that that clock also has to start ticking. And that starts right after the government vote, which we should expect here fairly soon given that the full cabinet is meeting right now again, that is the final stage in the process here as this moves forward to have Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as far right coalition parties coming out against it. But Boris, they don't have the numbers to make sure to stop this from going through here. The family's eagerly waiting for word. Even if they don't know who will be released, they say this is a critical first step to get that ball rolling. One hostage deal, they say, hopefully leads to many more in the near future.",
