However, we expect the conversations focused a lot on that support for Ukraine, that ongoing support for Ukraine. And the other key topic was expected to be sort of the elephant in the room and that is the prospect of another Trump presidency. We have heard the former U.S. President threaten potential NATO expulsion. We have heard him suggest that they would not protect allies who were not contributing enough to their defensive spending.So, we expect the conversations to sort of focus on how do we protect in case there are threats to the alliance. My colleague, Kylie Atwood, reported there was some discussion of a potential fund to continue supporting Ukraine. That could be worth billions of dollars. There is a proposal on the table to move this Ukraine defense contact group that is currently being led by America under the auspices of NATO. So, a lot of these ideas were expected to be discussed among these foreign ministers in Brussels to sort of safeguard the alliance against a potential new Trump presidency. I should note that this was a significant meeting in Brussels this week, because not only was it the 75th anniversary, it was also the first time that all 32 new members were there. This comes after Sweden was finally admitted into the alliance earlier this year, after months and months of delay. So, this was also a cause for celebration for the alliance to say, hey, Putin, look at this. This was a strategic failure for you. The alliance has only grown bigger. We expect the Secretary of State to speak a little later today, and we also expect him to call on Congress to further aid Ukraine, to pass that supplemental that is sitting on the table. Speaker Johnson has suggested that will come to a vote when Congress gets back next week. Rahel.",

Donald Trump's latest effort to delay his criminal hush money trial has been denied.[11:15:00] The New York judge in the case has shut down a motion to delay the trial until after the U.S. Supreme Court rules on Trump's immunity claim. Now, the judge says that Trump's team had more than enough time to ask for delay earlier. So, the trial is expected to begin on April 15. Now, while the trial in New York appears to be full steam ahead, the Florida classified documents case, less so. The judge there is facing pressure from Special Counsel Jack Smith, who has slammed her handling of the case. Joining us now to discuss this CNN Legal Analyst and Criminal Defense Attorney, Joey Jackson. Joey, we always good to have you and see you. So, tensions are pretty high in this Mar-a-Lago case, and part because of jury instructions that the judge has given to both sides, but a trial date hasn't even been set. So, can you explain for us what the issue here is? JOEY JACKSON, CNN LEGAL ANALYST, &amp; CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Absolutely. Good to be with you, Rahel. And so, what happens is first is the issue of jury instructions now because it's confusing there are so many cases. We'll take you to Mar-a-Lago. Mar-a-Lago is the case involving classified documents. Jury instructions are actually the law that the jury gets to guide them in their decision when the jury does deliberations and then they talk about guilt or innocence. Jury instructions, Rahel, are very important because they represent the law of the case. A jury is real providence. Right? Their role, their mission is to determine, what are the facts of the case? As fact finders, 12 jurors have to reach a unanimous conclusion as to guilt or innocence. In doing that, the judge instructs them as to the law, and through the jury instructions which constitute the legal instructions, which constitutes the law. Trump's team is arguing that the President, under former President Trump, under the Presidential Records Act, could, if he wished to, have taken those documents and made them personal in nature. That really contravenes, is against the Presidential Records Act because presidential records are public, not private. Moreover, the Special Counsel is saying, judge, what are you speaking of? This is trial about the Espionage Act relating to classified documents. It has nothing to do with the Presidential Records Act. So, why are we even talking about it? Furthermore, the issue in concern, Mar-a-Lago, happened two years after Trump was President. Yet and still the judge wants jury instructions to be fashioned by both parties. There is no trial date. There is no jury, and which one of the instructions would be, if the jury concludes that these classified documents were personal in nature, then there would be nothing to see here and it would lead to a quick dismissal, acquittal of the President. And so, the Special Counsel is very concerned about the judge misconstruing the law and even entertaining the notion that this could be considered the case under the Presidential Records Act, not this case, right, when it really deals with the Espionage Act, as we look at all the classified documents and boxes, and that's what all the argumentation is about in the case. And they really feel the Special Counsel, Rahel, that the judge has a clear bias towards Trump, is delaying this matter, is not making decision, and when she makes decisions, were making them in his favor, and they have just had enough. And that's what we saw really manifested in the Special Counsel's motion in which he expressed all of this frustration.",

So, I don't see that as a law. And so, I don't see how this attack would be appropriate from a legal perspective.Now, remember, Rahel, there is an election. And as a result of that election, of course, the President is going to create this narrative that everyone is out to get me. The Special Counsel is wrong. I'm right. The judge should be respected because he is on my side and doing things I wanted to do. And as a result of that, I am the one under attack. It's a terrible system. Everyone is out to get me, elect me President, and I'll end this weaponization of the Department of Justice. That's the President's narrative.",

But, CNN has had some polling that has said that if there is a conviction in a court of law against Donald Trump, that there will be significant drop off of support within his own base. And so, I think that's why you're seeing the desperation within the Donald Trump camp of trying to delay every single one of these trials until after the election.Now, politically, for the Biden campaign, this doesn't really change anything, because they have never and they should not ever count on any conviction or a court session with Trump as being part of their political strategy. But, it certainly underscores the talking point about how unfit for office he is and it reminds voters they don't have to do it.

I am told that it is going to be very tough. It is going to be very stern. And look, publicly, they are saying right now that nothing has changed. But, I suspect, Rahel, if these images continue, the horrific hospital that was bombed that you all have been covering this so incredibly well, as you should, and the outcry on the international stage about what is going on and how Israel has been so indiscriminate in their prosecution of this war, that's going to have to change.

Wade. He is the one who put in the three judges that resulted in the Supreme Court decision. And so, that is what Democrats are going to be using, not just against him, but against Republicans. And so, whatever he talks about, whether it is 15 weeks or 16 weeks, a ban is a ban is a band to women.And the problem with how Republicans talk about this is that they don't understand that every single woman who is in a situation where she might need an abortion is different. You cannot legislate the kind of healthcare that every woman might need because every situation is different. It's tragic and it's different. And this is what Republicans do not understand. And so, again, if he says that, this is going to continue to be political kryptonite for him and for Republicans all across the board who just want draconian decisions on this and to keep women from having the power to make decisions about their own bodies.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (R) AND CURRENT U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE (R): Too big to rig. (CROWD CHANTING) TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A sizzling insider trading scandal is rocking the business deal that brought Donald Trump's Truth Social to the public market with billions at stake. Simply put, two players in a company that helped Trump strike that deal pleaded guilty to securities fraud, admitting they illegally used secret information to make millions for themselves and some friends, even as the stock's value for regular investors has soared and sunk by the day.

Hopefully, they have a wonderful time. Hopefully, all the facilities are up to spec, and they'll tell other people about it, share on social media.
