By contrast, Harris's speech was squarely focused on the economy.Second thing, Trump's facts weren't true. Harris's were. Let me give a simple example. Both talked about the cost of living. Trump claimed falsely that the price of bacon is four or five times higher. It's nothing like that. Harris claimed, seriously, that bread was 50 percent more expensive. It is. And I think that matters because serious problems deserve serious analysis, serious facts. And the third is that Trump's policies, promised policies, were neither promises nor policies. You ask him about inflation. He says, I promise to get inflation down. You say, how? And he said in his speech, I will write an executive order telling my cabinet secretaries to come back to me with every idea they have about how to reduce inflation. That's not a policy.

And I think there are good parts and bad parts.Look, here's the crux of that housing problem. We've got too many people who need houses and too few houses. There's good parts and bad parts of the Harris plan. The part I don't like is if you subsidize more people buying houses, then you'll have even more people chasing the same number of houses. I don't think that's how you solve the problem. But the part I really do like is she's got a target and actually a proposal that will get 3 million more houses built.

Meantime, let's also talk about another area that she spelled out. She says she's going to call for a federal ban on price gouging to lower grocery prices, and everybody is feeling the pinch for the higher grocery prices. She wants everyday costs to come down. Inflated costs come largely from COVID pandemic supply-demand problems. So she underscored that shouldn't be a justification for high prices now. So what do you think? WOLFERSthink, on the one hand, what she said in his speech was she wants to come after corporate price gouging, after collusion and big businesses doing anticompetitive behavior that was basically designed to get rid of competition and screw their customers. Hey, that sounds fantastic. I think that occurs. I don't think it's the cause of our big inflation, but I think it's occurs, and there's a whole lot of companies I can imagine going after. The flipside is some economists are worried that when she says those things, she means I want to institute price controls and prices are going to be set in Washington. That would be a very bad plan. Now, let me be clear. I listened very closely to what Harris said, and at no point did she say that she was going to institute price controls. So we have successful rules and laws against price gouging in most states. And if that's what -- if that's the scope of her vision, I think it's terrific idea.",
