And the second thing, of course, is a malfunction at launch, either with a guidance system, or the -- or the -- or with the rocket motor.I wouldn't make it a sideways observation, perhaps that you'd write about that the crisis was handled well, and relatively quickly, people worked out this was not a Russian attack. And at least partially, some of that was due to the amazing intelligence sources from open sources from people on the ground using their Twitter feed and sending us pictures of the fragments left from the missile. And the frameless left from the missile had various identification codes. And so relatively quickly, if you like the Twittersphere and the social media could see that this was a -- that this was a missile that was probably not in service with the Russian forces, but was known to be in service with the Ukrainian forces.",

And that's even how he's been how his has been described in terms of his diplomacy, his diplomatic style. Clearly, this more muscular face to face almost confrontational tone is out of character for Xi Jinping. Think about even when his predecessor Hu Jintao was pulled out of the Party Congress in Beijing. In that moment, Xi Jinping kind of stared straight ahead, stone faced, not acknowledging.But this time he was right in the face of Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of one of the most important U.S. allies, and complaining about something that the Chinese have long had issue with when it comes to dealings with the West. The leaky nature of democracies. You don't have leaks like that come out of China on the Chinese side. They keep everything very, very much buttoned up. But in places like Canada, the U.S., it's more common for conversation details to be -- to be revealed to the press. Justin Trudeau, when he was asked about the exchange, a couple of hours afterwards, he tried to portray it is not that big of a deal. Listen.

It was Australia, France, Netherlands, South Korea, South Africa in Bali, not, you know, just to name a few. And here he's believed to be landing just about right now, Rosemary in Bangkok.

So, of course, there could have been different situations, there could have been Russian misfires or our protection of ourselves, our attempt to save ourselves, and to stay alive. We are, right now, fighting for our existence, we are trying to protect ourselves from 100 of bombs and missiles that are coming here to kill us and everything that we love.So, this is why it is so, so, so important that no matter what the investigation will show, the response will be clear, the response should be only one, give Ukraine more air force protection systems, give us an ability to protect ourselves, and protect our neighbors. Give us an ability to continue because what we think right now is even when a small percentage of rockets are hitting the targets, the results are terrifying. The results are throwing us into cold and direct winter that we don't know how many people will survive. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He will be coming in January, and that is just when a bitter election against Jair Bolsonaro, who had a famously ambivalent attitude towards climate change. Lula, as his university known, said that more needs to be done to help poor countries combat the climate crisis. He also says that his administration will do more to monitor illegal logging in the critical Amazon Rainforest and crackdown on wildcat loggers and miners. But the main thrust was really equality when it comes to fighting climate change. LULA DA SILVA, BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT-ELECT (through translator):  We need with urgency, with a lot of urgency, I should say, financial mechanisms or facilities to remedy loss and damages caused due to climate change. We cannot postpone this debate. We need to deal with the reality of countries that have their own fiscal integrity of their territories threatened and the survival conditions of its inhabitants seriously compromised. It is time to act. We can't waste time anymore. We cannot live with this rush towards the abyss.",

I -- they sense, and I think we would agree, that if the Russians are able to stop, set, reorganize, it will even be a harder fight. Of course, we've got winter coming that works both for and against both sides. So, yes, it will be hard. The Russians are falling back on what we call a little bit interior lines, closer to the supply routes.
