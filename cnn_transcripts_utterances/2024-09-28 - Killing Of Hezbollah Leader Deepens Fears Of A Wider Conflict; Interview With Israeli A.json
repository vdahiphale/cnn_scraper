Tonight, Hezbollah saying it has launched long-range missiles toward Jerusalem after vowing to fight back following the death of its top leader in an Israeli strike on Beirut yesterday. And tonight, there are questions about what remains of Hezbollah's leadership and what a potential response might look like as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warns, Israel is at quote, \"an historic turning point\". We have reporters live tonight across the region. Our Nic Robertson is in Tel Aviv. We start though with Ben Wedeman, who has the latest on the ground there in Beirut. Ben.",

      "sentences": "Yes Jessica. What we're hearing overhead is an Israeli drone. The anticipation is there will be a new wave of Israeli strikes on the southern suburbs.This after the Arabic spokesman for the Israeli military put out a tweet warning the residents of southern Lebanon, the Beqaa Valley in the southern suburbs of Beirut, to stay away from any Hezbollah facilities. And given that Hezbollah is a very secretive organization, most people don't actually know if there might be any Hezbollah facilities in their immediate area. So the assumption is that if you are in one of those areas, you should simply leave. And what we've seen is that tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of people have left those areas specified by the Israelis. Before the war, the population of those three areas in that tweet was around 2 million people. According to Lebanese officials in just the last few days, almost half a million people have fled. And that was a number before we saw this mass exodus from the southern suburbs of Beirut. Now, were getting a new death toll from the Lebanese ministry of health who say that for today Saturday, at least 33 people were killed in addition to 195 injured. These are all preliminary figures. For instance, that strike that took place at about 6:00 p.m. yesterday that resulted in the killing of Hassan Nasrallah, it's believed that there may be well over 100 bodies still under the rubble of those six buildings that were brought down by multiple 2,000-pound bombs in cluster buster bomb -- bunker buster bombs -- excuse me, it's been a very long few days -- bunker buster bombs on that location. Now as the tension rises, what we're seeing is that the United States is increasingly concerned about the situation in the country and has ordered some employees at the U.S. embassy which is north of Beirut, not in Beirut, and their families to leave. They've also put out on the Internet a form for us citizens in Lebanon who would seek assistance in leaving the country. This may be a preliminary step for the eventual evacuation of these people. Now in addition to this, Hezbollah has put out notices informing its followers of numbers they can call that would facilitate their departure to Syria. Syria being considered at the moment, a safer place than many parts of Lebanon. Jessica.",

We saw pictures, images of fire on social media around those rescue vehicles. But they say that they found no casualties there. But of course, one of the other things that people in Israel are bracing for is the potential that Iran well step in to support Hezbollah potentially in some way, potentially choose over the coming days to have its own strikes on Israel. And the IDF spokesman Peter Lerner had something to say about that just in the past couple of hours. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. PETER LERNER, IDF SPOKESPERSON: I would suggest that Iran look very closely how we've dealt with Hamas, the leadership of Hamas, and how in the last week-and-a-half, we've effectively decapitated Hezbollah, from its senior leadership all the way down to the operational and tactical staff. There is a lot to lose here. I don't think anybody is interested in a further escalation, a broader war, but Israel needs to be prepared for that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In general, I can tell you, we will continue to hunt down the leadership of the terrorist. They were the ones who started October 7th in Gaza.

So I think now where we are actually showing our capabilities against Hezbollah, maybe there would be an opening to catch that linkage between Hezbollah and Hamas.

I just spoke to the U.N. -- the Israeli U.N. ambassador.he said essentially they're going to keep their foot on the gas here. No talk there of any diplomatic solution at this moment. I'm curious if you'll just kind of broaden it out for us and talk about this moment in the broader Middle East and how the killing of Nasrallah and what's going on right now is changing the dynamic there. ZAKARIA: So until now, what Iran and its proxies had done was to place a great deal of pressure on Israel through a kind of strategy of attrition of asymmetry. So all these Iranian-backed militias and they're backed to varying degrees. Hamas is quite independent, but Hamas, Hezbollah, you know, even the Houthis, even to a certain extent some of the Iraqi militias, in various ways, putting pressure and keeping Israel in a sense, you know, mired in Gaza, where they keep having to go back and cleanup operations. So Israel I think was searching for a way to break out of this situation where it was in a somewhat defensive and trapped position. Gaza has been difficult because they are now in there and they are -- they are in a sense, de facto reoccupying it for the moment. But against Lebanon, against Hezbollah, they've thought about this a long time and this was a very dramatic change in the dynamic. What they just did was they brought the war to Hezbollah. They hit hard. They had superb intelligence. First they start with the cell phone and pagers which cut off all of Hezbollah's communication. Then they begin going after the middle command. Then the weapons caches. And then the central command. So I think they feel that they are -- they have Hezbollah on the run. They are essentially destroying a large part of it. And I think you're right, they're not going to stop. and I think that their calculation is that Hezbollah is in no position right now to respond. You know, it's decimated, its communications are gone, its caches are being destroyed and Iran will be very cautious about jumping in. Iran has so far always shown that it is willing to fight to the last Houthi, to the last member of Hezbollah. But they have never wanted to enter this themselves. So that's the calculation that the Israelis are pursuing. And I think there they might be right.",

It did not signal a massive new escalation. And even since Nasrallah's death, they have not, you know, the rhetoric has not been the kind which would presage some kind of major attack. Look, the important thing that I think we need to understand is Israel is the military superpower of the region. It can counterpunch very hard. The question is, does it want to.

They are -- they are, you know, as far as I can tell, I've always found them very rational in pursuit of their objectives. And they, generally-speaking, have preferred this kind of low-grade strategy of attrition. And look, it does put, you know, exacts a price for Israel. Israeli reservists have now been larger than three months out. They've been out a year. You know, Israel is bogged down in Gaza. It means, for example, that because of the Houthis a lot of the ship traffic has been diverted away from the Gulf. If you look at what is happening with airlines. 62 airlines, I think used to land in Jerusalem every day and I think that what I saw recently with it, maybe they just down to a lot, the Israeli Airline. So there is a cost, particularly for Israel, which is very plugged into the global economy. And what, you know, what Israel prefers -- would prefer is a short, sharp war. They win and then there is some kind of negotiated peace.

It gives you an idea how bad the situation was here.And let me show you how far the water, the floodwaters got here. This, what I have right in front of me, is the debris line. There are several feet between the level of that taco stand and this part of the grass where you all this debris. So that is creating a lot of problems for officials here. And we heard earlier from the University of North Carolina Asheville saying that they will cancel classes until October 9. In a statement by Chancellor Kimberly van Noort, she said that many trees fell on campus, that many parts of campus are inaccessible. And she also said that mobile service and internet are also down. And we've been talking to residents here who tell us that they had never seen anything like this. This area where we stand is not too far from the river and it floods on occasion, but not to this level. I spoke earlier with a gentleman who told me that he's been living here for 40 years and this is the first time he sees it so bad. Let's take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We heard from officials earlier who said that crews are going around the city looking at mains. There was a main that broke trying to make an assessment first about the damage before they can determine how quickly they can restore service.In the meantime, the entire city of Asheville is under a boiling advisory.

      "sentences": "Yes, to say the least. They've been there now for months.Now, SpaceX has now launched nine crewed missions for NASA since the end of the space shuttle program. Is this kind of the future that we're looking at, where we see private enterprise and NASA kind of joining together? O'BRIEN: Yes, and I think probably as it should be. The idea way back when, when they first were thinking about handing over a piece of this to the commercial sector in a more robust way, was to develop industries in space to encourage private enterprise one way or another. What we've been seeing, in addition to those NASA launches, are some fascinating privately funded missions. Most recently, the Polaris Dawn mission, funded by Jared Isaacman, the shift for payments billionaire, who conducted the first private spacewalk, among other things. And that's an exciting thing for those who would like to see space expand beyond the realm of the government. And so I think NASA has seeded this pretty well, and at least in one case. Now, in the case of Boeing, that's another story. DEAN: What would you say with the Boeing situation? O'BRIEN: Well, we still don't really know what the problem was with the Boeing Starliner, which is the second path to the International Space Station. NASA wanted to have redundancy. So if one of those spacecraft was not operative, they had another way to get there. Well, this launch today is sort of the case in point, isn't it? It's good to have another way to get there, and not having to rely on the Russian Soyuz, because that's problematic for a lot of reasons. But for Boeing, this is a big problem. It was a fixed price contract. That's the key thing to understand about this new era of space, is that SpaceX and Boeing are not on cost plus kind of defense style contracts. They have a fixed price and they're supposed to deliver. And Boeing has not delivered and is having to eat all these costs at a time where Boeing has a lot of other problems, as we know.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. And why do you think it is taking so long to get them back, the two astronauts that are stranded up there after the Starliner was deemed not safe enough?O'BRIEN: Well, it was easier in the grand scheme of operation of the International Space Station to just slot them in to this crew, that two people are on the ground now watching that launch today from the Cape that were supposed to be strapped into those empty seats and spend a six-month stint on the space station. Rather than sort of tailor-making or providing an Uber in space for Suni and Butch, they just opened up those seats and told them, hey, you're going to have to stick around and be drafted into this crew. Now, a lot of people say, wow, they're stranded. But if you're an astronaut, this is exactly where you want to be, is in space. So hopefully they have their bills on autopay and they're studying up on the manual for SpaceX so they know how to get back.",
