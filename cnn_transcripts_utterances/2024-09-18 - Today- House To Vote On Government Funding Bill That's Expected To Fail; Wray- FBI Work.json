MIKE LAWLER (R-NY): I'm not shutting the government down. My colleagues aren't shutting the government down. At the end of the day, the election is going to be determined by the American people, based on the issues of affordability, the border, crime, and the international crises that we've seen under Kamala Harris and Joe Biden. And obviously, a government shutdown would distract from that. REP. LAUREN BOEBERT (R-CO): I absolutely believe that the speaker should always be ready for a government shutdown. We are the most powerful branch of government. And that's because we control, well, the purse strings, because we control the funding. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That would mean essentially a shutdown if they we're to listen to Donald Trump. I asked the speaker today, do you agree with what Donald Trump said? And he didn't quite say. In fact, he said that he and Trump have spoken. He, of course, didn't also reveal what his next step will be when this measure fails tonight.

Lawmakers like Speaker Mike Johnson have been pointing the finger at the White House, saying the White House needs to do more, that the administration and Homeland Security to do more to get more resources there. The White House, in turn, is pointing the finger at Congress, saying you control the purse strings. You have to basically open up the country's wallet to spend money on these resources.

They've been underfunded for decades, which has led them to this point where they don't have the personnel they need to cover all of the many threats that face the many, many people, this expanded kind of universe of people they need to protect. The short-term response that falls on the White House and the administration, I think they've tried to stand up to that. And we know that DHS has basically detailed 1,500 Homeland Security investigators over to the Secret Service to bolster their roles. Because the long-term fix doesn't come in overnight.

So the FBI and the Secret Service are in a tight spot here. They need to be consistent with the way that we handle information that may be involved in a criminal prosecution and kind of keep at bay those who are screaming for more and more and more facts.

SANCHEZ: Nevertheless, former Republican presidential hopeful and Trump campaign surrogate, Vivek Ramaswamy, is announcing plans for a town hall there tomorrow. We want to discuss the situation there and other issues with CNN senior political commentator, Ana Navarro, and Lance Trover, the former spokesperson for North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum's 2024 presidential campaign. Thank you both for being with us. Lance, I'm wondering what you make of this move for Republicans to head to Springfield now after all of these rumors have been out there and have been largely debunked. LANCE TROVER, FORMER SPOKESPERSON FOR ND GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM'S 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: Look, I live by the old adage in politics that if a campaign is doing something, if a campaign is talking about something, yet been criticized for the media, but they continue doing it, it's probably because they believe they're on the right track politically in this country. Ipsos has a poll out this morning that says one-third of Americans believe that immigration is the number-one issue in this country. That is a staggering number when you stop and think about it. So I'm guessing the Trump campaign is wagering that Americans have moved on from the dogs and the cats and the memes. And they are wagering that Americans as a whole are looking at this community and asking themselves a foundational question: What if 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 people moved into my community? And that's a fair discussion to have across the country. And that is what the Trump campaign is wagering on because, when we're talking about immigration, it's a winner for Donald Trump.",

Today, in \"The Wall Street Journal,\" there is a story about a woman from Springfield who was one of the ones who, I guess, made a police report about her missing pet, except that a few days later, her cat, Ms. Sassy, showed up safe in her basement. And this woman had alleged that she thought Haitian neighbors had eaten the cat, taken the cat. She ended up having to use a translator app to apologize to those Haitian neighbors. Look, we all know that this is based on racist, false created narratives. We know they are created because J.D. Vance told us so when he was in an interview with Dana Bash this weekend. It is shameful for them to be exploiting this issue, with the cost it's having on this city, where the Republican governor has now had to send state law enforcement where they are getting bomb threats. Yes, they are hoaxes so far, but they have to be taken seriously. And this is happening because J.D. Vance and Donald Trump has elevated this issue and put a target on the back of Haitians and of the town of Springfield.",
