This one held last night for the community of Allen, Texas where a gunman killed eight people Saturday at an outlet mall.And these are just some of the mass shootings that have taken place during Abbott's tenure as governor. While there have been calls for stricter gun laws after each shooting, Abbott has rejected those calls and instead has drawn attention to mental health. It's become a common refrain over the past few years. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. GREG ABBOTT, (R) TEXAS:  We all know that this is something that we must address as a nation but also as a state, and that is for all of us to do a better job to address mental health issues. Too many Texans have lost their lives. The status quo in Texas is unacceptable. We as a state and we as a society need to do a better job with mental health. Anybody who shoots somebody else has a mental health challenge. There has been a dramatic increase in the amount of anger and violence that's taking place in America. And what Texas is doing in a big-time way -- we are working to address that anger and violence by going to its root cause, which is addressing the mental health problems behind it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We've had several things where toddlers have shot themselves recently. Background checks. Make them universal. Make them mandatory. Get a mandatory health information for adolescents 16 years of age or older. Raise the age. Why is it you can buy an AR-15 at 18 but you can't buy a handgun? How does that make any sense? And then if there's a gun involving a crime that we would require some more information. Most of these crimes with these shooters -- one of these laws would have prevented them having access to these firearms. No one is trying to take weapons from law-abiding responsible citizens.
