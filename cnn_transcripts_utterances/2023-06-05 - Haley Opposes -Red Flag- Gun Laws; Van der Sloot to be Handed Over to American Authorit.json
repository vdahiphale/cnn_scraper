He stepped forward saying, I can show you where the remains are. The attorney for the Holloway's went over to Aruba, travelled with him, he said Natalee's in the foundation of the house. Ultimately, he wired and e-mailed, that attorney saying, it was a ruse. It was false. I lied to you. Thus, you have this extortion and fraud charges. And according to legal documents, this was all done in coordination with the FBI.But CNN has exclusive video from the early morning hours of Saturday. We want to show everyone this because we were, \" CNN en Espanol\" we have to thank for this, they were allowed to go inside of that remote prison in Peru. Joran van der Sloot being taken out of his cell. In Peru, you can wear your own clothes. So, you see, he's got fleece sweater, coat on. You see they are shackle -- shackling him at his ankles, cuffing him, but that is just the beginning being led out. Then he goes to the medical unit where the, in fact, took his blood pressure, his heart, and then, ultimately, he was transferred out which was the beginning of that journey. But he is now in a prison outside of Lima, closer to the international airport in Lima. And we do understand from the head of the prisons in Peru, he will be transferred to Interpol, that intercountry policing agency and then transferred over to U.S. authorities, a plane will be waiting for him at that international airport where he will be transferred to Birmingham, Alabama.",

So, as an attempt to compromise, the FBI is coming here, in behind closed doors, going to show this document to Comer as well as the top Democrat on this committee.And this is a document that memorialized information that comes from a confidential source in the FBI. But the FBI has stressed that this is unsubstantiated, unverified information. And when it comes to these allegations, which you pointed out, are involving, you know, an alleged bribery scheme when Joe Biden was vice president. The White House has denied it. They have dismissed it all as a political attack. But, you know, Comer has really then stuck on trying to get a copy of this document. And we're going to see today whether the option to view it behind closed doors is enough to fend off these threats of contempt or if Comer decides to move ahead with this contempt proceedings because what he actually wants is a hard in his possession of the document and to be able to share it with other members of the committee and other members of Congress.",

Can colleges and universities continue to take race into consideration as a factor in admissions? The schools say they need to do this to help with diversity at the schools, but challengers are taking on programs at Harvard. The University of North Carolina saying, basically, that those plans violate equal protection and laws that bar the discrimination based on race. Key to that case is the fact that the court could again choose to overturn precedent.They're also taking aim at a big voting rights case. We know that this court has already cut back significantly on the scope of the Voting Rights Act. In this case, the court could make it harder for minorities to challenge congressional redistricting maps. Here, a lower court said that Alabama had to draw another black majority district in part because the state is 27 percent black. That's at issue before the court. Also, a big LGBTQ rights case. Here a woman wants to start a new business. She wants to make websites to celebrate marriage, but does not want to make websites that celebrate same sex weddings. So, now she has brought her case, and liberals are worried about the conservative majority here. They think they might rule in her favor but also some feared that this court might begin to chip away at that historic decision from a few years ago that allowed gay marriage nationwide. And finally, there's another case that's really important to the Biden administration. He sought to ease student loan debt in his student loan forgiveness plan, that, in the wake of COVID, would really help a lot of students that had a lot of debt. But the conservatives at oral argument there, they really seem to say that Biden here had exceeded his authority. So, all those cases and some more are going to be decided within the next about four weeks.",
