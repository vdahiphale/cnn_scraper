The Arab League convenes in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, with special guest, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The Ukrainian president once had to hold out in Kyiv bonkers at the start of Russia's invasion of his war. Now, he's on the world stage appealing to those who he says turned a blind eye. From there, Mr. Zelenskyy will travel to Japan, where G7 leaders are already putting their heads together on issues, ranging from training Ukrainians on fighter jets to regulating artificial intelligence. More on both of those important conferences straight ahead. But first, a CNN exclusive that underscores the balance international diplomacy requires in this interconnected world. Our Becky Anderson sat down with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan who is doing everything he can to maintain ties with both the West and Russia. We start this hour with part of their conversation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, more on the Ukrainian president's surprise appearance at the Arab League Summit in Jeddah, Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged leaders there to take an honest look at Russia's war on Ukraine, accusing some of turning a blind eye to the atrocities Mr. Zelenskyy frequently made appeals to Ukraine's staunch western allies, but this was a very different audience. Some Arab League states have remained largely neutral on the war, while Syria now back in the fold actively supports Russia. Mr. Zelenskyy urged members to strengthen ties with Ukraine.

He knows that the Arab leaders, and manyof these Arab leaders buy into President Putin's propaganda, that its western hegemony and NATO, that is threatening and attacking Russia. And this is why Putin had to invade Ukraine. There are many diplomats from the Gulf that I've spoken to have said, essentially, what Putin has said that actually Ukraine isn't actually a real country, and it is part of the greater Russia. So, that's a narrative that Zelenskyy is keen to disrupt, and is building a good relationship with the Saudis. And Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has really opened the door for Zelenskyy here to have a voice at the Arab League meeting in Jeddah. It was at the Crown Prince's invitation, Saudis giving hundreds of millions of dollars in humanitarian aid. They have an eye on helping Ukraine in the future because they're invested in Ukraine and its infrastructure, and its agriculture, and its industry in the past. So, that relationship exists. Zelenskyy sees, and he said it as a way to just sort of build on that positive relationship that the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has with Ukraine. But it's a door that's opening, if you will, because Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman himself wants to play a bigger diplomatic role in bringing peace between Ukraine and Russia, has close personal ties with Putin, has a shared view of the economy because both countries are massive oil producers. So, there's a sort of a symbiosis here, but it's a door-open for Zelenskyy in the longer term to convince more countries who sit around, they -- who sit at the United Nations, who ultimately may have a say and a voice in the sort of peace that Ukraine can establish. So, this is a long-term agenda. It's disrupting Russia's propaganda that's bought at the moment on the Arab strait.",

And so people were looking for someone or something to blame. And so, there were discussions about the influence of media, social media, and of course, about guns. The guns problem on its own is extremely tricky to solve. You're talking about a country which has one of the highest rates of gun ownership in the world. You're talking about 2.7 million guns in Serbia, less than half of them are owned legally. A whole tranche of guns that are illegally-owned, left over from conflicts in the 1990s, and now, you have people occupying two of the main bridges in Belgrade, essentially connecting the old and the new parts of the city. And you know, one speaker who spoke in front of the parliament earlier during this protest said that, look, they want to shut down the city.

There was a lot of people in favor of building some kind of national agency, and when people were in favor of specific proposals, like, for example, requiring licensing on certain types of AI models, there wasn't detail yet. But there was, I think, consensus around that. And I think there was warmth towards the idea that I've been pushing about having a global AI agency that might try to align all the different countries and have common plans, which, I think, would be useful both for the companies. They don't want to have to build different models for every country.

So, for example, we need, I think, much more transparency about what's in the models, because the models can influence people's beliefs, in the way that social media can but a subtle way. And so we need scientists to say, hey, we need more transparency about what you're doing and we need to build new tools to fight the kinds of misinformation that people will generate with your tools.

They show that while the Biden administration publicly hammered airlines for the problems, behind the scenes, the FAA officials were well aware that their own agency also bore responsibility. Well, CNN aviation correspondent Pete Muntean joins us now from Washington with the details. And Pete, I imagine airlines are feeling somewhat vindicated today because, you know, that -- they were charged with, you know, the blame for all of this in the first instance. So how much are the FAA -- how much do the FAA have to answer for here?",

      "sentences": "Well, you know, the blame game is pretty interesting here, Christina, because the FAA is not totallyvindicated. The airlines are not totally vindicated here. But we do have this tranche of new documents that really lays out the blame game in much more detail than we have ever understood before. And CNN uncovered in hundreds of pages of documents obtained from the federal government. These are messages and emails internally at the Federal Aviation Administration, that this problem was really owned by the FAA, but not in public. In fact, in public, the FAA, and the Biden administration was really pointing fingers at the airlines. Think back to last summer. We're talking 55,000 flight cancellations between Memorial Day and Labor Day, a half million flights delayed. And as that was taking place, repeatedly, the Biden administration said, this is on airlines. They emptied out the cabinet during the pandemic. And now, they're racing to keep up with the amount of travelers coming back. But what we were able to uncover in these documents is that at one key air traffic control facility run by the Federal Aviation Administration in Florida, it is known as Jacksonville Center, there were 200 shifts that were short-staffed over a seven-week period. And that led to 4,600 flights being delayed in the state of Florida that accounted for one in every ten delays during that seven-week period. So, this is completely new, previously unreported information that really puts into the limelight the FAA's onus here, and it's especially important now, because Memorial Day, the official -- unofficial rather start of the summer travel season, is right around the corner, we're talking only a week out, and so many people are planning to travel. In fact, AAA says the numbers on Memorial Day weekend, so the weekend after next, could be 11 percent higher than what they were back in 2019, before the pandemic when air travel was really hitting huge records. So this is really, really critical right now. And the FAA is also warning that these controller shortages is trying to own up to them in a way leading up to this summer, that could cause delays at some airports like in New York, to increase by 45 percent. So we're learning a lot here from the past. And it's really important to put the spotlight on this because the FAA says there will still be problems again this summer. So, we're going to roll out this reporting tonight on Anderson Cooper 360 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time and really lay this out for folks so they understand just how bad the problem was, and also lay out for folks how the FAA is addressing this. So this potentially does not happen in the future. Although we know there is a potential for problems on the horizon again this summer, Christina.",

Now the Colombian army thinks it has found what could be a significant clue in its search for four children missing after a plane crash in the Amazon jungle. Search and rescue officials say this appears to be a small footprint and they think it could be from one of the children. The children age thirteen, nine, four, and eleven months have been missing now for more than two weeks. Officials confirmed the bodies of three adults have been pulled from the plane wreckage. Well, Stefano Pozzebon has been tracking this story for us from the Colombian capital city of Bogota. Stefano, 18 days now and still no confirmation of the children.

Investigators in Australia want to know why a police officer felt so threatened by a 95-year-old woman that he had to tase her. It happened Wednesday inside a nursing home south of Canberra. Police were responding to a call about a resident with a knife. When great grandmother, Claire Nolan, didn't follow police instructions to drop the knife, an officer discharged his taser. Nolan has dementia and she is now in the hospital in critical condition. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANDREW THALER, BUSINESSMAN &amp; COMMUNITY ADVOCATE: Claire is 95 years old. She's about five foot two, and weighs all 43 kilos. She can't walk on her own without walking assistance. As they said, she had a walking frame or a wheelie walker. The use of a taser when a kind word was all she needed. If she was confused, which is what happens with people who have dementia, she needed kind words and assistance and help. She didn't need the force of the law as it were. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
