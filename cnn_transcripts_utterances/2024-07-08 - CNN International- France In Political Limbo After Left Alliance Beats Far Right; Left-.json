But, what we do know is that when this unlikely, improbable alliance was created less than a month ago that has now won these elections, becoming the biggest bloc in the parliament behind me, when it was created, there were all kinds of very difficult negotiations that went on. There was controversy. There were people who didn't agree, because the nature of this alliance itself includes such different political parties that have very different views, that do not necessarily get along very well.And there was a lot of concern for many of the more moderate left-wing parties about their alliance with someone like Jean-Luc Melenchon, who for years has been the much more controversial face of the far left. [11:05:00] There were many within the now victorious alliance that were extremely uncomfortable with being an alliance with him at all. So, the question now becomes, each party is going to want their candidates to be put forward for the potential candidate to become Prime Minister. It's very difficult from here to see how any of them are going to accept that their candidate isn't the chosen one. There will, of course, be the weight of each party within the alliance. But still, there are egos at play. There are sensitive political formations that for years have been very suspicious about what the others are doing. It's very difficult to see from here, Isa, how any of these people come to any agreement about who their candidate should be. And again, even when you consider the alliance and if you imagine that some kind of unity will hold even beyond this particularly fraught period of negotiation around the question of who the Prime Minister might be, even if they managed to hold it together and maintain a unity that, again, has been so elusive on the French left for so many years, even if they managed to hold it together, they're still not the majority party. So, there are going to have to be on all kinds of questions that Emmanuel Macron is going to be hoping to get through alliances that are made, trades that are made. It's very difficult to see how from the last parliament, which should really look very difficult for him to manage. There were questions about whether he is going to get his budget through. And that was -- it was assumed, part of his calculation when he decided just to dissolve it and start again. But, the current one looks even more difficult for him to work with than even the last one did, Isa.",

They were really hoping they were going to be celebrating their becoming the largest group inside the National Assembly. But, you're quite right. They did still double their number of seats. That gives them a much greater ability, both to be an important force in French politics to be part of that horse-trading I was talking about to make themselves heard.But, what you heard Jordan Bardella say yesterday was really speak to what he considers a sort of conspiracy against it. It was the alliance, the tactical voting, he believed, that was preventing, as he put it, the will from the French -- of the French people from being reflected in these final votes. And that message is something that they're going to continue peddling. And there is, in France, a large group of people, specifically in the French countryside, away from Paris, those are ones we went to speak to in Normandy on Friday, reminded us, who are very angry about the way the country has been managed. Some of them would have been part of the yellow vest protests. Many of them extremely dissatisfied. And what unites them all, and I'm talking about a constituency that voted National Rally outright in the first round, there were 39 who said cheese. So, loud was the anger that was poking in. And again, a first round that tends to be how people vote with their hearts. Very strong support. In some places, they won outright. And to those voters who very clearly made their voices heard, the message that is now going to be peddled by the National Rally is no doubt going to resonate. The idea that somehow their victory, their voice has once again been discarded, set aside by the political machinations of the Parisian elites, Isa.",

We know that children are among those injured. But, as I said, the work of sifting through the wreckage, that significant destruction of that hospital is not yet done.It has caused a lot of shock in the capital. This is a very well-known hospital, the most important in Ukraine, according to President Zelenskyy, where the sickest children go to get the most specialized treatment. We saw patients having to be evacuated, including very young children, cancer patients, very, very vulnerable. And at some point in the mid-morning, there was another air raid where everyone ran into the basement. And we're hearing about another health clinic in a different part of the city that was hit by, according to preliminary information, by falling debris from missile defense, taking down missiles, and seven people reported killed at that health clinic. So, an extremely deadly day in the capital. President Zelenskyy visiting Poland and calling for, he says, concrete action from his allies, including he wants permission to use Western-donated weapons to hit Russian weapons stores and missile locations in that country, and more of those limitations lifted. I think, ahead of the NATO summit, he is using this moment to call for more ambition from his partners when it comes to supporting Ukraine, and in particular, of course, given these attacks, for more air defenses.",

That is now, we've spoken to several weapons experts who've seen the footage of the actual missile falling on that children's hospital, who say that it is consistent with a cruise missile, which is, of course, what Ukraine is saying.But, look, Russia has reason potentially to use this moment. That is, of course, a day before the NATO summit. They may want to make it clear, given the calls from Ukraine and other international figures to step up aid to Ukraine that Russia is still capable of escalating.

There is just too much explaining that President Biden is doing now in trying to justify continuing his candidacy. All the things he is saying is true. No one needs a letter to point that out.

It definitely took some White House aides by surprise. But, overall, what they're reckoning with is the fact that the President is adamant that he is going to stay in the race and continue his campaign. And so, now, they're really on -- in the offensive. You're seeing them really amplifying their outreach to Democrats, and even publicly, the President himself voicing frustration that this conversation is continuing to carry on more than a week after the debate.And I think some of that is actually because there are congressional Democrats who complained that it took the President and his aides too long to respond to their concerns about the debate, both publicly and privately. But now, a Biden campaign official says the President has personally reached out to about 20 House Democrats, including Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill. You had that letter and the interview on MSNBC where he is striking much more of a defiant tone. And I think what you're going to start to see is them shifting gears from addressing the concerns to saying, hey, the longer that this debate plays out in public, the more we are strengthening former President Trump's hand by allowing the narrative to remain on divisions within the Democratic Party and whether the President should be at the top of the ticket. But, I don't think that's necessarily going to do enough to alleviate the concerns that Democrats on Capitol Hill have. They're back for the first time this week in Washington since the debate. So, this isn't going anywhere just yet. And I think that's why the President is either trying to wrap up this conversation as quickly as they can.",

Obviously, the President has been very firm in his commitment to NATO, and that's one of the points that he is trying to draw as a point of contrast with former President Trump, who, of course, had a much more skeptical attitude toward NATO and traditional U.S. alliances. But, in our reporting, we've also heard concerns from foreign leaders and foreign governments about the President's capabilities, about his age. And so, this is not a concern that's uniquely shared -- uniquely taking place here in Washington among Democrats on Capitol Hill, or among voters within the Democratic Party.It's something -- I think his performance is something that U.S. allies are also closely watching. In fact, U.S. allies would probably rather see a second Biden term than to return to former President Trump who -- where there was a lot more uncertainty. There was a lot more instability, but they're questioning as well, a lot of U.S. allies, if President Biden is the one who is best positioned to prevent a return to a Trump presidency.",

So, where does France go from here, and how will the chaos impact European friends and foes alike? Our Nic Robertson is with me now live from Paris.

We heard from the German Chancellor saying that he was relieved that France and the European Union weren't having to deal with a hard-right element within the parliament, either creating a hung parliament situation or just changing policies in the European Union. He said that he hopes France can form a constructive government, and of course, that's the real catch going forward. Can they actually do that?Look, everyone looks and the European Union to Macron to take a forward-leaning position on a lot of things, not least Ukraine. It is the one that suggested that there should be NATO troops on the ground in Ukraine, not fighting in combat, but doing the training. And that's something that no other leader has really been willing to stand up and say, and he has been pushing out upfront on that. And so, countries like Germany really do look to a strong France, even though they may disagree on some issues. But perhaps, Donald Tusk, the Polish Prime Minister, who himself was once a European Council President, who knows a thing or two about the EU, he put it this way. He said, look, in Paris, there is essentially excitement. In Moscow, there is disappointment. In Kyiv, there is relief, and that's enough for us in Warsaw, he said, to say that this is a good thing. That's not a ringing endorsement as much as this is better than we might have hoped for. And I think the Spanish Prime Minister, Pedro Sanchez, he also tweeted about this, and he said, look, you've just had the UK government, the French government voting new politicians who are on the left, just like we are in Spain. Perhaps he is getting a little ahead of himself or hopeful Spain, for example, has already recognized a Palestinian state. Well, neither the British nor the French have done that. Maybe with new political dispensations, they will move in that direction. But, it is an indication that there is this big relief across Europe, in Brussels, that you don't have this far-right element tripping up French politics, as the others in Europe would see as normal.",

It's the first time Narendra Modi has visited the Russian capital since the country launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Ties have remained strong, despite repeated sanctions on Moscow from the West. He and President Vladimir Putin are expected to discuss quotes \"regional and global issues of mutual interest\". Heavy fighting is reported in Gaza City, as Israel launches major new operations there. Thousands of people are fleeing the area after the IDF issued an urgent evacuation order. Residents say the attacks are among the heaviest since the war began. This despite a new push for a ceasefire. A source tells CNN the director of the CIA is expected to join talks in Cairo as well as Doha this week. Let's get more now from Kylie Atwood at the State Department, as, of course, these negotiations hopefully get underway, Kylie. That is the hope that this might actually be a breakthrough to getting to some sort of deal. KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: That is the hope. But, of course, we've been here before. There have been many different rounds, many iterations of CIA director going to the Middle East, meeting with both sides, hopeful that they were going to get somewhere and then falling backwards. So, all eyes are on what happens this week in terms of the Hamas side, in terms of the Israeli side. When you talk to U.S. officials, they do say that they believe that Israel actually does really want a ceasefire here, does want a hostage deal here to come to fruition. They have said that for quite some time. But, that is a significant factor as we go into what is another round of these talks. And we know that the CIA director is often only dispatched to the region when they are actually talking about the nitty-gritty details, not just the big picture, but really getting into the negotiations here, the specific aspects of the negotiation. So, that's why it's significant that he is in the region. Obviously, we have seen many trips to the region by U.S. diplomats, by the Secretary of State Antony Blinken. And so, we'll continue to watch what happens over the course of the next few days here. And it happens amid the backdrop of the NATO summit, the gathering here in Washington, D.C. You have all of these world leaders meeting here in Washington. President Biden will be watched incredibly closely. So, there are a lot of moving parts when it comes to the foreign policy space right now. And the Biden administration is really actively working on multiple levels across the space.",

This company really not saying all that much, only that it has reached an agreement in principle with the U.S. Department of Justice. Here are the terms of that deal, according to the federal government. Boeing is being fined $487 million. The Department of Justice says that it is the maximum fine allowed by law. The government will also be appointing an independent compliance monitor to oversee Boeing for the next three years, and that monitor will give reports to the court each year.The biggest part of this is Boeing agreeing to plead guilty to criminal charges. Remember, this is for the 737 MAX 8 eight crashes; the Lion Air crash in 2018, the Ethiopian Air crash in 2019. 346 people killed in those two crashes abroad. Boeing agreeing to plead guilty to defrauding the Federal Aviation Administration about the MAX 8, that Boeing hid major design changes that led to those two crashes. Originally, Boeing was able to reach a settlement with the government to avoid criminal charges for those crashes. But, that deal also came with three years of probation. And the January 5th door plug blow out at an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9 happened just days before that deal was set to expire. So, that made the Department of Justice look at that original deal again, and ultimately triggered this new deal. Victims' families are calling this a \"sweetheart deal\". They wanted Boeing to face a nearly $25 billion fine. Paul Cassell is the attorney leading the civil case. And in a statement, he says, \"This sweetheart deal fails to recognize that because of Boeing's conspiracy, 346 people died. This deceptive and generous deal is clearly not in the public interest.\" Of note here is that Boeing executives avoided criminal charges themselves. The Department of Justice says this deal gives them no immunity. That applies to the MAX 8 crashes as well as the door plug incident of earlier this year. Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
