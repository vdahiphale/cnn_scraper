CNN's Fred Pleitgen got a rare opportunity to grill the Belarusian leader about his relationship with Moscow. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  Vicious fighting in eastern Ukraine. His military so far repelling those Russian attacks here. And as Vladimir Putin's forces struggle losing both soldiers and armor, Putin's main ally, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, spoke to international media from one of the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine. An invasion that was started in large parts from his country. When I asked him why he still supports Putin's war, Lukashenko combative. ALEXANDER LUKASHENKO, PRESIDENT OF BELARUS (through translation): This is another rhetorical question. Why do you support Ukraine? Pumping it with weapons instead of sitting down to negotiate as I suggest? PLEITGEN (voice-over):  Lukashenko insist Belarus won't send troops to fight alongside Russia unless directly attacked by Ukraine. But says he still firmly stands by Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Lukashenko gets angry when I asked him if he's surprised by how weak Russia's army is. LUKASHENKO (through translation):  You must see this is the number one army in the world fighting against you. Americans and Europeans practically against NATO, using Ukrainians and the Ukrainians are not dumb. PLEITGEN (voice-over):  Many Belarusians oppose to Lukashenko have gone to Ukraine to fight against the Russian army. We are here to prove that we Belarusians are not our government. We don't want to be associated with that junta that seized the power in Belarus. I mean, the Lukashenko regime, this volunteer says. Near Bakhmut, they often face off against mercenaries from the Wagner Private Military Company. Wagner boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, recruited tens of thousands of convicts from Russian jails and brought them to the frontline. I asked Lukashenko how he feels about Russia using convicts as expendable fighters. LUKASHENKO (through translation):  Russia did indeed use convicts, but now this is forbidden. It is forbidden in Russia and Yevgeny Prigozhin, Wagner, are not doing this. It is forbidden. PLEITGEN (voice-over):  And what about the Russian defense ministry? They are using convicts now, I ask. LUKASHENKO (through translation):  The minister of defense? That's not true. The ministry of defense has enough mobilized resources and enough serviceman to create the special unit, if that's what they're doing. I will find out the answer to this question tomorrow. PLEITGEN (voice-over):  Lukashenko is meeting Vladimir Putin on Friday, but what Lukashenko really wants, he says, is to host peace talks with Putin, U.S. President Joe Biden and Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine and asked me to relay the message. LUKASHENKO (through translation):  If Biden has a desire, pass on to him through your channels that we are ready to welcome him in Minsk and have a serious talk with him if he wishes for peace in Ukraine. Even Putin will fly to Minsk and we can meet there, the three of us. Two aggressors and a piece-loving president. Why not? PLEITGEN (on camera):  But of course, the Ukrainians very much believe that Alexander Lukashenko is complicit in Vladimir Putin's war against the Ukraine. And Lukashenko did make clear at that press conference that he would continue to allow the Russians to use Belarusian territory to strike Ukraine. All eyes now on that meeting between Putin and Lukashenko to see how that could shape Belarus's involvement going forward. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Minsk. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And there are dozens -- thousands of families waiting for news of the loved ones, still hoping that they may be alive beneath the rubble. In fact, we have this emotional video, a 33- year-old man, who was pulled out of the rubble after 261 hours. And in this video, the first thing he does after being pulled out is call his friend whose number he had memorized. Take a listen to this emotional phone call.

Now, hoping among hope that their family, their relatives, their friends are still alive. As we continue to see the rescues taking place, look, the rescues are becoming few and far between.And really now here in Turkey, the focus is shifting somewhat to providing support for those who did survive. There is a huge amount of aid that needs to be distributed to those in southeast Turkey. The humanitarian situation there is extremely difficult. We've already heard from the United Nations Secretary Ggeneral Antonio Guterres now appealing for $1 billion in aid to support those in Turkey for the next three months. This comes after the U.N. has already appealed for nearly $400 million in support of people in Northwest Syria impacted by the earthquake. And in his statement, the U.N. Secretary General said that Turkey had taken in so many refugees, unfortunately the world's largest amount of refugees that now is the time for the world to stand behind Turkey. And as you've seen in our colleague's report by Jamana Karadsheh there in Southeast Turkey, the situation is very difficult. It is freezing. People do not have homes. They're sleeping in tents on the street. There's a dire need for food, for medication, for blankets, for clothes, and of course, we are now beginning to see people being evacuated to other cities including here in Istanbul. But this is going to be a long challenge ahead for the Turkish government and the need from the international community is only growing.",

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in the U.S. says the full self-driving system may not respond properly to traffic in intersections and certain traffic signals.

A leak in two Russian spacecraft will delay their return to Earth for astronauts on the International Space Station.  The first, a cargo ship docked at the space station was already supposed to act as a replacement vehicle. In December, it was found to be leaking coolant. Well then, leak was detected on the spacecraft meant to replace the first one. Russian engineers anticipated new rescue vehicle will be ready to launch in March. Until then, the crew on the space station will continue with normal activities. Well, seeing is believing or is it? I mean, that's the problem we now face as deepfakes become more popular.
