Yesterday, as CNN obtained shocking new video of rioters directly off the House floor on January 6 shouting at Capitol Police and Republican lawmakers, Trump attempted to twist the facts about the attack on the Capitol by his supporters, claiming that President Biden was the actual threat to democracy. While 1,265 of Trump's supporters have been charged for their criminal conduct that day, 718 have pleaded guilty, 171 have been found guilty at trial, including for such crimes as seditious conspiracy and using deadly weapons and attacking law enforcement officers, Trump is calling on Biden to release these criminals.

I mean, what I learned in our briefings in the south was that that fence line separating Israel from Gaza was breached in more than 90 different places simultaneously, paving the way for some 3,000 terrorists, heavily armed, to move into Israel. And, in fact, the briefings I received pointed out that, actually, the terrorists had sufficient armaments and supplies to literally march all the way here to Tel Aviv, all the way to Jerusalem. But, for the heroic efforts of police, IDF forces, and, frankly, courageous citizens, they were stopped from doing that. So I really believe that what Israel is doing in Gaza today is absolutely essential. It is a response to an invasion that was launched with the intention of beginning the process of destroying the Jewish state of Israel. And I really do believe that this is a moment where America needs to speak with one voice that we will stand with Israel today and tomorrow and every day until they have won outright this fight and eliminated the threat of Hamas.",

I saw many of them moving through the garage where I was spirited on the same day. And the truth is that this was a riot that should never have happened, that, as I have said many times before, the former president's words that day were reckless. I believe history will judge his role in that. But, at the end of the day, where I live every day and, frankly, the words of encouragement that I receive on a regular basis, as I know, by God's grace, we did our duty that day three years ago. But I will tell you, Jake, that I actually -- I understand why President Biden wants to focus his campaign on three years ago. The record of this administration has weakened America at home and abroad. And I actually don't think the election is going to be decided on a tragic day three years ago. I think it's going to be decided on the failed policies of the Biden administration that have emboldened the enemies of freedom around the world, that launched the worst inflation, that created the worst crisis on our border in American history. And it's one of the reasons why I continue to hope that, with the Iowa caucuses, New Hampshire just around the corner, that all the good Republican voters in those states will give our party a fresh start and give us new leadership to lead our party forward in the election and beyond.",

Joining us now, South Carolina Democratic Congressman Jim Clyburn. Congressman Clyburn, thanks for joining us. So let's start with President Biden's trip tomorrow to historic Mother Emanuel AME Church. What are you hoping to hear from President Biden?

JAMES CLYBURN (D-SC):  Well, thank you very much for having me, Jake. I think it is very clear that Donald Trump's utterances way back before Charlottesville or at the time of Charlottesville ties him to what happened at Mother Emanuel. The fact of the matter is, that young man went into that church's basement, joined with those worshipers in Bible study, and murdered them. And he said at the time that he was attempting to create a race war. But the people of Charleston, South Carolina, the families of the affected victims all came together to get beyond hate and reach out to help continue this pursuit of a more perfect union. Donald Trump looked at those people in Charlottesville and said that there were good people on both sides. And those people were uttering things like, \"Jews will not replace us.\" That is a religion. The AME Church Emanuel, that is religion.

Now, we have some laws in this country, the HIPAA laws, keep us out of people's medical businesses.

So, when you have someone running in the primaries -- we have got two or three people running in the primaries. We have got people running third-party tickets. At this particular juncture, these polls are not a true reflection of where voters are. I have seen polls that said, when you looked at people who say they will vote, Joe Biden beats Trump. Now, I don't pay attention to those things until we get a contest going forward and the primaries are behind us. But, having said that, when I talk with the president, I talk with him about my Rainey-Smalls project. Joseph Rainey was the first African- American to serve in Congress -- or to be elected to Congress here in the country. Robert Smalls -- everybody remembers Robert Smalls. For several years, I have had something I call my Rainey-Smalls project. I shared with President Biden what I did with that project. That project was the reason we were able to be as successful as we were several years ago with the primary and his contest here, when he won in South Carolina by 29 points.
