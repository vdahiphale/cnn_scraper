A majority of economists think there will be a recession in this year. The German Defense Minister resigns over a scandal. And Richard Edelman with me tonight on the trust barometer. We have a new snowman. The name is Marty. Marty will be with us all week, nose and all. I`m Richard Quest with Marty at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where together, we mean business. Good evening tonight from Davos and the WEF. I was just reflecting: Do you know, it`s been three years since we`ve actually been here in the winter? Well, now we`re all back and the world`s most powerful people gathered here, at least some of them up a Swiss mountain, and the object and the ambition to tackle the biggest global problems. It`s the first time since 2020 that we`ve been at the winter. A record 2.700 people are here, a cause for celebration, perhaps, but perhaps not because there is also great unease in the air. Leaders are preparing for a difficult year and there is a warning from the World Economic Forum that is adding to the anxiety. WEF has taken the temperature of private economists around the world, the banks and the like and the grim picture there is to show, almost two-thirds expect a global recession in 2023, and the number of people who say a recession is extremely likely has more than doubled since September to 18 percent. The reasons we know, high prices, tightening monetary policy, dramatically so and weakened demand are factors dragging economies. The OECD is pointing out the global economy is also reeling from the largest energy crisis since the 1970s and there are people here like me who remember that. A few months ago, the OECD downgraded world growth to just 2.2. So, I asked the Secretary-General, Mathias Cormann, who joined me earlier, if that number 2.2, does it still hold? (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATHIAS CORMANN, SECRETARY-GENERAL, OECD: We have not forecasted a global recession, but there are significant downside risks, which of course, we recognize and we have pointed to, which could still eventually, but what I would say is that since our last outlook, if anything, the environment, as far as energy prices, food prices, and so on are concerned has slightly improved.",

The chief executive of Austria`s biggest gasify OMV says thoughwinter warm weather means Europe will avoid an energy crisis this year. And economic anxiety is everywhere. That`s the message from the latest Edelman survey. The chief executive Richard Edelman will be with me, but only after the news headlines because this is CNN and on this network the news always comes to us. Officials now say at least 69 people were killed in Sunday`s plane crash in Nepal. Three people are still missing. The police say they`ve recovered the light box flight recorders from the aircraft. Authorities are working to find out what happened. Police have arrested the mafia boss Matteo Messina Denaro after 30 years manhunt. Denaro is as one of Europe`s most wanted men was captured at a private health clinic in Palermo in Sicily. In 1992 he was sentenced in absentia to life in prison for his role in the murder of two prosecutors. President Biden addressed the Martin Luther King breakfast in Washington, which is held each year to honor the civil rights leader on the holiday bearing his name. In his speech, President Biden said King`s life and legacy would help show us the way forward. Sunday would have been Dr. King`s 94th birthday. Now, don`t be fooled, I`m still wearing a coat, I`m not foolish, but I can`t afford to open it and I don`t need a hat. Because it has been unseasonably warm so far here in Davos. The snowfall has been unusually light. In fact, we didn`t really see snow until Landquart. Now all this might be changing. The temperatures around four degrees under zero. So tonight, it`ll be parky and there`s been a snow flurry or two with perhaps welcome for those hoping to get in some skiing. Europe has kicked off the new year with a heatwave. Eight countries have set record highs for the January 1st, and some countries are coming off their hottest year on record. This is not something to be applauded say the experts warm temperatures are a help for nations fearing an energy shortage to be sure only in the short term. Less heating means less energy use, which blunts Russia`s threat to cut off gas supplies. Austria`s energy company OMV has withdrawn from the Nord Stream 2 pipeline last year. The chief executive is Alfred Stern. He joined me here to talk about the impact. And if he thinks Europe`s energy crisis could be coming to an end. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
