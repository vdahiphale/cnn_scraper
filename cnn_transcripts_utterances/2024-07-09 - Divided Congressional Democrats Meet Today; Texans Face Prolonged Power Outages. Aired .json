Come on now, this is politics, John.But a couple of considerations that I think Mr. Nadler may have been - heard after he was - you know, had said one thing. Again, remember, the president has - not only did he get 14 million votes in our nominating process, which technically has ended. He has nearly 4,000 pledged delegates. And what that means is, these members of Congress, they don't get to vote until the second round of voting. So, that means as long as the president - and over the weekend there was a lot of checking in with those delegates. They are sticking with the president. So, technically, that means he's got the nomination, right? Second piece of this. What they may be able to talk about in this meeting is, sure, there are going to be some frontline Democrats who say, I'm concerned. But, guess what, they probably weren't going to be running with the president anyway. And so, strategically, people are going to have to do what they have to do to win. And, look, we've got to win the House and the Senate regardless of also winning the presidency if we're going to finish enacting the agenda that President Biden, Vice President Harris, have been running on.

We heard Mike Quigley say as he entered that he didn't think that Biden couldn't necessarily win this race against Donald Trump. We also heard, though, from others who say that they are hoping this is an opportunity for people who have concerns to vent those concerns and then perhaps walk out of this meeting united as a Democratic Party behind Joe Biden. But you know one thing to keep in mind here is the fact that all of this heartburn, all of this discussion about whether or not Joe Biden is up to the task does make it harder for Democrats to later on unify and rally behind the president because in some ways they have already started to question his ability to do this job, to keep this job, and I think that that is something that in talking with Democrats they are worried could play into Republicans' hands going into the November election. So, obviously, members here have very different views of what they hope comes out of this meeting. And as Tina Smith, a Democratic senator from Minnesota, put it to me last night, there really is no easy option right now. If they decide to stick with Biden, they have to defend him. They have to explain why some members had concerns in a matchup with Donald Trump. If they decide to move on, that unleashes an entirely complicated process that is completely unprecedented. So, that is what Democrats are dealing with this morning. Obviously, we're going to be watching very closely to see what Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader, tells his caucus in this meeting.

Obviously, Joe Biden adds a different dynamic. But the problem is, is that we keep forgetting, is that Joe Biden's policies are unpopular. There's a reason why two-thirds of the American people think the country's headed on the wrong track. And when you look at the polling averages, Joe Biden has 60, 65 percent disapproval on the economy, inflation, the border, foreign policy, crime. All of those are underlying reasons why Joe Biden is unpopular. The age issue is just adding another layer to it. So, whomever you're running against, the policies are going to be the same.

On top of the power outages and flooding, there's a heat advisory happening now. Temperatures may sweltered to more than 90 degrees, feeling like 105 degrees. Although downgraded to a tropical depression, Beryl still threatens the Midwest. Meteorologist Derek Van Dam is in Rosenberg, Texas. I know you are there with the folks that are going to be starting to fix this power problem, but it is widespread and it is dangerous temperatures that they're going to be dealing with.",

One that's only going to become more common as humans continue to warm the planet, helping fuel stronger storms like Hurricane Beryl.But in come the troops, the cavalry. You can see them behind me. We're at one of about a dozen staging areas. This is called a utility restoration staging area. It is a massive, multistate effort to restore power to the people. Obviously, that is the priority here to bring back electricity to the over 2 million customers without it here in the state of Texas before the heat sets in. So, the race is truly on. In Harris County alone, where Houston is located, 70 percent of customers without power. Take it from me. I drove around Houston this morning in the dark. Down trees, power lines. It was treacherous. And 2.3 million people across the state of Texas. And look, the heat that is moving in means that people will not have an opportunity to cool themselves or seek relief with air conditioning. Heat indices upwards of 105 degrees. That's why the National Weather Service issued this heat advisory for Houston and much of the eastern sections of Texas. And that is, of course, right where Hurricane Beryl barreled through the state only yesterday. Now, look at these feels like temperatures. That's when you factor in the temperature and the humidity. We're talking triple digit heats for so many locations and so many people here who do not have power at the moment. Now, across the state of Louisiana, they set a record number of tornado warnings from the Shreveport National Weather Service operations center. And, of course, with these tornadoes yesterday from Hurricane Beryl, knocked out power there as well. So, it's not just Texas. It's up through Arkansas, parts of Louisiana, and into other locations. So, this combination, Sara, is potentially deadly for people as they look to clean up their yard in the wake of Hurricane Beryl. Back to you.",
