The first population growth in half a century, the lowest number of homicides in half a century. That fake notorious derelict train station, I broke into it about ten years ago to tour the ruins of the train station. And it was a tragic thing. It has just been restored beautifully, and it's about to reopen. Detroit is now a magnet for attracting new artists. It is -- it is a great American turnaround story. So when you have to tell so many lies, when you have to bus in people, it tells me you probably don't have a lot of indigenous support in that town. And that tells me that, probably, these polls are reflecting a kind of disaffection with people who are bearing the brunt of price rises, but Trump just lies all the time. And we have to be very careful because, because of the code of our profession -- and it's a good code -- where the candidate speaks, and you report it. But when you've got a candidate who lies all the time, I mean, it raises a question that CNN is going to face with this coming debate, which is you're going to have this unprecedented event. You're going to have a president of the United States on a stage with a convicted criminal. I worry about the security implications of that. Are you going to do some kind of special pat-down to make sure he hasn't brought some kind of weapon with them that might harm the president?

Obviously, the issue that's top of mind for every voter, regardless of their demographic, is inflation. You know, cumulative inflation under Joe Biden is at almost 20 percent. That's not something that any working-class American wants to deal with. And I think that's what's fueling some of the support for Trump. As it relates to these specific topics, you know, there was a recent poll that came out from CBS that showed that over 60 percent of voters, Hispanic -- voters in general supported Trump's immigration policies. Over 50 percent of Hispanic voters support Trump's immigration policies. So I think that's something that's -- that a lot of minority voters are attracted to, and clearly, it's working.",

Their all-time record only 96, so they could beat that previous record by three degrees. And a lot of the Northeast is going to be feeling that heat.
