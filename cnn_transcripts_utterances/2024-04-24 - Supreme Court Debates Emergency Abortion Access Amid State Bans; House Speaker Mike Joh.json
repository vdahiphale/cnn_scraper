Whether her reproductive ability, whether she would have any kind of organ failure that doesn't rise to right, you know,  frankly, on death's doorstep, which is the you know, a finding that Idaho wants is that a woman has to, you know, there has to be a fear of death.

I am curious to get your perspective on the fact that Idaho's attorneys argued that this federal reading of the law doesn't conflict with the state's law. The federal government, through the Solicitor General, argued that there is a conflict, even though it is narrow. Where do you come down on this?",

Yes, this case is all about abortion and yes, we are back here talking about abortion after we just talked about the big Miffa-Pristone case, after the court in 2022 said we're getting out of the business of talking about state abortion bans. But this is a different question. It's all about whether or not this federal law that you heard Joan talking about, and this state law actually do conflict. Because if they do, then the answer is easy. Then we know that under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, it's the federal law that trumps, at least where there is a conflict.And that's why you have Idaho saying, these two things can live together. There's no problem. And that's why you have the Biden administration saying, only in these narrow exceptions, because Elizabeth Prelogar does understand that she doesn't want this to look like federal overreach, only in these narrow circumstances, there is a conflict. And therefore the federal law, which allows doctors to provide abortions, if it's stabilizing care, even if it's not health- saving care, the federal law would trump.",

So there was an important discussion just to your point about whether or not we would defer to doctors, for instance, that they in fact do need to perform an abortion because it is stabilizing care. And at what point would Idaho say, no, we're not deferring to you. We're not deferring to your good faith belief. And so there was this discussion about, do the doctors need to have a subjective or objectively reasonable belief that this is the type of care they need to provide? And the issue of prosecutorial discretion comes in where you heard the justices say, but what if a doctor says, I really believed it? Can the state prosecute anyway? And that's the question of prosecutorial discretion.Can a district attorney, can the attorney general say, we don't believe you, and therefore we are subjecting you to prosecution? And just the threat of that prosecution is where you can obviously see a real and immediate chilling effect on doctors. And that, of course, deeply affects women on the ground who are seeking medical treatment.",
