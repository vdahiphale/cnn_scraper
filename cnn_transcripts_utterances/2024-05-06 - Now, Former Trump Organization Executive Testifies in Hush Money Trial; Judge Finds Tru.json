I'm Kaitlan Collins in New York.A prosecution witness is right now walking the jury through how money changed hands inside of the Trump Organization. The important testimony follows an equally important ruling against the president from the bench, the former president, I should note. Judge Juan Merchan ruling that Donald Trump violated a gag order a 10th time, and that 11th time, if it does happen, could mean jail time potentially, that the judge said that is the last thing that he wants to do. I want to bring in David Markus, who is joining us. He is a criminal defense attorney. And, David, just as you're watching what has been argued here, and now that we have this former employee, who's retired, I should note, from the Trump Organization up there testifying, how is the defense watching this? Because they were complaining in court this morning that they didn't find out until late yesterday that this was going to be the witness on the stand this morning. Obviously, they'll get a chance to cross-examine them. What's it looking like for the defense overall, from your perspective?",

You would expect the prosecution to be winning after the first two, three weeks of trial. If they weren't, they'd be in big trouble.But the defense hasn't had a moment yet. They need that moment. Like when you were questioning J.D. Vance last week, or in the O.J. case when the glove didn't fit, there needs to be a defense moment that they can seize onto. They haven't had that yet. And so I think they're going to be pretty aggressive this week in questioning. They need to have one of those moments.",

The jury is looking for which story makes more sense.So, this witness is going to be important because as you say, that element about whether Trump knew about the entries, the false entries, is going to be the whole case. So, the fact that he's fighting on other things like regarding Stormy Daniels and others is odd to me. And I don't think that's a Todd Blanche-driven thing.

I mean, if Allen Weisselberg can't get on the witness stand because he's not a reliable witness viewed by the prosecution, and he's also in jail right now after allegedly lying on the stand, what -- could McConney connect him to that?

We called it legal expenses. He could get that out. But he'd have to testify in order to get that out and assert that as a defense. And if he didn't intentionally violate the law and say, I didn't know, I thought it was legal expenses. Yes, I paid Stormy Daniels back, but I thought I was paying him extra for the work that he did, and we coded it as legal expenses.

Because what she said is that Trump told her that he was aware of the payment, he knew that Michael Cohen did it, and said that Michael Cohen did it out of the goodness of his heart.And then he also told her that he was glad that that story didn't come out, that it was suppressed ahead of the campaign. And, again, that is significant because the reason that this is being charged as a felony is because prosecutors alleged that they don't have to prove that this was done to help his chances in the election, so that was critical and now prosecutors moving on to the heart of the case, the actual paperwork. And, again, it may not be the most riveting testimony, Mr. McConney has broken down on the stand, as you noted, but this is something that the prosecution absolutely has to nail down for the jury so they understand why they're sitting in this box.",

We've heard from David Pecker, to Rhona Graff, who, of course, who knew him very well. Now we've got this man, Jeffrey McConney, who is this person, the former Trump Organization comptroller, who actually cried on the witness after being on four days out of a six-week trial for the A.G., Letitia James. Now, why is it important to look at him? Because remember, go back to the indictment itself, there are 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. What does that have to prove? You got to prove not only the intent to defraud, commit another crime, aid, et cetera, but also made and caused a false entry of the business records. That is why we're really here and having this particular witness. And so what he can provide for everyone is not just only the intent, everything else, or the commission for a crime. This is really these two things here have to do with what happened already, excuse me, with weeks one and two. These people have talked about right here, catch and kill.

So, Cohen pays Stormy Daniels.Then the second transaction, and that's what they're talking about now, and this is where the heart of the crime really lies is in the Trump Organization reimbursing Michael Cohen. And the amount they reimbursed him was over $400,000. And part of the reason the prosecution's theory is they wanted to double him up basically so that he could pay whatever taxes he would owe as a result of having made the payment to Stormy Daniels. So, the numbers aren't going to match up here. The amount Michael Cohen was repaid was triple and then some more than he paid Stormy Daniels and the prosecution is trying to explain why it went down.",

The prosecution's goal is to make unbreakable links between how money flowed in and out of the Trump business to demand with his name on the door of, the former president of the United States.Let's bring in someone who is central to this hush bunny trial, Michael Rothfeld. He's a former reporter for The Wall Street Journal who helped break both the Karen McDougal story in 2016 and the Stormy Daniels story in 2018. We might not be here today, if not for the reporting coming from him and his colleagues. Michael, thank you very much for joining us. We should note you're now an investigative reporter for The New York Times and joins me from the New York Times newsroom. Your sense of how everything is playing out right now? I mean, a lot of these witnesses sound as though they're almost people who help manage Donald Trump's piggy bank as much as his whole business. But these alleged hush bunny payments to Stormy Daniels that you've been reporting on for years, is there anything in this trial that has jumped out that is new to you?",
