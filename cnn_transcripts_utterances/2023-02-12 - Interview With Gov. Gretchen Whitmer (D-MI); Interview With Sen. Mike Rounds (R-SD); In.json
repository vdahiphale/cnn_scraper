I'm Jake Tapper in Washington, where the state of our union is knowing the truth is out there.The U.S. military is trying to figure out what exactly they shot down over the frozen coast of Alaska on Friday afternoon and what else they shot down over Northern Canada on Saturday, the third time in eight days that a U.S. F-22 fighter jet has downed a flying object in North American airspace. President Joe Biden and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau authorized Saturday's operation, taking down an object that Canadians described as cylindrical and smaller than the suspected Chinese spy balloon and shut down February 4. Unlike that balloon, the second and third objects were both flying much lower, about 40,000 feet, close enough to be a threat to civilian aircraft. Anecdotally, a source said some pilots said the second object interfered with their sensors. And some pilots claimed not to have seen any identifiable propulsion, though U.S. officials could not confirm those details, but not much else is clear, as both the U.S. and Canadian government try to recover remnants and figure it all out. What we do know is that U.S. officials are on high alert for high-flying objects after the discovery of the spy balloon. Last night, the FAA briefly shut down Montana airspace after the military detected a -- quote -- \"radar anomaly,\" but pilots sent to investigate did not identify any object in the skies. Joining us now, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Mike Turner of Ohio. Chairman Turner, thanks so much for joining us. What can you tell us? What were the second and third objects that the military shot down, and where did they come from? REP. MIKE TURNER (R-OH):  Yes, well, I certainly don't know, as the administration is saying they don't know. They do appear somewhat trigger-happy, although this is certainly preferable to the permissive environment that they showed when the Chinese spy balloon was coming over some of our most sensitive sites. I think one thing that this shows is certainly the fallacy of the argument of the Biden administration saying that the height of the Chinese balloon caused them to have no concern, because certainly, as we know, whatever goes up can come down. And just saying that this Chinese spy balloon was high and these are lower, and, therefore, they actually pose a hazard really isn't a... (CROSSTALK)",

What's become clear in the public discussion is that we don't really have adequate radar systems. We certainly don't have an integrated missile defense system. We're going to have to begin to look at the United States' airspace as one that we need to defend and that we need to have appropriate sensors to do so.

From the press conference we saw, it does seem like they took this action without a real understanding for what they were going after, but having declared it a hazard. But we will see as the information comes to Congress. But I do think that there needs to be more engagement between the administration and Congress.

And, also, getting the data from the various planes, their sensors, what they actually were seeing or not seeing, in addition to what the pilots saw, will be really important.

We need more sophisticated radar systems. We have them. We just don't have them deployed to protect high over the United States.

We are fighting on the front lines of democracy. The fact that Zelenskyy has been -- as president, they -- will rally his country to fight against Russia, and we have been able to arm them, it is really unprecedented that a nation like that could stand to a superpower like Russia. But they're doing so with the commitment to keep the sovereignty of their nation. And Russia's atrocities are just appalling.

But, second of all, you have to do a little bit of looking at what longevity looks like and whether or not people, if they're living longer, do we have to plan to make sure that we have got the resources to be able to pay for those benefits long-term? There are some natural things that we have done in the past. We have looked at moving up by a couple of months the time period in which full benefits start. That's possibly something that we could look at in the future. There may be some possibilities of changing the amount of income which is subject to Social Security taxes. I think those are reasonable discussions to talk about, because, right now, we have some increases there built into the existing program. But let's not talk about significant stuff until we actually look at what the other alternatives are. We think that there are possibilities out there of long-term success without scaring people and without tearing apart the system and without reducing benefits. But it requires management. And it requires actually looking at and making things better. Look, in South Dakota, we have got the South Dakota retirement plan. It's one of the best plans in the entire nation.
