In a moment, a CNN exclusive, my wide-ranging interview with Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman. But first tonight, a mob marches through the heart of Fetterman's home state to send a message, Jews are not welcome. The protesters in Philadelphia veered from the political straight to the anti-Semitic when they swarmed Goldie. That's a kosher restaurant owned by an American Israeli chef, Michael Solomonov. Pennsylvania's governor says that the motive here is clear. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. JOSH SHAPIRO (R-PA): What we saw last night was not peaceful protest. What we saw last night, in my opinion, was blatant anti- Semitism. The purposeful gathering of a mob outside of a restaurant simply because it is owned by a Jewish person? Well, that's anti-Semitism, plain and simple. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In Gainesville, Florida, a Chabad Center in the University of Florida's campus, it was covered in anti- Semitic graffiti. Over in Brooklyn, Ohio, vandals painted red swastikas on graves in a Jewish cemetery. And on Friday night, right here on this show, we interviewed Congressman Adam Smith, whose home was marred by pro-Palestinian vandals. Now, peaceful protests, even passionate protests, is an American right. But Smith told us that he sees an overlap between these tactics and that of another group. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ADAM SMITH (D-WA): These are the same tactics that we saw in the most extreme form on January 6th. These tactics are not accidental. They are an attempt to intimidate people into silence, an attempt to overthrow democratic norms. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
