The chief also does not yet know what sparked this brutal beating of Nichols that followed the police chase and was caught on several cameras.Nichols' mother tells CNN that she could not bear to watch the video, but she did see the aftermath of what her son looked like in the hospital. Nichols' stepfather described what he saw in the video and how Tyre had to be propped up at one point. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RODNEY WELLS, TYRE NICHOLS' STEPFATHER: An officer walked over to him and said sit back up. I'm up. I'm out, you know, and while he's handcuffed so he had a popping back up and he's slumped over again. And they pop him back up again. But no one was rendering aid. I saw some fire department people come out there and they just walked around and nobody showed him the aid and they were supposed to be trained to first aid. By the time that -- (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But we're hearing a lot from community leaders and we're hearing -- obviously just heard from the family members of Tyre Nichols and the lawyer. And significant in that, yes, they are happy. They are happy to see the district attorney move ahead with charges. And that they are happy with the way the police chief here has been handling this. But they are calling for more changes. And they are specifically calling for reform within the police department. They say they need to disband -- get rid of this unit that these officers were part of called the Scorpion Unit. And they say, the lawyers, that they have evidence of other people who've had horrific interactions with the Scorpion Unit. And as a result of that, they are calling on the Memphis Police Department to disband this unit now. We heard from the police chief this morning. In her first interview, our Don Lemon interviewed her, she explained how they are looking. They've been trying to figure out why the police in the first place even stopped Tyre Nichols.

This narrative that they have been using a level of force that's beyond that, which is allowed by that police department and allowed by the constitution. So, we're hearing two sides to whether this unit is effectively -- one either helping protect and serve in that Memphis community or if they are engaging in the kind of conduct that we are going to see in this video.But I think, again, Alisyn, the bigger issue is, police don't solve crimes -- police don't stop crimes, they solve crimes, I should say. What we have refused to do in this country is really look at the systemic issues of crime and invest in those things that we know can prevent crime, such as education and mental health, and other things. So, we keep finding ourselves right back here asking the questions about how do we change policing, particularly when we know that so many of the individuals that die in the hands of police are young African American men. I saw a statistic that the police killed more people in 2022 and -- than any recent decade and that 26 percent of those people killed by police who are African American, even though we only represent 13 percent of the population in this country.

So, let's get right to CNN's Hadas Gold. Hadas, what are you learning?HADAS GOLD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Alisyn, we're learning that this shooting actually took place at a synagogue in northern Jerusalem in a neighborhood called Neve Yaakov. Israeli policing that around 8:15 is when the shooting began. I should also note it's Shabbat. It's the Sabbath here, so many people would be at the synagogue praying on a Friday night. So, the shooting began around 8:15. All we know so far is that eight were dead, there several more injured in critical condition. This is a quickly developing situation, obviously. But this shooting comes at what has been an incredibly violent and tense 36 hours or so for this region. So, while it's definitely a shock that this is happening, and such an attack is happening on a synagogue, the air has been tense here, I can say, for 36 hours or so after a deadly Israeli military raid in Jenin in the occupied West Bank yesterday. That killed at least nine Palestinians. And while militants were among those killed, at least one civilian a woman in her 60s was killed in that ensuing firefight. There were sort of a cascading amount of events that happened after that, including in the evening rockets that were fired from Gaza into Israel by militants. Israel responding with airstrikes in Gaza. And now tonight, we're getting this, this shooting attack. And I have to say, Alisyn, this is the biggest attack targeting Israelis in recent years, definitely in Jerusalem. I'm thinking back to 2008 when eight students were shot and killed. So, this is reaching quite big proportions. And this is a big question for this brand-new Israeli Government. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was just reelected. He has the most right-wing government in Israeli history. There will be a big question to them about how they will respond to this. Because there will be a response but the question is, what will that response look like under this new government and under Benjamin Netanyahu?",
