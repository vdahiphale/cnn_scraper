      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to CNN Newsroom. I'm Max Foster in London.Just ahead, thousands of ethnic Armenians flee the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh after Azerbaijan's lightning offensive there. Then Russian strikes force a ferry crossing between Ukraine and Romania to close as the Kremlin continues its relentless assault. And a surge of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border leaves Texas town scrambling. We'll explore how they're responding. The mass exodus out of Nagorno-Karabakh is picking up pace as ethnic Armenians flee the breakaway enclave. Armenia says more than 13,000 people have arrived following Azerbaijan's brief but bloody offensive last week that killed more than 200 people and returned control of Nagorno-Karabakh to Baku. The enclave is home to 120,000 ethnic Armenians. Adding to the misery, at least 20 people are dead, hundreds are wounded after an explosion Monday evening at a gas station in Nagorno-Karabakh. Many of the injured were taken to the hospital via helicopter. Scott McLean has been following all of this. Have we got a sense of how things are going to work in that enclave now?",

      "sentences": "Yes, I think that's the big question and I think it's useful to sort of remind our audience who actually owns this piece of territory. It is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan. But because it is majority ethnic Armenian, they have exercised some level of self-governance, obviously, ties to Armenia as well. And they've operated in sort of this gray area for more than two decades, a fragile gray area that came to a head in 2020 when there was this brief war that ended in this ceasefire where Armenian troops agreed to withdraw from the area, but they still left the local troops commanded by the local leadership there.This time around last week, this 24-hour lightning offensive, those troops were clearly outgunned, clearly outmanned, this ceasefire agreement. They've agreed to dissolve the Armed Forces entirely. The Azeri government would also like to see the local government also disassembled, I suppose. And so there's plenty of question marks now about how things will go from now, how people will be treated, especially those who may have served in the Armed Forces and people are being left with this choice, essentially stay in a place where they've been rooted for decades or centuries and live under Azeri rule or go to Armenia. Many are choosing to go to Armenia. As you said 13,500 thus far and some of those who are arriving we know say, that, look, they figure they will never be back. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SRBUHI, NAGORNO-KARABAKH RESIDENT (through translator): No, no, no, no one is going back. That's it. We are over this care back topic for good, I think. Unless the world turns upside down and everything is good again for everyone, everywhere, because right now the world is a complete mess. No one knows what's going on, but maybe we will have some kind of a payback. Although that is not possible, just not possible. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We've seen new video showing this mountain pass jammed up with cars that are frankly not moving at all or moving maybe very, very slightly. No one is going anywhere anytime soon.In fact, CNN has been in touch with one family who left very early this morning to try to get out of Nagorno-Karabakh to go to Armenia. They waited for six, seven hours. They moved about 50 meters or so. And so, they've decided to turn back. They're going to try their luck again tomorrow. Adding to the misery, obviously, is the fact that you had this gas fuel depot explosion yesterday, where you had 20 people injured, some 300 -- almost 300 people injured -- 20 people killed I should say, almost 300 people injured. And because of bad weather and obviously the dicey situation on the ground, it has been very difficult to get people out. The local officials are trying to prioritize not private vehicles but the injured in getting out. Just this morning, the very first helicopter carrying some of those injured arrived on Armenian soil. The cause? We still don't know. The local leadership in Nagorno- Karabakh, though, says that, look, there's zero chance that this was terror-related in any way.",

      "sentences": "Well, right now, the most thing that we're focusing on is that new video that just came out that the Russians have posted of Admiral Victor Sokolov, apparently taking part in that meeting of the defense minister Sergei Shoigu and some of the other top generals of the Russians that appeared to show Admiral Sokolov in one of those little screens as that meeting was going on.Now, of course, this comes after the Ukrainians claimed that he was killed in those strikes that they conducted on the Sevastopol headquarters of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Navy last Friday. Recall that the Russian -- that the Ukrainians said that they had hit that Black Sea Fleet headquarters with some cruise missiles and that 34 senior officers had been killed, including the commander of the Black Sea Fleet, Victor Sokolov. Now, we did say yesterday when the Ukrainians came out with this claim, Ukrainian military intelligence, they really hadn't offered any sort of evidence to back that up, that Sokolov was really killed in that strike. The Russians, however, over the past 24 hours, since the Ukrainians first made that claim, also didn't come up with any sort of denial. In fact, this morning on a conference call with the Kremlin and some journalists, so the spokesman for the Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, he was asked about all this, and he also said that he couldn't comment and that this was fully in the realm of the military. So now, the Russians coming out with this video, still having not commented on it. Certainly, that does seem to show Admiral Victor Sokolov there at that meeting. Again, impossible once again to completely verify whether or not it is him, but certainly, some pretty clear messaging from the Russians that he is -- or they say that he is very much alive. At the same time, you do have that situation that obviously is going on, especially there in the Black Sea with the -- or around the Black Sea with the Russians apparently attacking some places around Odesa. That, of course, is something that we have seen over the past couple of days. We had that massive attack involving cruise missiles and drones just a day ago, and now it seems as though the Russians trying to keep up that pressure and hitting more targets in the Odesa region. So that -- certainly, that seems to be going up or continuing all this as the Ukrainians, Max, say that they are still making progress on the battlefields here in Ukraine. Of course, the main thrust considers to be -- continues to be in the south of the country. However, at the same time, the Ukrainians also saying in the east where I am right now that they are also making progress there and certainly keeping the pressure on the Russians, Max.",

Navalny's team says the hearing to appeal his latest sentence on extremism charges has moved behind closed doors. A Russian court handed down a new 19-year sentence last month. That's on top of an 11.5 year sentence he was already serving. In 2020, Navalny was the victim of a suspected poisoning whilst on a flight to Moscow. He spent months recovering in Germany before he returned to Russia in early 2021, where he was immediately arrested. A CNN investigation with Bellingcat found that there was evidence that before Navalny fell ill, he was being followed by agents from Russia's security service.

The lawsuit claims Giuliani and others caused total annihilation of his digital privacy and violated computer privacy laws in an effort to hack his devices.CNN has reached out to Giuliani for comment on that. U.S. lawmakers got back to work today or they go back to work today after a long weekend, pondering whether the rest of the federal government should keep on working. If Congress fails to pass new spending measures, the government will shut down on Saturday. The biggest hurdle is the House, where some hardline Republicans are holding up short-term funding bills. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy could go to Democrats for help, but doing so would almost certainly mean the end of his speakership. As for President Joe Biden, he's spending today visiting picket lines in Michigan, where autoworkers are on -- were on strike. Let's go straight to our Congressional Correspondent Lauren Fox. It just seemed difficult to imagine a situation through this deadlock around the budget. What do you think is going to happen?",

      "sentences": "Yes, you know, one Republican that I talked to last week on the House Rules Committee said at this point, the only way out of this crisis is through this crisis. And that really speaks to the point that you're making here, Max, that it's very hard to see how House Republicans rally around any spending package, get the votes for any spending package and have a real negotiation with the U.S. Senate at this point, which brings us to the most likely outcome.Senate negotiators, both Republicans and Democratic leadership and their teams, they are trying to find a path forward on what we know now is likely going to be a 45-day short-term spending package that negotiators say would fund the government and get them past the September 30th deadline. Now, a few question marks still remain in that negotiation. Will they include any of the $24 billion in Ukraine funding that the White House has requested? Will they include billions of dollars in disaster funding that is so important to so many lawmakers whose states have been affected by floods, wildfires, tornadoes, et cetera? So those are some of the big looming questions. One of the obstacles to including Ukraine funding at this point is you have senators like Rand Paul who are arguing that if Ukraine funding is included, they will slow walk this process. And given the fact that we have a time constraint right now, that there are five days until the government shuts down, you are in a situation where there may not be time to work through the Senate process and ensure that you avert a shutdown. So one of the things that lawmakers are looking at is maybe you have a shorter spending package, 45 days long that doesn't include everything they hoped for. Then you can get to the bigger questions about Ukraine funding and disaster aid in a larger package. But again, that just means we could be doing this again very shortly Now, once the Senate passes that, assuming they could, they'll send it over to the House of Representatives. Then it's up to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy to decide. Does he put it on the floor, risk losing his speakership because it would work with Democrats? Or does he not put it on the floor of the House and risk a shutdown and all the political implications that could come from that? Max?",
