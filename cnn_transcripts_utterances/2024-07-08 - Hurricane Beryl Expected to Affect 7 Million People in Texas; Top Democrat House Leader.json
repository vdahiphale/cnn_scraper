We weren't expecting what we got last night, let's just say. Celebrations, though, here in Paris on the streets as the election results were announced. (VIDEO PLAYING) A jubilant crowd gathered in the central part of the city to celebrate on Sunday, and police had to finally use tear gas to disperse them.

President Emmanuel Macron's centrist Ensemble Alliance got 163 seats. Marine Le Pen's far right National Rally and its allies came in a third at 143.

Since then, Israel and the Iran backed militia in southern Lebanon have been engaged in tit-for-tat attacks that still threaten to boil over. Tens of thousands either side of the border have been displaced.On Sunday, Israel said Hezbollah anti-tank missiles injured a soldier and two civilians, one of whom is a U.S. citizen. The 31-year-old man who suffered shrapnel injuries to his upper body was operated on and was initially said to be in a serious but stable condition. The hospital treating him later said his health had worsened. The attacks came a day after Israel said it killed a senior Hezbollah operative in an airstrike in northern Lebanon. Meanwhile, CIA Director Bill Burns heads back to Doha this week to resume talks aimed at securing a ceasefire and the release of hostages still held in Gaza. An official familiar with the meeting told CNN he'll meet with his counterparts from Egypt and Israel, as well as the Qatari prime minister, amid rising hopes that a deal may be close. This comes after a senior Hamas official told CNN it's considering dropping its demand that Israel agree to a permanent cessation of hostilities from the very start. A red line for Israel. Under pressure from protesters to do a deal, but mindful that it could cause his far- right allies to bolt from his coalition, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office issued a statement on Sunday insisting on four points. Firstly, that any deal will allow Israel to resume fighting until all of the objectives of the war have been achieved. Secondly, that there'll be no smuggling of weapons to Hamas from Egypt over the Gaza border. Thirdly, that there'll be no return of thousands of armed terrorists to the northern Gaza Strip. And finally, that Israel will maximize the number of living hostages who will be released from Hamas captivity. Israel believes there are still 116 hostages in Gaza who were kidnapped on October the 7th, around a third of whom are believed to be dead. Elliott Gotkine, CNN, London.",

The euro did dip a little against the dollar on all of these results and partly, Max, because while the far right's majority has been avoided, you are now looking at a divided parliament, essentially. You're looking at instability in terms of being able to implement policy, And also a lot of friction within that parliament as well. You've got Macron, of course, wanting to implement pro-business market reforms, labor market reforms, especially, and he really needs to get a rain in on spending and reduce what is a huge deficit in France and a big concern of the E.U. in Brussels. But, now, of course, you have this far -- not far -- this left alliance within the bloc and that means that they will want to implement spending policies they could do policies are actually not help at all in terms of the French deficits situation.

Narendra Modi has left for Moscow. It's going to be an overnight visit there.But it is clear that the relationship has taken a hit in some regard as a result of brushes invasion of Ukraine in 2022, because the last time the two leaders met face-to-face, this was last year, Modi made a point of saying to Putin that today's era is not of war. It was kind of a subtle way of criticizing the ongoing war there. But as you pointed out, the relationship, the alliance between these two countries really goes back generations and India has traditionally purchased weapons from Russia. They work together during the Cold War. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as Moscow has been increasingly isolated by the West, India has taken advantage of discount supplies of oil from Russia and the bilateral trade has really surge. That's gotten really one way with India are buying huge amounts of energy from Russia and the Indian foreign ministry says that the bilateral trade has surged to $65 billion in 2023, 2024, but its almost all going into India. There is a huge trade imbalance and they do expect the two sides to discuss that in-person, perhaps at the face-to-face private dinner that's expected tonight or at more formal talks that will be held in Moscow on Tuesday. A huge elephant in the room is Vladimir Putin's growing alliance and partnership with China's Xi Jinping. Why is that important? Well, the relations between India and its neighbor China has been on the rocks since 2020 when there were deadly skirmishes in the Himalayas on the contested border between the two countries. They are not getting along. And so, India has looked with concern at the blossoming -- blossoming alliance between the two countries. In fact, Narendra Modi skipped last week, Shanghai Cooperation Organization meeting in Kazakhstan and that seen in some ways, as a snub against Xi Jinping, which kind of dominates that organization. One other area where there's a bit of friction is the fact that Indian citizens have popped up in the Russian military fighting in the war in Ukraine.

The western U.S. in particular has been dealing with an unrelenting and rather dangerous heat wave. Excessive heat alerts remain in effect for more than 50 million people across the region this week, the heat has proven deadly in California. A motorcyclist is dying from heat exposure in Death Valley on Sunday, that's according to the National Park.The temperature reached a record 128 degrees Fahrenheit the second day in a row, that Death Valley set a new record. CNN's Natasha Chen is in Los Angeles with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NATASHA CHEN, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  People are trying to cool off any way they can, including coming to this Hansen Dam Aquatic Center, which has a capacity for 3,000 people at this pool hours after the gates open, there are still people in line waiting to get in. We talked to the first person in line who waited two-and-a-half hours just to be the first one and make sure that he got a shape at spot. Here's how he described how this heat wave in pairs to previous years living in the San Fernando Valley.",

When it's winter, it's cold -- it's colder, because we're in a bowl, San Fernando Valley is a bowl. So all the air either gets flies right over us, which is what's happening here. And then the heat sticks here. And then in the winter, it just slams in here, so it's one of the two of extremes all the time.",

This has been a very dangerous stretch, especially considering the duration of this heat wave going into potentially midweek in many places, Death Valley reaching, the high 120s, even reaching 130.And authorities are very concerned about emergency room visits as well. The CDC and other federal agencies have been marking data the on how many, what percentage of total ER visits are heat-related illnesses and those numbers have gone up over the last couple of days also, very dangerous conditions its for fires that are burning all up and down the West Coast. You've got the lake fire in Santa Barbara County, the basin fire over by Fresno of both growing to 13,000, 14,000 acres. So really dangerous conditions for firefighters as well as everyday people just trying to stay out of the heat. Lifeguards here telling us that they've got a difficult job keeping track of so many people, what they're trying to do is just make sure that there are enough adults to children ratio, to make sure the kids are supervised, to make sure everyone is hydrated because they don't want people passing out, which has happened in the past.

I don't know exactly how old I was at the time, but to me he seemed like an old man, so I figured I could be in an old man and a foot race and we set off ready set go, and we took off and I thought I had them for a moment, but then he pretty easily caught up to me and pass me and won the race. So I was really upset or sorry that I didn't have a story to tell that I was hoping to be able to tell my friends at school that id beat the former fastest man in the world. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
