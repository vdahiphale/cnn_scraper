We're getting new video showing the catastrophic damage as people dig through the rubble searching for bodies. We do not know yet who is responsible. Isn't the same camp that Israeli forces struck yesterday.We're also covering a huge breakthrough. Civilians are now leaving Gaza for the first time since Hamas attacked Israel. Hundreds of foreign nationals and injured Palestinians are waiting to move through the crucial Rafah border crossing. U.S. officials believe more than 5000 could ultimately be allowed to leave as part of a deal brokered by Qatar. We have CNN reporters across the region, covering the latest on all of these stories. Melissa Bell is in Cairo. We start with Jeremy Diamond who is near the Gaza border in Ashkelon. Jeremy, what do we know about this second blast today?",

      "sentences": "Well, Dana, for the second day in a row, a massive blast appears to have hit the Jabalia refugee camp inside Gaza. This is the largest refugee camp in Gaza, historically linked to refugees who fled the 1948 war and were displaced as a result of that war.This blast as of now, we understand there is catastrophic damage at this site. It happens in the Fallujah neighborhood of the Jabalia refugee camp. And the images of the destruction are very similar to the images that we saw yesterday in the Jabalia refugee camp. In that strike yesterday, we believe based on eyewitness accounts and doctors at a nearby hospital that hundreds of individuals were injured and killed in that strike. As of now the Israeli military has not confirmed whether or not they were responsible for this latest blast. But of course, it does happen as the death toll inside of Gaza, Dana, is rising, continuing to rise with more than 8700 people, having been killed thus far in these three plus weeks of war inside the Gaza Strip. Far too many of them, Dana, as you know, include them -- include women and children. BASH: And Jeremy more broadly, what is the IDF saying about just how far they are pushing into Gaza as part of this military incursion that they're involved in?",

They have made it several miles at least, on the northwestern part of Gaza along the coastline.We also know that they're making another axis of advanced on the northeastern quarter of Gaza. And also, true, tanks have been spotted at the southern end of Gaza city along the main road at a main junction there. And so, it's very clear that IDF troops are moving in towards Gaza city, which is a Hamas stronghold. Today, Dana, we also saw artillery positions, we went to several artillery positions along the border with Gaza. And what we could see is that several of the artillery positions that were further back, those who have been vacated by troops instead, it appears that some of these artillery positions are moving closer to the Gaza Strip to provide a support, artillery support to those troops who are inside. We know that in this war, perhaps more than any other conflict involving Israel and Hamas, Israeli troops are really making a pretty heavy use of close air support and also calling in artillery fire on specific Hamas targets. They identify these targets. They call in that air support. And then whether it is air support or fighter jets or Apache helicopters then striking those targets. Dana?",

But we understand that that's going up foreign or dual nationals. We don't have their nationalities. But these are some of the first civilians to be allowed out.What's been remarkable about the Rafah crossing and we spent much of the day there. Yesterday is how little has gotten through, either aid getting in, or indeed anyone coming out. Until now, we've really only seen a handful of hostages released through this crossing so closed, had it remained because of the huge complication of the many parties that need to be involved in anyone getting through. And that is, of course, Israel, Hamas, Egypt, at this mediation through Qatar and in coordination with the United States, really a remarkable breakthrough the way and we're ready to go window this morning. That will allow all of the foreign and dual nationals that are trapped inside to make their way through the crossing are really remarkable development, of course, huge relief for the families who are waiting for news of their loved ones. There is also as part of the deal, the possibility for the most severely wounded Palestinians to get out, to get emergency medical treatment. 81 are expected to make their way to the crossing day. They're being taken to a field hospital. Egyptians have setup nearby. But again, we are talking about the lucky few. What we've also been hearing from the crossing today is that a further 28 trucks have gone in, Dana, that is a tiny proportion of what is needed inside. So, the people that you're seeing coming through the Rafah crossing today, and that you're going to continue seeing over the coming days, including those American nationals are people that have been hoping, waiting to get through now since this conflict began. They'd been told early on to head south and that they would get through. They're finally getting through, but it has been a long and difficult wait, Dana?",

Lieutenant General Hertling is a former Commanding General for Europe and the Seventh Army. Nice to see you again. I appreciate you coming on. Can we just start where we ended with Melissa and talk about the fact that you do have foreign nationals leaving the Palestinian territory, leaving Gaza, I should say. And how long it has taken for this to happen?LT. GENERAL MARK HERTLING, FORMER COMMANDING GENERAL EUROPE AND SEVENTH ARMY: Yes. I believe, Dana, that this is a strategic move by Hamas. They are releasing international citizens as more condemnation comes against Israel by the world for some of the strikes. So, they see it appropriate to garner more support for what they're doing and to heat more damage on the Israelis for continuous bombing and the kinds of attack. So, the combination of releasing international citizens from Gaza, and also the potential for releasing international hostages, non-Israeli hostages. I think it's part of the strategic plan by Hamas.",

We don't know who is responsible for that.But going back to one of the things you said, let's just focus on what happened yesterday, because we have more information about that, about sort of the crater here and about the tunnels. And what it tells you that that this blast was so big and so deep. What it tells you about how deep these tunnels likely are, where Hamas was potentially, where the leadership was located, where some of their, maybe some of their headquarters are even located.",

The Israeli intelligence have had this kind of information in 2014. They went into some of these tunnels in 2021. The last time Israel went into Gaza, and they were amazed at how you basically had an underground city.So, there are the passageway, there also rooms. Places where Hamas can store ammunitions that have been built up. And they are about from all indicators between 100 to 150 feet underground. So, you have to have a pretty large penetrator to get there. And I think, after three or four weeks, based on what they learned in 2014, 2021, and now today with intelligence gathering, Israel knows that that these tunnels are extensive. They're moving fighters around under the cities, and they are in areas like this neighborhood, and also underneath hospitals that have not just human beings have shield, protective facilities as shields, hospitals, schools, neighborhoods. So, all this is part of the way Hamas fights using that victim doctrine that I've mentioned before. BASH: Yes. It's so manipulative, and so crass. And I mean, I kind of think of another word to describe the notion of doing that to your own people, evil, evil, evils, people will do it. General, thank you so much for your expertise.

So, these concerns go all the way up to President Biden, who was also discussed this with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu even this weekend. In their call, again, saying that Israel has the right to defend itself, but that they also need to make sure that they are protecting innocent civilians at all costs. Now, aides to the president believe that these warnings are best stress and are most effective in those private conversations that they have with their Israeli counterparts. But the reality here for the White House is that they are facing this public outrage over the destruction in Gaza, the dire humanitarian crisis there, and that all of this risks are eroding international support for Israel at a time where they need it. And so, all of that is what the president is keenly aware of, and White House officials are monitoring as this continues to unfold. Dana?",

He was incredibly clear about what Israel could and should do, which is whatever they feel that they need to do. And his rhetoric has changed just a bit in recent times. I want our viewers to listen to some of the differences.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, 46TH U.S. PRESIDENT: Israel has the right to defend itself and its people, full stop, let there be no doubt. The United States has Israel's back. We will make sure the Jewish and Democratic state of Israel can defend itself today, tomorrow, as we always have. If you have an opportunity to alleviate the pain, you should do it, period. And if you don't, you're going to lose credibility worldwide. We also have to remember that Hamas does not represent.

However, it is very clear that the damage in Gaza is wearing on the psyche of the world. It is horrifying to see bodies of children pulled from the rubble, it just is no matter, you know, who you are or where you come from. And it does seem to me that there are a couple of things. I mean, there's geopolitical pressure on the president, on the United States and on Israel, to do a little bit more to try and minimize these casualties. But as you point out, there is increasing -- that there's an increasing challenge from President Biden's left and he comes out of an old school.

One thing I would point out, is that not everybody in the western world, said it was OK to criticize these terrorists who went into Israel, including some Democratic members of Congress. There was a resolution that passed overwhelmingly last week, standing with Israel, but also criticizing the notion of terrorism about, you know, beheading babies.And there were a number of Democrats who either voted no or voted present, and you see them on the screen there. And they might be a sort of a small minority within the Democratic Party, but they represent a very vocal group of progressives out in the world and America right now. LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, PBS NEWSHOUR: And I think that some of those Democrats would say that the reason that they voted no, in part was because of their very strong criticisms of the Israeli government, not because they don't think that it was a massacre, which some of those Democrats have said that it was a massacre that occurred and condemn the action of Hamas. Because they are very strongly against the actions of Netanyahu and what they see as his even degradation of Israel's democracy, and then his forceful attack now on Gazans and on civilians. But you're right, Dana, which is at the president has may not have shifted his position. But he has shifted his rhetoric. And he has started to say more and more, and so have his national security advisors. And so, his Secretary Blinken, all of them across the board have started to say, more and more that they think that there could be -- it could be a time for a pause in the fighting. They will not call for a ceasefire at all at this point, but that they think that there should be a pause. John Kirby at the NSC, just said that yesterday, because they are very aware of the fact that that scene these dead civilians in Gaza is something that that they don't want to see and that they don't want to be.",

And we have to understand the situation. The IDF right now is fighting in face-to-face combat with Hamas terrorists inside Jabalia.They're running into tunnels, underneath medical clinics, inside universities, all of a sudden you see, want the terrorists that are going into schools, they don't come out again, because there's a terror network underneath. And what we saw yesterday, when we eliminated one of their top terrorists, is that there was a second implosion of an entire tunnel network. And this is the same network that we see Hamas taking selfies of themselves, running on their way to carry out terrorist attacks in Israel. They purposely put it there.
