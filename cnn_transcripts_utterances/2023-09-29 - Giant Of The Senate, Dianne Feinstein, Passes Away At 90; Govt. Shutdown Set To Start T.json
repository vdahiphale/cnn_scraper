Now this procedural vote at the moment, they have the votes to advance it to the final vote. Now that doesn't mean this is good news for the speaker. In fact, a number of these members who are opposed to speaker spending plans made clear that they're OK voting going forward on this procedural vote.But they plan to vote no, in sync the bill this afternoon to keep the government open just for a handful of weeks because of their opposition to vote the way the spending issues have been handled here and their demands to instead move forward with longer term funding bills. Meaning, Congress could be staring at a government shutdown, barreling into a government shutdown by Sunday morning because of this impasse. Now, the question for the speaker all along is what is next. He is still trying to get the votes for this Republican led bill. He is refuses to entertain publicly or even privately to some of his colleagues. What he will do if the bill does indeed fall collapsed this afternoon, which pretty much everybody here on Capitol Hill expects him, whether he will actually cut a deal with Democrats. I asked the speaker, why not cut a deal with Democrats at this moment? And he had some strong words saying, that he is not ready to surrender. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY, (R-CA): Yes, it's easy. It's easy to surrender. If you want to surrender, yes. But if you want to fight for the American public, to secure our borders and keep government open, how is that a problem? It's only for CNN that that becomes a problem, that I don't surrender to the liberals. What I want to do is stand for America. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That if you were to cut a bipartisan deal, that could be enough to sinking, push him out of the speakership and call for a vote for his ouster. The speaker is consistently downplayed that that's been part of his calculation, but that there's no question about it, that is hovering over the speaker at this moment. And Dana, in a clear sign that Republicans expect this key vote in the afternoon to fail to keep the government open, even as this procedural vote succeeded. They do expect the underlying bill to fail this afternoon. The House GOP plans to meet behind closed doors this afternoon to talk about their way forward. They would not be having that kind of meeting if they had the votes to succeed here. So, a lot of moving parts here is so much is hanging, so many people are watching to see what Washington does as a government shutdown seems more real by the moment. Dana?",

The first woman to serve as San Francisco mayor, the first woman elected to the Senate from California, the first woman to sit on the Senate Judiciary Committee, the first woman to chair the Senate Rules Committee and co- chair, the Inaugural Committee and of course, the first woman ever to chair the important Senate Intelligence Committee. Feinstein was without a doubt an American original, whose career was powered by the pain of a tragedy. She said, she could never unsee the lifeless body of one of the first openly gay politicians in America, Harvey Milk. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LATE. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, FORMER MAYOR OF SAN FRANCISCO: The door to the office opened and he came in. I heard the door slam. I heard the shots. I smelled the cordite. He whisked by. I walked down the line of supervisors' offices and found Harvey Milk, put my finger in a bullet hole, trying to get a pulse. It was the first person I'd ever seen shot to death. And that began a saga. I became mayor as a product of assassination of the mayor being killed, and the first openly gay public officials being killed by a friend and colleague of mine.

Why is that every man comes before me and says, nice lady, you really don't know. (END VIDEO CLIP) BASH: As you saw there, Feinstein was really no nonsense. A dogged advocate for her causes. She held her own government to account namely the Central Intelligence Agency, the entire intelligence community. Feinstein built bridges too in her own party, most famously hosting a smooth things over summit in 2008 for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton after their long and bitter presidential primary. She talked often about the isolation, the partisanship that pervades this town brings. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LATE. FEINSTEIN: This is a lonely place. Washington is a hard place. It is the most partisan place I've certainly ever been in. And there is a mean edge to that partisanship, our solidarity, our ability to break through it, our ability to be human in each other's company.

She would say later, and she said she wasn't listening in. But you have to wonder about that. But the reality was that meeting, and of course, she endorsed Senator Clinton, she endorsed Clinton campaign. But she knew Senator Obama a bit, but he was brand new to the Senate, basically, and they had only served a short time. But as she talked to reporters about it the next day, she said there were some nerve endings that needed to come together, this needed to end in a positive way. At her core, she was a Democratic Party stalwart. So that certainly was a very important meeting.
