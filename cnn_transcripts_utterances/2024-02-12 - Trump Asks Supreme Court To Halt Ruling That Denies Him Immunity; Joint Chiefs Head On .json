      "sentences": "OUTFRONT nextBreaking news, Trump taking his case to the Supreme Court, a last ditch effort to press his claim of total immunity as president. This as he's looking to slow down the Georgia election trial. Can he keep any of them from coming to a verdict before the election? Plus, the backlash building. The Joint Chiefs of Staff tonight slamming Trump's threat to abandon NATO. The former director of the CIA and retired Army General David Petraeus weighs in OUTFRONT. And it is one of the most closely watched elections, one that could give Democrats more power in Washington. Tom Suozzi is confident that he will flip George Santos' seat. He's my guest. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news, Trump appealing to the Supreme Court. The former president now pressing the nation's highest court to step in and agree that he has absolute immunity for crimes that he may have committed while in office. Now, Trump is appealing this historic ruling by a federal appeals court that says he has to stand trial for January 6th. Now, remember, that was a scathing rebuke from the three judges. They unanimously batted down Trump's argument that he has absolute immunity. And they slammed his alleged efforts to stay in power. Now at the time, Trump railed publicly against the ruling. He called it election interference. But now, it is actually a legal document. It is filed and his legal team tonight writes, quote: The D.C. Circuit's order thus threatens immediate irreparable injury to the First Amendment interests of President Trump and tens of millions of American voters who are entitled to hear President Trump's campaign message as they decide how to cast their ballots in November. Odd because obviously this isn't about campaign message. It's about what he did on January 6, but this appeal does put the Supreme Court right in the center of the 2024 election. Now, Ryan Goodman, our legal analyst and his team at Just Security, went through this document today and they still conclude that we are looking at a verdict of guilty or not guilty just weeks before the election, in this case. Now this is not the only case that consume Trump's time and energy today, though. He also chose to appear at another hearing. This one was unclear classified documents found at Mar-a-Lago. Trump came face- to-face with a judge. He appointed Aileen Cannon behind closed doors. Trump's team wants access to the evidence that the DOJ has, but that's something prosecutors have been trying to prevent. They claim some of these documents are too sensitive. Now this dispute over the classified materials is threatening to drag out that case. Currently, it is still scheduled to go to trial on May 20th, but we'll see what happens with that as this develops. It also came today as Trump prepared for hearing in Atlanta, and whether the D.A. prosecuting Trump will be removed from the Georgia election interference case that is slated for this week as well. Our team of reporters is standing by here. Evan Perez, live in Fort Pierce, Florida, or Trump appeared in court today. And Nick Valencia live in Atlanta. So, Evan, let me start with you. I want to start with a Trump's immunity appeal because that came late today. Obviously, he wants a Supreme Court to take this up. When could we hear from them in this case?",

      "sentences": "Well, the pressure will be on the Supreme Court to say immediately, Erin, whether the former president gets to have a pause on the proceedings because obviously, the way this appeals courts structured its decision is order. This was set to go back to the trial judge so that she could resume the effort to prepare for trial as soon as possible. So, now, what Trump needs it is for the Supreme Court to come in and say that there is going to be a pause at least for them to hear from the special counsel from the government, whether this needs to be paused further there are off- course weather.The former president gets to use all of the parts of the appeal, part of this is the former president is trying to buy time, perhaps spend another few weeks asking for the appeals court to have en banc hearing, have the entire appeals court rehear the case. One of the things you heard from the former president and his filing today, he said that this was going to radically disrupt his ability to campaign. I'll tell you this. He was here in Fort Pierce today. He didn't have to come to this hearing, but he did show up, was here for about five hours, his campaign was outside, Erin, handing out signs to some of them his supporters who are outside. [19:05:12] Again, the former president using the filing tonight to sort of make the point that, you know, these trials are getting in the way of his campaigning. The issue is, Erin, he doesn't have to show up to all of these things. He's choosing to do that as part of his campaign. Of course, we don't know yet whether -- when we're going to hear from the Supreme Court. But obviously this could eat up several more weeks of time.",

Hearing in that case is now scheduled for Thursday, which is the same day as a hearing in Trump's New York hush money case. Let's go to Nick Valencia, who is in Atlanta.

It's repetitive of their briefs below which the arguments that they presented were not only soundly rejected, but, you know, eviscerated both in oral argument and in the opinion. I don't think the Supreme Court is going to find those arguments compelling in any way. The Supreme Court can do a variety of things here. You know, they can grant or -- they can grant or deny the stay. If they'd grant the stay, you know, they will likely expedite consideration of the case. It can turn the -- they can turn the state petition into a cert petition and either grant or deny that. They can do that very quickly. Or they could grant to stay and wait for Trump to file for search, which I don't think they will do I personally. And I maybe sharp minority. I personally don't see them taking this case although I do think it's possibility they could consider the state petition as a petition for cert and stay the case for 28 or -- I'm sorry, 24 to 48 hours.

He was there and also with Jack Smith's team. Jack Smith's team. And right now, this seems to be focused and we don't know what happened behind closed doors, right, but on whether the Trump team will have access to the names of people involved in some of these -- some of these documents.

In any event, I think her ruling last week was clear air as Jack Smith has highlighted in the motion to reconsider. I think if she doesn't reconsider or if she reconsiders and stays the course on that ruling, that the special counsel will mandamus are on the 11th Circuit, will reverse or quickly and perhaps even remove her. Certainly, if she grants access to classified documents that the government doesn't believe is appropriate, under the Classified Procedures Act, the government has a right to an interlocutory appeal to go straight to the 11th Circuit and seek relief on that, and also likely to seek her removal.",

So, General Petraeus, obviously, whether an incident like this actually occurred as it's -- as he relays, it is highly suspect, but the point that he's saying, if I -- if you don't pay, you're delinquent, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. You got to pay. What's your reaction when you hear that? GEN. DAVID PETRAEUS (RET.), FORMER CIA DIRECTOR: Well, it's concerning. In fact, of all day long, I've been fielding emails from old colleagues. You know, I actually had assignments where I was dual- headed as a U.S. and NATO officer at the one, three and four-star level. So, a lot of experience with NATO and the number of earlier assignments as well. And everyone is seeking reassurance just as was the chairman of the joint chiefs and I agree very much with him and what he said. There's a particular irony about this, too. And that is that the Europeans have really been stepping up in recent years, particularly, of course, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, he had a point when he was in office, as did all of his predecessors. Again, I heard this from President Obama, adding new NATO summit when I was a NATO commander, I heard it from President Bush. Secretary Gates in his final gathering of the NATO defense ministers, railed on the subject. So there is absolutely a point here.
