Tonight, with the U.S. electionlooming, Donald Trump's former Chief of Staff John Kelly says the former President fits the definition of a fascist, will rule like a dictator if he is back in office. This as Kamala Harris seizes on that political moment, warning the respected staff members Mr. Trump hired before will no longer be the guardrails in a second Trump presidency. Plus, the U.S. Defense Secretary confirming North Korea has deployed troops to Russia calling the move very serious. What more we are learning ahead. We do begin though this hour with breaking news out of Turkey where the Interior Minister says a state-run aviation company was targeted in a deadly terror attack near the capital of Ankara.

      "sentences": "There are two very significant things about this attack, Erica, that are telltale signs of why it may have occurred.The first is the location. This is an airspace -- aerospace rather, a company that is state-owned, is on the outskirts of Ankara. You could see in that social media video that you played earlier, just how massive that complex is, where hundreds of people work in this company, provides aeroplanes, provides military equipment, provides drones to Turkey's military. It also serves private contractors as well, easing many ways a representation of Turkey's Defense Ministry. In fact, one analyst we were speaking to earlier today called it the crown jewel of Turkey's defense industry. So, a strike on this feels very much like a strike on the very heart of Turkey's government and its armed troops. The second thing to notice here is the timing of this attack. Just yesterday, an ally of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan appeared to extend an olive branch to the PKK, the Kurdistan workers party. That could have potentially opened the door to negotiations that would resolve a decades- long conflict that's claimed many lives. So, the fact that a terror attack happens just 24 hours after this gesture is absolutely raising questions. You also have to remember that, yes, Turkey is no stranger to terror attacks, but the country hasn't seen anything like this for years. So, absolutely, this is sending fears across the country, it is sending shockwaves across the country. Turkey's Defense Minister has been indicating or pointing the finger at the PKK, although not specifying that they are behind   this attack, and the investigation is already underway. But I do want to read you the words of President Erdogan, who called the attack, said the attack targeted the survival of our country and the peace of our nation.",

The Trump campaign is denying that he made the remark. Just last hour, Kamala Harris addressing the accusations against the former President from his former chief of staff. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES &amp; DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  So, yesterday, we learned that Donald Trump's former chief of staff John Kelly; a retired four-star General confirmed that while Donald Trump was president, he said he wanted generals like Adolf Hitler had. Donald Trump said that because he does not want a military that is loyal to the United States constitution, he wants a military that is loyal to him. He wants a military who will be loyal to him personally. One that will obey his orders even when he tells them to break the law or abandon their oath to the constitution of the United States. In just the past week, Donald Trump has repeatedly called his fellow Americans the enemy from within. And even said that he would   use the United States military to go after American citizens. And let's be clear about who he considers to be the enemy from within. Anyone who refuses to bend a knee or dares to criticize him, would qualify in his mind as the enemy within, like judges, like journalists, like non-partisan election officials. It is deeply troubling and incredibly dangerous that Donald Trump would invoke Adolf Hitler, the man who is responsible for the deaths of 6 million Jews and hundreds of thousands of Americans. All of this is further evidence for the American people of who Donald Trump really is. This is a window into who Donald Trump really is. From the people who know him best, from the people who worked with him side-by-side in the Oval office and in the situation room. And it is clear from John Kelly's words that Donald Trump is someone who I quote, \"certainly falls into the general definition of fascists\", who in fact vow to be a dictator on day one, and vow to use the military as his personal militia to carry out his personal and political vendettas. Donald Trump is increasingly unhinged and unstable. And in a second term, people like John Kelly would not be there to be the guardrails against his propensities and his actions. Those who once tried to stop him from pursuing his worst impulses would no longer be there, and no longer be there to rein him in. So, the bottom line is this. We know what Donald Trump wants. He wants unchecked power. The question in 13 days will be, what do the American people want? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

THOMAS GIFT, DIRECTOR, CENTER ON U.S. POLITICS, UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON:  Well, it's great to be with you, Erica, thanks so much for having me. I don't think that they will have a big impact, and the reason is that there's absolutely no shock value with Trump anymore. John Kelly is just the latest list in a long line of public servants and former Trump associates who have called him a challenge to democracy. We've heard Mark Milley denounced Trump as a fascist to the core. Jim Mattis said that Trump represents a threat to the constitution. The thing about Trump is that he's open about his aims. He said that Article 2 grants him the right to do whatever he wants as President, he's rhapsodized about my generals and my military in a possessive -- you know, recall Trump even proposed having a North Korea-style parade. And he said he wants his subordinates to be obedient to him like Kim Jong- un's subordinates are, cower and sit at attention to him.

And so, I think that Kamala Harris would be better served to shift the attention to policy, to talk about healthcare, to talk about immigration, to talk about the economy. That's where votes ultimately will be captured. I mean, you can certainly understand why she wants to use this rhetoric. It was a big part of Joe Biden's slogan nearing while he was running. That was put on ice for a little bit after the Trump assassination attempt, but it seems like, you know, Harris is going at it again.

I do think though, that, you know, there's a reasonable case to be made that this violates political norms. You know, norms are just unwritten rules of conduct that are mostly, but not always followed. I think skeptics are going to say that this isn't entirely unprecedented.

A path that would normalize Israel's ties with Saudi Arabia. Blinken meeting with the Saudi Crown Prince and other officials earlier today in Riyadh. And while he is touting what he calls Israel's military success in Gaza, Palestinians in the north are offering up what they have been living through, horrific accounts of forced expulsions, widespread hunger and thirst, men being rounded up and detained. One woman saying, quote, \"we are being exterminated\". Paula Hancocks has more now, and I do want to warn you, her report contains some disturbing images. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Hundreds stand in the midst of what looks like a post-apocalyptic world. Civilians being evacuated from Jabalya Refugee Camp in northern Gaza by the Israeli military after being trapped for days without food or water. Perpetual expulsion of desperate civilians. United Nations human rights office warns the population in northern Gaza may be destroyed through quote, \"death and displacement\". U.N. teams on the ground claimed forceful transfers of people. Israel says Hamas is regrouping and rebuilding in the area which it is fighting to prevent. The wasteland illustrates the intensity of the military force being used. \"There was bombardment every minute, explosions every second, gunfire\", this woman says, \"we never experienced such fear and horror, it was one of the darkest nights we ever lived through.\" Remarkable that the hells civilians have lived through for more than a year could still get worse. The reality increasingly resembles the so-called general's plan. A proposal to force civilians out of northern Gaza and block aid going in. Sources say the Israeli cabinet declined to adopt the plan earlier this month. But U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken felt the need to ask Israel's Prime Minister about it this week. Dr. Hassan Abu Saffia(ph) runs the Kamal Adwan Hospital in the north, which he says is now surrounded by the Israeli military and under constant shelling. He says they ran out of blood and medication on Monday, calling the constant stream of injured a massacre. \"The medical staff are few\", he says, \"and the volume of injury is high. We have had to implement a difficult triage system. We have to let some die, so some can live.\" He films the children's ICU himself to show the impossibility of evacuating despite IDF orders. \"This boy arrived with burns covering more than 70 percent of his body\", he says. Israel says 47 humanitarian aid trucks entered northern Gaza within a 24-hour period this week. Gaza's Health Ministry says no medical supplies or food have entered the area for 18 days, claiming aid is being diverted to central Gaza. U.N. aid workers cannot find food, water or medical care according to the head of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees. Adding the smell of death is everywhere as bodies are left lying on the roads or under the rubble. Gazan health officials say more than 770 have been killed in the more than two-week Israeli campaign. No breakdown of militants versus civilians. But the innocent are among the hardest-hit in this never-ending war.",

And that's because when we heard from the secretary of state yesterday with Netanyahu, and we then saw the readouts from both sides, they were quite stark in terms of the differences. As Netanyahu is talking about Iran, talking about the fight against Hamas in Gaza, offering maybe a little bit of lip service to this notion of the Sinwar's killing representing an opportunity to end the war going forward, but really not going quite as far as what the United States would like to see. And that speaks to the disconnect that clearly exists between these two sides. Even as Blinken talked about this important opportunity in the wake of Sinwar's killing to bring the war to an end, Netanyahu basically just talked about the fact that Sinwar's killing is, quote, \"likely to have a positive influence on returning the hostages and achieving the goals of the war.\" Not exactly a ringing endorsement about getting right back to the negotiating table. And of course, we're seeing what's happening in Gaza and in Lebanon as the Israeli military is not taking its foot off the gas, but instead, intensifying it strikes in those areas. And in Northern Gaza, we're watching, as Paula so deftly described in that report, the fact that the humanitarian situation is just rapidly deteriorating amid strikes, amid a lack of aid that is actually getting in, and that was another major focus of Secretary Blinken's meeting with Netanyahu, making clear that while Israel has taken steps -- some steps in the view of U.S. officials, to allow more -- to fix some of these issues with humanitarian aid getting into Gaza, into Northern Gaza in particular, that the U.S. needs to see much, much more being done, and that was clearly a message that was transmitted. Today, the secretary of state was in Saudi Arabia, meeting with the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, and there, he was talking not only about what's happening now in Gaza, also talking about, of course, these notions of regional stability as Israel prepares to carry out a strike against Iran and retaliation for that ballistic missile barrage a few weeks ago, but also, of course, talking about the day after the war in Gaza. And while we don't know when that will be based off of, you know, that meeting I was just talking about with Netanyahu, the Saudis could certainly play a major role in rebuilding Gaza in terms of financing in particular. And so, clearly, there is an eye to long-term as well, even as the secretary of state is also trying to drive home these short-term immediate necessity issues. But again, very little in terms of actual concrete deliverables emerging from this trip so far, which tends to be the case when Blinken has come to this region. Erica.",

Israel, for its part, advising its citizens to leave the area immediately. Neither of the alerts goes into more specific detail about the nature of the potential attack. The U.S. is also now publicly confirming a move by North Korea that has had western allies on edge. Speaking to reporters in Rome, U.S. Secretary of Defense Austin Lloyd said the U.S. is seeing evidence of North Korean troops in Russia. Exactly what they are doing there remains unclear. A senior administration official, though, telling CNN thousands of North Korean troops recently arrived in eastern Russia and that they're undergoing training. The move itself, fueling concerns they may participate in Russia's war in Ukraine. That, of course, would mark a major escalation in the conflict. U.S. National Security Spokesperson John Kirby just a short time ago saying if that is the case, he believes it signals Russia is weak and desperate. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The question, of course, is what are they going to do? South Korea and Ukraine have said openly and publicly that they're there to fight on behalf of Russia against Ukraine. Now, the U.S. hasn't gone that far, but it certainly sees that as a very real possibility of what North Korean troops are doing training in Russia. And that, in and of itself, has far-reaching consequences. As we just heard from Kirby there, first, it is an indication of the number of casualties that Russia is suffering every day. That number at about 1,200 a day of killed and wounded. It indicates that Russian President Vladimir Putin needs, essentially, more fodder of people and soldiers to throw into a horrible and very brutal war. And that, it seems, he may try to pull from North Korea. But it also means that that the conflict that had been in Ukraine would spread in terms of its implications. South Korea has said they might reevaluate what military assistance they're willing to give Ukraine if North Korean troops do, in fact, fight on behalf of the Russian military. So, that's also something the U.S. is watching very closely here. And of course, to see if the number of troops from North Korea increases going into Russia. One of the other questions that Kirby was asked a short time ago is, what does North Korea get in exchange for providing troops to Russia? Whatever the reason may be. And that is where the U.S. is still trying to assess what this exchange looks like, and if there is indeed an exchange. North Korea has obviously pushed forward with both its nuclear program and its satellite programs, some successes, some failures there, but Russia could certainly provide them very critical assistance, very advanced assistance to push North Korea ahead in both nuclear and satellite and other areas as well, if that's what Russia chooses to do, and if that's effectively the quid pro quo here. That's something the U.S. wouldn't say definitively, but that's also where they're looking very closely to get a better sense of what's at stake here aside from just a major conflict in Ukraine and trying to see if that's where North Korean troops will be headed in the near future.",

Sort of a sad truth here. But Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg says that era is now over. This is the TikTok that really thrust this issue back into the spotlight. It's from last November. And it shows American Airlines' baggage handlers dropping a wheelchair down the chute of a jetway. The Department of Transportation says this is only one of the thousands of cases that had uncovered between 2019 and 2023. There's the video now, where American Airlines mishandled wheelchairs. This was in Miami. The probe also found that American failed to provide adequate assistance to disabled passengers. One powerful quote here from a passenger in a wheelchair who told investigators, American Airlines treated her like cargo. The punishment for all this is the largest fine of its type. American is now required to pay $25 million to the U.S. Treasury. Penalty also mandates that American make a $25 million investment in its own technology and training so this does not keep happening. Now, American insists it's already spent seven times that much this year on trying to curb this problem. And its rating when it comes to handling wheelchairs and scooters has gone up 20 percent in the last two years. But even still, the airline is making a huge apology saying, quote, \"Despite these improvements, there are instances where the service the airline provides is disrupted, untimely, or results in harm to the passenger or their equipment. American takes all these complaints and claims seriously and works hard to remediate them.\" That apology might be the first of many from major airlines. The Department of Transportation says all carriers should now consider themselves on notice saying, quote, \"These problems are not unique to American Airlines and allegations of wheelchair mishandling and inadequate wheelchair assistance are far too common.\" DOT has similar investigations and -- similar violations at other U.S. airlines. Bottom line here, from Secretary Pete Buttigieg, this story is only just beginning and this penalty sets a huge precedent, 25 times larger than the biggest previous DOT fine for something like this. Buttigieg says this makes it clear that airlines cannot consider this doing just the cost of business. Erica.",
