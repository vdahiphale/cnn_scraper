Also, Modi on the move the Biden Administration pulling out all the stops as it welcomes India's Prime Minister to the White House in the next hour. Modi set to address a joint session of Congress later Thursday as well. The world's largest democracy India is viewed as a strategically important counterbalance to China's influence across Asia and beyond. Plus a financing flood vital climate discussions taking place in Paris among them ways to unlock climate cash for poor nations aiming to ramp up clean energy investment. Former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry now the U.S. President's Special Climate Envoy will join us live to discuss those talks. Meanwhile, a cooler climate for now on Wall Street U.S. stocks set for a fourth day of losses as Fed Chair Jerome Powell heads to the Senate for more testimony on the economy. Powell delivering a hawkish message on rate hikes on Wednesday, Europe also as you can see a sea of red there. The Bank of England taking many by surprise and raising interest rates by a half a percentage point after a dreadful UK inflation print. They have to get that under control and an enormous and I call it predictable policy U- turn now from the Turkish Central Bank. It just hiked interest rates by a whopping 6.5 percentage points. OK, let's get right to our top story today and more ships joining the search for the missing submersible in the Atlantic, including the U.S. Navy's deep ocean salvage system.

As it's beendiscussed there have been concerns about India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi's a human's rights records also India's kind of drift towards authoritarianism. But the White House and President Biden are ultimately calculating that India is a high stakes player that they need to cultivate a deeper relationship with, especially when you think about the geopolitical landscape in regards to Russia and also China. So that is why, even as the President is facing criticism for hosting this lavish affair here at the White House, that is why they have decided to host Modi for this state visit. Now in just about an hour he will have this official arrival ceremony which will be followed by Oval Office meetings. He's also set to address Congress. And then it's all capped off by a lavish state dinner this evening that even includes a chef who built a menu to accommodate Modi's vegetarian diet. But there are expected to be some key agreements between the two leaders today, when it comes to defense and technology areas that includes India is expected to purchase some drones, as well as there is an agreement that GE will manufacture engines for Indian military aircraft in India. So those are some of the items that they're expected to highlight today along with some investments in semiconductor manufacturing in India. But perhaps the most closely watched moments of the day will come in the early afternoon just after the Oval Office meetings when the two leaders will stand before the press to make remarks and take questions. It was not known until just yesterday whether there would be an opportunity to pose questions to the two leaders we're told there were very lengthy and delicate negotiations behind the scenes with the Indian officials initially bulking at the White House request to hold a news conference. It is very rare for Modi to take questions from the press. There have been concerns raised about his targeting of press freedoms as well. So many eyes will be on that press conference. Typically the state visits have two questions from each side. Today's will only feature one question from each side. But it does speak to the White House's desire to ensure that reporters are able to ask those questions of Modi today. Now, Jake Sullivan, the National Security Adviser, said heading into this visit that the President does not shy away from raising concerns about human rights and democracy that he is expected to do so in public and in private. Today we will see how public the President might be with those pronunciations. But it does come as the U.S. is trying to bolster this relationship with a partner that they really will think will be an ally heading in for the next decades to come. And if you think of areas like defense and space and technology and in their efforts to counter China's growing influence in the region.",

I just had an event yesterday, in Brussels with Jens Stoltenberg, the Head of NATO, the Director General of NATO, and with France Timmermans, the Vice President of the EU, and they focused exclusively on how the climate crisis is a security crisis. It's a personal, physical security challenge for people in various parts of the world. It's an energy security challenge. It's a health, security, food security; all of these things come together. And as these droughts persist, as the weather gets hotter, and you can't grow things where you live, people are going to move from where they live, and the pressures on migration will grow significantly. So there's politics in this too. And it's urgent for everybody to understand that if you don't want chaos, if you don't want things unfolding in terms of the social structure and the threats that are raised by the crisis, then you've got to move aggressively and proactively to deal with it. I think there's a more serious conversation here that I've seen in recent years. I mean, President Macron is really to be credited with stepping up, feeling this moment, seeing the urgency of what we need to do, and calling on people to do it. I've also, a lot of us are excited Julia, because there's a lot of money to actually be made in the investing in these new technologies and new opportunities.

I had a very good conversation with my Chinese counterpart just a few days ago. We exchanged thoughts about when a visit might be appropriate. But also we talked about what they're doing, what we're doing, how we can mesh those together, China has actually deployed a remarkable amount of renewable energy way ahead of all the other nations put together, including us. But China also has a lot of coal plants and coal dependency, and their emissions are higher. And obviously, we want to work with China to try to reduce that impact, just as we are working on it here at home, which we are doing. So there's a lot of work to be done. Here's the bottom line, the world will benefit if China and the United States can work together on this. President Biden has said he believes this is not a bilateral issue. It's a universal threat to humankind. And President Xi has said he believes this ought to be treated as a separate issue. And the Chinese have reiterated that recently. So my hope is that we can now get together, do the things necessary to build confidence in the relationship begin to change the dynamics of the relationship. And obviously, yes, work through some difficult issues that exist. But also, both of us step up, as the two largest economies in the world, the two largest emitters of greenhouse gas pollution, we really do have to join together to make sure the world can meet the target of holding the earth's temperature increased to 1.5 degrees.

And answer their concerns about risk and so forth. We have to remember some of these funds are pension funds. And there are pensioners in one country or another, including ours, who rely on some return of that investment to be able to retire comfortably. So there are certain limits of risks that can be taken. Other funds don't have that kind of money, the pension money with the same fiduciary level, but they aren't, but they have to. So, you know, they compete for clients. And if their clients say, no, I want to make X amount of money. It's difficult. But still, this is a place where reasonable returns on investment can be made will be made are being made even today. There's a lot of space here for those trillions of dollars to begin to invest and go to work and here's what's important. No government in the world has enough money to make this transition happen. The only way it happens is by bringing the private sector to the table, it just can't happen fast enough. The scientists have told us, we've got to reach a 45 to 50 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, 7 years from now, the only way we get there and hold the earth's temperature increase to those 1.5 degrees or close to that is by getting everybody at the table moving to these investments, de-risking and countries.

And you know we never had this growing up. Kids now have, it's not like a wave of information. It's a tsunami of information coming at them all the time, every day pressures and the anxiety and the stress that brings as well. And I think at the heart of so much of that trying to have a this discernible, effective way of working out what is real, what is fake news, what is generated, what is real. And so we're trying to do something that speaks to that try and help young people be digital literate, so to speak. I think it's a modern day survival skill. It is, you know, we all have, we know the sort of survival skills we're talking about. But actually, I think as a survivor, you've got to adapt, you've got to innovate. And if you're going to be relevant for young people fighting this battle today, you've got to try and do something that empowers them to work out.
