Well, there was one candidate who was in the first debate who did not meet theRNC threshold to qualify for the second debate, but he is still in the race for president. That is former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson, and we wanted to know his impressions of the event. We're fortunate to have Governor Hutchinson join us live. Welcome to the program, Governor. So, let me start with the headline from \"The Wall Street Journal\" today. It reads, GOP candidates fail to outshine Trump. You were the only one candidate not to raise your hand when asked in the first debate if you would support Trump's nomination. You said he was disqualified from the race, given the four indictments against him. Did you see any missed opportunities from the candidates last night to reiterate that point? What would you have said? ASA HUTCHINSON, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I did see missed opportunities. And whenever they went after Trump, they'd do it because he didn't show up for the debate. But you got to go after him on substantive issues. He has proposed an economic plan for America that would include a ring around the United States, a 10 percent tariff on all of our trading partners. That would shrink the economy in the United States. It would be a $300 billion tax on our consumers and would hurt auto jobs in Michigan and that's the issue that I raised yesterday. And so, you've got to go after him on substance. You've got to go after him on his terrible economic plan, on the isolationist approach that he takes to America, both in terms of our leadership, but also in terms of our economy and in terms of our jobs. And so, that's what I would have done, has gone after him on those substantive points. And that's why I was in Detroit yesterday, raising those issues directly where he was.",

Meanwhile, NATO's Secretary-General made an unannounced visit to Kyiv today during a joint press conference with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Jens Stoltenberg, says Ukrainian forces are gradually gaining ground in their counteroffensive against Russia. Let's turn now to CNN's Fred Pleitgen, who joins us live from eastern Ukraine.

And really a lot of what the Secretary General said really meshes with some of the things beyond that we've been seeing on the ground here, as well. He did say that he believes that the Ukrainians are making headway, albeit very slow headway, and that it's very difficult for them. You know, we've been on the southern front here, and we've also been here in this area on the eastern front, as well. It certainly seems to us also that the Ukrainians do have a lot of momentum on their side, but at the same time moving forward and taking territory away from the Russians certainly is still something that remains a challenge for them. I think one of the things that the Secretary General said, he said every meter that Ukraine gains means a meter lost by the Russian Federation. But one thing that the Ukrainians really were listening to very carefully was the fact that the secretary general also essentially announced that in the long term there would be further ammunition aid coming from NATO for Ukraine. Artillery ammunition, tank ammunition, and similar ammunition that the Ukrainians really need. And we were on a battle here on the front lines just a couple of days ago, we saw the entire battle unfold near Bakhmut. And I can tell you one thing that we saw, the Ukrainians definitely using a lot of ammunition when it really gets hot on the battlefield and when the two sides are really going at it. The Russians as well, but of course the Ukrainians have been saying that the one thing they really need is a lot of ammunition, both for their tanks, but for their artillery, as well. So, certainly something that would make that very timely. What the Secretary General said there, also tying into that is something that we heard this evening is that the Russians are also drastically increasing their defense budget by about 70 percent. So, it certainly seems as though Moscow also very much feeling the pinch as this war drags on, Bianna.",

As far as we've heard from U.S. officials,he is in good spirits, and now he's at Brooke Army Medical Center in Texas in San Antonio, where he'll get a medical evaluation, perhaps a psychiatric evaluation, as well, if needed. This is the facility where Brittney Griner and Trevor Reed, as well as other detainees were taken after they were released from detention. So, it's medical checks, it's well-being checks, and it helps to re-acclimate to being outside of detention. So, that is where he remains now after landing early this morning. He was able to speak with his family shortly after he got out of North Korea, and then we're waiting for an update with more information, although his family, as Will Ripley pointed out, has at this point asked for privacy. As for what happens next, that is a question the Army is right now punting down the road. There was the possibility that he would face additional disciplinary actions. He was absent without leave and willfully and intentionally ran into North Korea, which is obviously not something a member of the U.S. armed forces is supposed to do. So, there is that possibility that he could be brought up on charges under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. But when we put this question to the Army, they said they're not dealing with administrative action right now. Right now, the focus is on his recovery. The question though is, what will the army decide to do? He was just in a North Korean detention for some 70 days. So, charging him at this point, that's a difficult decision. At the same time, he went absent without leave. And not charging him or not punishing him in some way also sets a dangerous precedent. So, the Army has to make that decision.
