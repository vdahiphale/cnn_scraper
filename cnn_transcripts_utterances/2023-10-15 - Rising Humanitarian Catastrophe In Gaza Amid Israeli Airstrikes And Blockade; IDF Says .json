I think -- I just want to ask you one more question. There's something going on of course in Lebanon, that's the northern border with Israel, with rockets coming over.

I appreciate all of your incredible reporting throughout this really difficult time. The IDF just announced that they now have a firm number of how many hostages are being held by Hamas. 155 civilians have been taken into Gaza against their will since the war started eight days ago. That is the number that they have come up with. And we know that several of those hostages are American citizens. We do not have an exact number of just how many. CNN's Hadas Gold is joining us now. Hadas, the U.S. is saying it really won't rule out, and I just mentioned this to Clarissa, sending in U.S. troops to rescue hostages, which is something that I think will catch some people by surprise and catch the families and give them some hope that potentially maybe there is a way to see their loved ones again alive and well.

I would surmise they're underground and widely dispersed, and Hamas for its part is going to consider any information on the hostages as very, very, you know, sensitive state secret, so to speak.So this is a real disaster in the making, I think, because as each day goes by, given the condition, the physical condition of many of the hostages, it looks bad.

In Egypt there is mounting pressure to establish a humanitarian corridor to help facilitate the safe evacuation of Palestinians, civilians, who are living there in grave danger as a ground offensive by Israel is imminent. When exactly we do not know, but they are amassing troops, of course, on the border and have been for several days now. The United Nations is indicating it's keeping the option open of deploying troops as a potential measure to ensure the safety and evacuation of American citizens as well. Joining us now is Max Boot, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relation. He is also a columnist with the \"Washington Post.\" First, though, I'm sorry -- what did you say in my ear? His last piece on the latest conflict is titled \"Israel Doesn't Need an Inquiry to Decide Netanyahu Must Go.\" Those are words that are shared by some here in Israel.

They see that they are pursuing commercial pursuits. They're not geared up for war all the time. And so therefore, there's a tendency to think that they are incapable of fighting effectively. And that is an illusion that many tyrants have paid for with their lives or with their losing their wars. I mean, you think about Hitler and Tojo and the war that they declared on the United States, which ended with the utter annihilation of Germany and Japan. You think about more recently Osama Bin Laden thinking that the United States was a weak horse and could be attacked with impunity. And of course, eventually, Bin Laden himself was tracked down and killed by Navy SEALs.And I think that's a very common experience that democracies have a hidden strength that dictators and terrorists don't perceive. And you're seeing that right now in Israel where they've been able to mobilize in just a few days, more than 300,000 reserves. That's just an astonishing number. And you've seen in Russia in the last year that people were fleeing the country to avoid being called up to serve in the army. Whereas in Israel, it's the exact opposite. Israelis are coming from all over the world. They're flying home just so they can fight and defend their country.

This is completely different. There is a completely different feel, even though some of those operations, some of those incursions were massive. I mean, there were airstrikes, I was there in Gaza during some of the airstrikes after there was a barrage of rockets that kept coming over the border from Hamas and from Gaza into Israel.These airstrikes were powerful, they make your bones rattle, your teeth clench, they are terrifying, you can hear planes flying over and there's a real sense, I was around children when one of those airstrikes went off and I can't tell you, children would shudder looking up every time they heard anything flying over them. On this side of the border, the rocket attacks that happen so often, Dana, in places like Sderot and Ashkelon, there's always this sense that at any moment you could lose your life or be injured or lose a family member. And so, you can understand that deep sense of resentment and the tension that has been building and building and building, but this attack by Hamas was so disturbing, disgusting, debased, that Israel has decided that it is gonna go all-out war and that is a completely different thing.
