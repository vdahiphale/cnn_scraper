His name is Asem Abu Rakaba. And the reason why he stands out is because he was in charge of Hamas aerial assets responsible from for Hamas UAVs, drones, paragliders, as well as aerial detection and aerial defense systems, killed Saturday. I talked to a family in a near Ashkelon on a moshav. And they were telling me that a friend of theirs at a neighboring moshav, saw how they came down on October 7th using paragliders, and screaming at them in Arabic that they were going to kill them, a very hateful language.

All right, Rafael Romo, thank you so much.Let's bring in CNN military analyst, and retired U.S. Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton. Colonel Leighton, as we just heard from Raphael, Israel says it has killed more than 30 Hamas leaders since October 7th. Would you consider that a big dent in this mainly Hamas and especially including the sizable death toll in Gaza or do you think there's still a long way to go? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, Jake, there's definitely a ways to go. But it is a sizable dent, and especially when the leadership that has apparently been killed includes an intel chief or deputy intel chief and the air chief and some of -- probably some of the planners that were associated with the operation on October the 7th, it's significant. And it really does put a dent in Hamas's capabilities. Being said that it's pretty clear that Hamas has a capacity to regenerate itself, its adventures probably relatively deep. But it is something that they would have to overcome this deficit in order to really resume effective military operations against Israel.",

And so it really depends on the kinds of sources that the Israelis used in order to get that intelligence, how accurate they were, you know, was it just based on one source like electronic intercepts? Or was it also based on human and human intelligence, and other means that the Israelis could use?So the more there is cooperation between several sources of intelligence, the greater the confidence would be that the Israelis right. We don't know for a fact, you know, what the exact source of or sources of this intelligence were. But it is pretty clear that to the Israeli certainly believe that, and there is historical precedent for Hamas and other groups to use hospitals as a cover for their operations. But in this case, you have to be very right before you actually go attacking something like that. And it's a, you know, a very dangerous thing to do on a variety of levels.",
