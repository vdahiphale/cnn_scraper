Just weeks after winning Women's World Cup title, the head coach of the Spanish team has been fired. The head coach of the Spanish team has been fired. Jorge Vilda has certainly been a controversial figure in Spanish football for quite some time, with a lot of players calling for him to be ousted. He's also been one of the fiercest allies of embattled Football Federation Chief Luis Rubiales, who has, of course, faced worldwide criticism for that unwanted kiss on the lips that he gave Jennifer Hermoso during the World Cup championship celebration. Let's get right to it. CNN World Sports' Patrick Snell for the latest on all of this. So, you know, there were a few complaints about this particular coach even before the Women's World Cup tournament. He certainly was a controversial figure. And then on top of that, during that defiant speech that Luis Rubiales gave, he actually applauded and stood by Rubiales. So, a lot of people were angry at him for that. But just give us more context in terms of this move to fire him. What more do we know at this point, Patrick?",

You know, richer nations, how that was an economic and a humanitarian benefit around the world, and therefore questioning the need for the Black Sea grain deal, at least for Ukraine. We've got more information from President Erdogan today, which I think is revealing. What Putin is trying to do is roll back sanctions that have been imposed on Russia, financial sanctions that have blocked him from the swift international financial mechanisms. And that, according to President Erdogan today is one of his red lines for coming back into that grain deal. So, Putin wants back into the grain deal only if some sanctions, important ones that are hurting his country and economy are rolled back. And I think, you know, it was very clear that was the read from Kyiv as well, because Dmytro Kuleba, the foreign minister, said very much the same at the end of yesterday.

Refugee Agency and other humanitarian groups are asking for a billion dollars to provide aid and protection for them.

More than 70,000 people were stuck in ankle-deep muck in a Nevada desert. When conditions improved, they hit the road. But plenty of people stuck around for the main event, the burning of a giant wooden effigy of a man. A 10-year-old boy survived flooding outside Madrid by clinging to a tree overnight. A Spanish state broadcaster reports his family's car fell into a river on Sunday night. The boy's mother and sister were found and then taken to the hospital. His father is still missing, though. At least three people are confirmed dead following torrential rains. All right. I want to give you a quick update now to our top story. Spain has now named a new head coach of its World Cup-winning women's football team, Montse Tomei was the assistant coach and now, and this is huge, she is the first woman to be named head coach of the Spanish national team. The first woman has been named head coach of the Spanish national team. The move comes just hours after coach Jorge Vilda was sacked. We have not heard why exactly Vilda was fired. There has been speculation because he was facing so much criticism from Spanish players for more than a year, even before the World Cup, actually. And he's been widely seen as one of the fiercest allies of embattled Football Federation President Luis Rubiales, who is at the center of all of this because of that forced kiss with Jennifer Hermoso. It has, of course, been a tumultuous two and a half weeks since Spain won the Women's World Cup title, with Rubiales defiantly refusing to step down earlier on Tuesday. The Football Federation apologized for the, quote, \"totally unacceptable behavior\" of Rubiales. The Federation says it's trying to give the spotlight back to the players who have seen their World Cup victory overshadowed by scandal. Time now for The Exchange. Joining me live now is U.S. Today Sports Communist and CNN Sports Analyst Christine Brennan. Christine, so good to have you with us. I just want to start with a breaking news story that Spain has now hired its first woman's head coach for the Spanish national team. This is significant.

They complained and they said they didn't want to play for him anymore. They were going to actually strike or you know, boycott and not play. Well, what did the Federation do? Instead of listening to those players, in a different scenario we might have had over the last year, but instead of listening to the players, they totally went in for Vilda. Obviously, men supporting men, men defending men. And now, we see the quality of the men we're talking about here. And those 15 players, only three of them actually made the national team and won the World Cup. They were only three.

We've got Greece being lashed with torrential rains, whichhave flooded homes, businesses, roads as well, as you can see here, and left at least one person dead. The storm, dubbed Daniel, has dumped hundreds of milliliters of rainfall over some areas in the past 24 hours, in what the prime minister describes as a totally extreme weather phenomenon. And then Southern China, typhoon Haikui has been downgraded to a tropical depression after making landfall early Tuesday. Meteorologist Derek Van Dam is tracking both storms from the CNN Weather Center. Derek, what more can you tell us? DEREK VAN DAM; CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yeah, two big stories to cover here, Zain. We're going to start with the remnants of that typhoon Haikui, which continues to bring rainfall to the Fujian province and even into Taiwan, as well. But remember, this is on the heels of what was another powerful typhoon that impacted that region, Doksuri, at the end of July. So, two back-to-back typhoons impacting the same location of southern China. That means a lot of rain. That means flooding, landslides, mudslides, you name it. Look at these rainfall totals exceeding 1,100 millimeters. That's in a three-day storm period. And you can see that impacts kind of the mountainous regions of Taiwan. But look at the additional rainfall that will take place anywhere from Taipei westward into the western and southern sections of China. Now, to the other big story that we're covering. Look at this. Your eyes are not deceiving you. This is not a hurricane. This is a low-pressure system across the eastern Mediterranean. Sometimes we refer to this as a medicane, think hurricane, but in the central portions of the Mediterranean. But you can see clearly that counterclockwise rotation on the visible satellite imagery. It's all because of a very exaggerated weather pattern across Europe. We've got hot air blasting northward with this jet stream, well-elongated into Norway. But on the other side of that jet stream, it's cutting -- causing this cutoff low to develop and form and strengthen over the relatively warm waters of the eastern Mediterranean. And what this has done is it's taken advantage of the environmental conditions and produced significant amounts of rain. Look at the flooding happening across portions of Greece. These pictures are just a drop in the bucket of what we've actually been seeing pop up on social media. So, we believe that this could be a significant weather- maker, a weather headline going forward. Look at the latest infrared satellite imagery. The storm system is not slowing down and it really is going to just produce more rainfall than what you see here. So, there are some totals here that will easily exceed 200 millimeters here going forward. This is the current radar. You could almost pick out a little bit of an eye like feature just off the west coast of Greece. Again, we call that a medicane for lack of a better term, but the potential here for excessive rain, flash flooding and mudslides exists anywhere you see that shading of red, particularly over the eastern coast of Greece just north of Athens. That's where we're focusing a lot of our attention right now because some of the computer-generated models indicating the highest level of rainfall totals here. We've got some satellite derived imagery showing rainfall totals there potentially exceeding several hundred millimeters. So, flash flooding will be an on-going threat at least for the next 24 to 36 hours. So, Zain, a big story for us.",

On Tuesday, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry told the African climate summit that his nation would spend $30 million to help African nations combat food insecurity specifically. But it was really the UAE, the United Arab Emirates, that really turned heads when it pledged $4.5 billion to invest in clean energy on the African continent. Still, officials say the need is so great that an economic transformation is needed. Let's bring in CNN's Larry Madowo in Nairobi. I mean, listen, four and a half billion dollars, that's not nothing. But U.N. officials are saying that Africa needs over $100 billion a year, not just a one-time fee, $100 billion a year at least to combat climate change and to ensure that the continent becomes that much more resilient when it comes to weathering climate disasters.

And the U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres speaking today said there needs to be a whole lot more investment here. Over the last two decades only two percent of renewable energy investments came into Africa, despite that massive potential. So that's one angle that's coming up here. The John Kerry announcement of $30 million to combat food insecurity is also welcome, but it's still a drop in the ocean. But one of the other major side events here has been on the Nexus, between health and the climate, specifically about one of Africa's most deadly tropical mosquito-borne diseases, malaria.

Malaria will displace people. They will migrate to other areas within the continent and out of the continent. (END VIDEOTAPE) MADOWO (on-camera): That displacement is already being seen in parts of the world, but also those changing temperatures mean that the World Bank estimates that by 2050 you will see malaria in places that previously didn't have malaria, such as in China, in South America, in other parts of Sub-Saharan Africa. And the other one, which Dr. Munang talked about, Zain, is we, something we touched on yesterday that migration because of changing weather patterns that's already happening in the Sahel, it's happening in other parts of the continent, and as this continues, if global temperatures rise by just two to three degrees Celsius, you see this at a much larger scale.",

Some have complained that thesummit is far too focused on how Western nations can help Africa rather than looking at ways for Africa to actually help itself. CNN's Becky Anderson asked Kenyan President William Ruto about that exact criticism. I want you to listen to what he said. ((BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) Becky Anderson; CNN ANCHOR: President Ruto, more than 500 civil society organizations have written to you saying that they look up to you as Africa's most senior leader on climate change. They though believe this summit has been co-opted, writing, and I quote, \"Rather than advancing Africa's interests and position on critical climate issues, the summit has been seized by Western organizations hell-bent on pushing a pro-West agenda and at the expense of Africa.
