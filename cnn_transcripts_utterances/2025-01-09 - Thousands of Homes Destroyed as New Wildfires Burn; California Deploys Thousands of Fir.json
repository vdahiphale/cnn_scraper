That's the main difference this morning compared to yesterday at this time when they were not able to fly because the winds were too erratic and too strong. So, there was some relaxation in the Santa Ana winds, but we do anticipate that to pick up in intensity through the course of the day.So, we are monitoring five active large wildfires. We don't have enough time to talk about every single fire, but we know that the Eden fire, we saw it with Anderson just a moment ago, charring thousands of acres. But let's focus in on Pacific Palisades, the Palisades fire. Here's the Santa Monica Pier, the famed beach within this region, and look at how the fire is encroaching on this densely populated area of western L.A. into Santa Monica. The wind direction is so critical here still coming out of the northeast. It picks up through the afternoon. Ridge top winds down to the valley floors could reach 60 miles per hour. That's tropical storm force conditions. That's why we still have critical fire dangers and red flag warnings in place for much of the region. Kate?",

It's an exclusive club, but it's one among whose relationships have been fraught in recent years with the two elections of Donald Trump seen as controversial among the establishment.President Biden recently was asked what message President-elect Trump could learn from Jimmy Carter, and he said one word in his answer. He said decency, decency, decency. We expect that to be a highlight of Biden's own message today as he prepares to deliver a eulogy for his longtime friend of 50 years, Biden was among those helping to convince Carter to run for president when he was serving as Georgia's governor. In turn, Carter endorsed Biden's many Senate runs and even helped raise funds for him in the late 70s. The two counseled each other on politics and life for decades. And Biden recently paid a visit to Plains, Georgia, early on in his presidential term, Biden will be among just one of the speakers delivering a eulogy. We know that also eulogies prepared by President Gerald Ford and Vice President President Walter Mondale will also be read by their own relatives. Their sons will be delivering those eulogies with President Biden delivering his own at the Washington National Cathedral today. Now, following the service, Carter will be flown home to Plains, Georgia, his hometown, for a private internment. Around the same time, we had expected President Biden to depart for his final foreign trip to Rome, Italy, where he was expected to meet with Italian leaders, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as well as Pope Francis. That trip has been canceled because of the fires raging in Los Angeles, but it all comes as Biden today will be fomenting the legacy of his longtime friend Jimmy Carter while trying to burnish his own in his final days in office.
