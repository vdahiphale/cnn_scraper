I'm Zain Asher in New York.I want to begin this hour with breaking news coverage in Western Japan, where a powerful 7.5 magnitude earthquake has rocked and tsunami advisories are in effect. Residents are urged to evacuate affected coastal areas as soon as possible. Officials are still assessing the scope of the damage. I want you to look at how one office looked in Toyama as it was hit by this quake. Japan's weather agency is warning that aftershocks could continue for up to a week. Officials say there are already reports of injuries. Some people trapped inside buildings and under the rubble as well. This massive fire started in Wajima City after the quake hit as well. There are reports of many other damaged buildings, power outages and closed roads in the wake of the storm as well -- in the wake of the earthquake rather as well. I want to bring in Dr. Zegang Pen who is in Atlanta. He's a professor of geophysics at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Professor, thank you so much for being with us. What is your biggest concern just in terms of the major threats affecting the country right now? What is the biggest fear here? DR. ZHIGANG PENG, PROFESSOR OF GEOPHYSICS, GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY: Yes. I think the biggest fear or the concern would be whether or not there may be continuing activities. You already mentioned that the aftershock would continue for up to a week. But my understanding is that for event like this aftershock can last much longer. And in this particular case, the event actually happened in a region where there is ongoing activity. So, if you look at what happened before the main event, there was actually a foreshock. But if you look further in time, there were at least a few years of activities. So, this region has already been active for quite a while. And obviously, the 7.5 is the largest. But one of the concerns that, you know, I may look into in the next few weeks or days would be whether or not there may be some larger aftershocks, and sometimes it could be even larger than the may even could happen in the same region as well.",

So, as you probably know that most times aftershocks smaller than the main event. So, even though they are smaller, but sometimes they could be of, you know, a significant size. So, the issue is that the region has early experienced damage from the event. So, even though, in most cases, a smaller event happened, it can still produce significant damages and -- you know, and potentially to both building and also infrastructure as well.",

But of course, as the night goes on, as more and more time passes from that initial tsunami 7.5 magnitude earthquake the risk of the tsunami does decrease slightly. But of course, if there is another powerful aftershock, which Japan has warned could happen over the next three days, we might be searing very different things about tsunamis. And just in terms of overall devastation, overall effects from this earthquake from the tsunami, we know that 33,000 homes are without power. We know, according to the national police in Japan, that four people are in cardiac arrest. This is recent news. We also know that roads have been cracked, and we're just unable to cross them. Medical emergency personnel are unable to get to people that need rescuing and safety. We also know that, of course, this moment is very, very frightening for many people in Japan. This comes on New Year's Day, a time when many people are celebrating with their families, with their loved ones.

People living in the coastal areas have been urged to leave their homes. They've been urged to evacuate. Japan's defense ministry says it's dispatching 1,000 defense force personnel to help with the earthquake. More than a dozen aftershocks have been reported. Officials warn that these could continue for several days. Israel is beginning to withdraw some of its troops from Gaza.

In fact, in the last few days and weeks, we have heard those repeated statements from Israeli military and government officials, from Prime Minister Netanyahu himself, who have vowed this will be a long fight ahead. And in fact, what we are seeing on the ground is the Israeli military expanding its operations both on the ground and in the air, expanding into new areas, according to the Israeli military. And we've certainly seen that in the south. Prime Minister Netanyahu himself saying there is a long way ahead before this war can end in the eyes of the Israeli government. Prime Minister Netanyahu saying they still are seeking to achieve all of their military goals, namely bringing back all the hostages held in Gaza, but also diminishing Hamas' military capabilities in the Gaza Strip. Take a listen to his statement over the weekend. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): The war is at its height. We are fighting on all of the fronts. We have huge success, but we also have painful cases. Achieving victory will require time. As the chief of staff has said, the war will continue for many more months. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Danish shipping giant Maersk says it's pausing traffic in the Red Sea after one of its vessels came under attack. The U.S. military says its helicopters intervened over the weekend and sank three boats belonging to Houthi militants from Yemen. All of those aboard were killed and a fourth boat actually managed to get away. Maersk says the boats were trying to board one of its vessels before being fought off. Attacks by the Iranian-backed Houthis have spiked since the start of the Israel Hamas war. I want to bring in Oren Liebermann, joining us live now from the Pentagon. So, Oren, this is the first time since October 7th, since the start of the Israel Hamas war, that we've actually seen the U.S. actually attack Houthi militants, Houthi rebels, directly.

      "sentences": "So, we have seen more than a hundred projectiles, that is drones and missiles fired at commercial shipping vessels from Houthi militants in Yemen, Iranian- backed rebels in Yemen.That part is not uncommon, at least not over the course of the past month, but how this played out is a major deviation from what we've seen so far. That's because the ship that came under attack, the Maersk Hangzhou, which was right in the Bab el Mandeb Strait, so in the Southern Red Sea there, first it says it was attacked by an unidentified object and then, four vessels from the Houthis approached it, issued a distress call. That's when U.S. helicopters from U.S. Navy vessels in the area approached the Maersk Hangzhou as it was being attacked in an attempt to board it. Those -- the Houthi militants on their ships got within 20 meters, so about 60 feet of the vessel itself. U.S. Central Command says -- and the video you're seeing here, by the way, is of another attempted boarding of a ship, but U.S. Central Command says that those ships opened fire on U.S. forces. U.S. forces, they say, responded in self- defense, sinking three of the four ships, killing the crew, and the fourth vessel fled. Now, the White House has said they are not looking for a wider conflict or confrontation here, but obviously this is an escalation in terms of what we're seeing and the first time we have seen the U.S. fire upon, take kinetic action upon, and kill Houthi militants. So far, they have avoided striking Yemen itself. But we'll have to watch very closely how this develops. A few other points worth noting here, major shipping companies, including Maersk, had for a time avoided the Red Sea. Maersk was one of the companies that said it would continue once again going through the Red Sea after the U.S. launched a multinational coalition to protect shipping there. And that was a major vote of confidence in that multinational coalition called Operation Prosperity Guardian. But following this attack, they now say they will once again pause shipping through the Red Sea, and that means going a long way around Africa or finding some other means, that's a major blow to shipping. A major cost factor effectively and it will affect supply chain. So, we'll see how long they avoid the Red Sea and whether others do as well, how long it'll take them to feel confident going through the Red Sea again. Zain, it's also worth noting this was not the only Houthi attack. The U.S. says in a separate incident on Saturday, they shot down two anti- ship ballistic missiles. So, this hasn't led to any more calm. The question is how much worse and how much more tense will it get there? And do we see direct conflict, more direct conflict, between the U.S. and Iran-backed Houthis?",

An update for you on our breaking news out of Western Japan, where a powerful 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck on New Year's Day, initially triggering major tsunami warnings. Those have now been downgraded to tsunami advisories, meaning that the threat of larger waves has indeed passed. Japan is still bracing for aftershocks, though.And you've seen a lot of videos of the moment that the earthquake struck. Here's one of them. You see cars shaking back and forth, essentially rattling. And you also hear car alarms going off as well. Take a look at this. Another video here just showing the severity of this earthquake building shaking violently. Officials are reporting power outages, damaged roads and buildings and some flight cancellations as well. Last hour, I spoke with Dr. Ellen Prager. She's a chief scientist at StormCenter Communications. That's a company based here in the U.S. I asked her to explain the impact of the tsunami threat with the quake hitting on the western side of Japan and how that differs from quakes that hit the eastern side. I want you to listen to what she had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. ELLEN PRAGER, CHIEF SCIENTIST, STORMCENTER COMMUNICATION: So, the dynamics of the earthquake are different in those two places because of how the plates move. On the other side of the country, you've got what's called a subduction zone, and there's one plate going underneath another, and you tend to get very large-scale vertical movements. And that's what causes the most destructive tsunamis. On the west coast, it is deformation. The -- you can think of the plates of the ground as being compressed. And so, these faults accommodate that compression and deformation. And so, you can still get vertical movement, but it tends not to be as violent and destructive as on the east coast of Japan.",

I'm not sure because the thing with tsunamis is they can also be triggered by underwater landslides and also an aftershock could cause one. So, they might -- even though the current threat might be reduced, they might keep the warnings in effect for a while longer because of those aftershocks. So, my guess is 24, 48 hours, they may keep that warning up. It could be shorter. It's really hard to say. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, that's one sort of question that they want the U.S. Supreme Court to grapple with.And the other is, you know, whether or not it can be enforced by the states. And we obviously have Colorado and Maine, both places have said Donald Trump should not be on the primary ballots there. Those decisions are making their way in Maine through the levels of the state court where Trump is going to submit his own appeal. But ultimately, they want the U.S. Supreme Court to say, can states even enforce this section of the constitution? And lastly, whether or not Donald Trump and Republicans, there's a First Amendment right to select who you want to be your candidate for president.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over): A new year, a new era for Denmark and for one of the world's oldest monarchies. Queen Margrethe II will end her reign at more than half a century, a shock decision delivered in a live address to the Danish people on New Year's Eve. QUEEN MARGRETHE II (through translator): I have decided that now is the right time. On the 14th of January 2024, 52 years after I succeeded my beloved father, I will step down as Queen of Denmark. FOSTER (voice-over): Denmark's ruler became Europe's longest reigning monarch after the death of Britain's Queen Elizabeth in 2022. Queen Margrethe put the decision down to her fragile health. Recent surgeries on her back have limited her royal duties. QUEEN MARGRETHE II (through translator): The time takes its toll, and the number of ailments increases. One cannot undertake as much as one managed in the past. FOSTER (voice-over): That sense of duty won the hearts of the Danish people, and drew comparisons to Queen Elizabeth, to whom Margrethe looked to for some inspiration. Danish Prime Minister, Mette Frederiksen, was quick to praise the only monarch that many Danes will ever have known. On behalf of the entire population, I would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to Her Majesty the Queen for her lifelong dedication and tireless efforts for the Kingdom, Frederiksen wrote in a statement. Like other constitutional monarchies, the Danish Sovereign stays above politics, but feathers can be ruffled. In 2022, the queen removed the titles of prince and princess from the children of her second son, Prince Joachim. It was an effort to reduce the royal establishment and allow her grandkids more privacy.
