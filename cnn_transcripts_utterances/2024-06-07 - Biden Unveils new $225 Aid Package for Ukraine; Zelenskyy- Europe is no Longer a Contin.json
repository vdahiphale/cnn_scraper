It is 3 pm there in Normandy, it's 5 pm here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Becky Anderson. You're watching \"Connect the World\" and wherever you are in the world, you are more than welcome. Also happening over the next two hours more Israeli strikes and shelling today across Gaza as the Biden Administration steps up the pressure on Hamas to accept a ceasefire deal. And voting is underway for the next European Parliament with far right groups flexing their political muscles in the world's second largest democratic election. We are also seeing the latest U.S. jobs numbers, the economy added 272,000 positions in May that is a lot more than economists had expected and it could make the Fed's battle against inflation very tricky. How well we will explain later and we will check the Wall Street reaction when trading kicks off in about 30 minutes from now? Ahead of that a snapshot of the Futures markets which are at least in principle indicating a lower start to the trading day. Well on the day after the Anniversary of D-Day the U.S. President looking ahead to a world where in a growing number of places democracy is under threat. Next hour, Joe Biden is expected to give a speech defending democracy and freedom at Pointe du Hoc, which was a key German position that Americans captured during the D-Day invasion. And I'll get you that speech of course live. Earlier in Paris Mr. Biden sat down with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He announced a new aid package for Ukraine while repeating a promise that the U.S. will not back down on supporting Ukraine in its war against Russia. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So an apology there from the American President, after several days were very much the continued support the steadfast supportive allies for Ukraine have been at the heart not just of what we've heard from various leaders. But what we've seen is very strong images from Normandy yesterday where the allied leaders stood on Omaha Beach with President Zelenskyy and show a force sense and unity. And there the American President expressing his regret that there had been a question about ongoing American support. This fresh aid package Becky will represent 225 million of extra aid at Ukraine. It is the sixth American aid package, of course, as the biggest donor, the United States, clearly the most important in terms of its ongoing commitment to President Zelenskyy. What we're about to hear from the American President, no doubt now it is headed back to Normandy. It is much more about why he feels as strongly as he does. And this is about much more than just President Zelenskyy or just President Biden the United States for Ukraine right now. This is about the very ideals that were fought for 80 years ago on the beaches of Normandy. We could do that by choosing the story of one single veteran 100-year-old veteran who landed there in Pointe do Hoc and no doubt he'll be very much at the center of Joe Biden's speech, trying to link as he will no doubt again, what went on here 80 years ago, Becky with what's happening today in Ukraine.",

A dig at the Republicans on Capitol Hill, that had having agreed that weapons deal with the Democrats then change their minds and voted against under pressure we understand from President Trump. So this was, of course, about marking this 80th Anniversary and reminding people about the necessity because -- fighting Ukraine for what began -- in front. But this is also of course, an election year. And it was an opportunity for the president to stand firm about his vision of the United States, its place in the world and what it represents, and that of the man who's going to be his rival. So clearly at the very heart of everything that we've heard yesterday, and we're likely to continue to grow here because remember, President Biden is here until Sunday. He is going to have a -- dinner with President Macro. He's going to lay flowers at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier -- to tee off tomorrow so again, much more to come in terms of the objects in terms of the message that Joe Biden wants to send about what he as American President will continue to represent Becky.",

The White House has also said that they are asking Israel for more details about what exactly happened. We heard from John Kirby, the National Security Council Spokesperson telling CNN that Israel does have the right to go after Hamas, but the way in which it does it matters. We've heard from the UN Secretary General through a statement condemning this strike as well. From the Israeli side they've said they identified 20 to 30 militants Hamas and Islamic Jihad. They say that they have identified nine that were hit although without providing evidence. But what we're also seeing is overnight, another UN linked school was hit. This is in the Al-Shati camp in northern further north in Gaza. We understand three were killed in that strike dozens injured according to the Gaza media center. And also in Khan Yunis in the size the building housing the same family was targeted, at least eight killed in that strike. Now what I want to focus on as well is this area of Central Gaza. Overnight we understand at least 12 were killed in a number of different strikes. And what we're hearing from Palestinians on the ground is that they feel that the intensity and the frequency of Israeli strikes in this area really is reminiscent of the beginning of the war.

On Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a visit to the northern border in which he said Israel is prepared for, in his words, very intense action with Lebanon if necessary. But what's interesting over the last week is what we've seen is that Hezbollah has shown a tech sort of a level of technological sophistication we haven't seen so far. On Wednesday, Hezbollah used what is called an Al-mass anti-tank guided missile guided with a very sophisticated guidance system that hit an Iron Dome battery, according to Hezbollah. But this seems to been confirmed by visual evidence photographs from the Israeli side. It's the first time as far as I know that they've been able to strike an Iron Dome battery. Of course, the Iron Dome is that anti-missile system, which is really Israel's first line of defense against Hezbollah's a significant arsenal of missiles, by some estimates somewhere between perhaps 150 and 200,000 missiles in Hezbollah's possession. Also yesterday, Hezbollah claimed that it used for the first time anti- aircraft missiles to fire at Israeli Aircraft in Lebanese airspace, according to a statement by Hezbollah, forcing that plane to go back. On the 1st of June Hezbollah according to Hezbollah that is -- was able to shoot down at Hermes 900 Israeli drone, a very sophisticated drone that flies at a high altitude. That's the second time that's happened since April. So certainly these rarely seen all of this are perhaps concerned that if they do go to war with Hezbollah, that the price they will pay could be very high Becky.",

We, at the same time, we haven't continued to encourage Israel's leadership to be a thoughtful about making sure that they're reducing the number of civilian casualties. There have been way too many civilian casualties throughout this war, and move the civilians out of the battle space before conducting significant maneuver.

The lawyers for the U.S. President son will begin by presenting their case today they are expected to call his daughter and his uncle, the brother of President Joe Biden. In an effort to show Hunter Biden was fighting to get treatment for his drug addiction at the time he purchased the gun. The president's son is accused of illegally purchasing that gun while being addicted to drugs which is a violation of federal law. Hunter Biden's defense team says it has not yet decided if he will take the stand. Well on Thursday the court heard critical testimony from Hunter Biden's sister in law turned girlfriend. CNN's Paula Reid has more from Delaware for you. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Federal prosecutors put their star witness on the stand in the trial of Hunter Biden, the widow of his late brother Beau, who would become Hunter's girlfriend. Hallie Biden testified as federal prosecutors are close to finishing their case against the president's son in Wilmington, Delaware. She testified how she saw Hunter with crack rocks the size of ping pong balls, witnessed him smoking crack and even went with him to buy drugs from dealers in Washington D.C. and how she had conversations with him between 2017 and 2018 about his drug use, telling him this can't go on. We can't do this. His responses would vary sometimes saying leave me alone, I'm fine. Or at other times, I'm an addict, and I'll figure it out my way. She also testified how Hunter introduced her to crack in 2018. It was a terrible experience that I went through. I'm embarrassed and I'm ashamed and I regret that period of my life. But Hunter's defense, argues there's no evidence, he was actively using drugs when he bought the gun in October 2018 and allegedly lied on the federal background check form. Hallie testified that she found drugs and drug paraphernalia in Hunter's car days later. I did find some remnants of crack cocaine and drug paraphernalia. She went on to testify about when she found the gun saying I was afraid to kind of touch it. I didn't know if it was loaded. The prosecution then produced video evidence of her tossing the gun into a grocery store dumpster. I was so flustered. I realized it was a stupid idea now. The prosecution also introduced text messages between the two, including when Hallie asked where Hunter was the night after he bought the gun. He responded I'm now off Maryland Av behind blue rocks stadium waiting for a dealer named Mookie. But Hallie also testified during cross examination that sometimes Hunter would lie to her about his whereabouts.",

We go now, what a dream start for the Americans who Steven Taylor produces an outstanding catch in the slips to take the price wicket of Mohammad Rizwan which is nine brilliant catch. Pakistan was going to make 159 for 7 from their 20 overs now the U.S.A. responding really impressively. But look to be falling short until Nitish Kumar dispatches the very last ball of the American innings through a four and that means the scores will level at 159 each. The match left tie that meant the deciding six balls super over batting first, the U.S. got a competitive tally of 18, which meant all the pressure was on Pakistan, 4 balls left and still 40 needed. It's a moment of brilliance in the outfield the sensational catch to dismiss Iftikhar Ahmed. And that would prove absolutely crucial. Pakistan needing seven now for the very last ball and they only get the single cue the celebrations the USA celebrating the most famous of victories, leaving their illustrious opponents absolutely shocked and devastated. Joyous scenes for the Americans who won that opener remember against Canada, and they've now made it back to back wins. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MONANK PATEL, USA CAPTAIN &amp; PLAYER OF THE MATCH: It is a big achievement and you know, beating Pakistan and playing for the first time. And the way we played today. I'm really proud of the boys and you know there was complete team effort on the ball one to the last ball as a batsman and as a player you want to show up on the big occasion and big games. And my plan was to you know, whatever runs I score, it has to be on a winning cause. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And I think it was very telling when at the very end or during the commemorations the Navy officer said, you know, in essence, passing or taking the baton from that that D-Day generation, we've got the watch. And I think Biden's message is going to be that, that watch comes with a price and the price is that we need to stand up and be ready and do everything we can to take on and tackle President Putin as he tries to take more territory away from Ukraine. That will be it, but it'll draw those comparisons with history and with that place that is standing Pointe du Hoc not just a place where 225 rangers claimed 100 foot cliffs to take out German artillery positions. 155 millimeter guns raining deadly shells on the Omaha and Utah beaches where our troops were coming ashore, but then got in a battle for two days to hold the ground there before they could get relief. And that fortitude was something that President Biden talked about President Zelenskyy today and I think that's an image he'll draw upon that there's fortitude you don't give up. You fall back. You're lying. You harden those positions. You face a lot of casualties. So those 225 rangers on that cliff top Pointe du Hoc, only 90 survived. And the comparisons will be there for President Biden to draw on to say, look, Ukraine stands strong, you may be losing some ground around Kharkiv, but we're with you were united. We're there to support you. The support is coming.",

Of course, one may think that these things come naturally. They will be part of the visit anyway. And in a way, yes, they do. But they're freighted with so much more importance, because, you know, as President Zelenskyy center, President Biden today, we thank you for this bipartisan support, the hint being, you know, we really need that to carry forward. But without that with an isolationist president in the United States, one willing to cut ties, potentially with NATO, dwindle support for Ukraine.

But most will say there is some of semblance of a crossroads at this point, Russia, pressuring the frontline in Ukraine as allies scramble weapons and aid European Parliament elections looming with populace and right wing politics on the rise, Donald Trump, though friend of NATO ahead in key polls in the U.S. At this moment, what do you expect to hear from President Biden?

But when he looks forward, it's a little bit difficult for the president here. First of all, as you suggested, and Nic suggested, the momentum, which a year ago seemed to be in favor of Ukrainians has now shifted to the Russians. And so while he's going to say we have to do everything we can for Ukraine, he's probably not going to say for how long? Or what the right outcome of this war is? What is the end game here, which has been widely discussed in Washington? But it's difficult for I think, for him to, raise, in this context. And then there's the Trump piece of it, which you alluded, to where, he's basically got to make the case that it's Joe Biden, who is the inheritor of what Ronald Reagan was saying 40 years ago. They're not Donald Trump, whose party has basically said or chunk of his party has basically said Ukraine should be on its own.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RONALD REAGAN, 40TH U.S. PRESIDENT: We in America have learned bitter lessons from two world wars. It is better to be here ready to protect the peace than to take blind shelter across the sea, rushing to respond only after freedom is lost.

And Peter was just right on that point. When you hear President Reagan's statement that isolationism and the retreat behind -- has never worked and never should work. That is not a speech that would get you the nomination for Republican President United States today. Clearly, we could see in the vote for the aid in Ukraine, that more than half the Republicans who voted to deny the aid, and even when it was characterized as a victory for Putin, if the U.S. abandoned Ukraine. So it's the President's challenge today, to sort of make that Cold War philosophy of Ronald Reagan, a core of the democratic approach, and not all of his party is along with it, either the progressive side of the party believes as much too much of a hawkish America must lead view. So he's kind of bringing in his own left. And then those in the Republican Party, who still identify with what Reagan said, and not with what Trump said.",
