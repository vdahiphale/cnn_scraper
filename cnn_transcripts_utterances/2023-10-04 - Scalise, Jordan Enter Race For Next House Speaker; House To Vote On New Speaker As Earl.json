Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana and Republican Jim Jordan of Ohio have officially joined the race now that Kevin McCarthy has officially been fired, an ignominious history- making headline for the Californians. A new speaker could be a fresh start tor House Republicans or it could be just another hostage sitting in the same office, terrified of doing anything to offend a tiny faction of his party? So how did we get here? For the very first time in American history, speaker-less. Well, it might have all began when Kevin McCarthy thought he could appease the MAGA right, with almost the notion that he would allow them to set just some of the building on fire. But that's not how fireworks. While the votes were still being counted, two days after the election of 2020, Kevin McCarthy decided he would cast his lot with the election liars.

This next chapter won't be easy, but I know what it takes to fight and I'm prepared for the battles that lie ahead. I humbly ask you for your support on this mission to be your speaker of the House. So, Jake, a reference there to the fact that Steve Scalise was shot at a GOP baseball practice back in 2017. Now he's under going treatment for blood cancer. But he said he feels great and he's up for the job and this is a moment that he and his team have been preparing for for quite sometime. They've long been seen as waiting in the wings if McCarthy were to step aside or were to stumble. But Jake, I could tell you, this is not a coronation for Steve Scalise.

And some of the questions that they are being asked, Jake, include what are you going to do with Ukraine funding? That, of course, has been a polarizing issue inside the conference. Jordan suggested he would not support more funding for Ukraine. And also, are you going to reform the motion to vacate, that tool that was used to oust Kevin McCarthy? And hardliners say it needs to stay exactly where it is, but now there are some moderates and centrists in the party who are saying we need to reform that tool so we don't have chaos again on the floor. But all of this is not going to be sorted out until next week at earliest. House GOP is going to have a candidate forum on Tuesday. They will vote on their elections on Wednesday.

That's totally his decision. And that's up for him to make, and was up for him to make. And now, the question is, what do we do going forward? Because to me, that's what country wants us to do? How are you going to make this work? And we've got to figure out ways and it might be looking at the rules to change the rules and change the motion to vacate?

We're back in a moment. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [16:33:04] TAPPER: In our law and justice lead today, former President Trump has seen enough of his own civil fraud trial for now. After sitting in a New York courtroom for two and a half days, he flew back to Mar-a-Lago in Florida. But not before filing an appeal against one of the judge's rulings and taking a parting shot at the judge. Trump stands to lose quite a bit in this case. Financially, this could spell the end of his entire business career in New York. And already mounting legal bills are causing cracks in his empire, for the second time in three years Trump did not make the cut for the Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans. Now to exclusive CNN reporting, Joe Biden's son Hunter is in big financial trouble and daddy's friends are not coming to the rescue this time. At least not as of now. Hunter has racked up more than $10 million in legal bills over the past five years and he could need to spend millions more. His allies hope supporters of President Biden would swoop in with fundraising but as of now he might have better luck starting a GoFundMe. CNN's Paula Reid is here to discuss. Paula, how did he manage to get $10 million in the hole and how does he plan to get out of it?",

According to the lawsuit, the CIA not only voluntarily turned over those messages to her attacker, but the suit claims also selectively edited them in such a way that it makes it appear as if the victim was having an extramarital affair, which she denies. So, for example, according to the suit, a message in which she is talking about feeling sore from a workout at the gym was allegedly presented in such a way that made it look like she was talking about being sore from a sexual encounter with this other employee, again, something that the victim denies.
