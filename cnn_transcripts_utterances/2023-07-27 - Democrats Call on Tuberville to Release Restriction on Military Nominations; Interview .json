We're talking about the best and the brightest and most accomplished military leaders, and the ones that the younger forces look up to. So, they're really playing with these folks who have literally dedicated decades of service to our country.And it really -- as I said, I will get back to it, it impacts the entire military community, because this isn't happening in a vacuum.

I think hearing that there's no resolution in sight is going to be very discouraging, and especially for those folks who are literally in limbo. When they get an assignment, we spend months researching, preparing, thinking about all the possible outcomes, where we could be moving. And then, many people have moved out of their homes. They're literally living in hotels, waiting to find out if they're going to go ahead to a new duty station or remain where they are.There's so much that's out of our control as military families.

And we know the grand jury has to be meeting if they are going to vote on an indictment, necessary, though not necessarily sufficient. And also, Jack Smith's attorneys meeting with Donald Trump's lawyers right now. We will see how this develops over the next several minutes.In the meantime, unusual new developments out of Russia this morning. The man, who last month led an armed rebellion against the country's military leaders, has been spotted alive, first of all, which is interesting in it of itself. But he's been spotted in the same city as Vladimir Putin. Putin is hosting a Russia-Africa summit in St. Petersburg. And this morning, an image was posted on a pro-Wagner social media account. Yevgeny Prigozhin was the head of a Wagner military group. It shows Wagner Chief Prigozhin smiling, you can see him smiling right there with someone who was attending the summit. So, Prigozhin, as you remember, he led the revolt that ultimately marched toward Moscow. CNN's Nic Robertson joins us now with the latest on this. So, Prigozhin's not just alive, he's happy and he's in the same city as Vladimir Putin. What do you make of that?",

He's media outlet is saying that this is a member of the delegation from the Central African Republic, and that's one of the handful of African clan states that Prigozhin interwoven with the -- with Wagner mercenary group, interwoven with the Kremlin have been helping back the leadership in the Central African Republic and a couple of other country as well. Mali, Mozambique, Sudan, Libya, to name but a few.And the quid pro quo on that was access to minerals, including gold, including diamonds. So, this is kind of, in a way, this maybe what we're looking at here is part of Prigozhin's get out of jail free card. Because remember, Putin said there's going to be severe consequences for your betrayal, for your mutiny a year ago. Yet, here he is, seems to be doing business again with the very countries that he was doing business with in Africa at the behest of the Kremlin in the past. Is he being rehabilitated or is this, sort of, some leverage he still has with Putin? All of that is unclear. But, yes, he's not dead. And simply people thought if got anywhere close to Putin, he would be.",

Nic, particularly important developments on the ground in Ukraine where CNN has learned that the Ukrainians are now putting more and more troops, significant numbers of troops into the counteroffensive in ways and in places where they had not before, pushing towards the south, perhaps towards the Sea of Azov.

But what we're hearing from the U.S. officials and from Ukrainians is that they've deployed the bulk of their military, they still have some in reserve to this front line, the southern front line, that it's about a hundred miles east to west, stretch south of Zaporizhzhia, and they've made some gains.And it's not just the Ukrainians saying it, which is the interesting part. One of the strong Russians military contingents has admitted that they've had to pull out of a small village. Now, this is a relatively small gain, but it's a gain that the Ukrainians didn't have before. And we heard from Zelenskyy -- President Zelenskyy last night saying, look, our guys did well.
