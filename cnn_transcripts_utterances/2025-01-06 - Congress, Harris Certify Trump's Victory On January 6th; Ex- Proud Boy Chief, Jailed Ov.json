Let's get right to what America is talking about, now versus then. Today, January 6th played out as intended with the vice president of the United States certifying the election results. No violence, no injured police officers, no deaths, no near fatal blows to American democracy. Today, unlike four years ago, the president of the United States didn't marshal a mob and then point them toward the Capitol. Today, unlike then, the outgoing administration listened to the will of the voters. Today, unlike then, the loser of the election didn't urge their supporters to fight like hell. Today, Kamala Harris said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
