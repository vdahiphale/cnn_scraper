We engaged in good faith in these negotiations, and we compromised quite a bit in this text. But one of the things we could not compromise on was the principle of having a linkage between a ceasefire and a hostage release. So that was a fundamental principle that we had to adhere to. Unfortunately, we tried many different language fixes to see if we could come to some kind of an agreement, but it was very clear we could not. And unfortunately, were backed into a corner with regard to this resolution.

Kennedy, Jr. as the chief, you know, the head of HHS, and, in effect, the person who will be running the health agencies of the federal government.And this is a test on all of these fronts.

I believe it's basically been a century since a Senate controlled by the president's own party formally voted down one of his Cabinet nominees.

Why was Tulsi Gabbard chosen? Why was Robert F. Kennedy Jr. chosen? Even Pete Hegseth at the Defense Department. These are all agencies that Trump wants, whose independence and traditions Trump wants to break, either because he views them as places that have been unfair to him in the past, or because he views them as critical to his designs going forward.And his language during the campaign about taking on the, quote, enemies from within, I mean, they are all designed to break the culture of those institutions, to break the independence they have traditionally had from simply executing a president's will, you know, under any circumstances. And so, again, like for Senate Republic, I think in all of these cases, Senate Republicans are being asked to do something they could not have imagined ever being asked to do. The vast majority of them will do it. The question will be, assuming David McCormick wins the recount in Pennsylvania and it's a 53-seat majority, are there four who will not? I did note that today there was one of those more moderate, relatively more centrist Republican senators. Tom Tillis of North Carolina, who said he would considered inappropriate that you try to have recess appointments at the cabinet level, maybe sub-Cabinet level, he said, but for Cabinet, he thought they should have to go through the normal advise and consent confirmation process. We'll see how hardball Trump wants to get. Because as you know, there's a constitutional argument where if the House goes along with him trying to recess the Congress and the Senate doesn't, he, by some readings of the Constitution, has the authority to do so himself, which would allow him to push through some of these, you know, clearly controversial and by most conventional metrics, unqualified appointees.",

But critics of this new bill argue the exact opposite. They say that actually it would reduce children's digital literacy at a time when technology is really a huge part of our everyday lives. They also argue that social media isn't all bad; that some kids can actually find better communities online as they connect with people from different backgrounds and find safe spaces for themselves. And Lynda, there's also the technical aspect of this as well, because how is Australia going to verify each user's age? It's a monumental task and also there are some security concerns because for instance, if these tech companies have to ask users for their personal identification documents and then store those online, that could spell a lot of trouble.

Still making an awful lot of rainfall along the coast making winds, of course, but the bomb part of this means that the pressure has to drop 24 millibars in 24 hours. In fact, this storm dropped 57 millibars. So double the category of a bomb because this thing rapidly intensified so quickly. And we've talked about rapidly intensifying storms all summer. It seems like every hurricane was a rapidly intensifying something. 77 miles per hour though the highest wind gusts so far. Something else this tapped into was a stretch of moisture in the atmosphere called an atmospheric river. And the river is what took all of the moisture and pushed it right onshore all the way, really, from almost Hawaii. We used to call it \"Pineapple Express\", but I think that became too cliche. The rain coming down is very heavy. It's still going to be coming down as snow above about 2,000 or 3,000 feet. There will be places that pick up 10 to 15 feet of snow.
