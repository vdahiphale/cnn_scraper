The conversation would happen on the heels, of course, of Israel striking Beirut and amid new signs of a potentially imminent ground incursion. All of this leading the Pentagon to adjust its military posture.CNN's Natasha Bertrand has more on this story. Natasha, what are you learning that officials are doing and what is changing in the region as they prepare for potentially a ground invasion into Lebanon by Israel?",

And that will likely involve sending additional fighter aircraft to the region. There are already squadrons of F-15's, F-16's, F-22s, eight-tens (ph), all in the region there prepared for the possibility that this is going to escalate even further.The secretary has also ordered that U.S. troops increased their preparedness to deploy really at a moment's notice, if necessary. So, what does that mean? That means, for example, if troops were previously supposed to only be prepared to deploy within a matter of 72 hours, for example, now they have to be ready within 24 hours or even less. So, all of this is in preparation for the possibility, we are told, that this conflict escalates to the point where Iran actually gets involved. That is the biggest concern right now for U.S. officials. And the Pentagon actually noted this in their statement. They said, quote, \"should Iran, its partners, or its proxies use this moment to target American personnel or interests in the region, the United States will take every necessary measures to defend our people.\" Now, a U.S. official did tell me that if Iran does fear that Hezbollah is going to be completely dismantled by all of these Israeli airstrikes, by a possible ground incursion into southern Lebanon, than Iran might indeed feel compelled to intervene in the conflict because Hezbollah, of course, is Iran's most important proxy militia in the region. But the U.S. now saying that they are prepared for every possible contingency here. We should note that the secretary of defense also ordered that the Lincoln carrier strike groups stay in a region. It's currently in the Arabian Sea. As well as the Wasp amphibious ready group, which is in the eastern Mediterranean. That is equipped with thousands of Marines who are prepared to help in a potential evacuation operation, again, if this conflict escalates further, and if one becomes necessary, Sara.",

It also may have sharp objects, like glass and metal in it. And for those reasons, that's why there are health risks, like if you encounter this floodwater, you come - it comes with the risk of wound infection possibly, other types of bacterial infection. Harmful bacterias are also in this water. You could experience other gastrointestinal illnesses after you encounter floodwater like this. And we also know that tetanus is a big risk as well.And that's why it's so important for people to avoid walking through this floodwater, avoid driving through it. We don't know how deep it may be in some places. If you do have to encounter floodwater because you're part of rescue efforts or you're part of safety efforts, then you want to definitely make sure to wear tall rubber boots, make sure these boots are snake proof. There could be snakes or other wildlife in the water. Wear rubber gloves, wear goggles, because, Sara, again, the risks here are high. And we also know that floodwater can attract swarms of mosquitoes. So also wearing mosquito repellent as well. Now, if you're someone who's already been exposed to floodwater, after the fact you want to definitely make sure to clean any area that was exposed thoroughly, wash your - yourself. Disinfect clothing. Wash clothing in hot water. Check yourself for open wounds. Your wound could have been infected. If that's the case, talk to your doctor, seek medical attention, and also determined whether you might need a tetanus shot. But these are definitely things to do after the fact and to be aware of during this now aftermath, Sara.",

We heard Tom Emmer, who is helping Senator J.D. Vance prepare for the vice presidential debate tomorrow, say that he needs to be talking about the issues, not personal attacks. But this is something we've seen from Donald Trump. And look, he - these comments came in a string of speeches that he gave where he really was painting a very dark picture of America. And it came shortly after Harris visited the border on Friday. And we know that Donald Trump has been fixated on that visit. He believes that she's really fighting on turf that he considers his own. Now, I do also, though, want to talk to you about something we also heard Donald Trump say yesterday while in Erie, Pennsylvania. He appeared to call for an hour of violence when discussing what he argued was a major problem with shoplifting. He also claimed that progressive policies are putting constraints on police and having them struggle with cracking down on this. But really his solution for it was quite jarring. I want you to take a listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You know, if you had one day like one real rough, nasty day with the drugstores as an example. All these stores go out of business, right? They don't pay rent. The city does have much - the whole - it's a chain of events. It's so bad.

So, I keep that in mind. But this is a frequent line of attack we hear from Donald Trump, particularly when he tries to focus on whether it be the border or crime. These are issues we know that Donald Trump is trying to prioritize. He is polling better than Harris on these issues.

Five points compared to four years ago. The reason Donald Trump is doing so well amongst voters of color is because he has really gone in and grabbed a lot of voters that he didn't previously have among those who didn't graduate college.

They don't want to hear that she's dumb. They don't want the personal attacks.More than that though, there's some other stuff he's been saying, that, you know, we're going to prosecutor her, we're going to impeach her. A lot of swing state voters and undecided voters are also telling us they don't want the chaos that defined a lot of the Trump administration and they don't want all the oversight, the investigations, the nonsense clogging up Congress. So, they're worried that if Republicans keep the House, all they're going to do is impeached and investigate and oversight. They don't want that either. So, a lot of this stuff that he's saying is playing to the base, but it is not playing to the voters that he needs in this final stretch.",
