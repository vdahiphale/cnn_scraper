Trump represents an axis in this primary that doesn't necessarily have anything to do with the level of conservatism that voters see themselves as having. And that is another place where we've seen DeSantis and Haley make different bets, make different critiques of Trump and therefore appeal to different constituencies within the Republican Party that just as Amy was saying, may not be compatible, may not want to be in a room with one another, may not be amenable to this splitting of the difference. So, you know, you have Haley who is appealed to more moderate to liberal Republican voters potentially political independence, which is a big voting bloc in New Hampshire and a big reason that she has a chance to do well there. You don't get those people in an Iowa or a South Carolina. And that's part of the reason that DeSantis has instead run to the right, run to Trump's right, making the critique of Trump not a characterological critique like Haley has made, that it's about chaos and divisiveness and discourse, but instead saying that he didn't go far enough and he wasn't effective enough at pursuing these sort of very conservative policies.",

She got the endorsement in New Hampshire of the very popular governor, Chris Sununu, who keeps saying this is a two person race.Chris Christie's in the race in New Hampshire, and he's polling. Like, he's got numbers. Does he have to get out for Nikki Haley to really have a chance in New Hampshire?",

      "sentences": "You would think so. And I think that's why you're seeing increasing calls for people on that front. I mean, if this is going to happen for Nikki Haley in New Hampshire, a couple things probably have to break her way. One, being Chris Christie kind of consolidating support or at least trying to get out the race.The other, I would say, is she probably needs to finish above Ron DeSantis in Iowa, which is not something that looks really clear either. I think that the two person race argument that Governor Sununu is making will become more complicated if Ron DeSantis seems like he has consolidated more evangelical support or others in other parts of the country. That is the argument which DeSantis is trying to make is that his ceiling is higher than hers. The problem is he has not been a candidate to really consolidate much of that support. And so Nikki Haley as an individual candidate has really outperformed him. But I would actually say, you know, to the point that others have made the well -- the Republican electorate has been poisoned against Nikki Haley for years now. You know, what Donald Trump has done in this party exists outside of ideology to that point. He's really reoriented the focus. So that a lot of Republican base voters are proud from the way they look different than the Bush years, are proud of the way they've kind of shunned corporations and the kind of kind of war axis that they talk about. And I think that is really what Nikki Haley is up against is a perception that she represents a kind of pre-2016 version of the Republican Party. So there is ideological policy things that she could do here, but there's a brand that she's up against. And it's really one that Donald Trump imposed on the Republican electorate and base.",

Amy, on the issue of immigration, look, you can -- you could spend hours tracking back the last several decades of who's to blame and why this is broken and different migration patterns. All of it would be factual. From a purely political context, how much is this going to matter in the months ahead for a general election? AMY WALTER, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, COOK, POLITICAL REPORT: It's absolutely critical and I think your framing of that is right, Phil, which is the bottom line is you could go back 20 years and point fingers at a lot of different politicians and things that have fallen apart. But the reality is, when you're the president, the buck stops with you and your job as president is to solve problems. That's what voters put you there to do. So, I think beyond the fact that there are real -- there's a real legislative log jam obviously on this issue. What are the sorts of things that the president, the administration can do from an executive perch to make some changes on the border that are not necessarily going to require Congress signing off on either more funding or the kinds of changes to the law. And I think that's probably where the administration is going to have to spend a great deal of time early in the new year, trying to make those changes and show the American public that they have some control of this.",

So, Phil, as, you know, there are just a handful of states that are going to be critical in the 2024 election that will determine who the next president United States is and Michigan and Nevada just a little bit to the left in the sense that they've been pretty consistently good for Democrats, with the exception, of course, 2016 in Michigan, 10,000 votes, the difference between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Donald Trump, of course, winning the state.But what we've seen in these last couple of weeks here are some really fundamental changes I think that that make it harder to believe that those two states, Democrats should feel as confident in those two states as they might have been earlier in the year. And I think you've got the war in Gaza. We know Michigan is a state that has the highest number of Arab Americans in terms of population. That is a significant factor in a state where every vote is going to matter. We know the President's low approval ratings. They are across the board. It's not just in red states or in true purple states, but in even in some Democratic leaning states, like Michigan, where the top candidate for the Senate in that state threading that she will be dragged down in Michigan by the President's low approval rating numbers. And finally, of course, Nevada big state for Latino voters. Democrats have been draining support or Democrat support from those voters has been drained since 2016 and we're not seeing a bounce back at least nationally from Latino voters to Biden or to Democrats. So all of those factors Phil combined to say, you know what, these belong in the same category as Arizona and Georgia and Wisconsin and Pennsylvania states that Biden carried, but by less than 50 percent of the vote. He did win Michigan and Nevada by 50 percent in the last election.",

You know, when two- thirds of Americans think you're moving in the wrong direction, they're not in the mood to vote saying, thank you.

He said that Dole and Gingrich, Dole, Gingrich, he called them every day, were a threat to Medicare, Medicaid, education, environment. Every day. I still remember that mnemonic, MMEE, Medicare, Medicaid, education, environment. He needs to say Trump is a threat. He's a threat to your job, your healthcare, your social security, your abortion rights, your constitution. Instead, he's saying, I did a great job, didn't I? Give me a gold star. It's a completely wrong approach. He has got to be fighting, and he's got to introduce an element of threat to his -- and that's how he'll get credit for his accomplishments if it's -- what economists call loss aversion.
