      "sentences": "Yes, so many coincidences, right? Well, in terms of what we're hearing today, so first let's start with Donald Trump. He's going to be in Nevada earlier today. Then he's going to be here in Phoenix. We expect to hear a lot about Kamala Harris. He clearly did not like that speech. She went after him. And that kind of thing gets under his skin. And you saw that in that Fox interview. So, even though today is supposed to be earlier, an economic event, and then later a rally, we expect to hear him reacting to Kamala Harris because, as we know, he likely cannot help himself.Now, what we're doing here in Phoenix behind me, RFK is expected to suspend his campaign. And we know there have been very high level talks about RFK endorsed Donald Trump at that rally later tonight, or possibly when he suspended his campaign. Donald Trump's team essentially saying that they were waiting to see what happened. Trump himself saying that there had been no conversation about a rally in Phoenix, but then, just moments later, his campaign putting out an advertisement for this rally, saying Donald Trump would appear next to a special guest with a shadowy figure. Clearly trying to allude to RFK Jr. here. Now you might be wondering why exactly Donald Trump's team would want RFK's endorsement given the fact that his campaign has been really plagued by scandal after scandal. We saw in May he admitted that a parasitic brain worm had entered into his brain and died there and caused brain fog. In a \"Vanity Fair\" article he essentially evaded questions about allegations of sexual assault but - from former nanny. And then, obviously, we saw what happened with the admission that he left a bear cub in Central Park. But if you look at this race as a whole, particularly with Kamala Harris at the top of the Democratic ticket there is concern that this race is going to be decided by razor thin margins. And I want you to take a look, or at least listen to the poll numbers here in Arizona. Six percent of Arizona voters in recent polling were for RFK. Now that is compared to Harris at 45 and Trump at 42. This is a \"New York Times\" poll. They believe that even if some of those RFK voters were to shift to Donald Trump, that could make up that margin. And so that is why Trump's team is really working for this endorsement and have been for several weeks. Obviously, we'll see what happens today, Kate.",

A cancer survivor. Congresswoman, I am familiar with Kamala Harris as a prosecutor. And that is Kamala Harris the prosecutor. What else did she bring to the table last night? REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ (D-FL): The Kamala Harris we saw last night was caretaker of the kitchen table and the commander in chief. [08:39:47] And the bookends of her speech last night were absolutely the stark contrast that the American people needed to hear because we need someone in office who is going to care about the affordable roof over your head, the grocery bill being lower, the prescription drug costs continuing to come down, and someone who cares about our freedom, not just freedom from, you know, Republicans and politicians getting all up in your personal health care business and telling us what to do with our bodies, but freedom around the world. And we need a commander in chief like Kamala Harris who doesn't cozy up to dictators, who's going to make sure that Maduro understands that there has to be, in Venezuela, a transition to democracy because he lost that election. And we have to have someone with a spine, like Kamala Harris, who is going to stand up around the world to ensure that we are not going to let tyrants run over there people.",

Those radios, never picked up. This is one - this is part of the new reporting coming out in the - on the investigation into the security failures that led to one rallygoer being shot and dying. CNN's Zach Cohen has these details. He's back with us. Zach, radios left behind. What could that have to do with it all?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Kate, a local official is telling us that if Secret Service had picked up these radios, they likely would have heard a warning that went out three minutes before the shooter opened fire in Donald Trump's direction. And that warning was about a man on the roof.And that's been a prevailing question over the last month as various investigative bodies have been trying to determine how the shooter managed to get a clear line of sight at Donald Trump on July 13th at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. And look, these radios were intended to establish a direct line of communication, or at least inform Secret Service about what local police officers on the ground were discussing in real time. It appears, according to the Butler County district attorney, that those radios were never picked up by Secret Service, which really underscores more broadly this disjointed communication structure that sources are describing to us that - in that Secret Service has used not just leading up to the Butler, PA, rally, but for years now. They actually do not ever have any sort of direct communication with local officers on the ground. Sources saying that instead they rely on a really disjointed, almost game of telephone between a series of liaison and command structures to pass messages back-and-forth. That really being a core problem. And how critical information was lost on July 13th as this crisis folded. And look, the Department of Homeland Security is looking into all of the security failures around the July 13th rally and the assassination attempt on Donald Trump. And explicitly looking at the communication breakdowns that day. I'm sure that they are going to think very hard about implementing some of the tools they haven't implemented yet, and also trying to revisit this idea of how local police officers interact with the Secret Service at these large security events.",
