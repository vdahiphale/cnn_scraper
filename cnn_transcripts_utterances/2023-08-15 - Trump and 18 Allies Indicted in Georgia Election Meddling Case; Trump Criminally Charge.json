Now, Phil and Poppy, I'm also told that Donald Trump's team was prepared for this indictment. And as they have done with the previous charges that he's faced throughout the past several months, they had been preparing his surrogates and allies, readying his defenders with pre-written statements and talking points so that they were immediately ready to respond to these charges.

Not only is he indicted four times.One of the things we don't talk about enough is he is indicted for different behavior in New York. It's paying Stormy Daniels hush money. In South Florida, it's classified documents. Now, this is January 6th. So, it's not as if there is this coordinated effort by these far left whackos to persecute the former president of the United States. No, this is a lot of smoke. And the question is where there is smoke, is there fire? And what Fani did, which I would love to hear Elie's comments, but what Fani did was she went in detail. I mean, this is beyond a federal speaking indictment. This is very granular, talking about the bad behavior of the president of the United States trying to overthrow the election. And they're going to try to compare this to Bush-Gore and how Democrats stood up and said, we don't believe he should be president-elect, blah, blah, blah, but the overt acts. II mean, there are over 100 overt acts that this president coordinated with others, including a bail bondsman in Georgia, Rudy Giuliani and other people, to overthrow an election, break into facilities, steal data. I mean, this is a very, very serious charge.",

And there's going to be cameras in the courtroom for this trial. SELLERSAnd something that Scott said last night and he echoes all the time, when we go around the country and do this work of politics, you meet very, very good human beings. I refer to Ruby as one of those old black women who sit in the front row of the church and she wears the big hat. And like when you hug her, you smell like Chanel number 5 the rest of the day. She like cooks sweet potato pies and uses a whole stick of butter, like she is the core principle of our democracy. She is the person who makes democracy work. And she is articulate about the fact that she is going through this pain because of the president of the United States. It also highlights something else about Donald Trump and it's something we have to talk about. It's the way that he goes after black women when they are on the other side of him. We have seen it with Yamiche. We've seen it with April Ryan. We've seen it with our own Abby Phillip. And now, we're seeing it with Fani Willis. Fani is the daughter of a Black Panther, a criminal defense attorney. Fani's name is Swahili, it means prosperous. I mean, she is the prototype of what Donald Trump has as disdainful. So, between Donald Trump and Ruby and Fani and all of these other subplots, not only is it going to make for good T.V. but it's going to have people realize that there are real victims in this case in Georgia, in comparison, where, of course, Stormy Daniels and Michael Cohen are victims. But they are less sympathetic than the people who make democracy run. And, by the way, I love Stormy and Michael.",
