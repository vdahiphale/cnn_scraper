Her comments came aboard a Philippine coast guard vessel on her trip to Southeast Asia. Recent polls have shown a majority of Americans, even Democrats, do not want Biden to seek re-election.In the coming day, U.S. Appeals Court will hear arguments about whether a so-called special master should be allowed to keep reviewing the records seized from Former U.S. President Donald Trump's Mar-a- Lago estate. Government prosecutors say this independent arbiter is impeding their investigation and they want him gone. Meanwhile, a special counsel is now overseeing the Mar-a-Lago case as well as another criminal investigation. CNN's Katelyn Polantz has the details. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "The Justice Department's newly appointed special counsel, Jack Smith, is getting down to business. He's getting to work only three days after his appointment by Attorney General Merrick Garland to take over two investigations around Donald Trump. And the first indications right now, are that the work that is already ongoing into those two criminal probes, it is not slowing down. So, Smith is going to be taking over a case that is about to be argued in a federal appeals court on Tuesday about documents that were seized from Mar-a-Lago. Donald Trump is trying to keep those documents away from criminal prosecutors.In a court filing on Monday, the Justice Department showed to the court Smith's documents showing that he was writing his oath of office. He signed off on his oath of office that Merrick Garland commissioned him into this role to become the chief prosecutor over this investigation. And also said, Smith has reviewed the filings in this litigation and approves of all of the arguments that have been presented in the briefs and will be discussed at the oral arguments on Tuesday. Also, stepping back, we've been hearing from sources the subpoenas that are out there trying to seek information from witnesses and from witnesses', both testimony and documents, in a federal court in Washington, D.C. those subpoena dates are not changing. Smith has sent the message to investigators who are working on these probes that he shouldn't be delaying any work as he's coming into place as the special counsel. Now, he is in the Netherlands right now recovering from a bike accident but does plan to return to the United States to take over both of these criminal probes. Katelyn Polantz, CNN, Washington.

Fred, you obviously monitor this very closely and have been to Moscow a lot throughout the year. Have you noticed any shifts in terms of Russia's rhetoric and posturing in terms of how they're framing this war to their domestic audience and the international community?",

Grand Rapids, Michigan, let me show you this, a record daily snowfall depth on Monday of 12 inches. Previous record was set back in 2014 at 10 inches. A new update for you, Hamburg now reaching the top spot, 81.2 inches.[04:55:00] Thankfully, again, the snow finally winding down still with maybe one or two inches with this next moving clipper. But otherwise, high pressure is in control and it's moving further east which tries to help to warm us up. But we're still dealing with winter weather with the next low-pressure system coming in over the Pacific Northwest. Winter weather advisories in effect the lower elevations through the cascades roughly about five inches of snow. But you get over 3,000 feet, now we're talking a foot which we need it in ski season starting to set up, and that's good there. But not so much when it comes to travel, especially on the holidays. So, there's that quick-moving system rolling through early Tuesday and then into the Northern Plains late Tuesday, bringing in snow to possible Billings down into parts of Montana, as well as, Wyoming. The darker pinks that you're seeing, that's again, 10 to 12 inches higher elevations but lower elevations roughly about two to five inches. All right. One front after the next reinforces the cooler air but right now, we have high pressure kicking in more of a southerly wind. So, we have temperatures back up into the 60s in Atlanta. And that warmer temperature trend holds over the next three days. As for precip, you saw that low moving in over the northwest. And there's that front. And as that front moves down across into the south and that low moves in from the Gulf, we increase our rain chances, bringing in a substantial amount of rain across the southeast and down into the lower Mississippi Valley where we really need it. Where we've been under the drought. So, roughly two to four inches here in the upcoming days. As for your Thanksgiving forecast, again, travel a bit dicey across the south and southeast as temperatures start to warm back up into the 60s and 70s.",
