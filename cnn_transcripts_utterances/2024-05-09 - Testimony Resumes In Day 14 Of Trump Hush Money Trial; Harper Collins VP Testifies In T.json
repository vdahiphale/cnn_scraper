I was inside the courtroom for this morning's riveting testimony as attorneys did the cross-examination of her, then the redirect, then the cross and then the redirect of Stormy Daniels. Joining me to discuss is former federal judge, John E. Jones III. Judge Jones, thanks for joining. I want to start with Stormy Daniels. She was, at times, explicit. She was, at times, crossing the line or at least the prosecution one in terms of details because, at least Tuesday, that was a thought. How do you think Judge Merchan is handling the proceedings? JOHN E. JONES III, FORMER FEDERAL JUDGE: I think he's doing really well, Jake. It's a tough go for the trial judge in a situation like this. And what sometimes folks don't realize, it's not just responding to lawyers' objections, but the presiding judge has the responsibility to protect the record and to prevent prejudice if they can in a case. And it's pretty evident that, on a couple of occasions, Judge Merchan, on his own initiative, decided that he was going to shut down certain areas that he thought were just a field of what was fair and fair game in the -- in terms of the interrogation of the witness.",

      "sentences": "Something interesting that happened this morning, before the jury came in, the defense team made it clear that they wanted to bring up the fact that Stormy Daniels had been arrested, something having to do with her ex-husband. Judge Merchan said, absolutely not, anybody can be arrested. Thequestion is whether now she's been convicted of a crime and she hasn't. And then later in the testimony, when the defense attorney, Susan Necheles, was asking Stormy Daniels about her time as a medium, conjuring fourth ghosts and speaking to people's love -- dead loved ones, she seemed to try to re-introduce that arrest. Again, no conviction and Judge Merchan shut it down quickly. But what is the purpose of that? Is the purpose of that to show it to the jury anyway, so that they see it, they see a little leg there and they wonder, huh, there might be stuff there that we don't know about. I mean, why do that? Why so blatantly violate what the judge said earlier in the day?",

She said, you know, you said something along the lines of being integral to Donald Trump going to jail. And what it was, was a crude response to a tweet.

I would be prone to call the lawyers to sidebar and say, look, you know, you're too long on this witness and cross-examination. You know, I would say sometimes, look, I've got the best seat in the house. I can see the jury. I can see that their attention is waning. You're getting hurt here. I'm going to recommend that you get out of this witness. You're just in it too long at this point. This thing is deteriorating and you should stop. Whether Judge Merchan did that, I don't know.

And she was there were really just to testify to the validity of a book, or an excerpt in particular, from a book called \"Think Big.\" Let's talk to our panel about this. It's an excerpt about loyalty, which I want to talk about here in a moment. But first, let's zoom out.

There is no question that Michael Cohen paid $130,000 to Stormy Daniels for -- as hush money to silence her. There is, to me, little question that a substantial part of the motivation there was the campaign, the 2016 presidential campaign. Yes, there probably were other motivations as well, family. But it's quite clear that the campaign was a major motivation. It is absolutely clear that Michael Cohen was then reimbursed $420,000 over the course of about a year. Donald Trump signed some, but not all of those reimbursement checks. The big question though, is, A, why was it set up this way? Was it set up this way to try to disguise the fact that it was hush money payments? Michael Cohen, surely, will testify to that. And we've had some, I think, pretty convincing testimony to that effect. And then really the heart of the matter is, did Donald Trump know, was he in on the idea of, let's try to make these payments, the reimbursements to Michael Cohen, look like legal fees so we can disguise the fact that we're really trying to pay Stormy Daniels to keep her quiet before the election? And Michael Cohen is really the one who's going to have to bridge that gap. They've narrowed the gap, I think, substantially, but it is going to ride on Michael Cohen.",

Not exactly sure where all that is going to. But one of the excerpts that Menzies read here said, \"I just can't stomach disloyalty. I put the people who are loyal to me on a high pedestal and take care of them very well.\" Another reading, \"When you are wronged, go after those people because it is a good feeling.
