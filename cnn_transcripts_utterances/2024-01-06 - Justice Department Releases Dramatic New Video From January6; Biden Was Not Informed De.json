But you know, I think it is also a reminder as President Biden tried to do yesterday about what is really at stake in this country, and just today, Trump was, I believe he submitted paperwork in the state of Illinois, where they said, well, you promised not to do an insurrection.

That's according to a source familiar who told that to our colleague, MJ Lee. Now National Security adviser,. Jake Sullivan did not brief President Biden about it until Thursday afternoon shortly after Sullivan learned himself about the hospitalization. The Pentagon did not disclose the fact publicly that Austin had been hospitalized since New Year's Day following an elective procedure and then complications from that elective procedure. They have not disclosed that until Friday. And just moments ago, we also received the first statement from Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin where he said he is on the mend and looks forward to returning to the Pentagon soon. But he did acknowledge these transparency issues. He wrote in the statement: \"I also understand the media concerns about transparency, and I recognize I could have done a better job ensuring the public was appropriately informed. I commit to doing better,\" he added. \"But this is important to say, this was my medical procedure and I take full responsibility for my decisions about disclosure.\" Now we still do not know if President Biden has since spoken with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, but this hospitalization does come at a critical time in National Security matters. When you think about the US dealing with the war in Ukraine and also this conflict between Israel and Hamas. Now the Pentagon really still has provided very limited information about why he was hospitalized. They simply said that there was an elective medical procedure, and then he was admitted to the hospital at Walter Reed on New Year's Day due to complications. They have not said whether he was unconscious during any of this time, or really provided any further details. The Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks was able to assume responsibilities from time to time, and they have said, the Pentagon, that he has now resumed full responsibilities as he remains in the hospital, but still some pretty serious questions about the lag time in notifying not just the public, but also President Biden about this matter.",

And so if they order the configuration where they don't need quite so many emergency exit doors, they can just tell Boeing when they order, just put the panel on the inside, but on the outside, it's still a door. So it will call into question whether they installed the same kind of door locks and then just put the panel over because we've all heard, oh, you can't use the door, in-flight, the door can't be opened in-flight, which of course they can. Or if they had another system to simply put this door patch in place, and it was improperly installed or they had some sort of, you know, a maintenance or mechanical failure. And we've had accidents, I am not saying that here, where there were literally the improper bolts placed or things were missing.

It shows, and I'm not sure if you've seen it, but it shows a confrontation between a couple of the rioters with some Republican members, and it's a pretty alarming video. It just strikes me as rather stunning that we're still learning new pieces of what took place that day, even now, three years later. Have you seen this video and what was your impression of it when you saw it? REP. ZOE LOFGREN (D-CA): Well, I hadn't seen it, but I'm sure you'll remember there was some still photos of the two Republican members attempting to talk to the crowd through the broken window and that was reported on and certainly the January 6th Committee knew about it. I think in a way, I thought at the time it was bizarre that Markwayne and Nehls thought that these were their friends and they could talk them out of the riot. I mean, I guess they thought they could talk them down. Obviously, that was not the case. But, this was a very dangerous riot. I've been reflecting on it today, as I think many of us who were in the Capitol have been doing. I've been reaching out to some of the police officers who helped defend us and who were injured. That some are trying to say that this was not actually a riot, that this was a peaceful protest is stunning and sickening.
