      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to CNN \"Newsroom\", I'm Max Foster in London. Just ahead, Russia strikes the Ukrainian City Mykolaiv less than 24 hours after a phone call between Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and China's leader Xi Jinping.Then clashes continue to rock Sudan despite the latest ceasefire where thousands of people are trying to escape the violence and a new point of contention in the political tension between the U.S. and China. But this time, it's about the giant panda. A speculation mounts about the timing of anticipated Ukrainian counter offensive. Russia continues to pound targets in Southern Ukraine. In Mykolaiv, the Ukrainian Military says Russian missiles hit a residential building and houses killing one person and injuring 23 others. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy called it another crime against humanity. Further East in Zaporizhzhia the regional military says Russia pounded targets with more than 80 attacks. Two people were killed there. Nic Robertson has the details from Northern Ukraine. What can you tell us, Nic?",

      "sentences": "Well, what we know about the strikes in Zaporizhzhia 83 strikes overnight or over the past 24 hours. Some of them were air strikes, there were 5 UAV some multi rocket launcher systems use, as well as multiple artillery rounds fired more than 69 artillery rounds fired there.The strike that you were talking about in Mykolaiv that was involved for S 300 surface to air missiles that hit an apartment building about 1 am in the night, very heavy damage to the buildings one person killed, as you said 23 people injured including one child. But perhaps interestingly, it's the satellite imagery from the north of Crimea that gives an indication of what the Russian forces are perceiving Ukraine's next move might be a Russian Military base in the north of Crimea that satellite imaging had showed earlier this year to have heavy armored equipment and it tanks, artillery pieces and recent satellite imagery has shown that actually, that site is now empty. It's not clear where the Russians have moved that heavy military hardware. But it does seem to indicate that perhaps they are concerned that it could be caught up targeted, and what is expected to be, they expect to be an offensive launched by Ukraine. Why North Crimea, they'd be moving their equipment from that base there? Perhaps they think that the Ukrainians are going to attack and advance along the coast from Kherson that area into close to North Crimea. But again, this is indicative that Russia thinks this but we don't know for sure. And certainly Ukrainian Officials are not saying where this offensive is going to be these airstrikes. So continuing in that region and showing that Russia is still absolutely on the offensive there despite whatever it anticipates about the possible offensive.",

Food, water and fuel are in short supply and fighting between rival military factions continues despite yet another ceasefire.

      "sentences": "Well, Max, it certainly doesn't seem to be holding as one doctor said to us that the generals in her mind are lying that there is no ceasefire. There have been some pockets of calm in the capital Khartoum, but overnight, very heavy fighting and into the morning, and now at this hour, it seems like continued clashes in different parts of the quad widespread Capital. So no, the ceasefires are not holding there have been very high level and desperate attempts from the diplomatic world to try and force these two sides to talk. At this stage, it seems like General al- Burhan of the Sudanese Armed Forces, the de facto ruler of the country is at least publicly being more open to having some kind of talks there's from the East African Community.An aim to get talks going in neighboring South Sudan, the U.S. Secretary General, sorry, the U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, and the African Union Head had been also trying to apply pressure. But the reality on the ground is, as you say, Max, the fighting continues. And the humanitarian situation is extremely dire in the country in various parts of the country. Within the capital itself, the majority of hospitals are closed. We've been speaking to doctors over the last few days; they're running out of supplies. It's very difficult for people to get to the hospitals to get treated for gunshot wounds and other wounds. And there is General Mayhem, looting is widespread, according to several eyewitnesses. And at that one hospital where we talk to a doctor, they said they have to have use from the neighborhood protecting the hospital from being rigid itself. The rapid support force, the paramilitary group has not spoken publicly about this plan to extend this so called ceasefire shaky as it is by the armed forces. So it's unclear whether there's any actual maneuver to get to some kind of protracted stalemate, or I should say, a protracted ceasefire. One thing to note that experts have been speaking too is these two forces are very different. One is the large, well equipped military of Sudan. The other, in a way was the paramilitary group that did the dirty work of Former Leader Omar Al Bashir. These are very different tactical forces. And while you have these airstrikes going on, throughout the days by the Air Force of the military and pounding these positions, this paramilitary group is very adept at this kind of guerrilla warfare that they grew out of from the atrocities that they allegedly committed in Darfur. So it doesn't mean that because the Armed Forces is the main military force in Sudan that they could just walk over this other force. And that's why people are worried that this could drag on without any clear winner as it were, for many, many months. And you've already seen a scenario in the west of the country where other armed groups may be taking advantage of this chaos. And that fragile piece that was in that part of the country seems to be breaking down as you saw from that a refugee who had fled to the border of Chad, Max.",

It claims they are carrying out a \"targeted campaign of government retaliation and violating Disney's constitutional right to free speech\".Disney and DeSantis have battled publicly for months ever since DeSantis signed controversial legislation restricting classroom discussion about sexual orientation or gender identity. Meanwhile, DeSantis is in Jerusalem, where he's expected to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Here's what he said about the lawsuit. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): They had no accountability, no transparency, none of that. And that arrangement was not good for the state of Florida. We did not think that should continue. So we now have brought accountability every other Floridian has to have this type of oversight all Florida businesses. So it's a little bit much to be complaining about that. I don't think the suit has merit, I think it's political. People of Florida they understood that this was an issue. Do you want one company to have their own fiefdom? Or do you want everyone to live under the same laws? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Disney has for the past 55 years, been operating under what we call a special improvement district in Florida. Meaning essentially, Disney has been given the power to govern its own land the way a municipality would. When Disney spoke out against that legislation that you mentioned, it kicked off this battle with Ron DeSantis, Disney criticized the legislation. And then DeSantis essentially said I'm going to try to revoke your special powers now, which led to this lawsuit. And so it's a fascinating legal issue because it has to do with land rights and property rights and contract rights.It pits two very big players, one of our largest and most well-known corporations in Disney against one of our best known and emerging politicians and Ron DeSantis and the stakes are really enormous.",

That's actually a really good question. Donald Trump has declared three or four other Republican candidates have declared dissent. This was three or four months ago, sort of the darling of the right and he was seen as the next great hope of the Republican Party and the most likely person to meaningfully challenge Donald Trump. But Donald Trump's been beating him up pretty badly for the last month or two. And frankly, this fight that Ron DeSantis has picked with Disney is not helping him politically either. So we'll see if he comes back and makes his declaration but this lawsuit is going to be hovering over his entire candidacy if he does declare.",
