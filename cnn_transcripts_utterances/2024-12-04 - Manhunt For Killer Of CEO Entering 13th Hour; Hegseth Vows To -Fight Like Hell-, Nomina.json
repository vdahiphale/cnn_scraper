The gunman who shot and killed the CEO of America's largest health care company on a busy Manhattan street is on the loose. The motive, unknown, as we are learning more about CEO Brian Thompson's past. And KFILE doing it again, revealing how Vivek Ramaswamy really felt about Elon Musk, the man he's about to team up with to cut government waste. Ramaswamy once calling Elon a circus monkey. Plus, a CNN exclusive. A top Russian official threatening the United States in an interview you'll see OUTFRONT, first saying tensions have never been worse between Russia and America. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, we begin with the breaking news, manhunt. At this hour, police are scouring New York City looking for an assassin who killed the CEO of Americas biggest health insurer. By the way, we are in the 13th hour. No idea where this person could be. \"The New York Times\" is just posting right now some brand new video of the gunman. Take a look at this. This was taken steps away from where the assassination that's what it was, took place. So there he was, just a between 6:30, 7:00 this morning, the suspected gunman walking down the street in Midtown Manhattan. And I want to warn you that what we are about to show you next is graphic. This is according to police, the masked gunman lying in wait for the UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, to appear. He waited several minutes. Then, just before 6:45, you see him stalking Thompson, using what police say was likely a silencer and then firing several shots from behind. So he passes him. Now, what we are not going to show you is that the gunman then walks up to Thompson and fires several more rounds. We have made a decision not to show that part. Seconds later, though, you see the gunman crossing the street and taking off, and then that's it. According to police, they know this, they say the path he took to get away was that he ran down 54th street in midtown Manhattan these are big, wide avenues, but in the middle of one of these, and this is not -- not, not normal in midtown. There's only a few streets like this in the entire city. There's a break halfway through the block. That's the famous Ziegfeld Theater in midtown. And that little alleyway is where the gunman ran. He then got onto a bike and made his way north into Central Park. Now, tonight, we do have a new image of the suspected gunman, police releasing this picture which was taken at a nearby Starbucks just before the shooting. So he goes into Starbucks. We don't know what he bought obviously. He had his face mostly covered, but you can tell, for example, that he's Caucasian. You can tell a general age range, you can tell you know more than you might think from a picture like this. You can also tell that he didn't want anyone to see his full face. And the motive is unknown at this hour. Sources tell CNN that there were threats made against the insurance company, but no idea as to whether any of that is related to this. And tonight, there's a massive police presence just a few blocks away from the crime scene. You see there, the Rockefeller Center tree. Tens of thousands of people are right at this moment as we are speaking gathering for a Rockefeller Center Christmas tree lighting. Brynn Gingras is OUTFRONT live near where the deadly shooting took place just hours ago were now, as I said, we're in the 13th hour of a manhunt. What is the latest that you are learning about the status of this hunt and the investigation?",

And police are also using some of that same video that you were just showing your viewers trying to piece together a timeline of this gunman's movements, in addition to even just trying to identify that person, hoping that the public with showing those images also can provide some clues.I can tell you really quickly that one of the deputy commissioners of the NYPD just came here to the scene to see for himself where this all took place.

He felt confident enough to take that shot, even though there were individuals. If you look to the right, it looks like there's a person standing there. It might be a person standing off. So he's confident in his shooting. What he might have had an issue with is the suppression, the silencer, which might have caused the jamming because he walked up as almost professionally that he's been trained or he has been proficiently worked on firearms, but maybe not with a suppression device which might have caused the jamming and also when he walked up to the to the victim and attempted to finish the job.

Who went into that room the night before?Because this shooter was tactically in place when he came out of this specific exit in order to shoot and kill him. Therefore I want to know who did this person, meaning the deceased contact the day before within that 24-hour period? Because that's going to be telling that there was communication which would allow the shooter to believe that this individual would have been at a certain point. I believe -- you got to take into consideration in a city like New York, the average person is photographed the videotape 100, 200 times 200, 100 to 200 times a day. The shooter was wearing a mask, so he was clearly surreptitious about his appearance but I believe that there's another person that's working with him.",

They're going to backtrack where he was prior to the shooting. We've seen that. Is there a chance that he had that mask, did not have that mask on at the around there. And then put it on when he was going to do the shooting? They say a half hour later. So you're going to -- it's going to take some time.

And we don't know yet. We don't know the personal details here of Brian Thompson's life. We do know the DOJ investigation into impropriety, financial impropriety, selling massive amounts of stock ahead of the company, losing quarter or a third of its value, that that was under investigation by the DOJ. We know about the threats that that his wife says that they had received. So we know some things like that, but we don't know what the motive -- ultimate motive may be, nothing even about it at this point. PORCHER: You're absolutely right. That's the million dollar question. When we look at there was a hack earlier in the year, whereas the company lost upwards of $2 billion. So the company was worth $5 billion. Then it went down to $4 billion. And then, as you mentioned, the financial impropriety, he never got that information out to the shareholders until after the fact because he sold millions of dollars in stock before he let the shareholders know about it.",
