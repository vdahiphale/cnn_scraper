In fact, we just saw a bunch of pizzas being wheeled in Speaker Kevin McCarthy's office, which is usually a sign that they are digging in for the long haul here. But Anderson, I would warn that there is still a long way to go because the two sides are still very far apart on substance and the clock is ticking.

But I would point out, he doesn't necessarily need conservatives in order to be able to pass this because presumably, if there is a bipartisan deal, there will also be Democrats who support that, but he does need their support in order to retain their speakership.

That's good lawyering. Now, the problem for the former president is that every time a piece of this evidence comes out, it is more indication that he knew he was in possession of the documents, right?

If he entered not guilty pleas, then it's possible that there could have been outrage that he's not taking responsibility for his alleged actions. And so by not saying anything, he didn't have any kind of characterization that the public could assume today, it's also possible, I'm told, that there could be something happening behind closed doors.
