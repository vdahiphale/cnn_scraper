Now U.S. Secretaryof State Antony Blinken is postponing a high stakes visit to Beijing according to two U.S. officials. It comes after suspected Chinese spy balloon was spotted drifting over the Northern U.S. And there it is. The Chinese Foreign Ministry says the balloon is a research airship which deviated from its planned course. U.S. defense officials say the incident is \"Definitely serious\". We've got CNN's Natasha Bertrand, in Washington for us and Oren Liebermann is at the Pentagon. Natasha, I want to start with you. Antony Blinken postponing his trip we knew there were multiple briefings that were occurring once the U.S. started tracking this balloon and trying to figure out what exactly it is? What does the postponement of the U.S. Secretary of State's trip mean for overall relations between the two countries?",

But what we know is that the Biden Administration really wanted todemonstrate some kind of response to this Chinese balloon floating over the continental U.S. without necessarily shooting it down, right? So some kind of diplomatic middle ground was really necessary here. And what we are told now is that, you know, the Biden Administration has over the last few days been weighing whether or not to cancel Antony Blinken's trip? Well, now it seems as though it will be postponed. The Chinese of course, have been trying to walk this back trying to ease tension, saying that this was accidental that this was a weather balloon, and that it simply went off course. But you know this is likely to just be another big irritant in the U.S. China relationship that was really starting to kind of get back on track. Of course, we saw that President Biden did meet with Xi Jinping in November. And that meeting went fairly well according to U.S. officials. They were optimistic that they could find some kind of a floor to the relationship and put guardrails up around potential conflict and kind of manage that competition between the U.S. and China. Well, now obviously, the U.S. is trying to take a very strong position against what at the same time, the administration is saying there's not necessarily a huge counter intelligence or intelligence risk to the United States, but at the same time does warrant some kind of response. So it remains to be seen how the Chinese are going to react to this postponement of this trip, because again, they have been trying to cool down tensions here and trying to deflect blame away from Beijing.",

But they have been clear, they view this as a spy satellite launched by China with some sort of surveillance or intelligence gathering capabilities. They do however, say that it doesn't have any abilities above and beyond what Chinese spy satellites can already do. Which asks the question, and then what's its purpose? What does it do? There is one official who told us that it can loiter and gather information about a specific area for an extended period of time, unlike spy satellites which obviously move very quickly, and hit an area once every 90 minutes? So perhaps that's the explanation. Obviously, the Pentagon is taking this very seriously. They haven't detailed what sensitive sites this balloon crossed? But we know it was over Montana, where the U.S. has one of its ballistic missile fields. So perhaps that was the sensitive site. And that's what has raised alarm bells here at the Pentagon and throughout the government. The Pentagon has been tracking this for several days now, along with Canada and Nora. And the question is where does it go now? Is it drifting with the wind? We've had U.S. officials tell us it is uncontrollable, and essentially at the mercy of the wind, so the Pentagon is keeping an eye on this. They've made the decision not to shoot it down for now. President Joe Biden was given military options but advised not to take any of those options, including from the highest levels of the Pentagon, for example, General Mark Milley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. But Pentagon officials have said that if they decide the risk has increased from this balloon, then they may take those military options and perhaps depending on how and where this goes, shoot the balloon down.",

And so while the U.S. does not want to take such a dramatic action as shooting this balloon out of the sky, as I mentioned earlier, they do want to send some kind of message. And according to this new reporting, this was the track that President Biden and Secretary of State Blinken decided on that this would be the way essentially to communicate to the Chinese that this is not acceptable. Because of course, this is not the first time that this kind of balloon has floated over the U.S. Now, it may be the first time that it's happened over the continental U.S. But as we have reported, it's happened over Guam and Hawaii, and in the past the administrations that had been dealing with this have kind of just let it float away. Well, now given all of this criticism by the Republicans on Capitol Hill, it seems like the administration did want to take more of a drastic action here, and this was the best diplomatic way forward. Now, it is unclear whether this is indicative of greater tensions that simmering below the surface. Of course, the U.S. China relationship has been far from perfect; however, they have been trying to repair it. So we will wait and see whether or not Blinken does, in fact, reschedule this trip at a later date after having these diplomatic conversations with the Chinese about the balloon Eleni?",

China expressing its displeasure even more than its displeasure with a new marine unit in Okinawa, with new military access to bases in the Philippines so you've seen them respond angrily to that. And this, perhaps is the U.S. responding in kind pointing out that this will not be taken lightly that a Chinese balloon, whether it's a spy satellite, whether it's a weather balloon is in U.S. airspace and above the continental United States. And the U.S. isn't simply going to look at that and say, alright, well, we're going to turn the other cheek here, and we're going to - we're going to walk away. The U.S. feels it has to respond and this is part of that response. Shooting it down yet that hasn't been decided upon, as far as we know, that remains an option.

And here, he would hope that that would be Saudi Arabia, because it's very influential in the region. But what Secretary Blinken said to him is that, that broader relationship and the region is no substitute for improving relations directly with the Palestinians. And that message that we heard from President Macron, about no colonization. And what Secretary of State Antony Blinken talked about, about no expansion of settlements are sort of faces of the same issue. And the issue that that confronts Israelis and Palestinians at the moment is, if the two state solutions really isn't workable, and a lot of people on both sides of the divide here, have really given up the hope, given up hope of it, Palestinians cling to it, because they think it gives them into international legitimacy. But if that's gone, then the solution becomes a one state solution. And that's a conundrum for Prime Minister Netanyahu. Because, as he's being told by Secretary Blinken, as undoubtedly has been told by French President Macron if you do that, and you don't give equal rights to Palestinian citizens, and that would be an improvement on their standing right now, then that would look like apartheid.

And if Iran reaches a tipping point, whether that's the passing of the supreme leader or military confrontation with the United States or Israel, then I think the likeliest scenario is that the Revolutionary Guards, which was the most powerful entity within the country, could potentially take over. And the future of Iran would look something between Pakistan and Egypt in the sense that the military will be in charge. And the distinguishing factor there is whether Iran will have a nuclear weapon --.",

      "sentences": "One research paper by a short seller, though that had such far-ranging allegations of fraud of stock marketmanipulation. And despite a huge rebuttal from the Adani group, just less than a week ago, actually some 400 pages that were released, it clearly hasn't done much to assure investors looking at that share price that we've seen. And there have been twists and turns of this story now almost every single day. The latest twist, I would say was TotalEnergies, which is one of the major international partners of the Adani group released in a statement say that it has limited exposure to the group some $3 billion. But it also said that it welcomes the announcement from Adani that they will be mandating one of the big four accounting firms to do an audit. Now, this would probably be good news in terms of investor confidence, except for the fact that we have not had that line confirmed by the Adani group themselves. There has been no comment and we have reached out to Deloitte, EY, KPMG, PwC. All the four big firms, none of them have responded immediately to our requests. And we've been looking back at Adani enterprises. In their last audit, they used a small Indian firm called Shah Dhandharia &amp; Co, the website address listed for that is currently invalid. So, it's hard to know what happens next with the story given we're getting so little information from the Adani group themselves. And this is now not just a financial fallout but a political fallout as well. I'd like to show you what the Indian finance minister had to say about this as he tries to reassure both lawmakers I think and investors. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The result of that was a fairly chaotic parliamentary session. And parliament has been essentially paused at this stage until Monday.
