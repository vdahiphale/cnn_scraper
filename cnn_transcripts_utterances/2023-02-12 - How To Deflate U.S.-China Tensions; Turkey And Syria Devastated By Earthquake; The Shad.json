Imagine if we have a real crisis over, say, Taiwan where ships or aircraft come into close proximity or contact. How are the United States and China going to manage that? We don't seem to have the lines of communication and the political environment has so deteriorated over the last 20 years, it's in some ways worse than the United States and the Soviet Union were, even at the height of the Cold War.",

But it's competition not -- you know, there are two ways, one, you try to run faster, but the other is you try to trip the other guy and there is a lot of us trying to trip the other guy, restraints on technology, restraints on exports.Do you think that Europe broadly speaking is on board with this strategy, that the United States has adopted toward China? DAVID MILIBAND, FORMER U.K. FOREIGN SECRETARY: Well, I think that Europeans have changed their tune significantly over the last five years. They will have been relieved last weekend that the administration was firm but not macho about this balloon incident. But they will be really urging that the cooperate part of the triad that says confront, compete, and cooperate, that that cooperate part gets filled out. Because at the moment, whether it'd be on global health or on the global climate, you see very little cooperation in areas that in themselves speak to the global commons and the responsibilities of great states. Then when you think about the Russia-China access or link over Ukraine, they're voting together on a whole range of issues at the U.N., you see the parties very far apart and if anything cleaving further apart. And the great fear, I think not just in Europe actually but across the rest of the world, is going to be that these two countries that are competing so ferociously, that the competition bleeds into every aspect of international relations and freezes out the kind of cooperation and diplomacy that is so essential.",

It's, you know, China and India but also Turkey, apparently Iran's trade with Russia has gone up a lot.In that context -- it seems this is a point Larry Summers made last week on the show.

We overuse the instrument. We ask way too much of it.And what you're suggesting is we're living in a world particularly if China is the target of the sanctions where the ability of sanctions to deliver is I think less and less and less. A country like India is going to potentially, though, gain twice. First it's now trading with Russia, oil and other things, then where we do limit our relations with China economically, guess what, India may be in a position to step in.

The Labour Party is now under management that's electable. The conservatives have got a leader or prime minister who at least exceeds his two predecessors. So you've got some form of center right, center left politics. But the whole left by Brexit is very, very large indeed, and it's getting deeper.

That nation was also devastated in the disaster and has been a pariah state for about a decade.So this terrible disaster while so deeply personal for so many is also deeply touched by politics, and we're going to talk about some of that now.

It's a more normal, quote-unquote, \"country.\" The problem there is, yes, Erdogan will try to manipulate this to essentially improve his political prospects and again the question is, can we keep control of as much of the aid as we can? I think we have to accept that some of it is going to go to the wrong places. I think you just do the best you can. But you understand it's almost like a tax, Fareed.

I think when you're talking about a wider development, when you're talking about rebuilding roads, when you're talking about rebuilding schools it's a different game.But remember, for 12 years President Assad has had the chance to deliver aid into the northwest of Syria. What's called cross-line aid, cross-conflict lines. It's basically zero. The U.N. reports on this every six months. The reason that there is cross-border aid from Turkey into Syria is that there is no aid coming from Damascus into the northwest of Syria. And here's the thing. The number of crossing points was reduced from two to one by the Russian veto at the U.N. Security Council. The first thing that could be done is open up the closed crossing point because that will get you into Aleppo, it will get you into the northwest region as well. So there are things that can be done and I think that it's in the medium term that we're going to have tougher problems.

Founded by Putin's ally, Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner group is believed to get its name from another man behind the organization, a former Russian military officer whose call sign was Wagner, in honor of the German composer much beloved by Adolf Hitler.To help us understand the roots of the Wagner group and the role it is playing in Ukraine today, I want to bring in Shaun Walker, central and eastern European correspondent for \"The Guardian,\" and Fred Pleitgen, CNN's senior international correspondent.

He spent most of his 20s in the 1980s in jail then he became a hotdog seller in Saint Petersburg. He started setting up restaurants. And at some point when Putin back in the late 90s was deputy mayor of Petersburg, he started eating at Prigozhin's restaurant, seemed to take a liking to this guy. Before long Prigozhin was catering meetings between Putin and other leaders.And then somehow he gets into this inner circle. And in 2014 when the Kremlin takes the decision -- Putin takes the decision to annex Crimea and to start that first invasion of Ukraine -- Eastern Ukraine, which is very different from the one we saw last year, they are trying to keep it covert, they are denying that there are any Russian troops on the ground even though, you know, all of us that were reporting there at the time could see there obviously were Russian troops. But clearly in the Kremlin, they started to think what can we do to have a bit more plausible deniability to be able to intervene and deny that really were there. And I think that's really the genesis of the Wagner idea. At some point in the spring of 2014, there is a meeting in the ministry of defense and Prigozhin is given this whole -- bit of land where he can train fighters.

I mean, they are very tough fighting force on the ground especially right now if you look at the area around Bakhmut in Eastern Ukraine, but a lot of this is also it seems very much about Yevgeny Prigozhin increasing his position, bettering his position especially of course trying to appeal to Vladimir Putin among the other people who are also trying to do the same, like for instance Putin's generals.If you look at the situation around Bakhmut, I spent a lot of time on the ground with Ukrainian fighters who have come face-to-face with Wagner mercenaries and they essentially say, look, the reason why Wagner is able to gain ground on the battlefield is because their tactics are so brutal and so in disregard of human life that it is very difficult to defend against them. I met one Ukrainian soldier who tell me his group of about 20 Ukrainian soldiers was up against 200 roundabout Wagner mercenaries. Now, a lot of them are people who are convicts, who are immediately recruited out of jail and thrown on the battlefield. And the way that Wagner does this, and I've crossed checked this with captured Wagner fighters who told me exactly the same thing, is that you have these convicts who are what's called the first couple of waves which the Ukrainians say is essentially cannon fodder. They try to assault positions head on, each group trying to gain a little more ground where there is massive attrition rates of up to 80 percent of these guys. And at some point these Ukrainian fighters are, of course, worn down by having to fight off these waves and then Wagner does have specialized forces, very capable forces that then try to attack from the flanks. On top of that. Wagner now has an air force. Yevgeny Prigozhin was just seen inside an aircraft saying he himself was on a mission to bomb Bakhmut. And they also have long range artillery. And in all of the places, Fareed, what we're seeing increasingly, and I think this really shows that that Yevgeny Prigozhin is sort of trying to come out of those shadows that Shaun was just talking about, so it certainly seems as though a lot of this is about public relations, for Yevgeny Prigozhin, but it's also, if you will, a desire to show that this is the only force right now in Ukraine that can get real results for Vladimir Putin, Fareed.",

That was likely a reaction to the joint statement by the two militaries pledging to expand and bolster the level and scale of their joint exercises. All of this comes after a year in which North Korea launched over 90 missiles.I can't think of a better person to help us understand all of this than Sue Mi Terry. She is a former CIA analyst on Korea, a former director at the National Security Council and the current director of the Wilson Center's Asia Program. She had a great article recently out in \"Foreign Affairs\" titled \"The New North Korea Threat.\" Welcome, Sue Mi Terry. I want to start by something that really caught my eye, which is that polls in South Korea now show that somewhere between 70 percent and 77 percent of South Koreans believe their country should have nuclear weapons of its own. That strikes me as a massive shift from say a decade ago. What is going on there that is prompting this reevaluation in South Korea? SUE MI TERRY, DIRECTOR, WILSON CENTER ASIA PROGRAM: Well, there is a recognition that North Korea is a runaway nuclear program. Since the failure of the Hanoi Summit in 2019, since the summitry and diplomacy have really collapsed, North Korea has been working on their nuclear and missile program. They have been quantitatively and quantitatively modernizing and expanding their program. It seems like the whole world is focused on other events understandably like Russia's invasion of Ukraine while North Korea has this runaway program.
