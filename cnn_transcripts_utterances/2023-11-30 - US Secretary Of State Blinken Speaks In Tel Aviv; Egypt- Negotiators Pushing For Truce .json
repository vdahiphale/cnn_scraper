      "sentences": "The prime minister and members of the war cabinet agreed with the need for this approach. We discussed thedetails of Israel's ongoing planning, and I underscore the imperative for United States that the massive loss of civilian life and displacement of the scale that we saw in northern Gaza not be repeated in the south. As I told the prime minister, intent matters, but so does the result. At the same time, Hamas has choices, too. Hamas could immediately release all of the hostages it holds. It could stop using civilians as human shields and stop using civilian infrastructure to stage and launch terrorist attacks. Hamas could lay down its arms, surrender the leaders who are responsible for the slaughter, the torture, the rapes of October 7th. Hamas could renounce its stated goal of eliminating Israel, killing Jews, and repeating the atrocities of October 7th again and again and again. Meanwhile, everyone around the world who cares about protecting innocent civilians, innocent lives, should be calling on Hamas -- indeed, demanding of Hamas -- that it immediately stop its murderous acts of terror and deplorable use of innocent men, women, and children as human shields. In our meetings with Israeli leaders here and in Jerusalem and Palestinian leaders in Ramallah, we discussed our continued focus on preventing the conflict from spreading -- whether to the West Bank, to Israel's northern border, or to the broader region. I raised our deep concerns about steps that could escalate tensions in the West Bank, including extremist settler violence and proposals from parts of the Israeli coalition government to further expand settlements. I made clear our expectations about addressing these issues. We also focused on what we can -- what we must do now to prepare for the day after the conflict, to create the conditions for a durable and lasting peace, building on the principles that I set out a few weeks ago during the G7 meeting in Tokyo. Breaking out of the cycle of violence, the cycle of conflict, ensuring Israel's enduring security demands improving the lives of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank in immediate, tangible ways, and providing them with a credible path toward their legitimate aspiration for statehood. In our ongoing conversations with Israeli, Palestinian, and Arab leaders, we'll discuss practical steps to make real a just and lasting peace and what each of us is prepared to do to help achieve it. We have no illusions this is going to be easy. We will surely have disagreements along the way. But if we're going to move forward on practical steps toward lasting peace, lasting security, we have to be willing to work through those disagreements, because the alternative -- more terrorist attacks, more violence, more innocent suffering -- is unacceptable. That is why the United States is here and we're leading toward this goal. With that, happy to take some questions.",

Based on what you heard from them today, are you confident Israel will follow the international laws of war in southern Gaza when it resumes its military operations? My second question is you and others in the administration have repeatedly said that United States wants to see a revitalized Palestinian Authority to rule Gaza and the West Bank.

Many of them are reportedly severely injured, and yet the Red Cross hasn't yet visited them. Can you clarify if this was indeed included in the agreement? And if it was, why isn't it being implemented, and why is Israel pressured to continue to expand the humanitarian assistance to Gaza while the Hamas does not let humanitarian access to our hostages?",

Hamas is believed to have released the vast number of women and children that were in its captivity. So what assurances, if any, do you have that Hamas might be open to releasing male hostages? And on the flip side of that, is Israel prepared to agree to the conditions set out by Hamas on that? Separately, President Biden has signaled that he -- that the U.S. is prepared to issue visa bans on what he described as extremist Israeli settlers. What is the status of that? And forgive me -- one last one on India. Federal prosecutors on Wednesday charged India -- an Indian national in a murder-for-hire scheme targeting a Sikh separatist and activist in New York who's a US citizen. According to the indictment, the assassination plot was organized by an Indian government official. The US charges come shortly after Canada. Canada's prime minister said that an Indian government -- the Indian government participated in extrajudicial killing of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil.

I can tell you thatfor the United States, for Israel, for other countries who have their citizens being held captive by Hamas, clearly, we want to see this process continue, move forward. We want an eighth day and beyond so that people can be returned to their families. And that applies to all hostages, whatever category they may happen to be in. But it's also up to Hamas. And again, I can't speak to their intentions. I can say that I think this process has clearly been beneficial, and the fact that so many have now been reunited with their loved ones and families is something we, I think, take joy in. But a lot of unfinished business, and we're determined to finish it when it comes to bringing the hostages home. With regard to extremist violence, all I can tell you is this -- we're looking to the Israeli Government to take some additional steps to really put a stop to this. And at the same time, we're considering our own steps. Finally, with regard to India, first, this is an ongoing legal matter. So you'll understand I can't comment on it in detail. I can say that this is something we take very seriously. A number of us have raised this directly with the Indian government in past weeks.

      "sentences": "Good evening everyone. You've been listening to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken there speaking in Tel Aviv followingmeetings with the leadership of both the Palestinian Authority and the Israelis as well. He said in broadest terms, the focus has been on getting more hostages out and getting more aid to Gaza. He serves the elation of those family members who have been reunited with loved ones and also shares the sadness of those that are still waiting. And they will not stop in their efforts to get them back. He said on the aid efforts into Gaza, those efforts have meant more than doubling of the trucks entering Gaza, but clearly, it's still not enough. And that work will continue. He was pretty adamant whereas Hamas' return -- regards. He said they cannot remain in control in Gaza. That point was underscored by the attack at a bus stop in Jerusalem today that Hamas celebrated. It killed three and injured seven. He said and they continue to say that they support Israel's right to defend itself, but this was the key part, I think. He said, \"The way it defends itself matters.\" He said measures must be taken to protect civilians before the war resumes. And that includes allowing displaced Palestinians back to the north those that have been pushed south and protecting infrastructure, like hospitals. He says it's difficult, but it can be done. And he said the Israeli government agrees he was pushed on what measures, perhaps, the Israelis have agreed to. He wouldn't give further details on that. He also said that Hamas has choices, too. They can release the hostages. They can stop using civilians as human shields. He also talked about the future in the building conditions for sustainable peace, but clearly, lack detail on just what that looks like. In the meantime, today, two more Israeli hostages have been released so far. This is the moment 21-year-old Mia Schem was reunited with her family. The French-Israeli citizen was kidnapped from the Nova Music Festival on October 7th. And sources close to those hostage talks say a total of eight Israeli captives were to be released on Thursday. So we are awaiting word on the others, of course. Now Matthew Chance is in Jerusalem for us. We got Ivan Watson in Beirut and Jennifer Hansler at the State Department for us, too. Jennifer, I want to come to you first on what we heard the US Secretary of State discussing there in the comprehensive detail. Very clear that that support for Israel's right to defend itself remains, but again, before the war restarts, concrete measures on better protection for civilians, that he says the Israelis agreed to, too. If so, that would be a success from these meetings.",

Is that sort of emphasis that the Secretary of State made there when he underscored the point that Hamas cannot remain in control? And he pointed to the violence that we saw where you are in Jerusalem and those that lost their lives at that bus top attack, and that the fact that Hamas celebrated it. It's a very tenuous truce that's holding at this moment and moments of violence like this where it underscores that the challenges of coming together, no matter just on this, but something more broader are highlighted when you see violence like this.",

      "sentences": "Yes. I mean, look, I mean, the two sides are so far apart in virtually every way. The fact that there's a temporarytruce in place right now, you know, is really a sort of miracle, that it's been unable to happen and has been going on for seven consecutive days. Like Secretary Blinken was saying there, the hope is digging on for an eighth, for a ninth, for a tenth day as well to get as many hostages out as possible. But the truth is -- I mean, an Israeli legislator has spoken to me tonight saying that he believes that we're close to the end of this phase of the deal -- the phase in which women and children in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and a flow of aid inside to the Gaza Strip. That phase, well, that's coming to an end. And the process is underway -- the diplomatic process to try and sort of transition to the next phase, which is, inevitably, going to involve, if not military action, then the release of some of the adult male prisoners, including Israeli soldiers. And what Hamas wants, according to this Israeli lawmaker, is to reevaluate the equation, to recalculate the equation. At the moment, they're getting three Palestinians for every one Israeli hostage that's released. They want to change that. They want a better deal than that. Now, Israel has indicated it may be open to that kind of negotiation. But at the same time, it's also reiterating that what it believes will bring Hamas to the negotiating table and to get the Israeli hostages out -- the rest of them -- is a return to military action or at least the threat of military action. And so Israel is sort of about being pretty categorical about this that they will resume that military activity inside Gaza Strip -- the Gaza Strip as soon as this, you know, kind of pipeline of hostages out of the strip actually stops, or gets blocked, through whatever reason. Now, you know, listening to Secretary Blinken there, there was plenty for the Israelis to take part in. You know, he spoke about how Israel have the right to defend itself, how Hamas can't be allowed to continue to control Gaza and must stop using civilians as a shield. But, you know, make no mistake, this was also a very clear warning from the United States about what Israel's next step should be -- to provide civilian protection before returning to military action, making sure infrastructure and humanitarian aid flows are in place. And also, you know, to allow the people who have left the northern -- the northern Gaza Strip to go back, there must be no enduring internal displacement, he says. So this is, you know, the United States, essentially, a close ally of Israel basically telling its ally, this is what we need you to do.",

In particular, here I am in Beirut. I'm talking about Israel's northern border with Lebanon where the combat continued for much of the last month and a half on the Lebanese side, at least around 100 people killed -- the vast majority of them, Hezbollah fighters and also at least 15 civilians, several among them journalists. What this means is it just underscores how volatile not only the situation around Gaza and the West Bank are, but also on Israel's other borders and against enemies of Israel that have far larger supplies of weapons and capacity to fight. So far, though there has been cross-border contact and deadly battles -- essentially, artillery duels between Hezbollah and the Israeli military -- we haven't seen full-fledged fighting the likes of which we saw in 2006. And that is a scenario that I think everybody is conscious of not only the Lebanese front, but other allied militias with Iran that can also pose a threat to Israel if the fighting resumes.",

At that moment, it seemed that there's no daylight between the Biden administration and the Netanyahu government. And here, we are 54, 55 days later, and the secretary basically exposes two clusters of very important differences between the two governments. The tactical that you mentioned and that he enumerated and accentuated, which is how does Israel conduct a war, the issue of protecting civilian -- innocent civilian lives, the humanitarian supply for those displaced and so on as well as settler violence, Jewish terrorism along the West Bank, that has to be reined in. But there was another cluster, a strategic one, that is to say the entire administration's strategy, both in terms of pacifying Gaza the morning after and pacifying and moving the Israeli-Palestinian context writ large on the road to a settlement and the U.S. efforts that were stopped on October 7th. United, obviously, which is to resume forging a regional coalition to block Iran's regional meddling, all of those are, at the moment, stuck in Jerusalem when the Israeli government says no to the two prerequisites for all three. Which is that the Palestinian Authority governing the future, the governing entity on the West Bank, as well as in Gaza, and that it's all done in the context of a peace process. Without these two, the administration has heard in the region that no country could contribute to the post Gaza strategies absent answers from these two in Jerusalem. If I may conclude, when the administration says there is a need for these two, I say that when it is translated into Hebrew and Arabic, it means a new policy in Jerusalem and maybe a new government.",
