He also called for a full exchange of prisoners between Russia and Ukraine in the Russia and Ukraine war. And his message, in general, was one of a call for peace, for taking the message of Easter, one of new life and hope, and applying that to various conflicts and difficulties around the world. Now, as you said, Francis has been battling some health difficulties. He pulled out of a Good Friday service due to a desire to preserve his health. But this morning, the Pope seemed on good form. He traveled around St. Peter's Square in the Pope mobile, greeting the thousands of people who'd gathered to celebrate Easter Sunday. Last night, he was at the Easter Vigil, presiding at that service, which went on for more than two hours. And on Thursday, went to a female prison in Rome to wash the feet of female inmates. So despite some of the fragility that he experiences with his health, the Pope is showing a determination to keep going and he is certainly over this Easter time continuing to preside at the liturgies and to continue with giving his message to the world, one of, at Easter, one of hope, one of reconciliation.",

That will allow more vessels to get in and around the collapse site.Now, just over my left shoulder. Now that the sun's up, you can see the Dali there as well as the remains of the bridge on and around it again, we've seen the largest crane on the east coast, the Chesapeake 1000 brought in. We're also going to be seen in the coming days and weeks, more equipment, six more floating cranes, more barges, more tugs, other vessels brought in as crews go through this delicate salvage process. And as this is all going on, we're still having more than 1,000 engineers here in Baltimore and across the country starting to analyze. The best ways to take these various pieces apart, of course, if you cut and remove one section, it could potentially shift a little bit on and around the water. So trying to keep everyone safe as they go through this process. You also mentioned that underwater natural gas pipeline. Yesterday, we did get confirmation from Baltimore Gas and Electric Company that they were able to isolate that line. They were able to release some gas from it as a proactive safety measure. Also told no impact to customer safety as a result of that. But again, just highlights how complex of a process this is. Again going to be weeks to try and get all of this out of here and then try and reopen the port.

As you can see, this is actually the third time the Turks are voting in an election in the last year. And this is local elections. And normally we might not pay too close of attention.But in this case, there are some important reasons why we should. First off, let me just show you the view here of where we are. So we are in the Beyoglu district of Istanbul. You can see the view out the window. It's gorgeous. This is where President Erdogan himself was born and was raised. This is his home district. And as you said, he is playing an outsized role in this election. It is really a referendum on his rule and his popularity and his handling of the economy, which is really sputtering. You have inflation that is out of control. You have interest rates that have hit 50 percent, 50 percent. And Erdogan himself has injected himself into the race. He is on plenty of posters and banners around town. He's held rallies in the waning days of this race. The other reason why this race is important is who is on the ballot. And you can see for local races there's three of them, but the one that all eyes are on is the white one there. That is the Istanbul mayoral race and there are 49 names on it. And one of them is Ekrem Imamoglu, that is the incumbent mayor of Istanbul. He is widely seen as one of the very few opposition figures that is strong enough or popular, maybe even the only opposition figure who could take on President Erdogan directly and maybe win in a head to head election. And so, if he wins, then it means Erdogan has some competition for the next few years as we head into the next presidential race. If he loses, then it is really back to the drawing board for the opposition in this country, which has not, in recent times, fielded a very strong candidate. And so, that is why President Erdogan has put so much effort into trying to defeat Imamoglu before this local election might actually strengthen his hand. [07:20:08] There is one thing standing in Erdogan's way for running for president one more time, and that is the Constitution of this country. But Victor, there are plenty of pundits who have pointed out the loopholes that he could find which may allow him to run just one more time.",

We've seen a lot of concern, a lot of worry about the King, but particularly, we've seen a lot of concern and panic about Kate.

And, of course, the big loss, the big sort of lack we have is the Prince and Princess of Wales and their three children. They are the royal stars. They are beloved by the crowds. Of course, the crowds love the King and Queen, but they love William, they love Kate. And without William and Kate, the royal family does look very, very slim. I mean, the slimmed down royal family was the project of the King. But we see the consequence of it here when we have two major royals suffering from cancer. And when you were royal, it's not like a job when the rest of us have when you -- if you have cancer treatment, someone else covers for you. You know, there's no one really to cover for the King.

And that is going to be up for William. So expecting to see him in sort of late April when the children go back to school. But I don't think we're going to see Kate for quite some time, probably not until the early summer because she is undergoing this treatment. And as we know, the treatment for cancer is rough. It's rough on the body and mind.

This could be a change of government. And the monarch has a key role as the head of the state in this activity. He has to open Parliament, dismiss, Prime Minister, welcoming the new one. And, you know, these pictures are showing here of the Queen accepting the flowers and that Charles, he's looking in great form, but certainly this is his first engagement, the first time we've seen him in public since early February, since he left the hospital, left the London clinic after his initial treatment. So I think it's something that you will find quite exhausting when he'll be ready to get back to the actual full time duties of monarch, I think it's a question. I don't expect to see him.

Wax poetic about the papers in the coverage that he's getting about the Weisselberg plea, who, of course, is his former person who dealt with his finances. That plea is going to be on April 10th. Talk about the documentary for Stormy Daniels. This has everything in it, Victor. But I think at the end of the day, the judge has made clear that the trial is moving forward on the merits. Listen, I think it's premature. Why? Yes, it has. That is the motion. A sampling study of the media talking about how the locality, right, in New York County voted against him in 2016 for Clinton, against him for Biden. Again, having everything in there. But what jury selection is about is about picking a jury that could be fair to the case. And you ask the jury questions. If the jury has apparent biases, they're struck from the case for a cause. For cause challenges are unlimited. The second issue Victor is it's not whether you know about the case or have opinions about it. It's whether or not, with respect to questions for the jury who are qualified to serve, whether those opinions will so overwhelmingly influence you as to not be fair, impartial, and have the ability to base the case on the facts and evidence that you hear.

What are they instructed to do with the factual findings?And so, it's not unusual for you to submit proposed jury instructions, you being the prosecution and the defense. In this particular case, what makes it so unusual is that the judge is asking the jury to make a determination as to whether or not these classified documents could be considered Trump's personal property. That appears to be contrary to the law, which would suggest in state that nothing the president does really is his personal property. It's a matter of public record under this, you know, Presidential Records Act Law. You can, if you're the president, make exceptions under limited circumstances, birthday cards, other things. But the fact that the judge is even considering an instruction to the jury that they could consider, hey, these were the president's personal property turned a lot of eyes.
