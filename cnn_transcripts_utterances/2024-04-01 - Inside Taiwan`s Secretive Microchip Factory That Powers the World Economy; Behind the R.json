Behind these walls, some of the world`s most advanced, highly secretive technology. It`s so secret you have to check your phone, your laptop, anything that emits a signal just to walk through the door. RIPLEY (voice-over): As demand for A.I. driven technologies soars, TSMC is the go-to global manufacturer, sending stocks skyrocketing. The company`s workforce, 77,000 strong and growing, a far cry from its humble beginnings in 1987, says the senior vice president of human resources, Laura Ho. What is it like to run H.R. for what is arguably the most important company in the world right now?",

An expansion world leaders say is necessary to protect the global chip supply chain from potentially disastrous disruptions. We got a taste of that during the pandemic. Months long waits for new phones, laptops and other tech. Any major disruption could mean waiting years for cutting edge tech.
