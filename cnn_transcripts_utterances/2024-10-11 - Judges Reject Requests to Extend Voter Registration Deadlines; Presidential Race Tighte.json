      "sentences": "Yes. Good morning, John. A federal judge here in Georgia ruling against civil rights groups saying that their arguments lack clarity and detail as to how specific individuals were harmed by the voter registration deadline not being extended.Attorneys for the Georgia chapter of the NAACP as well as the Georgia Coalition for the People's Agenda brought testimony from individuals affiliated with their local chapters who said that they couldn't conduct voter registration drives because of the impacts of Hurricane Helene. They said they had no internet access and no power. But attorneys for the state pushed back saying that not being able to conduct a voter registration drive much different than an individual not being able to register to vote. And a judge here, Elean Ross, an Obama appointee, agreed saying, quote, \"We did not hear from anyone specifically who could not register to vote.\" She went on to say, harms to the state interest outweighs the interest of the plaintiffs. Now, attorneys for the state had argued there would be a tremendous administrative burden on the elections offices throughout the state if the voter registration deadline was extended. Judge Elean Ross also saying that the attorneys for the plaintiffs did not point to any specific statute or authority that the governor or secretary of state had to make the authority to change the voter registration deadline. Similarly, on Wednesday, a Florida judge there, a Bill Clinton appointee, ruled against civil rights groups, the local chapter of the NAACP trying to do the same thing, as well as the League of Women Voters in Florida. It's clear that these civil rights groups believe that every vote in their state could be consequential in the 2024 election, but these judges pushing back, saying procrastination and not registering before the deadline expired, not enough an excuse to extend the deadline.

These are, of course, the Great Lake Battleground states, the states we've been focusing in on. If Kamala Harris wins these three, she most likely gets to 270 electoral votes.Take a look three weeks ago. Harris was ahead by two in Pennsylvania, two in Wisconsin, three in Michigan. Look at where we are today. The race is even tighter, even tighter than it was today. It's a one-point advantage in Pennsylvania, one in Wisconsin, one in Michigan. Look, that's limited movement. But in a year in which this race has been so static, we're talking one point movement, one point movement, two- point movements, and we see movements in all three. This is the type of thing that, at least in the public polling, makes Democrats worry. And I think that the public polling, in this case, is reflected in some of that internal polling, some of that reporting that suggests that these Great Lake Battleground states have certainly tightened a lot where, at this point, they are way too close to call.",

You go four years ago, Joe Biden was up by an average of seven points across these three Great Lake battleground states. You come today, it's just a one-point advantage for Kamala Harris across these three Great Lake battleground states. So, Kamala Harris, at least in the polling, is doing considerably worse than Biden or Clinton. And of course, Clinton lost in all three of these states, and Joe Biden barely won in all three of these states. So, when you see Harris up by just a point across these three, I think that this is really the type of thing that gets Democrats really to worry, John, because the simple fact is Kamala Harris, is doing considerably worse than either Biden or Clinton was.",

What she actually got was something different, but it looked like the real pill. She ultimately died from it. And what they say, these aren't pharmacists that are actually fulfilling these orders. Oftentimes, these are drug traffickers. And let's take a look here at some of the warning signs you should be looking out for. If a website is giving you a prescription without -- medication without requiring a prescription, that's an issue. If the prices seem too good to be true, really cut-rate prescription prices, that could be a warning sign. If you get the pill and it's in, you know, damaged packaging or the pill itself might be damaged, that is an issue to be looking out for. And if there's no expiration date on the pill, that is a giant red flag. Here are some of the websites that DEA had pointed out that are fraudulent.
