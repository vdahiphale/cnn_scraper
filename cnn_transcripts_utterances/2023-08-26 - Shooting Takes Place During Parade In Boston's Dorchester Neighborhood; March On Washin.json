At this point, there's zero indication that there's any actual active threat there, but the investigation is very much just getting started after an early morning shooting in Boston's Dorchester neighborhood. It left at least seven people hurt. We understand that their injuries, according to what Boston police have officially confirmed this morning, are not life threatening.As you mentioned, we do also hear that there are several people who have already been arrested as well as firearms recovered. It's also important to point out that this happened during the city's Caribbean carnival that actually typically includes two parades. In fact, one of them was getting underway when those shots rang out. However, at this point, still we have not heard any sort of indication that this incident will interrupt today's festivities, though it certainly wouldn't be surprising if we at least see a delay in that given the scope of this investigation when you see some of the pictures coming from the scene. You can see that police there certainly have a large crime scene to cover and to go through. But if there's any good news to report here, it's fortunately, again, none of the people who were hurt this morning. Unclear if they were directly from the shooting itself. All of them are expected to survive after, again, shots rang out in Boston's Dorchester neighborhood this morning at about 7:45. Still a lot to learn in this one.

And it's complicated because all of the 19 defendants, they don't necessarily have the same idea about how it should move forward. As you said, two of the defendants, Sidney Powell and Kenneth Chesebro, they want this trial to happen quickly. They filed motions to have a speedy trial. And for Mr. Chesebro, a judge has already set a date of October 23rd.President Trump, however, former president, he does not want to have such a quick trial. And so he's opposing that, and potentially leading to a severing of these cases, where Mr. Chesebro, he could have a separate trial from the other defendants. The other question of this is what venue is this trial going to take place? We have now seen five of the 19 defendants have filed motions to move the case from state court into federal court. That includes Mark Meadows, the former White House chief of staff, Jeffrey Clark, former DOJ official, and three of the Georgia officials who served as state electors. Now, one of the reasons they are doing that is that a jury pool in a federal trial, it would be wider than it would be if it was just in Fulton County, because it would include some of the surrounding counties. This is also an important question because former President Trump, he is also expected to file a similar motion. Now, if this is going to succeed, we will learn more on Monday, because that is when Mr. Meadows has a hearing before a district court judge who will decide whether or not this motion to move the case to federal court is ultimately going to be successful, Amara and Rahel.",

They have now provisionally suspended Luis Rubiales pending the disciplinary proceedings that have been opened against him.

Many expected Rubiales to resign after he was heavily criticized for forcefully kissing a player, Jenni Hermoso, during the World Cup trophy presentation. And we'll show you the kiss on the right side of the screen.But not only did Rubiales not resign yesterday in front of an extraordinary general assembly that was called, he doubled down. He said that kiss was mutual, and he said he's going to fight to the end, calling what was happening to him an unjust campaign and fake feminism. After he said all of that, the player who was forcefully kissed, Hermoso, released a statement saying in no way was that kiss mutual. She said, quote, \"I felt vulnerable and a victim of an impulse-driven, sexist, out of place act without any consent on my part.\" Hermoso also said she had been pressured to actually release a statement that would verify Rubiales's version of events. The Spain's women's players, they are standing by Hermoso saying they're not going to play again until Rubiales is out. And earlier today, Rubiales and his office actually tripled down. They said that he has not lied in his version of events, and in a statement they actually threatened legal action against Hermoso. The federation also went on to say that the players have an obligation to participate in matches.

Both of those places still under excessive heat alerts for this today and through the weekend across the south.We also have additional ones starting to pop up in the southwestern U.S. That's where we're going to continue to see the temperatures jumping up in the coming days. Palm Springs going from 114 up to 117 on Monday, Phoenix 113 jumping to 115 Monday and Tuesday. So again, you're really going to start to see those temperatures jumping in the coming days. The opposite in the eastern half of the country. Yesterday and the day before, the red color was all the way up towards Minneapolis. Gradually we've started to see that shrink back, focusing a little bit closer to the Gulf Coast. We'll continue to see that shrink back in the coming days. Take, for example, Memphis. One more day of the triple-digit temperatures, then they then drop back into the 80s. But we're still looking at pretty intense heat right there along the Gulf Coast including Houston and New Orleans bock looking at several more days of the triple-digit temperatures. And one thing that may actually provide them some relief would be in the form of a tropical system. This potential development here just off the east coast of the Yucatan peninsula is expecting to slide into the Gulf in the coming days. That could provide some extra cloud cover and also some relief in the form of rain. Now, right now it's a pretty disorganized system, not really much to it. But the fact is as it moves into the Gulf, it's going to more into a much more favorable environment. So we do anticipate that this will become a tropical depression and eventually into a tropical storm in the coming days. And then it's going to start to make its way up into Florida as we get into Tuesday and Wednesday of this week.

So Mary, great to see you. Good morning. Let's start with the funding first. What do we know about how this money will be divided and where it's going?",

And they break that down even further. Two-thirds of the time they blame it on the pilot -- miscommunication, getting confused on the runway, which is why these grants are important to sort out the runways. Pilot error confusion two-thirds of the time, but air traffic controller mistakes one-third of the time.And you literally rely on that air traffic controller. I'm a pilot who can honestly say an air traffic controller saved my life years ago. But you rely on those instructions. And knowing that one-third of the mistakes are the controller's, that's something that only the FAA can fix. And the FAA has to fix that. That's why the second announcement this week, that they had hired an additional, I think it was 1,500 controllers this year, is hugely important, because 77 percent of the air traffic control facilities, the FAA facilities, don't even come up to 85 percent employment. And 77 percent of the facilities are below 85 percent staffed. And so the new hires are important, but training can take 18 months to three years. So it's going to be awhile before we see all these people fully deployed. But that's a huge improvement, and a good start.",

SCHIAVOwithin the control of Federal Aviation Administration. One is they are going to have to increase separations between aircraft, because separation is safety. Now, they asked the airports to help by cutting back on some of their flights, using larger planes, not doing as many takeoffs and landings, et cetera. And the airlines did for a while agree to help, but during the busy summer season, that kind of slipped away. So the FAA has to enforce increased separation between aircraft. And the other thing that they can do, and they have been harangued, the FAA has been harangued about this for years, it is absolutely no exception, require every aircraft in the sky to have a transponder, because without a transponder, all the wonderful collision avoidance equipment both at the airport and on the aircraft, it doesn't work. You have to have a transponder to be seen for collision avoidance and for proper air traffic control. And you can fly legally without one. Stunning. The FAA can stop that.",

Everyone wants to fly at certain times a day and into literally the top 30 airports. Even the FAA calls them the top 30 or top 35. And so the traffic has been impacted. And the airlines have also added on to this with their spoke in hub system. We have impacted so much traffic at so few airports. And there are major cities and states, Delaware, with no air service at all. So we funneled it all into 30 or 35 airports and at certain times of day. And the airlines have to take responsibility for that. That puts tremendous pressure on air traffic controllers, tremendous.",

And she also said before everything began and they woke up that morning and looked out the window, they were concerned because they didn't see a lot of people moving on the streets. So they were fearing that enough people were not going to show up. But when they got to the Mall, they saw lots of people, and eventually more and more people came. And she was so delighted to see that all of the efforts in planning this day were not in vain. So it was an exciting day, and she felt very hopeful. She always felt very hopeful, though.

So there's something in humankind across the world that we have the ability to deal with these difficult moments and dark moments. And because I come from these ancestors, I know that we, too, can overcome what we are faced with now.It's going to be difficult. It's going to be challenging. But I know that this is just a moment in time. And if we continue -- and that's why vigilance is important. If we continue to be vigilant, then we will get through this season and overcome these pushbacks and be able to put the right policy in place, but more important, be able to create a society where we exist as the beloved community, where we may have conflicts, but we resolve them in a way where the dignity, worth, and value of people are respected, that we work in a common ground way to ward off those things that seek to divide and separate us as a humanity. So I'm hopeful also because there's a generation like my niece and others who are determined to be a part of this freedom struggle. And we are going to be victorious. It's not going to be easy. I may not see certain things in my lifetime, but my dad didn't see things that I see today. So as we continue the fight, as we continue to struggle and continue to remain vigilant, we'll overcome and be in a different place.",
