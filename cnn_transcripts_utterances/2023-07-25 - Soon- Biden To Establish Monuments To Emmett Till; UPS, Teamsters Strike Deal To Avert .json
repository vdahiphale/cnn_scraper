      "sentences": "Today on \"Inside Politics\", the grand jury and the former president, two CNN stories expand what we know about the special counsel's evidence and Jack Smith's attempt to answer a question everybody wants answered. What was Donald Trump thinking?Plus, down the impeachment rabbit hole. Kevin McCarthy says, he's following the facts and that he'll pursue impeachment proceedings against President Biden, if that's what it takes to get to the truth. And they had to see what I had seen, the tragedy and the pictures that shook a nation. Today, President Biden unveils his plan to make sure America never forgets what happens to -- what happened to Emmett Till. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. Up first, her pain powered a movement. Today Mamie Till and the son stolen from her, Emmett, are enshrined as national markers of America's possibility, both how this country is capable of evil and how Americans can bend the arc of history back towards justice. We start our coverage at the White House with CNN's Arlette Saenz. Arlette, what do we expect this hour?",

      "sentences": "Well, Dana, any moment now President Biden is expected to sign a proclamation establishing a new national monument that will honor Emmett Till and his mother. An effort from the president to try to shine a spotlight on some of the most painful moments in American history.The president has long talked about the need to ensure that these moments are not erased from history. And it comes as just in 1955, Emmett Till was just 14 years old when he was brutally murdered after being accused of whistling at a white woman. The president will be establishing three locations for this monument including, two in Mississippi, and one in Chicago, Illinois. That includes the Chicago church, where Emmett Till's funeral was held. Emmett Till's mother insisted on holding an open casket funeral in order to ensure that the brutality of that incident, the brutality of racism against her son was not hidden from public view. Now, it's worth noting, President Biden at this event will also be hosting some members of Emmett Till's family, including Reverend Wheeler Parker. He will serve as the introduction to President Biden and Reverend Parker was the younger cousin of Emmett Till. He is now in his 80s. And he was actually the last living survivor that witnessed Till's abduction. So, it will be rather a powerful moment, held here at the White House with Emmett Till's family, as President Biden signs this proclamation establishing this national monument. But this all comes at a very important time when you've really seeing the White House and the president, trying to become more vocal in this debate over how these painful moments in U.S. history are taught to students in schools. Of course, you had Vice President Kamala Harris, traveled down to Florida, just last week to talk about the guidelines that have been placed regarding slavery. But in just a short while, the president will be trying to honor Emmett Till and his family, trying to ensure that these moments are not erased from American history.",

Nevermind, politically for President Biden. Thank you so much for that very quick reporting and digesting and that deal and getting it to us as quickly as you did. Vanessa, appreciate it.And turning to a question holding our politics hostage. Will a federal grand jury indict the former president of the United States? It's unclear if or when they will vote on whether to charge Donald Trump with crimes connected to the alleged plot to steal the 2020 election. CNN's Katelyn Polantz is outside the federal courthouse here in Washington. Katelyn, as we wait, there are two very important pieces of news breaking here at CNN last night and then today.

We are learning essentially avenues that the special counsel's office is pursuing and getting information about that really weren't the focus of that massive story that the House Select Committee had laid out that over a series of different events on the Hill, where they had explained what happened on January 6, and the 2020 election.And the stories that we're hearing now that the special counsel was looking into one -- on one side, they're looking into a briefing that Donald Trump received as president in February 2020. This really wasn't something that was a focus of that House investigation. But it was a briefing that there has been testimony given to the special counsel's investigators about how Donald Trump received word that the election was going to be secure. And he should be comfortable with that. And he was very receptive to that information so much so. He wanted a press conference to tell the American public that the election would be secure. Of course, his tune changed a little bit after that, not even a month or so, after that February 2020 briefing. And then the other story is that the special counsel's investigation is getting information that no one else has been able to get, including the House investigators. That information is coming in the form of many, many records, hundreds of records held by Bernie Kerik, a close associate of Rudy Giuliani, who was working on those efforts to describe election fraud that was just not founded at that time. But to try and say that to the American public. They were doing all kinds of work, communicating, having memos, and that information has now been turned over to the special counsel. But Dana, the question right now, today, and in the coming days is how does this affect? That indication to Donald Trump that he's already been given, that he's already been told that he's likely to be indicted. The grand jury is often in on Tuesdays, but we have not seen them in today. There is no prosecutors over here at the courthouse. And so, it's just not clear exactly how this will all factor and come together.",

In their questions to at least one of those former officials, we're talking about former Trump officials, investigators were interested in how Trump reacted to information from his advisers that U.S. election systems were secure, and whether Trump was well informed on the topic, one of the sources said.",

When it comes down to how you think about this legally, it's all going to come down to the charges that might come.And here's why. It's about the jury instructions. Is it a knowing standard? Is it about intentional? Is it about willfulness? Is it about actual knowledge? Is it whether his belief was reasonable or subjective? All this comes into play. Like he has got a commonsense argument, or you've got to believe this was the case or was your head in the sand. But what can the prosecutors prove? And some ways you do that is through contextual clues, like you're talking about the thin piece you just played. What he knew at this moment in time in the public eye versus other times. Was there somebody to corroborate that he actually was aware of this as a strategy? Or was it so unreasonable for anyone to believe what he says he believed as to account for a criminal intent pinner to be actually met? That's the key.",

It appears that there's no evidence of this fraud.But after the election, Giuliani was tasked, putting together a team and looking for any evidence of fraud, which is why the special counsel is interested in this evidence. But there was nothing that we saw from the documents that we have that would be relevant, it appears to a prosecution of former President Trump. To some people have asked, well wait a second, do they need to wait before they go through thousands of pages to do the indictment? It does not appear that that is the case. But I will note that Bernie Kerik is scheduled to sit down with the special counsel about two weeks from now. And this is something we've been trying to reconcile in our reporting, right? It appears the Trump indictment is imminent. But we know there are multiple witnesses scheduled over the next few weeks. Could you indict?
