They -- their explicit aim is to strengthen the Hamas in order to weaken the P.A., rather to do the opposite. To strengthen the P.A. and weaken the Hamas. And a lot of money was transferred to them.

And the Israeli military confirming that two mortars were launched towards Israel from Southern Lebanon.They also reported that there were a number of armed suspects who had infiltrated Israeli territory from Lebanese territory, and that Israeli soldiers engaged with them. And that they are now also saying that a helicopter is striking in the area. We don't know whether it is still striking. This was a message sent from the Israeli military a bit ago, so it's possible they have stopped striking the area. So far, we understand as this area is very much concentrated right on the Blue Line, right on the border between Israel and Southern Lebanon. But there is a major, major concern about the involvement of the Hezbollah militant group. Now, there have been skirmishes along the border in the past few months, very small things, usually about tense in the like with Hezbollah. But if Hezbollah gets fully involved in this war, not only does it open up another front, it opens up another front with what's essentially the varsity team compared to Hamas in Gaza when it comes to the types of arms and missiles and rockets that Hezbollah has in its possession. They have a much more sophisticated arsenal than what Hamas has at the moment. So, that would obviously complicate the situation quite a bit. And not only, then also for the Israeli military happen to handle two fronts. Now, there is the possibility that this will be attributed to Palestinian militant groups to Hamas in Southern Lebanon which does have a presence there, and that can -- can often give, sort of, the plausible deniability that it wasn't Hezbollah. We don't need to get them involved. But that just goes to show you how sensitive and how unpredictable and how potentially very volatile and explosive the situation is right now in the north.",

They would have to coordinate with their air force, with the Israeli air force to, in essence, de-conflict operations.Right now, it looks like what the Israelis are doing is they're softening up targets, using air power and artillery. What the next step would probably be -- would be that incursion if they want to go that far, and it looks like they are probably going to do that based on the types of equipment that is pulling up onto the area around the border.

You had Former Prime Minister Barak, Ehud Barak, on. He was, of course, the guy behind the famous Entebbe Raid from 1976. And it would be that kind of an operation. The Israelis had to plan that very carefully. They will have to do the same kind of thing, multiplied by at least 10 times in order to find all of the hostages and get them out as safely as possible.So, you have that going on on the one hand. On the other hand, you also need to, in essence, pacify the population and eliminate the leadership. So, you have, really, three different lines of attack that you have to undergo at this particular point in time. And the ability to do that would tax any kind of military force. And the Israeli force, of course, is under the IDF, who's under a great deal of pressure right now to not only perform well, but it also means that their intelligence elements are going to have to be really on top of their game to provide the tactical intelligence that is going to be necessary for every single aspect of such an operation.",

It looks as if they are trying to get into different nodes, perhaps cutting communications links, also perhaps going after leadership entities where they think they have Hamas people either working or living in those areas.Of course, it's really difficult because the Hamas forces interspersed themselves within civilian population, and that very fact makes it really, really hard to find the people that you're looking for as opposed to innocent civilians.

The Israelis have basically picked a whole series of targets, apparently 130 of them, and those targets are ones that they think will, in essence, either decapitate Hamas or coerce Hamas to do something that will help the Israelis move forward in this. This is going to be, you know, a bit of a slog here. And I think, Kate, what you're looking at is a situation where there is going to be a lot of unknowns when it comes to this. We're going to see some things happening that we don't expect. We're going to see some things happening that, you know, would be in line with the military operation of this type.

We have to keep in mind that the rockets that Hamas sent over into Israel, most of them are fairly primitive, you know, kind of, built in garages type contraptions that have a very, very short range. But in some ways, that's an advantage because it makes it a lot harder for the Israeli defense systems like the Iron Dome to detect what these rockets are actually going for, which targets they are trying to hit, that also impacts their ability to go after them.When it comes to the Israelis and what they are doing in Gaza, it is a far more precise effort against Hamas because they are using more modern weapon systems, you know, the types of aircraft that they're using would include F-15s, F-16s, possibly F-35s as well because the Israeli Defense Forces have all three types of aircrafts, and they're modified especially for Israeli use. So, they have different variant that they use compared to what we use in the U.S. Air Force. But what they're really opting for here is something that will allow them to coordinate with their forces. And I -- you know, this does look absolutely like a softening up of the target, you know, to use that term. And what that means is it's supposed to make it easier for the ground forces to come in and do what they need to do. The -- you know, the -- if they are successful or not, that will depend on many, many factors. And there's always a variance between what happens with air power and what you really see on the ground.
