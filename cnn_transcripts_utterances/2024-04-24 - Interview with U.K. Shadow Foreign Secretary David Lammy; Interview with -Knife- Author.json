Here he is speaking after he signed the bill into law. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  It's going to make America safer. It's going to make the world safer. And it continues America's leadership in the world, and everyone knows it. It gives vital support to America's partners, and so they can defend themselves against threats to their sovereignty, and to the lives and freedom of their citizens. And it's an investment in our own security, because when our allies are stronger -- and I want to make this apparent again and again, when our allies are stronger, we are stronger. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But the months of inactionhighlighted Ukraine's vulnerability to western politics, as well as a worrying shortfall in defense production across NATO. That's why the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, announced plans to lift U.K. defense spending by almost $100 billion, investing 2.5 percent of GDP by 2030. Sunak says that he's putting Britain on \"a war footing,\" saying the world is at its most dangerous since the Cold War. But after 14 often chaotic years of conservative leadership in the U.K., Sunak's Tory Party could well be tossed out by voters in elections later this year. Labour M.P. David Lammy could become the country's next foreign secretary. He's making a case for what he calls progressive realism. David Lammy, welcome back to the program. You are what's known here as shadow foreign secretary. So, before I get to your manifesto, essentially, for foreign policy, I want to ask you about what the prime minister has done. First and foremost, do you -- does the Labour Party, agree with this? DAVID LAMMY, U.K. Shadow Foreign Secretary:  A hundred percent: We have been clear right from the beginning that we must stand with Ukraine. We haven't sought to be partisan and divide in the United Kingdom. And indeed, I went with my defense shadow, John Healy, to Washington to underlie the cross-party support that we've got here in the U.K. We think the 2.5 percent of GDP, we've also said when the fiscal climate allows, we'd have a strategic defense review on day one if we win the next election. So, it may well be sooner than 2030. We'll see once we've had that review. But 100 percent we must stand with Ukraine. We're very close to the Baltic States, Poland, Finland, Sweden and others who are right at the epicenter of this fight. And Biden is absolutely right, when America's strong and allies are strong, the free world is strong. It's for all of those reasons, we stand together.",

We shareAmerica's concerns that there must be better defense spending across the European family of nations, and there are many nations still not meeting 2 percent. But it is of concern that South Korea have provided more shells to Ukraine than the whole of the European family of nations combined. We have to be much better at manufacturing munitions right across the board. That's why the British Labour Party is proposing a U.K., E.U. defense and security pact so we can get serious about the challenge Putin remains a long-term threat.",

You say, \"Progressiverealism advocates using realist means to pursue progressive ends. For the British government, that requires tough-minded honesty about the United Kingdom, the balance of power, and the state of the world. But instead of using the logic of realism solely to accumulate power, progressive realism uses it in service of just goals. For example, countering climate change, defending democracy, and advancing the world's economic development. It's the pursuit of ideals without delusions about what's achievable.\" And it's interesting because Senator Bernie Sanders, who's obviously on the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, a responsible, comprehensive foreign policy he wrote about as well. Tell me how that works. I mean, how do you make progressive really matter in everything, you know, not just in defense spending?",

      "sentences": "Well, let me start with the realist. And this comes out of a tradition from my own party, best personified by Ernest Bevin, foreignsecretary after the Second World War. He was sent out by clematis (ph) to look into the world, what's really going on. And he came back and was pretty sober. The Labour Party birthed NATO because it could see that an alliance across states and with America was so important. The other hard headed response we had at that time was a nuclear deterrent. That's the realist bit. And today, we have to be realist in the Middle East. If you want peace in the Middle East, it does mean working with partners like Saudi Arabia, Qatar and others. They may not -- their values may not be aligned with our own, but that is how you broke a piece in the Middle East. If you're serious about peace here in Europe, you have to be pretty hard headed about the hard defenses that we will need in terms of defense spending, ammunitions, and manufacturing capability. And of course, in relation to China, we have got to be clear about the security risks, the posture of the communist -- the Chinese Communist Party presents, but also clear that we have to cooperate with China, huge power in relation to issues like climate, health, and of course, trade as we move forward.

I heard a major European entrepreneur speak earlier this morning talking about how the West had thought they weredoing the right thing by trying to bring in Russia, China into the WTO for instance. And if you remember Russia was brought into a G7, which became a G8 until it invaded Ukraine. But he's saying that they do not play by the rules of your game, and it is incumbent upon Europe, the United States, to freeze them out if they don't play by the rules of the game.

On these issues, on the idea of defending democracy, territorial integrity, Ukraine, and I've been reading that there's been quite a few European leaders, including the current foreign secretary, the prime minister of -- the president of Poland, the prime minister of Hungary, all went to talk to Putin -- to Trump. And they're coming up with this theory that instead of panicking, try to persuade Trump, like -- obviously they did over the Ukraine aid bill, that actually this in America's interest, that actually all this aid and all this cooperation makes, you know, for American jobs as well.

Let's be clear that, yes, if I look backon Donald Trump's period in the White House, it's pretty noisy. And social media, particularly in that era, made it very noisy. But actually, did Trump continue to invest in NATo the tune of 75 percent? Yes, he did. Did he send the first javelins to Ukraine? Yes, he did. Did he talk about burden sharing on defense across Europe? Yes, he did. But that conversation started with President Kennedy. And that's not unique to Donald Trump. So, I think we should look at the actions as well as some of the rhetoric. Look, I worry a little bit about the rhetoric. I worry about the rhetoric in my own country. Because in the end, when western democracies appear divided, really polarized, that can only benefit our fundamental opponents. And those fundamental opponents are in very autocratic countries. They're in Iran, they're in Russia, they're in North Korea. And so, we do have to be very, very careful about how we maintain democracy, how we have rich and different opinions. But on the critical issues, do you stand with freedom or not? Do you stand with all that we've gained in the 20th century, the benefits after the Second World War? The rules-based order, the rule of law, the economic systems that we've set up, that, yes, of course, we still have poverty in our countries, but have brought huge benefit to many. We have to be clear that those are things worth fighting for.",

And this why all these conversations and comments about how, you know, the Ukrainians should -- they should change -- exchange land for peace or they should negotiate or they should stop have really been a bit pointless because until the Russians decide to stop fighting, until they decide they don't want to continue the war, then the war won't end. In other words, in order to negotiate, you need to have someone to negotiate with. And until now, there's no one to negotiate with. Because Putin's goal in this war is not just territory. He doesn't need any more land. Russia is a very large country as it is. His goal has been to eliminate Ukraine as a state, to make it unviable, to perhaps to wipe it entirely off the map, certainly to capture and control its major cities, perhaps to have a kind of Russian controlled government in Ukraine, but in any case, to have it cease to exist as an independent entity. And it's only when they give up that goal, when they say, right, we're not going to eliminate Ukraine from the map. It's not going to happen. Their alliances are too powerful.

We are now living ina world in which Russia is allied with Iran, China, Venezuela, Belarus, and other autocracies. They have, you know, different goals and different kinds of political systems, but they do see themselves as aligned against democracy and particularly against the language of democracy, human rights, rule of law, transparency, because those ideas, which are often the ideas used by their own internal opposition would be threatening to their form of dictatorship. And one of the reasons why Russia invaded Ukraine was because Putin wanted to show Europeans, in particular, that he doesn't care about their -- you know, we don't change borders by force, rules or their laws on human rights or their language, you know, never again, we mustn't allow mass murder to happen in Europe again after the Second World War. He wanted to show Europeans he doesn't care. And he can kidnap thousands of Ukrainian children, which he has done, and he's been sentenced by the International Criminal Court for doing so. He can put Ukrainians in concentration camps. He can, you know, randomly murder Ukrainians walking down the street in occupied Ukraine. If we really care about those ideas, if we believe that you shouldn't be able to occupy other countries and destroy them and change their identity and murder their people with impunity, then yes, we -- this -- Ukraine in that sense is the front line in a broader war, whether it continues further militarily into Poland, in the Baltic states, whether it continues further into Africa, where there's a large Russian presence already, whether it means -- just means that Russia is emboldened to use its, you know, information warfare and propaganda in new ways all over the world that this place to stop them.",
