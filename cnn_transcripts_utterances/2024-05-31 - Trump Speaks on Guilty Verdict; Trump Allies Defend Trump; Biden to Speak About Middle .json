These, of course, will be some of his first remarks since that historic conviction on Thursday afternoon.Meantime, the man Donald Trump is campaigning against, just departed Delaware, as he now makes his way back to Washington. Will we hear more from President Biden and the campaign about this guilty verdict seen as Priscilla Alvarez is joining us now from the White House. So, Priscilla, what more do we know about the messaging going forward here?",

TED CRUZ (R-TX):  This was not law. This was not criminal justice. This was politics. This was a political smear job. This was an attack job. This is what you see in banana republics. REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA):  People see what is going on. They see that the Democrats are so desperate because President Trump is crushing Joe Biden in the polls. They see the Democrat Party and the left so desperate to stop him that they'll risk the destruction of our entire legal system to do it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Of course, it was not all Republicans who immediately fell in line there, although a number of them did, as we saw.I was struck by comments from former Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who, of course, is now running for Senate and has a shot, right, at flipping that seat, urging, all Americans to respect the verdict, he said, in his initial tweet, saying, political leaders, regardless of party, must not pour more fuel on the fire with toxic partisanship. And then came the responses, perhaps somewhat predictable, a number of folks really just falling in line, including from the Trump campaign, Chris LaCivita, noting you just ended your campaign, and the comments went on from there. Scott, the reality here, does this solidify even more Donald Trump's hold on the Republican Party and therefore, make it more difficult for more mainstream Republicans to actually win the races?",

      "sentences": "Well, I will answer your question directly. Yes, I think it does solidify Trump's hold on the party precisely because mainstream Republicans, people who are decidedly non-MAGA are as mad about this as the MAGA crowd.I mean, I've gotten tons of messages from people that I deal with in my own life over the last several years who, you know, Trump's not their favorite person, it wasn't their first choice, some of them supported other people in the Republican primary, and they are hopping mad about this trial, about the fact that it was ever brought in the first place. So, it actually gives me a bit of a feeling, the same kind of a feeling that I had during the Kavanaugh Supreme Court hearings. That was a situation where all corners of the Republican Party that didn't get along, and some didn't like Trump, all aligned around the idea that Kavanaugh was being railroaded. I get the same kind of vibe out of this. So, right now, I think you're seeing, you know, Governor Hogan's comments notwithstanding pretty widespread viewpoint in the Republican Party that this is bad, it shouldn't have happened and that Trump deserves to be defended on it.",

There were -- there are a few, even Trump voters, I should point out, in a recent poll from Quinnipiac, 6 percent of those who said they would vote for Donald Trump, likely Trump voters said, they would be less likely, Bakari, to vote for him if he were in fact convicted. That is well within the margin of error of that poll. As we know, every single vote counts here.Bakari, how likely do you think it is that some of those 6 percent would make a move to Joe Biden?",

Donald Trump saying that this is election interference, that this is a rigged trial, trying to link this to President Joe Biden and saying it's political persecution.Of course, as we have reported teamly (ph) and over and over again, this has absolutely no link to Joe Biden. This was brought by the State of New York. But one thing to remind you of Donald Trump does not always stay on message. And just moments ago, we saw his team actually remove a teleprompter setup that they had in place. So, clearly not anyone's going to know exactly what Donald Trump is going to say. He often speaks off the cuff. Now, I will remind you that recent polling we saw just as of yesterday show that among people who had said that they were going to vote for Donald Trump. 7 percent of them said they were less likely to vote for him if he was convicted. Now, while that might seem like a small number, remember, this election is expected to all play out in the margins. Both sides believe it's going to be a very narrow victory for whoever wins. But Donald Trump's team is projecting confidence. They said that they raised $34.8 million since that verdict came out. This is small dollar donations. We do know that the site that does that crashed yesterday after the verdict. I should note, none of this can be verified until those FEC filings come out later this month. But they are projecting confidence. They say that they believe this is going to help them rile up their base and bring people out to vote. But just as Erin said, Wolf, this is not over yet. I think that this really will be determined the outcome in November.",

And I'm told that they're not sure. Some members of the team believe there's a political advantage to keeping it there to help frame Trump as a martyr, something they've been trying to do for a long time in the court of public opinion.So, there'll be discussions over the next few days about what they want to do. But I want to note, this is a significant shift. I've been speaking with his legal team about this case for a year now, and this is the first time that I have heard them talk about a purely legal proceeding in purely political terms, because, yes, they brought up the 2024 election when trying to get the case moved back in the litigation over the gag order, a political speech. But when Todd Blanche, the other lawyers were in that courtroom, they never brought up the 2024 election, and this is the first time that I've seen this shift. And it makes sense because in November, not only is this about the White House, this is also about those two other federal cases, really his only ticket to avoid those serious cases is re-election.",

The judge said, lucky for them, avoided the actual week of the RNC convention.But the calendar here is really important because even if they push it into August, then they create another political situation for themselves, the Democratic Convention comes up. So, they are potentially creating a split screen between Trump being sentenced for 34 felony counts and perhaps President Biden being nominated by his own party for the presidency. It's -- look, I mean, I think they see a lot of political advantages, but there are some political risks too. For the Republican base, this was a bonanza 24 hours for them.

President Biden.President Biden was in Delaware, walked to his helicopter, got on it to fly back to Washington. It is often when a president chooses to speak. He did not weigh in on this case out loud, at least not yet. In a way, the Biden campaign has seeded the morning to the Trump campaign and the Trump response, and what you end up with then is this disproportionate response, where every Trump ally in the world is out there yelling, and sometimes literally screaming about the verdict. But there's no political counterpoint yet, at least, not loudly. I mean, we had Mitch Landrieu on this morning, a Biden campaign national co-chair, who said, the fact of the matter is, Donald Trump is a convicted felon, but he also made the point not to dwell on it too much, and try to shift it back to the issues and the character issues they want this campaign to be about.",

He is not going to show any remorse. We all know that for sure. So, I think that they don't really mind so much if he's distracted, if he's doing other things. They're going to kind of do the sentencing on their own in a way that you normally don't. So, I think for them, it's like it pushes back if it stays.
