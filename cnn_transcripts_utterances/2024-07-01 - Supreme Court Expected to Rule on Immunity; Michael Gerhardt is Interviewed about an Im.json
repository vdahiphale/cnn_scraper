Sixty percent of Americans say no, just 30 percent say yes. This is true basically across the entire political aisle. Only Republicans believe in the yes on this particular one. Although I will note, John, that, in fact, if you take Trumps out of the equation, you just say, should a generic president have criminal immunity for his official acts as president, even in that particular case, Republicans say no.

Look at this, nearly a majority, 48 percent say the federal January 6th charges, if true, would disqualify Trump from the presidency. That is very different from what we saw in that New York hush money case, right, where obviously Trump was convicted. It was just 28 percent there. This is nearly double that at 48 percent.A lot of voters think these charges are very, very serious. And if the court were, in fact, to rule that Trump somehow had immunity, this would just be another one of these rulings in which the court went against the public and took away what they think is something that, if true, could very much be the end of Trump's run for the presidency. Of course, even if they did, in fact, find that he didn't have immunity, I'm not quite sure that they'd able to get that case underway in time for it to be determined by the election.",

MICHAEL GERHARDT, UNC SCHOOL OF LAW: Well, that - the ramifications of that outcome would be enormous. To begin with, it'd be really significant to figure out what - how the public reacted to that. I assume most Americans would be quite upset with that ruling because basically most Americans think, if you committed a crime, you should be held accountable for it. It would also - that outcome would also mean that presidents generally have a very broad scope of immunity for doing things as president that would be countered as official, even if those official acts could be characterized as criminal. That means the presidency will become more unaccountable and more capable of breaking the law. Those are not good outcomes if you believe in the rule of law.",

The question in this case is, whether or not Trump's actions leading up to January 6th and on January 6th our official or unofficial. Could they be private? Those two justices, I think, did an excellent job of highlighting the risks - the stakes in this case, because the broader the immunity the court gives for official acts, the more that not only helps Trump, but the more it places the president above the law.Again, that's a - that would be historic.

Either the court or a lower court will determine whether or not Trump, on January 6th, satisfied those elements.But beyond that question of whether or not Trump - Trump's conduct met the elements of official conduct, there's - the question is also whether or not the Supreme Court will decide that question for itself or will it let a lower court decide it. Either way, Trump wins in the short term because it means that there's going to be a delay in terms of an outcome. And either the delay is immediate, because of what the court says, or could the court perhaps even go further and just decide the merits of this question? Yes, whatever Trump did on January 6th was official conduct, in which case I think the court ultimately hurts itself because it will really undermine its own legitimacy by helping a fellow Republican be above the law.",

I mean when you think about saints, often people assume that to be a saint is something from the past. They think of saints depicted as statues. Whereas Carlo Acutis was a video gamer, as you mentioned. He was also a technological whiz kid. He used his skills to try and spread awareness of the Catholic faith. And he was also a teenager who enjoy things like all other teenagers. He liked soccer. He loved his pet. He had problems with bullies. He had challenges, as every other teenager might have. And, therefore, he is seen as a very relatable figure for the Catholic Church to hold up to young people as the Catholic Church seeks to connect better with a next generation. Of course, to become a saint in the Catholic Church, you do need to have two miracles attributed to you. And Carlo Acutis has had those. The second miracle recently signed off which - concerning a woman in Costa Rica. A Costa Rican woman who had fallen off a bicycle and sustained a serious injury. And according to the Vatican, she was healed after prayers were made to Carlo Acutis. So, this is an unusual cause for canalization. An unusual saint.

I mean imagine owning a restaurant but you can't take reservations, you can't pay the bills, you can't order foods, right?

Employees, they'd have to go back to pen and paper, in some cases, and some of them are worried that their paychecks are going to be delayed.

Now, those sales would hopefully be made up in July, but still, Anderson Economic Group estimates that if this last for three weeks - and we don't know it will - but if it does, there could be almost a billion in losses for the auto industry. The longer this goes on, the bigger the impact. Now, CDK says they're taking this very seriously. They put out a statement saying - saying that they understand and share the urgency for their customers to get back to business as soon as usual, promising updates to come. The good news is that CDK, they say that they have been able to bring back some groups of dealers back online. They're scrambling to do the same for others.
