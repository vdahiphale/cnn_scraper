A forensic match tying Luigi Mangione to the scene of the killing of the UnitedHealthcare CEO. We'll have the latest on the case against the suspected gunman. Plus, a promise of peace as Syria counts the costs of more than a decade of war. Hello, everyone. Live from New York, I'm Bianna Golodryga. Zain is off today. You are watching ONE WORLD. Americans think Donald Trump is doing a pretty good job with his transition, and they are optimistic about how his presidency will change the country. That's what CNN found in a brand new poll released just moments ago. It shows Trump getting significantly higher approval numbers on his transition than when he was preparing for his first term in 2016. Almost half of the country thinks Trump will bring positive change to the country. And only one in five think he will make things worse. And a solid 54 percent of Americans believe Trump will do a good job in his first four years. All these numbers suggest that Trump is enjoying a honeymoon with the American people, though his support still lacks with polls found at this point for Joe Biden, Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. CNN's national affairs correspondent, Jeff Zeleny, has been going through the numbers and he joins us now. Jeff, we have seen what appears to be a more disciplined, at least relative to what we saw in 2016, transition period for president-elect Trump. He got to work immediately after his election win. What is surprising to you in these numbers, if anything?",

      "sentences": "And, Bianna, that has been one of the striking things. We really have seen a night and day differencethe second time around as President-elect Donald Trump is filling his government compared to the first time. And it really underscores that he knows more of what he wants and he knows more of how the job actually works. No incoming president coming from the outside or even coming from government is exactly sure what the role of president is. Of course, Donald Trump knows exactly. He also knows that time is short. Yes, he was elected to a second term, a four-year term, but they know that really the first half of that is the time to get things done. So that explains some of his quick action and really filling out all of his cabinet or prospective members of his cabinet. Some may not get confirmed very quickly. But if you look deeper into these numbers, yes, there's no doubt there's a bit of a honeymoon. There's a bit of optimism in the eyes of some American voters. There's also a bit of an exhale that people are ready to move on from the election. Some are predictable partisan splits between Republicans and Democrats, but it's the independents, of course, that are also so interesting. But you mentioned one of those numbers. Let's take a closer look at that. About seven in 10 Americans say that they think there will be a change, but for the positive change, that is largely Republicans believe that. Independents believe to a smaller degree that there will be a change, but that is really the bottom line here. So change for the worse, Democrats, obviously, but not change at all, 31 percent. So we are still in a very deeply divided country. There is no question. But it does seem that American voters are, A, you know, giving him a bit more space here. And there is a honeymoon, although, as you said, not as much as we've seen in years gone by for other incoming presidents.",

We saw a revolving door in the first Trump administration, the first Trump term, so we will see if that happens again.

The Kremlin says ensuring security at Russian military bases and diplomatic missions in Syria is of, quote, paramount importance. Moscow says it has contact with the new leadership in Syria, but some in Russia are now acknowledging challenges Moscow could face under the new government. Russia, of course, was a major ally of ousted president, Bashar al-Assad. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): As Syrians embark on a new era after ousting longtime dictator Bashar al- Assad, Russia fears the era of its massive military footprint in Syria could be coming to an end. The former commander of Russian forces in Syria, and now member of Parliament, is already warning Russia's leadership not to make concessions. Any gesture of goodwill in the Middle East is perceived as weakness. Weakness is unacceptable, he says. What should be done in this situation? He's asked. Talk from a position of strength, he answers. But how much power does Russia still hold in Syria? Kremlin-controlled T.V. strategizes over what might come next with maps showing Russia's bases in Syria. A guest acknowledges Moscow was caught off-guard again. Thinking about how it all happened in Syria reminds me about how it all happened in Ukraine in 2014, he says. I want to highlight one universal lesson for world powers, don't take wishful thinking for reality. When a power is crumbling in days and can't protect itself, this is a verdict. For years, it was the Russian military that kept the Assad regime afloat. Russia's air force pounding rebel groups, its navy firing cruise missiles at ISIS militants in Eastern Syria. In return, Assad gave Moscow a 49-year lease on both its main air base near Latakia and a military port in Tartus, allowing Vladimir Putin to project power throughout the Middle East.",

Let's take a closer look at what theupheaval could mean for the surrounding region and the wider world. The U.S. Secretary of State is traveling to Jordan and Turkey for talks. Antony Blinken set out four things that the U.S. expects of a new Syrian government, including respecting the rights of minorities and facilitating the flow of humanitarian aid. Then there is the status of Syrian refugees. Germany says their return must be coordinated with partners in Europe and the United Nations. European foreign ministers will discuss Syria when they meet in Berlin Thursday. Germany is urging Turkey and Israel not to jeopardize a peaceful transition in Syria. Reports from Turkey say a Turkish drone this week destroyed military vehicles and ammunition in Northern Syria that has been seized by a Kurdish group. And Arab nations are voicing concern about Israeli airstrikes in Syria, with Egypt accusing Israel of exploiting instability to grab Syrian territory.

Jane Harman, thank you so much. Please stay with us. We want to discuss U.S. politics with you next. Washington insiders say, it looks like Republicans in the Senate are largely ready to back Donald Trump's picks for top positions in the government. Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump's defense secretary pick, met today with moderate Republican, Susan Collins, a day after meeting with another moderate, Lisa Murkowski. They are seen as the Republicans most likely to defy Trump and vote against Hegseth. So far, neither has publicly committed to voting yes or no on his nomination. So, Jane, you know, it appeared last week that Pete Hegseth would go the way of Matt Gaetz, that he didn't stand a chance of being confirmed. He's lasted thus far. Donald Trump still is backing him. That could change any time, as you know. But given what we've heard, even from the likes of Joni Ernst, who initially was very skeptical now saying that she's had some relatively good meetings with him. Do you think that he ultimately will pass the confirmation?",

The advice and consent function of the Senate is a crucial function. And what I worry about is that the Senate could give away voluntarily its power over confirmations, its power over the budget to remind the fiscal year started in October. We don't have a budget. We just have continuing resolution, possibly until next March, and its power over declaring wars, which hasn't been exercised for years. And so, you know, we don't want no first Article One branch of government, do we? And if I'm a senator, I would want to be in a role that had power.
