Yesterday, he said, talking about Saturday, we hit the head of the octopus, is how he described it. The idea being that, you know, Iran is the head, the tentacles are its proxies in Hamas, in Hezbollah, and in the Houthis. In Yemen as well, as well as other militant groups that target Israel. And so, look, it's been, you know, broadly, you know, accepted that this retaliation strike by the Israelis is something that will draw an end to the current round of tit for tat strikes between Iran and Israel. Part of that is because Israel was careful, it seems, to target a narrow, a bunch of targets that were military targets and not hit nuclear facilities, not hit fuel infrastructure targets and not try to assassinate people inside Iran. And so for that reason, the understanding at the moment is, or at least the interpretation of this is that Iran is unlikely to take measures immediately to strike back, even though it's reserved the right to do so. So, you know, this as, you know, the conflict in the rest of the region, particularly in Gaza and the strikes there by Israel against Hamas, although, you know, having a big impact on civilians as well as that continues.",

So, we are starting Monday and Tuesday with a four- hour schedule instead of our normal six hours. And we did that modified schedule. So, you know, first of all, it's still pretty dark in the morning and we wanted our buses to have a little more light as they were picking up students on the routes. And then, we also didn't want it to just feel like a full-fledged normal day. So, the first two days are modified shortened days. For those first two days that our students have that time to really connect with each other. The focus isn't going to be jumping right back into academics, but really taking time to connect with their friends, to get back into a sense of normalcy in a gradual way.

So, we were very, very fortunate in the metro area of Asheville that none of our schools were damaged from the storm. We have electricity. We have running water. We have internet at all of our schools. Now, we don't have potable water. So, the students cannot drink the water that is going to come through the pipes. But what we do have is -- four of our schools, we were really, really fortunate to get a partnership with an organization called Water Mission, and they have set up four mini water treatment plants so that our students can refill water bottles on campus. So, we can be very conscientious of our environment and not waste plastic water bottles. And then, we also drilled a well at one of our schools. And we're testing that water to see if it is drinkable water. So, we are looking for all different kinds of solutions so that we can keep our students in school and get them back as soon as possible. For bus routes, we did have to change some routes. There was some damage to some bridges with the floods.

We have staff members who lost family members. I think the most tragic was one of our staff members lost 11 members of her family in the Craigtown area. And that is just completely devastating for her and for our whole community. We really stick together in Nashville City schools. We're a smaller district. And it's nice that we all know each other and can lean in and support each other. But many of our students are still struggling to fill basic needs with their families.

It is a chilly start to the morning here in the northeast, yet, we're talking about the risk for fires. We have a gusty wind in the northeast, bringing in some drier air. And what else is adding insult to injury here is the fact that New York City and many of the surrounding areas haven't seen rain in quite a while. Specifically for New York City, it's been 27 days plus since the last measurable rainfall there. That is close to being a record. If we get to 36 days without rain, yes, that's going to be a record.Then expanding the view here, it's not just New York City that's gone all of October without rain. We're talking Philadelphia, we're talking Atlanta, all the way out here into Houston as well. Overall, about 80 percent of the country is abnormally dry right now. There is some relief on the way though, some good news. Pacific Northwest storm is going to be barreling across the country, and that's going to lead to some heavy rainfall across the eastern two- thirds of the country, maybe even some snowfall across the higher elevations out west too. Houston, I think you will break your streak. Atlanta in New York City, it's going to be a coin flip. You're going to be right on the cusp. Now, as that weather system approaches, we're going to see some very above average heat here across the eastern two-thirds of the country. We're talking about 140 plus records could be broken. New York City, chilly start today, chilly afternoon. And then, by the time we get to Halloween, you're definitely not going to need the jackets because that's 78-degree high. That's a potential record. We're shifting gears here now going down to the Caribbean where, yes, the hurricane season is not over and we are unfortunately watching another system. This area right here, right off of Central America, has a 30 percent chance of development. What I can tell you confidently right now is that Central America is going to see some heavy rainfall. From there, the U.S. just needs to monitor this area for the next seven to 10 days. Guys, if it does get a name, that name would be Patty.",
