Take a look at these dramatic images just in to CNN of a volcano in Iceland erupting yet again, spewing fountains of lava. We'll have an update. But first Haiti is in chaos tonight as gang violence wreaks havoc on the island nation. Today, the State Department coordinating an evacuation flight for U.S. citizens trapped there. The agency releasing a bulletin calling the situation, quote, \"unpredictable and dangerous,\" and telling residents with valid American passports where to go if they're able to get to the airport.

And I think, you know, for folks who are living here, they don't even flinch. I mean, it's surprising to us, but it shows you just how constant these confrontations are between the police and gangs, and even sometimes between the community members and the gangs directly.The situation, as you said, it is dire. I mean, we got a sense driving out before curfew set in around 6:00 Eastern Time. And in the window that we're able to get into one of the communities it gives you a reality check on what they're dealing with, given how supply lines are essentially severed and how they're relying on each other to stay afloat. I mean, even us getting into a community like that relied on conversations with a local who then had further conversation so as to make sure that they knew when we were coming. We weren't anyone nefarious and who could potentially cause issues. That's how dangerous it can be if you come into some of these communities and they're not expecting you. And they have barricades set up in several different routes that they have become traffic cops essentially themselves, redirecting folks to try to maintain a flow that they're comfortable with and know, again, who's coming in and out of their neighborhoods. Also really interesting that they keep watch themselves 24/7. Now they have police within some of these communities. But the police are stretched and they themselves are essentially out of resources at times and relying heavily on these community members to fortify their neighborhoods from these gangs that are trying to encroach. Interesting, though, to sustain some of these community members who are at the front lines and working to barricades in the middle of the night you've got some folks who will go around into the community. And essentially like tax collectors, though it's not required, they'll ask for handouts, they will be given anything from some spare change to a Coke, you know, just whatever it can take to, you know, essentially keep these folks on the front lines going. The overall sensation that you get going through, I mean, there is something that just sits in you that's an uneasiness, right? You get that just driving through the streets and knowing that at any moment something could change. But also the desperation that you see in the eyes of the folks that we've talked to realizing that with every passing hour, Paula, they don't know where the next meal might come because if they can't secure more supplies coming in, especially when you think that 90 percent of the food consumed in this country is imported and the ports aren't operating and the airports closed, there is going to be chaos here beyond what we have already seen.

The residents in that duplex quickly fled upstairs, called police telling them that he was likely still downstairs. Police responding to those reports, establishing a perimeter. It turns out that Gordon had actually left that holding before police had arrived. I want you to hear from Trenton's mayor as he broke down exactly how the arrest of Gordon took place as it was one of those officers who was guarding the perimeter that first noticed him approached them and then positively identified him as a man they thought was in that home.

The very sticky issues that remain at play in these talks. And of course, this is coming against the backdrop of this deepening rift between President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu. That was best illustrated in that speech last week from Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, one of President Biden's top allies in Washington. And it was interesting, President Biden did not explicitly endorse this call for new elections in Israel, but he also didn't condemn it, and it just gives you a sense of where things stand in this very complicated relationship between these two men. And I can tell you there has been mounting frustration inside the White House from President Biden on down on what they see as these rebuffed calls for things like protecting civilians in Gaza, for allowing more humanitarian aid. They have seen him reject calls for an eventual Palestinian state. And it really does cause a lot of frustration. And to best illustrate that, I think you can look at how much these men have been talking at the onset of this war. We were speaking on a daily, even weekly basis. Now, it's been more than a month since the two men have talked by phone. So certainly a very complicated and fraying relationship there -- Paula.",

I think the president understands now he's not dealing with the risk averse Benjamin Netanyahu, who's one step forward one step back and one to the side. He's now dealing with a desperate risk ready prime minister, whose conflated I think his own political and legal travails with what he regards as the best interests of the country.

It's not clear to me yet that Hamas has reached the point where it believes that a phase two hostage for prisoner exchange is in its interest. And that's certainly the case for Benjamin Netanyahu, but the realityis the more the Israelis and Hamas tangling Gaza, reality is I suspect over time there will be another deal. It's just very difficult to predict exactly when that's going to take place. One additional point. Remember, these are strange negotiations that principal decision-maker, Yahya Sinwar, the military head of Hamas, is making decisions 10, 20, 30 meters below ground in a tunnel under Khan Younis or Rafah. These are indirect negotiations between two parties who want to destroy one another. So it's not surprising at all that they're taking this long to come to fruition.",

So it's not like suddenly because Miss Willis decided that Mr. Wade would leave and she would stay on the case, that now everything is cleaned up and we're starting with a fresh slate and bringing people out of a hole who've never heard anything about this to use as jurors, that's just not going to happen. And so it's -- I know she could try to keep things quiet and I would encourage her to. I think that things like the speech at the church and these public statements and public appearances where there's any mention of the case and interviews, you know, I think right now the best move she could make would be to keep her head down to dive into the case, to make sure that things stay on track, and to pay less attention to the press and more attention to the perception that she's got to clean-up about this case.",

No prosecutor is bigger than the case, I guess is a better way to say that, because this case is not Fani Willis versus Donald Trump, and somehow at some time that's sort of gotten mixed up.This case is the state of Georgia and the people of Fulton County versus Donald Trump. And so sometimes for the good of the case, remember that a prosecutor's ultimately job is to maintain the integrity of the investigation, the integrity of the case, and ultimately the integrity of the conviction on appeal if you're able to get a conviction. Those have to be -- that's the priority and so with that in mind, you can see how this could have been resolved months ago once this motion was made and they knew they'd been in this relationship to say, look, I'm going to recuse myself from this. This case is bigger than me. I'm going to let somebody else step in. I've got plenty of good lawyers in my office who can come in and serve as acting district attorney for this case. I'm going to move myself, you know, away from it. That would have been an easy way to do it as opposed to sort of this long, drawn-out circus that we watched about who spent the night where and whose cell phone ping where during what hours, and who said what their lawyer when. We've been talking about that as opposed to really having our nose to the ground and working on the case, and being ready to try the case. So she -- I believe it would be better. And we sort of start with a clean slate to have somebody come in. Ultimately she is elected. The voters have placed her as district attorney, but sometimes then you use your independent judgment to think and to say, you know, I do think that what's important here is that the public has the pursuit of justice and we believe that law has been violated in the state of Georgia.

MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Paula, after a second day of voting in this Russian presidential election, officials say turnout has already been over 50 percent and there is still another day of voting left. A high turnout is key for the Kremlin, which wants to claim that Vladimir Putin, who is certain to win has a strong public mandate for a fifth presidential term, amid a tightening of Kremlin control. Most significant opposition candidates have been barred from standing, but a spate of disruptive incidents at polling stations across the country point to the degree of frustration with the election process. Election officials say, more than 29 polling stations across 20 regions of Russia have been affected mainly by individuals pouring green dye, ink, or paint into ballot boxes to spoil votes that have already been cast. There's also been a number of arson attacks at voting centers with election officials saying at least 214 ballot boxes have so far been ruined. Well attention on the final day of voting will focus undoubtedly on the protest calls from the widow of the late Russian opposition leader, Alexei Navalny who has been telling supporters to gather at polling stations, at midday local time in their various Russian regions and spoil their votes or to vote for somebody other than Vladimir Putin. It is not yet clear what that will look like, but the Russian authorities have issued a stern warning that anyone engaged in unauthorized election protests will be dealt with severely by the law.
