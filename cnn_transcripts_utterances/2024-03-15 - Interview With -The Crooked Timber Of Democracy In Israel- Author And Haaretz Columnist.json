Israel's government is facing growing calls for change on several fronts. In the U S., President Biden has reacted to a call for a change in the Israeli government made by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, America's highest-ranking Jewish elected official. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  At this critical juncture, I believe a new election is the only way to allow for a healthy and open decision-making process about the future of Israel. At a time when so many Israelis have lost their confidence in the vision and direction of their government. JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  He made a good speech, and I think he expressed a serious concern, shared not only by him but by many Americans. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Even war cabinet member Benny Gantz, who many view as his most dangerous opponent and likely opponent if there were early elections and someone who, at least according to the polls today, would beat Netanyahu, said that Schumer aired in his remarks and that any external interference on the matter is counterproductive and unacceptable. Is there, do you think, the possibility that these words could have the reverse effect that they were intended to deliver, that instead of Israelis sort of being awakened and frightened by comments like this from one of its stalwart supporters, that, instead, there may be a rally around the flag, and if not the flag, then around the prime minister, kind of a moment in response to another country, suggesting that a smaller ally should go to the election polls?",

      "timeStamp": "13:05:00",
      "speaker": "SCHEINDLIN",
      "sentences": "Yes. I mean, surely Netanyahu would hope that that's the reaction. Netanyahu loves to position himself as Israel's top globalstatesman, the only one capable to standing up to pressure from the United States. He has often in the past, or certainly at very particular moments, picked kind of fights with the U.S., particularly in 2015 when he spoke before Congress going around behind the back of President Obama. And that was a controversy that he tried to leverage to his advantage. But let me just say Netanyahu would have to go a very long way to rallying the Israeli public behind him. First of all, in 2015, it didn't help him to go to Congress. We were in an election cycle, and it did not help his poll numbers. At present, Netanyahu is suffering in the polls. You know, he is not incorrect to say that the Israeli public is supportive of the war. That's already a rally-around-the-flag effect and it's a reality. But the Israel public, interestingly, by contrast to most other countries where the public rallies around their leaders behind the war has expressed scathing attitudes in all surveys with relations in Netanyahu. His personal ratings -- in his personal ratings, he's trailing Benny Gantz by double digits and has been since the beginning of the war. Only about a third of Israelis prefer him as prime minister, whereas over close to 50 percent, 47 percent prefer Mr. Gantz. His party is losing over 40 percent to up to 50 percent of its support in surveys. And his original coalition has lost about a third of his votes. These are very significant indictments of Netanyahu for his responsibility on October 7th, but of course leading up to October 7th, and the Israeli public is not going to turn around for him so fast. And I should say that Schumer was quite right to say that it may be worth going towards elections soon because over 60 - at -- in certain polls, up to 70 percent of the Israeli public also supports going into elections either when the war is over or right now. That's a very significant and strong rebuke for the government during a time of war.",

Everyone wants these hostages returned home and a ceasefire, but perhaps even acknowledging that they had taken out or killed Yahya Sinwar or something along those lines. Dahlia, it's very easy for Netanyahu to hide behind the I have the support or my policies have to support of the Israeli public. In terms of your research, do you sense that there's a change there, that the support for the war itself is waning at all or no?",

I don't think you can talk about a decline in support for the war itself, but there is adecline in confidence that the war aims can be achieved, because, frankly, they haven't been achieved. And, of course, you know, the most unifying aim of the war is the release of hostages. And that is already not going to happen. The tragic reality is that many of the hostages have already died in captivity. The army has already admitted that they assess that around 30 have died. Many assess that they are probably more than 30 out of the 134 or so remaining who are probably no longer alive. And every -- you know, at every phase of the of indirect negotiations to try to release the hostages and reach a ceasefire to -- in return for a ceasefire, they're -- the hopes of the families are raised and then dashed. And this is a tortuous process. And so, Israelis -- again, I think that they would certainly continue to support the aim of destroying Hamas. There's very little doubt that the vast majority of Israelis support that, no matter how the question is asked, Israelis supports the use -- the amounts of force that have been used despite the catastrophic situation in Gaza. They even justify the number of civilian casualties, according to Tel Aviv University's polling, but they are increasingly aware. How could they not be? That the hostages are not home, and for the majority Israelis, that has been the higher priority for them. I don't think they're going to go out into the streets calling for a ceasefire, because for Israelis there is no such thing as a cease-fire in isolation of the hostage release.",

It's a bit like two different realities from what Israelis, for the most part, are shown and what the rest of the world sees. Another potential crisis that is looming for Netanyahu and definitely headwind he's facing is the controversy over drafting of the Orthodox in Israel for -- they've been exempt from conscription. That may be changing. And of course, this really would impact his coalition. How do you see that playing out?",

And one thing she elicited is that if people are telling things that aren't true, they will get used to that and accommodate to that, if they're incentivized to lie. And what happens in the brain is extremely interesting. If ordinary people are incentivized to lie, there's a part of the brain that's called the amygdala that is basically the non-technical term on fire, that people hate their own lying. But as they lie more and more and more, the amygdala quiets down until in the course of a day, the amygdala isn't even noticing that they're lying. And that gives you a very vivid picture about how the brain habituates to one's own wrongdoing. It also explains how we might habituate, let's say, to something wonderful, our brain quiets down. And it also is literally true that if there are colors all around and you stare kind of at the middle of an image that has colors, it will literally turn gray.

This was done by Tali, co-author of the book, and she found that 43 hours into a vacation tends to be the time when people are most upbeat about the vacation. The first maybe 24 hours, they're really liking it, but they are kind of figuring it out. After the 43 hours they tend to like it a lot, not as much as right then. And if you ask people what they like best about a vacation, this is a scientific study that doesn't involve the brain, it involves self-reports, people keep saying the first. It was the first time I saw the beach, first time I sell the hotel, the first time I went in the water.

But if you hear it twice, you're more likely to think it's true. So, the second is called the illusory truth effect. Repetition increases a belief in the truth of the statement. The other is truth bias. On social media, these are evil twins, truth bias and the illusory truth effect. They tend to get people who are believing something that's false. What we did was we had a study where people could say not like, but trust. So, you don't press a like button, you can press a trust button.

And that can be done with respect to race also, where there's, let's say, egregious discrimination that maybe even the people who are engaged in the egregious discrimination or the comments they're not dishabituated from their own practice sufficiently. It's not that they're bad people, it's that this is what they know.",

It may be that non-Catholics think this is life and, you know, that's how it is. But for someone who's Catholic, it's going to be like a slap in the face. And they might habituate to it in the sense that they see it as part of their culture, but it's not something that doesn't sting when you get slapped in the face. And for a person of color, there are places and maybe states or months where you get slapped in the face a lot, and getting slapped in the face always hurts. And even if there's no particular white person who's done the slap, or even if no white person in the vicinity intended the slap, the slap is there. It might be built into a practice. It might be built into some kind of language.",
