CNN crime and justice correspondent, Katelyn Polantz, is here with more on what's happened at this hearing today. Tell us. KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN CRIME &amp; JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, this is a moment where the defense team for Ryan Routh, some federal public defenders down in Florida, are overwhelmed. And they've gone to Judge Cannon to tell them there is just so much evidence that the feds have gathered about Ryan Routh, about this alleged attempted assassination of Donald Trump, that they just can't get through it. And they can barely make out the time to meet with him in the prison where he's being held, or in the jail where he's being held in Miami as he's awaiting trial. So right now, the trial is on schedule for February, February 10th. And that's five months from his being arrested and charged. That's not a lot of time. And the prosecutors even say, sure, we would be OK with you moving this trial date back. But the defense team, they want the trial for Ryan Routh to not take place until a year from now. So that is quite a long period of time. Judge Cannon didn't make a decision today. But one of the highlights in this discussion over the trial time and how much time the defense needs to prepare, is just the -- the incredible amount of information that the feds picked up on Ryan Routh. They say that they we're doing it because they needed to assess the threat against Donald Trump. But then he had a massive amount of electronics, 17 of his own cell phones that the FBI has had to go through. There we're computers, tablets, additional things. And then, of course, a large amount of body camera footage of the law enforcement that tracked him down that day after he was found on the Mar-a-Lago golf course -- or the international, the Trump International Golf Course.",

Mohammad al-Jolani, who was just appointed as Syria's caretaker prime minister, tells reporters the Assad regime is no more, that his people are exhausted and that foreign governments should not fear a war with Syria.But fighting continues in the country's north and east and across its borders. Israel says it struck Syria nearly 500 times in just two days, while Turkish state media says this drone strike destroyed military equipment that had been seized by a Kurdish group. Joining us now is retired Lieutenant General Mark Hertling. General Hertling, thank you so much for being with us. Despite the ouster of Assad, some of the rebel groups that joined forces to unseat him are directly opposed to each other. And with him out of the way, do you foresee a period of peace in Syria, especially given that some of these Kurdish forces and Turkish-backed fighters are at odds? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING, (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, Jolani has a couple of tasks in front of him, Boris. The first one is to gather the groups together that have been fighting. And it has been an unbelievable spectrum of people who have been fighting in Syria, all pointing guns at each other over the last 10 years. So he's said publicly that he's going to try and pull all those groups together. Some are extreme terrorists. Others are just freedom fighters. But there's also, right now, a whole lot of churn. Russia has been sending their forces out of the area drastically trying to get out of the area. As you just mentioned, the Kurdish forces are bumping up against the Turkish forces. And Turkey -- Turkey always considers any Kurdish forces to be its enemy. So you're going to see some additional churn going on over the next several days and weeks while Jolani tries and pull the government together. As I said the other day, you know, whenever you mention the two words, \"regime change,\" you're going to have a lot of chaos right after the -- the statues are pulled down and people are firing celebratory gunfire in the streets. That's what we're seeing right now. SANCHEZ: And often, as we see that chaos, you see the attempts by foreign governments, perhaps to influence what happens and to and to seek opportunity. To that point, do you think that Recep Erdogan sees this moment as a chance to hurt those Kurdish rebels in the north? Should we expect more from Turkey and it's fighters in the region, and more aggression towards the Kurds?",

Those 900 forces there, along with some of their security forces, have always been geared toward fighting against ISIS regenerating along the Euphrates River Valley. That's the concern.You know, Boris, it's interesting because this area has a long history of shuttling terrorists to and fro, between Iran all the way to the western border of Syria and into Lebanon. It was there when I was there 10 years ago, and it still exists. This is a terrorist rat line that goes all the way through Syria and into the northern Nineveh Desert of -- of Iraq. And I think it's going to be very challenging to try and stop those terrorist activity, both Shia and Sunni, going into the various countries in the Middle East. This -- this is a hotbed of terrorism. And it's going to be hard to shut it down. And that's what the U.S. forces are going to do. But in addition to that, I think the administration has said they're going to do everything in their power to help secure a new government within Syria and work with the -- the new Syrian government under Jolani to bring about, you know, a normalization in ties. And I think that's a good thing as well.",

Albertsons is alleging Kroger did not do enough to support the deal, while Kroger says Albertsons is deflecting its own responsibility. And in California, officials are investigating a possible cause -- a case, I should say, of bird flu in a child who drank raw milk. The child went to an emergency room last month with a fever and vomiting and tested positive for Influenza A. California health officials are warning about the risks of raw milk, which can carry listeria, salmonella, E. coli and bird flu virus. And a kayaker, who faked his own death and fled to eastern Europe, leaving his wife and three children, is now in police custody in Wisconsin. A local sheriff says he is cooperating.
