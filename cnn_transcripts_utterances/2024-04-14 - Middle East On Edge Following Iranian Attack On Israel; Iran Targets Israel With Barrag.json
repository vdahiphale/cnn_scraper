President Biden is meeting virtually today with G7 leaders as Israel's war cabinet has been gathering too. Deciding how to respond to Iran's unprecedented overnight assault. A member of that war cabinet, Benny Gantz, saying Israel will, quote, exact a price from Iran in a way and time that suits us, \"unquote. Iran, last night, fired around 170 attack drones, more than 30 cruise missiles, and more than 120 ballistic missiles over the course of five hours from Iran to Israel. According to the Israeli government, which says 99 percent of the projectiles were successfully intercepted. Israel says a 7-year-old girl was injured by shrapnel in the evening's activities. President Biden telling Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, overnight, that Israel should consider the overall results a win and that the U.S. will not participate in any offensive operations against Iran. That's according to a senior Biden administration official. The region is now bracing, of course, for what comes next.

But everybody really waiting to see what that price might actually be. And we are already seeing criticism coming from hard line right elements of Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition, Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national security minister, calling Gantz' comments, hollow Western catchphrases and saying that it is crucial to reestablish deterrence and hit hard. He's warned of not having a, quote, sluggish response. But it's important for our viewers to remember that Ben-Gvir and others like him are not part of that war cabinet. And we don't yet have a window into what that response will be like, whether Netanyahu will be heating the warnings of President Biden to act with restraint, to not escalate the situation further and to, quote, Jake, take the win, as you said, because many are viewing the news as essentially a gift or a lifeline for Prime Minister Netanyahu changing the calculation of this entire conflict, deflecting away from the disasters that have been happening inside Gaza, reflecting -- deflecting away also from the weekly protests that have been gathering momentum calling for Benjamin Netanyahu to step down, Jake.",

And that's what's going to happen.I can tell you that now I think the world is realizing that Iran is a global octopus of terror, each time using a different tentacle of his to apply terror, sometimes in Europe, sometimes in Israel. It could be from Hezbollah, it could be from Hamas, the Houthis, sometimes in the Red Sea. Ultimately, the Islamic Republic of Iran is a regime that is destined to collapse. It will collapse. Yesterday, it incurred a historic failure, because I want you to understand, when it sends all types of weapons from all directions, it didn't just use cruise missiles, it didn't just use ballistic missiles. It used the mix of it precisely in order to punch its way through to Israel. And it was a disastrous failure for Iran. But that's not enough. We're going to have to ultimately bring this horrible regime down.",

He said, quote, \"In 1991, Saddam Hussein of Iraq hit Israel with scud missiles, and the U.S. said don't play into his hands by turning the world against Saddam into an Arab-Israel war. And now some will say don't play into Yahya Sinwar's hands,' that's the head of Hamas, 'with a response that creates a regional war instead of finishing the war in Gaza,\" unquote. I guess the point he's making there is that Saddam was trying to bait Israel into an overreaction, but Israel didn't take the bait in 1991. Do you agree with that analogy?",

Now, the politics of this have completely flipped as we have separated out into two camps that have some fading resemblance to the Cold War era, but a lot of differences.We're now discovering the Russians are getting their -- their drones from Iran. They're getting artillery from the North Koreans and so forth. They are not going to cross the Iranians by getting in the way of something like this.

I actually think it's more immediate goal is to get the Americans out of the region because they're the ones who back Israel and make the kind of counter strikes or count the operation last night more viable. Long term, you know, this is where a regime does speaks with one voice and the people may speak with another. And there, I think, when we talk about Iran, we're talking about different communities. So, you know, the danger is we've crossed a threshold now and that this is not going to end anytime soon, even if it doesn't play out tomorrow. On David's point, it's true that we're in a different place globally than we were in the most important non-proliferation agreement. You had the world's six major powers in sync.

I think that's been happening privately. But I think it's also helpful for it to be clear publicly that it's not acceptable for Hamas to continue day after day the torture of hostages and their families.I just met last week with Rachel Goldberg-Polin, whose son Hersh has been a captive since October 7th. It's important to remind folks every day that this horrific situation in Gaza has in no small part continued because of Hamas, and that their use of civilians as hostages and human shields has contributed to this being as terrible a situation as it has been. We're also calling on our partners in Israel to flow humanitarian aid into Gaza and to partner with us in making sure that we avoid humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. In the regional context, it's important to remind everyone that Iran has been behind all of this, that they have equipped and trained Hezbollah, which even today is continuing to attack Israel, the Houthis, which have continued to attack regional shipping, the Iranian militias in Iraq, which continue to threaten the American presence in Syria and Iraq. So coming up with a way to de-escalate tensions, to defend Israel, and to resolve the conflict in Gaza is the hard and important work that President Biden is leading today.",
