I'm Alex Marquardt in today for Fredricka Whitfield.A defiant President Joe Biden is pressing ahead with his plans to return to the campaign trail as early as next week despite growing calls for him to end his reelection bid. Now the president has come down with COVID and is recovering from that. In the meantime 35 Democratic lawmakers are now publicly urging him to step aside with the latest announcement coming in the past few hours. But Biden is vowing to stay in the race and a source says that he is, quote, \"seething\" at the former House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, since some of her close allies in Congress are joining in the calls for him to drop out. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is with the president in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. So, Priscilla, we've also just gotten an update from the president's doctor on his condition after coming down with COVID. What did that update say?",

      "sentences": "Well, bottom line, the president's symptoms are improving, that according to Dr. Kevin O'Connor, who put out an updated letter on the president's condition. He is improving. He continues to take Paxlovid, but he is still testing positive for COVID.Now of course it was COVID that took the president off the campaign trail this week. He had been in Nevada where he was trying to shore up support among black voters and Latino voters. But it was in the middle of that that they learned that he had tested positive for COVID and had to return here to Delaware where he is in or he's isolating at his residence. Now, as the president has been behind closed doors with his inner circle, Democratic lawmakers and allies continue to pour in with letters saying that the president should step aside and then he should withdraw from the race. That has been ongoing over the course of the week. And even today with more lawmakers coming forward publicly and saying that it's time for the president to drop out of this race. Now, in the midst of all of that, in the face of it, the campaign is adamant that the president is staying in the race. On the airwaves yesterday Biden campaign chair noting that it has been a difficult few weeks and that there has been some erosion of support but really ultimately saying that the views among voters are hardened and that there is still a path ahead here. And that's really what we've also heard from sources close to the president that he has kind of doubt over that polling that shows that he can't defeat former president Donald Trump, even as other top officials see the situation as it is now was wholly untenable as Democratic lawmakers just continue to share their concerns about the president's vigor and candidacy. Now, I should note that among some Democrats there is consensus that should the president step aside, it should be Vice President Kamala Harris, who leads the party's ticket. Now aides have told me that the president and the vice president remained close, that there is no daylight between the two, and that just yesterday the vice president at the behest of Biden advisers had joined a call with donors which again defended President Biden. Now today she is going to be attending a fundraiser in Massachusetts. Of course, the campaign also struggling with donors, some big-dollar donors who have been holding back their checks amid all of these concerns. But again, the campaign is hoping that the president recovers, that he can get on the campaign trail next week, and that they can continue this campaign in earnest, and try to show lawmakers what they want to see, which is the president engaging with voters and up to the task of taking on former president Donald Trump. But, Alex, even as they hope for that, we are still expecting more lawmakers to come forward and say that he needs to drop out.",

      "sentences": "Well, Alex, good question. We've never actually seen them campaign together. Now obviously as we have reported one of the reasons that Donald Trump chose J.D. Vance is because he wanted an heir to the MAGA throne. J.D. Vance is all in on Donald Trump's version of the Republican Party.And the other thing we've heard is that the reason that Donald Trump chose J.D. Vance is because of the chemistry that the two of them have. Keep in mind, we've never actually seen any of that chemistry. We have only seen very small snippets of the two of them together from the Republican convention. He did not name him as his vice presidential nominee or vice presidential candidate until Monday of the convention. So there are still so much that we have yet to learn about what a Trump-Vance ticket looks like, including how they interact, what it looks like up on that stage, how they speak to each other, or how they're seen to be crowd, how they interact with the crowd as a team. That is so critical in a presidential election to see what that team is doing. Now the other thing is that here in Michigan, there is another reason they might have chosen J.D. Vance which is that he could help with voters in places like Michigan, like Pennsylvania, because of his working class background. Now, Donald Trump really doesn't need a lot of help in that area. If you look at all the polling, most of his supporters do fall into that category or many of his supporters do. But he could still reach out to other factions within those kind of states. Again, we're really looking at right now is how these two run as a ticket, something we just haven't seen yet.",

He just kept eroding confidence that he can serve until he's, you know, 85 years old. And so it's not just about can he make it to November, to the finish line, there's a great concern can he be president.And instead of talking and being reasonable, I think President Biden has been petulant. He's now denouncing CNN. He'll denounce \"The New York Times.\" He'll denounce Nancy Pelosi, the Obama people, everybody's picking on poor Joe. That's not leadership. And so that's what's frightening people is his inability to talk to people and say, how do we fix this? Why not bring in a James Carville, a David Axelrod, say you guys won two elections apiece, Clinton, Obama, I need some help? Let's get a new campaign manager. Let's put some energy into beating Donald Trump, which for Democrats is the all-important thing. Instead, he's whining about how he has been dealt a bad hand.

A violation of international law and a threat to the international peace and security. Today Israel stepped up its actions in self-defense against these attacks. The Israeli Air Force conducted precise strikes on Houthi military targets in Yemen.

The Israeli military says that was a Samad-3 drone.I'm also told that this was a 100 percent Israeli strike carried out by the Israeli military, not in conjunction with the United States or the United Kingdom. And that's notable in particular because over the last several months Israel has really let the United States and the U.K. take the lead in carrying out strikes against Houthi militants in Yemen. But because this drone strike on Friday actually resulted in Israeli casualties that changed the calculus here and Israel carrying out this strike alone. I am told however by an Israeli defense official that the Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant got on the phone with his American counterpart, the U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to give him a heads up on the strike ahead of time.

Let's talk more about all this with the former deputy national security adviser, Victoria Coates. Victoria, thank you so much for joining us. This is really such a remarkable story. We see it very visually at the airports there, but obviously far more reaching consequences at elsewhere like emergency services, hospitals, businesses. I think it's surprising to a lot of people that so much hinges on one company and as one expert told me earlier, a miniscule piece of code. So how is it that this happened? How is it that there's so much reliance on one provider like this?",

I think this is now very much a national security issue what we're seeing here, and yes, this was one piece of code, but it brought everything to a grinding halt and it was an update, glitch. This wasn't a cyberattack and sort of coordinated penetration of the U.S. grid or system.And I think it has to be a wakeup call to all of us who care about these things that we are intensely vulnerable in this sphere. Not enough has been done to create redundancy, to create backups. You know, the awful story Isabel just reported on is that woman losing her vacation. Well, think about just needed the compounding nature of that. The lost money, the loss to the airlines. I mean, this becomes in a way, you know, an economic meltdown as well.

You can see it right there. The town of Palm Beach where Mar-a-Lago is placed, is based, is warning drivers there of road closures through the election.CNN's Holmes Lybrand is joining me now. So, Holmes, you've been reporting on this since the assassination attempt last week and uncovering a lot of new things.

So the entire apparatus of Trump's security is being rethought from as we talked about his Mar-a-Lago residence and how road closures are going to be there for 24 hours a day, seven days a week, up and until the election. That is a big change for the Secret Service.We're also seeing on the ground in Michigan today far more Secret Service than was expected. And they've also called local law enforcement in recent days to increase their presence there as well. Part of the reason for this is certainly the assassination attempt last week, but it's also because of new federal assessments of potential copycats, and that is a big concern. And we're talking about a complete change of Trump's security presence from his motorcade to his how they're thinking about campaigning in general, whether they want to move everything indoors, like tonight, it's being held indoors which the Secret Service likes because they can control that much, much more easily than a field like we saw in Pennsylvania last week.
