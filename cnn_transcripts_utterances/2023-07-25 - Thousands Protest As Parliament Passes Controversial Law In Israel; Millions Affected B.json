      "sentences": "Well, since about last fall, it appears the convicts have been a pretty substantial part of Russia's frontline strategy. Originally recruited by the Wagner mercenary group in their tens of thousands, the scheme then taken over by the Russian Ministry of Defense, seemingly thinking there was something successful in it that they wanted to own, wholesale.But now, we're hearing pretty rare testimony directly from Russians who survived, or in one case, lost a dear son to that particular violence. And it is, indeed, shocking to hear quite how appalling the conditions they endure are. Here's what we heard. WALSH (voice-over): Russia is often cruelest to its own. The bleakest fate: prisoners recruited by the Ministry of Defense, basically as cannon fodder. These so-called Storms Z battalions, surrendering here, have death rates hard to fathom. Here are two rare stories. One of incredible survival, and another of a young and quick death, told to CNN at great risk from inside Russia. Ex-con \"Sergei\" barely made it back. Now he works two jobs and can't sleep, because his ears still ring from shellshock. We first talked when he'd been shot for the second time. But he was still sent back, injured. From 600 prisoners recruited with him in October, he says, only 170 are alive, and only two of them without injury. Sent again and again, in waves, to attack Ukrainian positions. \"SERGEI\", EX-CON RECRUITED TO RUSSIAN MILITARY (through translator): I remember most clearly the last of the nine concussions I had. We attacked. RPGs, drones flew at us. Our commander yells on the radio, \"I don't care. Go ahead. Don't come back and until you take this position.\" Two of us found a small hole and dived in there. A drone threw a grenade us, and it landed in the 30-centimeter gap between us. My friend was covered with shrapnel all over. Yet, I was untouched somehow. But I lost my sight for five hours. WALSH (voice-over): He only stayed in hospital that time, and then got home, as doctors made him an orderly. He has nightmares that he is told to be first out of the trench again. But daily life in the trench was a nightmare, too. The frostbite, hunger, and thirst. \"SERGEI\" (through translator): Sometimes we didn't eat for several days. We didn't drink for several days. It was a four-kilometer walk to water. And thank God it was winter. We were drinking the snow.",

But it was on May the 9th, Victory Day in Russia, when presidential pomp in Moscow marked the Nazis defeat. \"Andrei\" called her the night before to say his unit would attack at dawn. \"YULIA,\" MOTHER OF RUSSIAN PRISONER RECRUIT \"ANDREI\": (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)",

      "sentences": "We were arguing. It is horrible to say, but I already thought of him like he was dead. He left knowing everything. Every day I told him no, no, no. And he didn't listen to me. When he said, \"We're going to storm,\" I wrote him, \"Run, Forest, run.\"WALSH (voice-over): We think these ruins are near where he died. Up to 60 others, \"Yulia\" heard, died in the same assault that day. Yulia got nothing, no body, just a letter from the military saying Andrei had died the very day he left jail. \"YULIA\": (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)",

Utterly shocking conditions, and it's really a snapshot on the appalling morale that those Russian units must be experiencing. And that could make Russia particularly fragile if Ukraine's counteroffensive gains weight. Nick Paton Walsh, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
