DeSantis has been viewed for so long as the guy who has the best shot of taking on Trump. But now, the doubts are coming from inside the House, from outside of the house. And a lot of it has to do with what seems to me to be the campaign actually coming out of the gate viewing themselves as the front runner saying, oh, we don't have to talk to reporters.

And -- but it's really more complicated than that, like Axios does the swing voter focus grouping. And the focus groups that we just did in Minnesota this week, these are people who voted for Donald Trump and Joe Biden. About a third of them say they don't know enough about Ron DeSantis to make a judgement. But the other third saying, they don't like him. They use words like want to be dictator, wildcard.

I think he spent $8 million the last quarter, and a million dollars of that was just on payroll, which is maybe why we've learned this week now that he has fired, I think, it's some good thing in the number of 10 campaign staffers, because he's just -- this is a campaign that is just far too bloated. I mean, we talk about Joe Biden's campaign being skeletal, they are doing the opposite here with Ron DeSantis. Too big, too fast, spending too much, and most importantly, not getting the results.

How do they address what's going on here with voters?But before we go, I want to bring up one other thing about President Biden's reelection. This is how much money he has raised, $72 million between his campaign, and a Super PAC 97 percent of donations. Let's talk about those small donors are under 200,000 compared to Trump, 35 million.

He was utterly shameless, tethered to neither decorum nor facts, and there was something refreshing about that about his admissions of infidelity as petty grievances.
