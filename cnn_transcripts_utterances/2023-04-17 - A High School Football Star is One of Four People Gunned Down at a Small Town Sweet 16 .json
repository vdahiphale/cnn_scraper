The \"Fox\" defamation trial delayed just hours before opening statements. Is this a sign a settlement could be near? And SpaceX boss Elon Musk, downplaying expectations with his company about to launch the most powerful rocket ever built.Good Monday morning to you, welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Christine Romans. We begin with carnage at a sweet 16 birthday party in a small southern town. Four people were killed, nine injured, some critically in this rampage Saturday night in Dadeville, Alabama. So far, authorities have not released details about a suspect or a motive. But overnight, we did learn the name of one of those killed, KeKe Smith, who was a student athlete -- athletic manager on the high school's track team. For more on another of the victims, a star athlete -- let's go to CNN's Isabel Rosales in Dadeville.",

So on this topic of coal, this transition, as you know, can be tricky even if nations want to get away from coal altogether. They may not have other energy sources like solar, like wind to fill that gap.So, perhaps, that's why they aren't offering the specific timetable. But there is certainly a lot of discussion based off of the communique that we have received today about looking toward these alternative sources. For example, increasing wind energy by 2030, getting rid of plastics by 2040. Perhaps, next month will have a more specific timetable when it comes to coal, but right now, I think the feeling is that they're trying to manage expectations, Christine.",
