I think first of all, you have to deescalate the violence. You have to provide some solution that makes -- that makes it certain that the Palestinians will have their rights respected and that they have security, that they have electricity, water, food, et cetera.But then you've got to start talking about what happens after. And I'm afraid to say, I think in the current environment, there is no hope that you can start talking about regional peace deals or what it looks like visa v Iran, et cetera, because there's still so much potential for escalation. That all you're doing is putting out fires as they emerge one by one. Let's not forget, of course, Becky, that you've got protests against Israel and the United States breaking out across the region. You had the U.S. embassy in Beirut stormed by mobs of people last night. There are so many problems to address that thinking strategically about how you then move forward is very difficult. Because it's about calming the anger. People are so frustrated. The region, as some people would say, is starting to boil. You've got to get that tension down otherwise this could escalate much further. And then we really don't have any pathway, you know, for peace. So I think that's what's got to be done first. Then you've got to say, OK, look, we've got to start moving on a Palestinian track that looks political and rather than military. But that's a conversation that Mister Netanyahu will have to enter into. Let's see if he does or not.",

      "sentences": "Well, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you very much.Look, folks, I wanted to be here today for a simple reason. I wanted the people of Israel, the people of the world to know where the United States stands. I've had my great Secretary of State here. He's been here for -- a lot. But I wanted to personally come and make that clear. The terrorist group Hamas has slaughtered, as has been pointed out, over 1,300 people -- and it is not hyperbole to suggest slaughtered -- slaughtered -- and including 31 Americans as part of that. And they've taken scores of people hostage, including children. You said, imagine what those children hiding from Hamas were thinking. It's beyond my comprehension to be able to imagine what they were thinking. Beyond my comprehension. They're -- committed evils that -- and atrocities that make ISIS look somewhat more rational. You know, Americans are grieving with you. They really are. And Americans are worried. Americans are worried because we know there's -- this is not an easy field to navigate what you have to do. But the fact is that Israel, as they respond to these attacks, it seems to me that -- have to continue to ensure that you have what you need to defend yourselves. And we're going to make sure that occurs, as you know. And we have to also bear in mind that Hamas does not represent all the Palestinian people and has brought them only suffering. You know, years ago, I asked the Secretary of State, when he and I were working in the Senate, to write something for me. And he said -- he wrote a line that I think is appropriate. He said, it's not -- we lead not just... Well, I won't go into it. I'll wait until later. I'm taking too much time. But the point is this -- that I was deeply saddened and outraged by the explosion at the hospital in Gaza yesterday. And based on what I've seen, it appears as though it was done by the other team, not -- not you. But there's a lot of people out there who are not sure. So, we got a lot of -- we got to overcome a lot of things. And it also means encouraging lifesaving capacity to help the Palestinians who are innocent, caught in the middle of this. And -- well, any rate, that's -- that's who we are -- not just me, but I mean that's who the United States is. And it's just not the example of our power, it's the power of our example that's almost as important. The world is looking. We -- Israel has a value set like the United States does and other democracies, and -- and they're looking to see what we're going to do. So, Mr. Prime Minister, I'm very happy to be back in Israel with you. Thank you for having me. And I'm looking forward to having a thorough discussion about where everybody goes from here. But thank you. And I want to say to the people of Israel, their courage, their commitment, their bravery is -- is stunning. It's really stunning. I'm proud to be here.",
