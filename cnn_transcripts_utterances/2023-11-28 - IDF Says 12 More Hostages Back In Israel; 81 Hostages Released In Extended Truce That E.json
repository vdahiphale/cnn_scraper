      "sentences": "Tonight on 360, more hostages come out of Gaza with another group expected tomorrow and talks underway to extend the truce and the flow of captives for as long as possible.Also tonight, Liz Cheney's new book and the revelations in it about the former president, which she calls his Republican enablers and collaborators, and how she says they just could not quit him. And later, why Republican hopeful Nikki Haley is that much more hopeful tonight, the surprising early big name and big money endorsement she just got, and how it might change her campaign. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. We begin tonight with the hostages. Hamas freed 12 more today under the terms of a truce, which is now run five days but expires tomorrow after we expect the sixth group of hostages comes out. This is new video taken from inside Gaza of the handover from the AFP news agency. You see crowds cheering, some shouting \"Allahu Akbar,\" God is great, as the latest freed hostages are paraded past them on the way to waiting Red Cross vehicles. It's a sharp difference from last night's version, which took place on a dark and empty street. Two Thai nationals are in this latest group. The other 10 are Israelis. In all, Hamas has now freed 81 hostages that they took so far. But still, only a single American, four-year-old Abigail Idan, on Sunday. Two other American women expect to be released by now are still being held; Israel, for its part, releasing 180 Palestinian prisoners. CIA Director Bill Burns arrived today in Doha Qatar for a meeting with officials there, including, a source tells us, his Egyptian and Israeli counterparts. Another source familiar with the trip tells CNN the discussions are part of a push for a broader hostage deal expanding beyond the current women and children. Meantime, troops are not in Gaza, Israeli military operations continue in the West Bank. Tonight, we saw clashes in Jenin with fighting near a local refugee camp. The IDF telling us it's conducting, quote, \"counterterrorism activities in the area,\" but not providing any other details expect to say it's expected to continue overnight. Oren Liebermann joins us now. What do we know about the hostages released and their conditions?",

Over several hours, the hostages being transferred from Hamas to the Red Cross to the IDF and to the hospitals. Eight of them taken to the Sheba Medical Center, two to the Ichilov Medical Center, both of those in or near Tel Aviv. And then the two Thai nationals taken to Shamir Medical Center.We do expect an update early tomorrow morning here from Sheba Medical Center, where most of those freed hostages have been taken. So far, as we've heard from the doctors and the families, they have been, generally speaking, in good physical condition. Malnutrition has been the biggest issue, but we don't have a specific update on the latest group to come out yet. It is worth passing along two specific updates with two specific stories we have followed to this point. Four-year-old Abigail Idan, as you just pointed out, the only American to have been released so far is in good shape and was released from the hospital two days after she was released from Hamas captivity in Gaza. So that's certainly good news on that front as now the mental health process begins in that recovery part. Meanwhile, Alma Abraham who was taken into the hospital in critical condition suffering from a lack of medication and a lack of nutrition over her 50-odd days in captivity, she was unconscious for a period and on the breathing machine. Doctors at the hospital where she was taken in Beersheba say she is breathing on her own now and is conscious. So that, too, is good news as we wait for the next hostage transfer to take place tomorrow.",

According to Cheney, Johnson was pressuring Republican members, especially freshmen, to support Trump, and that he just was playing this critical role behind the scenes to try to help Trump overturn the election results.And she writes, quote, \"When I confronted him with the flaws in his legal arguments, Johnson would often concede or say something to the effect of, 'We just need to do this one last thing for Trump'\". So the book is filled with revelations about hypocritical comments, public versus private. There's a lot about her unlikely alliance with Nancy Pelosi that's fascinating. And I just want to tell you about one extraordinary scene, which is on January 6 in the Republican Cloakroom, where Republican Congressman Mark Green of Tennessee, he's signing his name to these objection, these electoral vote objection sheets, and she hears him. She writes, quote, \"As he moved down the line, signing his name to the pieces of paper, Green said sheepishly to no one in particular, 'The things we do for the Orange Jesus'\". Anderson?",

Also there, the President, Joe Biden, First Lady Jill Biden, former President Clinton, and all living former first ladies, including Melania Trump. It was a moving service. Primary speakers were his family, including daughter, Amy, who you'll see read the words of her father, the former president who was unable to speak.

My mother, Rosalynn Carter, was the most beautiful woman I've ever met and pretty to look at, too. JASON JAMES CARTER, JIMMY AND ROSALYNN CARTER'S GRANDSON: She was my grandmother first, and she was like everyone else's grandmother in a lot of ways. Almost all of her recipes call for mayonnaise, for example. AMY CARTER, JIMMY AND ROSALYNN CARTER'S DAUGHTER: This is from a letter he wrote 75 years ago while he was serving in the Navy. My darling, every time I have ever been away from you, I have been thrilled when I returned to discover just how wonderful you are. While I am away, I try to convince myself that you really are not, could not be as sweet and beautiful as I remember. But when I see you, I fall in love with you all over again. Does that seem strange to you? It doesn't to me. Goodbye, darling. Until tomorrow, Jimmy. (END VIDEO CLIP) COOPER: Someone touched by her life and legacy.
