At any moment, a U.S. district judge could decide if former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows will face trial in Georgia, or in federal court. Meadows argues that his case belongs in federal court because, as Trump's right-hand man at the White House at the time, he says his actions were thus part of official government duties. Meadows specifically faces charges for participating in Trump's infamous phone call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger where Trump asked the Republican official to, quote, find enough votes for him to flip the state from Biden to Trump. A Fulton County judge yesterday ruled that cameras will be allowed in his courtroom in this sprawling election subversion case. So if Meadows does end up in federal court, he'll avoid the television cameras. He'll avoid playing a starring role alongside his former boss, Mr. Trump, in what is likely to become the most watched trial of all time. As for some of Trump's other co-defendants in this case, four more of them pleaded not guilty today. That brings the total to 10 out of 19. Some are struggling to pull together funds for these mounting legal bills. At least four have turned to crowdfunding, one has a political action committee, another has an ally in Congress to support the legal defense. What they do not have is any apparent sign that Donald Trump intends to help any of them. Mr. Trump told Newsmax, he doesn't even know a lot of them. Here with me, CNN's Jessica Schneider and Tom Dupree, former principal deputy assistant attorney general in the George W. Bush administration. Thanks for being with us to both of you. Jessica, let me start with you -- when do we expect this U.S. district judge to decide where Mark Meadows will ultimately have to face trial?",

Mark Meadows still hasn't entered a plea here, so he needs to do so, if it were to stay in state court by Wednesday. But the judge just got this extra briefing late yesterday afternoon. It amounted to about 35 pages. And the issue here that the judge really seems to be focusing on is whether maybe one of these acts, in the multiple acts that were listed in the indictment, if even one of those acts touched on Mark Meadows' role as a federal office, does that mean that it should be removed?Of course, Mark Meadows team is saying, yes, absolutely, even if one of those acts even remotely touched on his duties, it should be moved to federal court. Fani Willis's team, as expected, is pushing back in their briefs saying, no, this indictment was about the broad conspiracy, not just one single act. So, it needs to be, you know, multiple acts here that would require the removal. So we'll see what this judge could rule in the coming days, likely I would think by Wednesday.",

So, they're saying, prosecutor, you can't have it both ways. You can't ask for this speedy trial or agree to it, and then not give us the documents. And then secondly, just a few hours ago, actually, Chesebro also filed a motion to not have -- to have his case tried solo. He does not want to go to trial alongside Sidney Powell, who has also asked for a speedy trial. Chesebro's team is basically saying that Chesebro had no communication ever with Sidney Powell, that they're not accused of the same thing.

SHORT:  Again, I'm very sympathetic, I think he was acting at the president's behest and I think you could make the argument as part of his role as chief of staff. But as I said, I think what undercuts that argument is, if you're in that federal role, then how come none of the White House counsel is there with you helping to advocate for that case? It's clear that White House counsel was giving very different advice. And so, Mark went outside and found independent counsel that he could partner with on this endeavor to try to overturn the results in Georgia and I think that that obviously argues against this is part of your federal role because you clearly weren't relying upon the people who are giving you counsel inside the White House.

First is that police believe there is no evidence at this point to suggest that anyone is helping this escaped inmate at this time.The second thing that we also learned from this press conference is the district attorney believes that escapee, Danelo Cavalcante, is still in this general area. The D.A. saying we believe he's hiding somewhere locally and is still alone. And the third thing we learned, Jake, is that there is reason to believe that this suspect is heading south. And the stem of that belief really comes back to why Cavalcante was in this prison behind me. Remember, Cavalcante was convicted just two weeks of brutally murdering his girlfriend back in 2021. He was just sentenced to life in prison without parole last week. Well, prosecutors said after that murder, in 2021, Cavalcante tried to flee down to Brazil, his home country. But he didn't get that far. Law enforcement officers picked him up in Virginia and that is why law enforcement officials today believe he may be trying to head south again. But the U.S. Marshals, they are not deterred. Take a listen to what one representative had to say at this press conference. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERT CLARK, SUPERVISOR OF FUGITIVE TASK FORCE FOR U.S. MARSHALS: They have no reason to believe Mr. Cavalcante has left the area. However if he does, U.S. Marshal Service has a long arm to touch anyone in this country or its territories, and we plan to do so. We will stop at nothing until we bring him back to custody to support our state and local partners. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You've seen obviously the pictures of Pezzola breaking the window there, leading what the judge said, he was the tip of the spear for people who went into that building. But the other thing that you hear, certainly right now as we're listening -- as we're watching Nordean being sentenced as we speak in the federal court in Washington here, you hear from their families. You hear from them apologizing, tearfully, because they realize what is about to happen to them. The prosecutors have been asking for very hefty sentences, in some cases for leaders of proud boys, Joseph Biggs, and for Zachary Rehl, they're asking for more than 30 years. In the case of Biggs, they got 17. Zachary Rehl got 15 years. These are very, very hefty sentences. They're going to basically have their daughters grow up without their fathers being there. But the judge, one of the things that he just mentioned in court, was that what happened on January 6 and the violence that happened that day was more than just that. There was something that was lost for all Americans, which was the tradition, at long held tradition of a peaceful transfer of power, which we've lost. And we will have to build the next time there is an election and next time there is a transfer of power. So one of the things we're watching for now is Nordean. He took over the leadership of the Proud Boys after Enrique Tarrio was arrested right before January 6. Enrique Tarrio, by the way, is facing his own sentencing next week. So he's -- they're going to be the fifth of the proud boys that are -- that are facing sentencing in this federal court again by Judge Timothy Kelly, Jake.",

Don't shoot the messenger. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is estimating that hospital admissions jumped nearly 19 percent the week ending August 19th, compared to the previous week and you may have seen this headline on CNN.com today. This wave is probably worse than official data suggests, it says. Let's bring in CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Sanjay, testing is nowhere like it was before. So how do we know we're in a COVID wave given the fact that I can't even tell you the last time I got tested? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, it's challenging. I mean, some of this is anecdotal. A lot of people may have had it themselves or hearing that more often. But to your point, it is hard to validate because we're not doing as much testing. A lot of the testing is at home. Not being reported. So it makes it challenging. One of the things that you and I talked about for a couple of years now is looking at more reliable metrics such as hospitalizations. You just mentioned it. But let's take a look there. If you look at where the hospitalizations are over the past several months now and compared to this point last year, very far right is where we are. So it is much lower, half of where it was around this time last year, but it is ticking up. So, there is a trend up. It is not a surge per se, but it is trending up. Another indicator, wastewater. So this is basically looking at wastewater all over the country and trying to figure out how much COVID, how much virus is in that wastewater. And this goes back to earlier in the spring, it was higher then. But now, it's higher than it has been in several months. It is not directly correlating with new cases or new hospitalizations yet. But you're seeing a tick up there as well. So this is the early warning system, Jake. I mean, I think we got to pay attention to it.

But I've got to tell you, Jake, you know -- I recently visited my parents, I tested myself before I went down there. I wore a mask on the way down there. They're older, they are the ones who are the high risk that we were just talking about. And if I did test positive or someone tests positive to the second part of your question, it is five days of isolation.
