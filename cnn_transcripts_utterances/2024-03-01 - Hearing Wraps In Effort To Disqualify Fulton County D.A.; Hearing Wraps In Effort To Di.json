We didn't get the opportunity to call Mr. Wade back to the stand. So to claim that you cant impeach him because you didn't ask him when they objected to as ask him is a obviously -- is a false position to take as disingenuous as it can be. Now, if the court wants to open it up, we'll be more than happy to call Mr. Wade back to the stand. But as the record stands, there could be no confrontation of Mr. Wade when both his counsel and the state are arguing that it shouldn't be done. Second, let's use little common sense here.

It is not an overstatement to say that the prosecution of Donald Trump in the state of Georgia hangs on what you have just been listening to.That last person there who is speaking to the court with Steve Sadow. That is Donald Trump's attorney here. But shortly before that, we heard from the prosecution as the chief deputy district attorney was arguing against the disqualification of his boss, Fani Willis, who I should note was sitting behind members of her staff as the judge has now weighing her fate in this case. Welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Kaitlan Collins, in for Jake Tapper on this Friday. Fani Willis, of course, is the woman who charged Trump with attempting to overturn the 2020 election in the state of Georgia, along with a slew of co-defendants whose attorneys were also in that room. But now she herself is facing allegations of an improper relationship when the special prosecutor that she put on that case. If Willis is disqualified, the case could very well not happen. A lot is at stake here. I want to bring in CNN's chief legal analyst anchor Laura Coates, who's been watching every moment of this hearing, has been an Atlanta as part of this has been going on as well. Laura, I mean, the stakes here are so incredibly high. Now that we do have the closing arguments.

Tell me what you're going to say and ill tell you if its actually privilege and if it's not, take the stand.Well, the judge said, as it relates to the relationship between Fani Willis and Nathan Wade. It's not privileged. Therefore, you have to testify. That's why we saw him again. And you remember, you're right. He says when asked, were you lying to the attorney, Mrs. Merchant, about the statements you made to her through text messages about when though I should began, he said, I don't recall. And that was an important moment here for a lot of reasons because they believe that if you are wondering, why would he talk? Why would he text these people? Why would he knowing there was a motion disqualify Fani Willis and the team, why would he offer statements, particularly as his former attorney in that context? Well, they're saying because he was disgruntled, because there's a skeleton in his closet and it was a bit of karma returned. The judge has so aside though, Kaitlan, who to credit and who not, but ill tell you what a really telling moment the fact that this judge is focused on whether an appearance of a conflict is enough versus an actual conflict tells you a lot about where his head might be at. If he was just focused on the actual conflict, not the case law to talk about the parameters, Fani Willis would be probably a little bit less nervous than today.",
