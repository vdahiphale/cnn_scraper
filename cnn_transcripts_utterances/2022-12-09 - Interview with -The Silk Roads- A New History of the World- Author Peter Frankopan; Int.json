Her release, after nearly 10 months in detention, is being celebrated not only by her family, team and supporters, but as a major win for the Biden administration. However, the president is facing criticism for not securing the freedom of another American locked up and Russia, Paul Whelan. Listen to what the state department spokesperson said earlier about it all. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NED PRICE, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKERSPERSON: The choice we faced, this is what President Biden said yesterday and what Secretary Blinken said yesterday, it was not which one. It was one American or none. And of course, we took the deal that was on the table that we certainly didn't want to lose. To have the opportunity to see Brittney Griner reunited with her -- with Cherelle and her family, back here. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The Pentagon says,there's still some concern that he could return to the illicit international arms trade. Let's go now to U.S. State Department -- to National Security Correspondent Kylie Atwood. Kylie, thank you so much for joining us. There are so many things going on right now. Can you talk to me first about what has happened in this situation? There is a wide disparity of offenses between Brittney Griner being jailed for just having less than a gram of a hashish oil, which were in some cartridges in her luggage. And Viktor Bout is known as the merchant of death. And there have been criticisms here. While there is a huge celebration on the part of her, her family, her supporters, there is some criticism that the Biden administration is facing. Including, you know, the Russians saying that this is a victory for them. They're trying to do their spin on it. But Republicans have also jumped in, not surprisingly, Kevin McCarthy called it a gift for Putin. Why was it so important for President Biden to make this deal?",

But the question here is, how can the Biden administration figure that out? And I spoke with a senior administration official who said that, even though they tried their best to get him out at the same time as Brittney Griner, they're essentially going back to the drawing board. They're going to come up with some new ideas, some innovative things, new offers, bigger offers that they can go to the Russians with to try and keep this momentum going here. And it is significant to note that for President Putin, who is of course facing some pressure in his own country, domestically because of the war in Ukraine, this was heralded as a pretty big win for him at home. So, there's reason for him to want to engage into perhaps engage in another prisoner swap that would be good for him domestically. The question is, how quickly can they get there and how, you know, challenging are the Russians in getting to that agreement?",

But, I think, clearly this is a sign of a sharply changing world. You know, that relationship that the U.S. has had with Saudi and many states in the Middle East over the last 30, 40 years, you know, the primary question today, is what does the U.S. get out of that relationship? You know, the U.S. is now energy independent. It produces its own oil. Shell has been a huge success in the last 20, 30 years. We're all talking about carbon -- freer carbon neutral futures. So, you know, what is it the U.S. actually gets from Saudi? What does it get from Middle Eastern States like UAE that have very extensive fat (ph) budget to several wealth funds? And I guess that works in the other direction, too. You know, what is it if you're based out of Riyadh or in Abu Dhabi right now? You know, presumably you want to have friends in many different ports as possible. And Washington is the obvious place because of what the U.S. stands for but there's no harm in having cultivated high relationships with London, with Islamabad, with Delhi, with Beijing. I mean, a lot of actions that we don't spend a lot of time thinking about. Their relationship with Moscow is a little bit more problematic because that really is taking a stake of saying, I'm not just here for building my economy. I'm here to make a political statement. And so, I think, watching the axis of Moscow reaching out into Beijing and into the Middle East, into the Gulf is a really important thing to be paying attention to.",

You know, that's not just a problem in China, I mean, it's acute in China,the politburo, it's male dominated, all men over the age of 60, give or take. You know, that's the same in many countries around the world. Including, in fact, in the U.S., the age of our senior politicians. What those protests were really driven by was by young people. And what we learned about COVID, is although immunosuppression can happen at many ages, it's obviously much rarer with young people. So, this is, I think, a moment where China had its bluff called. The Communist Party, working out, should it run the risk of more protests with all those young people who have got difficult life prospects? You know, the big booms that we've seen in China over the last 30 years, economically. Very acutely aware that that 996, the way of young people working in all hours of the day, pretty much all everyday of week. But that is, at some point, going to go in the wrong direction. So, the loosening up of these restrictions, I think, what it has done is to say that we're going to listen to young people. And in fact, the people are going to be more compromised or be the ones who are older. I mean, about 80 million in China over the age of 80 haven't had a booster shot. So, the question will be now, what happens to the health system in China? Which is not completely functional. It's very regionally up and down. And if very large numbers of people get infected and those develop into mortalities, then it's a different kind of problem that the leadership has to deal with. But for now, taking a chance on opening things up, getting the economy going is probably what's driving this. To get productivity back, getting people back into jobs. Because China is facing a whole set of macroeconomic, big economic challenges right now that it has to work at a deal with. And keeping people locked up indoors is probably not the smartest way to solve that.",

DAVID DALEY, AUTHOR, \"UNRIGGED: HOW AMERICANS ARE BATTLING BACK TO SAVE DEMOCRACY\": It's really, really interesting case. It is called More V. Harper. And it arises out of a gerrymandered congressional map that the North Carolina State Supreme Court tossed aside as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander because as it was drawn by Republican state legislatures there, it gave the GOP, 10 of 14 seats in what is effectively a 50/50 purple state. What Republicans, however, did was they appealed this using a novel legal theory called the Independent State Legislature Theory. They have gotten it now all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. What they are asserting, in this case, is that under the federal constitution in the elections clause, the word legislature means legislature and only the legislature. So, that the state Supreme Court in North Carolina and indeed the state constitution would have no power over the legislature in their ability to make rules that administer the time, place, and manner of federal elections. If this novel theory is upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, it could really dramatically change where power rests over federal elections.",

They are lining up a situation in which absolute unfettered control over all election issues would lie in state legislatures.

The rules would have been completely unclear. And much would have been left to U.S. Supreme Court to decide and interpret. And what we've seen, of course, is that that court has become much more partisan. There were only about 75,000 votes, effectively, that separated Joe Biden and Donald Trump in the 2020 election. Biden wins the popular vote, yes, by 7 million. But his electoral college victory is super narrow when you look at the margins in Georgia, Wisconsin, Arizona, and a single congressional district in Nebraska. If those electors had been challenged by Republican-controlled, oftentimes Republican gerrymandered legislatures in those states, and alternate electors had been sent to Washington, we saw on the hours after the January 6th insurrection that there was a majority of the U.S. House Republican caucus that was willing to set aside free and fair election results from states like Pennsylvania and Arizona.

If theindependent state legislator theory is adopted, you might see many states rush to redraw legislative maps, which could reopen the battle for Congress. If state legislatures are free to draw maps without any constraints of state Supreme Courts, you could see New York, you could see, you know, many, many states jump back into this. If the most maximal endorsement of independent state legislature theory is embraced, it could lead to the unconstitutionality of independent redistricting commissions around the country. It could dramatically change the way that people vote by mail, whether absentee balloting is allowed. And I think, just as importantly, it would remove the ability of voters and citizens in these states to challenge some of these really new draconian bills and state legislatures that make it much harder for people to vote. So, a package of voter suppression bills, for example, in the State of Georgia that, you know, currently is being litigated, the state Supreme Court would have no power there to rule on a case like that. And what we have seen from the U.S. Supreme Court on voting rights over the course of the last decade has been that they are very reluctant to weigh in on the side of voters and against the power of state legislators to do what they will. And then, if we get to a case where elections are contested, where estate - - slates of electors are contested in 2024 in some of these most competitive states, places like Arizona and Georgia and Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, what you could see is pure constitutional chaos.
