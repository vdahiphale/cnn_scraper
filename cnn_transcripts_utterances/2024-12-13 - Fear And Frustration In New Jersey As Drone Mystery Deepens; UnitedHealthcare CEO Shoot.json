Plus, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is in the hospital after falling during an overseas trip. What we're learning about her condition this days after longtime Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell was also injured in a fall.But we're going to start this hour with the drone mystery now expanding to at least three states and federal officials facing increasing pressure to give the public some kind of explanation for what is really going on. Today, Connecticut and New York join New Jersey in reporting drones flying over neighborhoods, restricted military sites and near airports. And now New Jersey's governor is asking President Biden to ask for more resources to figure out who is behind these drones and what they're up to. Let's go to CNN's Polo Sandoval in New York. And Polo, it seems like every few minutes we're getting a new alert from local officials about more drone sightings. Do we have any clarity from officials on who they think is behind these drones?",

And of course, you recall yesterday you had that conversation with New Jersey Representative Josh Gottheimer, which basically reaffirmed what he told you yesterday, that he has been briefed by federal authorities. And based on what he's been told, based on what he's been shown, that it basically puts any sort of fears to rest in terms of this being a potential threat to homeland security or to public safety.So that aside, he still has his questions and also his call for the federal government to fully, briefly the American people, mainly people in New Jersey. He says he's been told what these are not, but he wants to hear what they actually are. And so we continue to hear that. Meanwhile, the White House, the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, for their part, they've continued to reaffirm what they've said, really since yesterday. And that is that thus far the evidence that they have seen, they have not. They don't believe that this is a threat. And they also have not received any reports of any drones flying in restricted airspace. But to your earlier point, Jake, those sightings, they continue. And it's not just civilians, but we've also heard it from elected officials, the U.S. Coast Guard, and most recently from former Maryland governor Larry Hogan that reported that it was last night at his house south of Baltimore that he observed what he described as large drones flying there in the area. And today, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, as you mentioned, officially putting out a request to the government for resources, information. But he's also warning about these wild conspiracy theories that are certainly taking taken some at least we've heard a lot of them filling that information void. It was just days ago that we heard from an elected official who believed without evidence that in fact it was Iranian mothership off the Jersey coast that was sending these drones in. Of course, the Pentagon quickly denying that. But there certainly is a concern that with that information void, that we're going to continue to hear these theories that perhaps may not be -- may not make the most sense. Now, all of this said, we have also heard from government officials who maintain that a vast majority of the videos that have been circulating widely on the internet, they believe that a lot of those are actually simply civilian aircraft operating legally.",

We've now gone on weeks here, and there's been no press conference by the FBI, DHS secretary, the Department of Transportation Secretary, or FAA.Instead, we get a press release, you know, several days ago, that says nothing. Really nothing to see here. I don't know that's enough for the American people. They want answers. If you're able to brief members of Congress and assure them, and it seems like some of them are assured after these briefings, then let's share that information with the American public. I think more transparency here helps, even if you don't know exactly what it is, but you've discounted or you've ruled out certain things. I think the American people would like to understand what exactly is going on here from a vulnerability perspective. Obviously, there's critical infrastructure throughout the state of New Jersey. There is restricted airspace throughout the state of New Jersey. And so the American people are concerned on a variety of different fronts. And the more time that goes by without officials talking about that directly to the American people, I think builds that distrust. And I think that's a lot of what we're talking about.",

It could be a variety of different things where they don't want to reveal what they know and, of course, how they know it.Again, I think you can be more transparent. You may not be able to tell the American people everything, but the more transparent that you're able to be with them, I think starts to, you know, relieve some of the fears and some of the stories and some of the presumptions that we hear about what's going on. I have found during my time that, you know, the less you communicate, the more people grow concerned, and then it starts to balloon and gets out of control a little bit. So, look, they need to figure out what's going on. I think that's first and foremost. I think it's been over a number of weeks. If it's manned aircraft, there's a very easy way to determine and to discern that. And if that's what it is, just tell the American people that's what it is.

Perhaps it is, but we don't know because it's not being communicated as such.And my guess is you would have President Trump tweeting or truthing on this as well and sharing with the American people what he knows and what he's been told.

What do you make of this? Is this just a matter of slow bureaucracy or so many leads you can only check out at one time? How do we improve this? JOSHUA SKULE. FORMER FBI EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR FOR INTELLIGENCE: So first, we don't know the context, Jake. We don't know, you know, they say they identified them. There's a picture associated with it. The FBI likely, when they say they did investigative background on it, they likely worked up a it's a bad content profile and went through all of his social media and sent that over to the NYPD. The NYPD is a very sophisticated, very good police department. But still they did not have DNA. They still did not have fingerprint match and he was not in any databases.

Right. More than 140 police officers were assaulted. Millions of dollars in damage to the U.S. Capitol. One option that we're told is on the table is to maybe pardon people who are charged with certain offenses related to January 6th. But even if you take an offense like assault, there are varying degrees of violence related to that. You also have folks like the leaders of some of these far right organizations. Enrique Tarrio is a perfect example. Enrique Tarrio is a perfect example because he wasn't in Washington. He wasn't engaging in the violence, but he was encouraging it. He was convicted of seditious conspiracy. He's currently in jail serving a multi decade sentence. So what do you do there when he says he doesn't want to pardon someone like that, pretend, does he mean maybe he'll commute the sentence? It's unclear. But Katelyn and I and our colleagues, we have made calls to everybody and it's clear there is no formal process. They don't have a clear plan. The only thing we know is that Trump's going to do this, he's going to do it quickly. And I would not be surprised, based on my conversations with sources, if we see something that in fact isn't that nuanced, that's actually pretty broad because whenever we push them on this, the name that of course came up was that of Hunter Biden and President Biden's pardon of his son that extends over a decade.
