Ninety-one charges, that's what Donald Trump is now facing after he was indicted in Fulton County, Georgia, late last night. This is the fourth time he's been indicted since leaving office. The former president is one of 19 people charged in Georgia, for his and their attempts to overturn the 2020 election results in that state. Trump joined by his former attorneys John Eastman and Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell and Jenna Ellis, as well as former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, all of them have been given until noon next Friday to turn themselves in. One major difference in this case is the racketeering charge that Trump and his coconspirators face. Prosecutors are accusing Trump of being the head of a, quote, criminal enterprise working to overthrow democracy. And in Georgia, that racketeering charge carries with it a five-year mandatory minimum prison sentence. Mr. Trump is once again today lashing out and reverting to his playbook, attacking the prosecutor, calling this a witch hunt, insisting without any evidence that the 2020 election was stolen. To which Georgia's governor, Brian Kemp, a conservative Republican and former Trump endorser, responded this afternoon. Quote, the 2020 election in Georgia was not stolen. For nearly three years, now anyone has failed to find evidence of fraud, come forward, under oath, and prove anything in a court of law. Our elections in Georgia are secure, accessible, and fair, and will continue to be as long as I am governor, unquote. The Georgia indictment is nearly 100 pages long, and includes a sweeping list of ways that Trump allegedly broke the law. So, CNN's Sara Murray is starting off our coverage today by digging into what exactly went down in Georgia.

So he would argue that, as president, he's responsible for ensuring that elections for president are secure and that's all he was doing.The problem is, the indictment, of course, is full of allegations. That's not what he was doing. There are people charged with ensuring elections are fair and clean. And those are the state elections officials that actually conduct the elections in the state and that he was actually interfering with them. So he's not going to be able to prove that. In fact, he was acting within the confines of his job at that time. So, ultimately, I think he will make the motion and it will be denied.",

      "sentences": "All right. Former prosecutor Jennifer Rodgers, thanks so much. Appreciate it.Joining us now to discuss, Republican presidential candidate and former U.S. attorney, Chris Christie. Governor Christie, thanks for joining us. You said today, earlier, that the Georgia charges against Donald Trump you feel are, quote, unnecessary because you feel as though Jake Smith, the special counsel, has already charged Trump for these exact actions in Georgia. Now, Georgia prosecutors might point out, if Trump is elected president, he can just shut down Jack Smith's case or pardon himself, but he wouldn't have the right to do that with a Georgia investigation and/or verdicts. What is your response to that? CHRIS CHRISTIE (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, Jake, you know, I don't think that's a prosecutor's job. The prosecutor's job is to look at how you administer justice in this case. And let me say, first off, that I have no argument with the underlying conduct constituting something that should be seriously considered by any grand jury at the state or at the federal level. But what happened here was Jack Smith charged the case. He charged the case weeks ago that consumes this conduct. Now, she could have brought us case without Donald Trump, and because Jack Smith didn't charge anybody else, other than Donald Trump in this matter. So, I think the double charging here of Donald Trump is something that complicates things in a way that makes the administration of justice much more difficult in the near term. And so, I didn't think it was a necessary thing to do. Once you saw that Jack Smith was trudging him federally for the ferries and contact, we would have these kinds of discussions among federal and state prosecutors when I was U.S. attorney, and we would work it out so we didn't have these things. I'm a little bit concerned that this had more to do with ego than anything else, that her office had put a lot of time and to the investigation, Jack Smith came in a number of months ago, swooped in, moved quickly, charged the case, and at this point she felt like I put all this time, and I should talk to president because I put my time in. I don't think that's the way you make these calls. So I think it was an unnecessary thing to do, because she has 18 other defendants who have not been charged in any place else, that she could have charged without Trump, and still have a very, very strong case down there.",

That's why I said that, off the top, when you look at what he's alleged to have done here, along with others on his behalf, the pressure campaign that was put on these folks.Look, Donald Trump got due process in Georgia. There was an original account. There was a machine recount, then there was a hand recount. All which came up with essentially the same result. He had access to all the courts in Georgia to contest it in the same way that Al Gore contested these measures in Florida state court, back in 2000. The difference being, that when al gore ultimately lost this case, he conceded and moved on. Donald Trump ratcheted up the pressure even more, ultimately resulting in what we saw on January 6th.

People must understand. They think everyone also act has to be a crime. What she is really establishing is that these were acts in furtherance of the conspiracy to commit a crime. And, you know, the fact here is that the RICO state being as broad as it is, as it is in Georgia, that gives have the opportunity to do it this way. I don't know if I would have charged at this way, but now we're into the realm of second-guessing. Every prosecutor is going to make their own judgment on these things.

They're just going to read whatever news reports that they read about characterizations of it.It becomes much different when there's a trial going on. And that's what I think Jack Smith charged this case the way he did with just Donald Trump as a defendant, no one else. He wants to move that case quickly and get this case done. He wants January -- that might be a little bit tight, but I can certainly say this happening in February or March of 2024. And so, you know, I do think whenever this starts to be presented, witnesses get on the stand and tell their story. And if the prosecution does an effective job of weaving that story together -- and Donald Trump has to be sitting there. Remember, Jake, he has to be there every day. This is not an optional exercise. You are a criminal defendant, and I think, that's one of the things folks should keep in mind that are watching. He is now going to be when he appears next week in Georgia sometime, he's going to be out on bail in four different jurisdictions in this country -- New York, Miami, Washington, and Atlanta. I think that what Republican voters have to ask themselves is two things. One, is someone out on bail on four jurisdictions really our best chance to beat Joe Biden. And secondly, are we really going to continue to act as though this is normal conduct? It's not. So, even if you disagree with some of the criminal charges here, if you think they were in overreach, or as I think on this, they're unnecessary, it doesn't get rid of the underlying conduct, which is what we should be discussing in the campaign, which is, does this man have the temperament and the character to beat Joe Biden and to be president of the United States again? And I firmly believe the answer to that is no. TAPPER: And he'll be under indictment in every single national league east city, with the exception of the great city of Philadelphia. Governor --",

But, that's the only place that are on the same play page. They are both on opposing views on what happens to this gun diversion deal. Hunter Biden's team saying on Sunday night that they think this deal is still binding, and valid, because both prosecutors and Hunter Biden had signed this deal. Now in a new court filing today, the special counsel's office is saying that it is not a binding deal, and they're saying is because it's lacking one other signature, and that's from the head of the U.S. probation apartment in Delaware. In the filing they write, because she did not approve the now withdrawn diversion agreement, it never went into effect. And therefore, none of it is terms for binding on either party. So, that puts this gun diversion deal back in the hands of the judge. And you remember last month, she was not a fan of how it was structured, questioning whether was constitutional.
