Human Rights Council special session on Iran where you have two countries,Iceland and Germany, that have presented a draft resolution to create some sort of an independent investigative accountability mechanism that would allow for the collection, preservation, documentation of evidence of these human rights violations, Becky, to ensure that there is some sort of an accountability mechanism in place to try and hold the perpetrators of these human rights violations and abuses to account. This is something that human rights groups, Iranians have been pushing for for years. And it's finally happening today. We have to wait and see what comes out in the next few hours. There is still an ongoing debate coming. But then we heard from the Iranian regime as you mentioned earlier. They are still standing by their position, their narrative that this is all some sort of foreign plot, that it's everything and everyone's fault other than the Iranian regime. Blaming it on everything from social media platforms, from Twitter and Instagram, to Israel and Germany. Refusing as we've heard from multiple countries that have come out today and spoken in support of the protesters. And U.N. officials as well. Really refusing to hear and listen to what their own population has been calling for for weeks. Just completely dismissing it all. And I have to tell you, Becky, we have been speaking with Iranians. And they tell you the numbers right now speak for themselves over the past more than two months. More than 300 people killed and the numbers are believed to be much higher than that. 14,000 people have been arrested including children. At least six people have been sentenced to death for taking part in these protests. So Iranians around the world and Iranians inside Iran taking part in the protest believe that the international community must do something. And the least they can do is to try and hold the regime accountable for these crimes. Take a listen to what one protester told us recently. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KARADSHEH (voice-over): Iranians have been risking it all for freedom. To break free of the shackles of a repressive regime that's brutality and bullets are only fueling the anger of those on the streets, making them more defiant than ever.",
