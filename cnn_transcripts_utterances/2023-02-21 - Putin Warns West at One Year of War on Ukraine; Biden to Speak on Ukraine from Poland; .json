And in the next hour, Joe Biden is set to take center stage in Poland to counteract the Kremlin and affirm Western values, his top aides say. Ahead of the first anniversary of what Vladimir Putin calls Russia's \"special military operation\" in Ukraine, the Russian president announced a short time ago that he is suspending Moscow's participation in what is known as the nuclear arms pact with the United States. He's also pledging to strengthen his army, claiming the West wants to make the Ukrainian conflict wider and bigger. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA (through translator):  The elite of the West do not conceal their ambitions, which is to strategically defeat Russia, finish us off once and for all.

Meanwhile, China's top diplomat is in Moscow. State media say he will meet with the Russian foreign minister on Wednesday, the first visit to the country from a Chinese official since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. And in just about 19 minutes, we should be hearing from the U.S. President Joe Biden. He'll be speaking from Poland, where he will meet with leaders from NATO's eastern flank. All of this comes off Mr. Biden's visit to Kyiv yesterday. He promised U.S. support as Ukrainians continue to defy Russia and promised another $0.5 billion in military aid. A lot of developments, a lot of competing narratives here. CNN's Kaitlan Collins is in Warsaw, where it has been a busy day for everyone, not least for Mr. Biden. Let's start with this suspension and the participation of what's known as New START, what's been the response to this suspension of this nuclear control treaty with the United States? What has been the response from the Biden administration?",

One is that they didn't really think Russia was complying with it anyway. You know, these inspections have not happened because of COVID-19 and, then, because of last year when Putin was launching his invasion of Ukraine. So they've made that argument. But they've also said, you know, in the wider debate of him saying they're suspending their cooperation, there are questions, of course, of whether or not Russia will formally pull out of this. What does it look like when they're trying to renegotiate it in just a matter of years from now? Those are the concerns they've raised, saying they believe his comments this morning during that lengthy speech were irresponsible, according to the White House. They say they do stand ready to have these discussions, to talk to Russia about their concerns with this and to have those conversations. But they're also dismissing what President Putin was saying earlier today, saying it's a lot of bluster; of course, given Russia wasn't really complying with in the first place.",

At the end of that speech, Biden said, quote, \"for God's sake, this man cannot remain in power.\" Raised all these questions about whether not he was calling for regime change, something the White House later came back and said, that is not what they were saying. Though Biden said he did not regret that remark but it just shows you, basically, these dueling styles of these two leaders and how they have fundamentally different views of the world. That is going to be on full display as President Biden is urging others to keep up their support for Ukraine, to not let it fledge (ph) or disappear, saying just how important it is, not just for Ukraine but the entire world order really.",

Based on his detailed eyewitness testimony and cross-referencing with satellite imagery, CNN has been able to locate the black site where he says he was tortured, in his hometown of Azhnaviya (ph). These are the trees that hide the unnamed building he was brought into. And this is the girls' school where he had children playing in the courtyard. But this is not the only black site. Cross referencing testimony from over 2 dozen sources with satellite images, CNN found dozens of these black sites which can be divided into two types, undeclared illegal jails inside government facilities, such as military bases and intelligence centers, and makeshift clandestine jails that typically crop up temporarily near protest sites. For instance, in this city, known for its religious pilgrimage sites, they've been using some mosques as detention centers, according to multiple sources CNN spoke with. This pattern can be seen in different cities across the country. In Sanandaj, we found at least six unofficial detention centers; Zahedan five and Tehran, the capital, where CNN was also able to locate eight different pop-up torture sites. After speaking to dozens of eyewitnesses who were tortured in these different unofficial detention centers, the barbaric treatment used on Samadi was not unique.

It paints a picture of a regime meting out torture on an industrial scale, designed to crush an uprising that has posed the biggest existential threat to the regime in decades. These are photos of just some of the protesters that state hospital physician Dr. Mohsen Sohrabi and his colleagues treated in the city of Sanandaj, a major flashpoint in the crackdown of the uprising. It was an illegal act, according to the Iranian regime. For that, he, too, was brought to a black site and tortured. DR. MOHSEN SOHRABI, STATE HOSPITAL PHYSICIAN (through translator):  They are a power in and of themselves. They don't follow any kind of human rights, there is no supervision.

Apologies for mispronouncing your name. I mention Bucha just now, one of the most horrific incidents in this war and one that shocked the world, only weeks into the start of this war. We are now a year on. In these images, you can see some of the mass graves and damage to the town here. Russia has denied these allegations. But I want you to give me a sense of scale here. What are we talking about as far as your investigations have turned up? BETH VAN SCHAACK, AMBASSADOR-AT-LARGE FOR GLOBAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT:  Thank you for covering this really troubling situation. You know, when the conflict restarted in February of last year, we focused very much on what looked like deliberate, disproportionate and indiscriminate attacks against elements of the civilian infrastructure. Basically lobbing of missiles across an international border, focused on maternity hospitals, train stations where people were evacuating, et cetera. But then, as investigators, journalists, human rights advocates got access to areas that had been under Russian occupation or control, we saw violence of a different order. This was interpersonal violence. This was evidence of individuals being shot, execution style, with their hands tied behind their back; evidence of clandestine torture chambers, where people were subjected to beatings, electrocution, et cetera; incredible reports of sexual violence against women and girls but also men and boys. So this is what we are talking about when we see the torture being committed by Russia's forces against ordinary Ukrainians. And it's on a terrible scale. The prosecutor general has recorded over now 70,000 incidents of potential war crimes and other atrocities. And all of these are being subject now to investigation and eventual prosecution.",

We see crimes, literally everywhere, that Russia's troops have been deployed but also we're seeing patterns of abuses, the same types of abuses happening in multiple areas, where different battalions and leaders are operating. And this suggests that responsibility goes up the chain of command. The doctrine of superior responsibility enables prosecutors to reach those most senior figures, who knew or should have known that their subordinates were committing abuses and who failed to take the necessary steps to either prevent them up front or to investigate and prosecute after the fact.

They're probably a little bit more than 50 percent at this point. Of course, the 2.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank are under military occupation. They are not citizens of Israel. But I think the point that Beinart makes is that the distinction is increasingly blurred, especially as the Netanyahu government seeks to de facto annex the West Bank territories. And so, as Palestinians become more and more a part of greater Israel, Israel Jews in Israel become less and less of a majority. And at a certain point, very soon, they will be a minority.
