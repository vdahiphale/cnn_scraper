Police are investigating the president for possible treason, while he also faces an impeachment vote for declaring martial law.And things are changing fast in Syria, Bashar Al-Assad's army withdrawing from one of the country's biggest cities, as rebels continue their advance. And a manhunt in New York, we've got the latest on the chilling murder of Unitedhealthcare CEO in Manhattan. A martial law declaration was only in place for a few hours in South Korea, but the political aftershocks continue to rattle the country. President Yoon Suk Yeol's declaration Tuesday night was met with shock and anger. The leader of the opposition spoke with CNN earlier today and says he was certain the announcement was a deep fake. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LEE JAE-MYUNG, LEADER OF DEMOCRATIC PARTY: My wife suddenly showed me a YouTube video and said, the president is declaring martial law. I replied, that's a deep fake. It has to be a deep fake. There's no way that's real. But when I watched the video, the president was indeed declaring martial law. Yet I thought to myself, this is fabricated. It's fake.

So, let's pick up where you left off talking about impeachment.So right now, it's unclear what the impeachment path is going to be. And we say that, Omar, because we have President Yoon and his political party. So, the Head of President Yoon's political party is saying in, you know, paraphrasing here, Omar. All right, we think that you need to go. You need to leave the party President Yoon. But the leader of the party is saying he is against impeachment -- and against impeachment because he does not want the country to delve into further disarray, further chaos. But I will tell you, Omar, we have new public polling that is out, being shared throughout media outlets across South Korea that's saying that upwards of 70 percent of the population here wants impeachment. So, we're waiting to see there is a vote that we're thinking is going to be, in all likelihood, around 07:00 p.m. on Saturday for impeachment, Saturday evening. And we are waiting to see if eight members of the president's party join the opposition and vote for impeachment. But right now, we're not really sure, Omar, if those lawmakers are going to join the opposition and go down that road of impeachment, because what the leader of the party is saying, again, he is saying new today, that he's against impeachment. Meanwhile, we haven't heard anything from President Yoon. He gave a more or less one minute statement after he rescinded martial law, saying, all right, I've heard the will of the people, did not apologize, Omar. But I'll tell you, if this impeachment vote looks like it's going to fail, we see on the screen images of candlelight protests. Those protests will likely increase by several magnitudes, protests and echoes of loudspeakers emanating across Seoul. And of course, it's so important because we're talking about a key American ally. 28,500 U.S. troops who are stationed throughout South Korea. [08:05:00] Political stability is paramount when we're talking about such a key. U.S. ally and predictability. So, we're waiting to see what does the impeachment outlook appear to be.

Mike Valerio appreciate the reporting as always. All right, I want to turn now to new developments in Syria, where rebels have entered the strategically important City of Hama. Now that's forcing the army to redeploy outside of the city. We're getting that from a Syrian military statement. Now you can see the territory under rebel control in green there. Losing control of the strategic City of Hama would be a massive blow to the Syrian regime. I want to bring in CNN's Ben Wedeman, who is tracking the developments for us and joins us live. Ben, can you just give us some perspective on what this actually means? And obviously, over the past week or so, likely even before that, we have seen a reinforced rebel offensive in Syria as well.

      "sentences": "Just to keep it in perspective, Omar, in the space of essentially a week, the Rebels have taken control of Aleppo, Syria's second largest city, and now Hama, which is Syria's fourth largest city. These are the two northern most cities on the M5 highway that links Aleppo with Damascus.Basically, they now control about half of that highway. And it really is underscores just how much of a paper tiger the Syrian army has turned out to be. Now, surprisingly, a very frank statement coming from the Syrian army today, acknowledging that they were coming under attack from a variety of directions in Hama and pulled out of the city. They said, to avoid civilian casualties, which is uncharacteristic, with an offer an army with a lot of blood on its hands, but nonetheless, clearly, they were incapable of defending the city, and what we're seeing on social media is that they've abandoned a military air bases full of jet aircraft. They've abandoned a prison, according to the opposition, they've managed to -- the regime has managed, rather, the rebels have managed to take over the central prison of Hama. And you need to sort of keep in perspective the history of this city, back in 1982, Rifaat al- Assad, who was the brother of the father of Bashar al-Assad. Hafez al-Assad led Syrian forces surrounding Hama, which was at the moment, at the time, in the course of an uprising against the regime. They surrounded the city, pounded it with artillery, then went in and slaughtered at least 10,000 people in that city. So, there is a lot of bad blood in among the residents of Hama toward the regime. And it really was a symbol of the oppression of the Assad dynasty, which has been in power in Syria since 1971 so the fall of Hama after the fall of Aleppo within just a week represents a real collapse of the regime so far. It doesn't seem to be able to depend upon the Russians to provide any more than occasional air strikes on rebel targets. The Iranians don't seem to be anywhere in evidence in making any difference in resisting the rebel onslaught. And of course, Hezbollah, by and large, seems to have pulled out altogether as a result of its war with Israel. So, I think today, we are seeing the Assad regime at its weakest point since the outbreak of the revolution in Syria in 2011, Omar.",

The one you were just talking about happened in the humanitarian zone of Al Mawasi near the City of Khan Younis in southern Gaza. We see this enormous fireball emerging following the Israeli strikes.The Israeli military claims that there were secondary explosions as a result of its strike, indicating the presence of Hamas weaponry in the area and effectively blaming Hamas for some, at least some of the deaths in this strike. As you mentioned, Nasser hospital says that of the 20 people who were killed in this strike. 11 of those were killed. Eyewitnesses describing an absolutely horrific scene, bodies dismembered and burned. Some eyewitnesses saying that the majority of the people who were killed appeared to have died as a result of the burns from the fire that engulfed the tents in this area. And it is important to note that this strike did happen in an area where there were tents where people were told to flee to from other parts of the Gaza Strip and where they had hoped to find at least some sense of safety, but instead finding out, as all too many have in Gaza already, that nowhere is truly safe in Gaza. Now, as for that, Amnesty International report, Amnesty International is now saying that they believe that there is, quote, sufficient evidence to believe that Israel's conduct in Gaza amounts to genocide. It is a 296-page scathing report from Amnesty International, based on evidence that they have gathered over nine months of this war. They say that Israel has committed three out of the five of prohibited acts under the UN's Genocide Convention. The mass killing of civilians, causing serious bodily or mental harm and deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about people's physical destruction in whole or in part. They cite the indiscriminate attacks, the destruction of civilian infrastructure and the forced displacement of Palestinians, 90 percent of whom are displaced from their homes at this point in the war. The Israeli military calls this report from Amnesty International, quote, entirely baseless. They say that these allegations of genocide are not only unfounded, but they also argue that it ignores Hamas' violations of international law. Amnesty International noted that while that violations of the laws of war by Hamas do not preclude Israel from its responsibility not to violate those same laws of war. It is also important to note that Israel at the International Court of Justice has been defending itself against allegations of genocide leveled by South Africa, and they have, of course, wholly rejected this notion that there is any basis for genocidal intent in this war Amnesty Israel. We should also note a branch of Amnesty International issued a dissent, saying that many in their branch have doubts regarding proving unequivocally and beyond any reasonable alternative this question of intent, meaning not just the acts that have been committed, the killing and the dismembering and the displacement of Palestinian civilians. But saying that there is not sufficient evidence in Amnesty Israel's view to establish the intent of genocide, they do not, however, dispute that the conduct of the Israeli military in Gaza raises serious suspicions of crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing, Omar.",

What was the motivation here? Can you just lay out sort of where we are in this case, and what might be so difficult at this point in trying to track this person down?JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; INTELLIGENCE ANALYST: Well, he's gone to a lot of trouble, Omar, to make sure we don't know what he looks like, because if you look at him here in the Starbucks, he's wearing the hood, he's wearing the mask, as most people did during COVID, you can see his eyes during the shooting. You can see he where he's wearing what appears to be white rubber gloves. So, he's trying to not tell us who he is. At the same time, he is trying to send us a message. The idea that, depose was written on one of the bullets he fired, delay was written on another one of the bullets. That is something investigators believe is a variation that you find in internet chat rooms about insurance, insurance claims, fighting insurance companies. Of the saying, deny, delay, defend, which is a legal maxim of how insurance companies try to slow down payment of claims. So, these are the investigative questions now, Omar, which is, is this an individual who had a personal experience with United Healthcare who was targeting the CEO for revenge? Did he lose someone? Was he sick? They're looking at that angle, or is this an individual who has a larger gripe with insurance companies, health care companies in general. And this was a crime of opportunity, because it was known the CEO was going to be at that hotel. This is a nine-millimeter bullet. It's the bullet and the shell casing together, but when you consider the trouble, you would have to go to actually write something in this space that would survive being fired through a gun. This is someone who went to a lot of trouble to make sure that those rounds would be discharged, that they would be found, and that police would pick up that message when they took a closer look.",

Officials say the electrical grid came back online just before midnight, but it's just the latest in a series of near total blackouts affecting the island nation. The government blames U.S. economic sanctions, while critics say is due to a lack of government investment in infrastructure.Meanwhile, Iran is one step closer to toughening its already harsh modesty laws. The hard-line Iranian Parliament adopted the new Chastity and Hijab Bill earlier this week. It would significantly tighten existing clothing restrictions with new penalties for violations that include fines and prison sentences for women, this includes banning tight outfits and wearing the hijab incorrectly. For men, it bans any exposure below the chest and above the knees as well as the shoulders. And now goes to Iran's President for his signature. And while he has expressed opposition to the bill and called it vague, he also acknowledged he has to implement it. A woman well-known for her fierce defense of human rights in Iran has been allowed to leave prison temporarily after treatment for suspected cancer, but her family argues her release didn't come soon enough.

Her temporary release comes as one of her long-standing battles, opposing the mandatory hijab is yet again in the headlines.
