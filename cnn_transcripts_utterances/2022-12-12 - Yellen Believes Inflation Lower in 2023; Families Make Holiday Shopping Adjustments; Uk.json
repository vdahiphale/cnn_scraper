So we have all this data, key inflation data, coming out tomorrow. Wednesday we should hear about a rate hike, right, because the Fed is meeting.

      "sentences": "Well, Erica and Jim, there is a lot of gloom and doom out there, right, as we head into 2023. But I think the truth is, there are some real bright spots out there. I mean it's easy to forget but we are in the middle of this historic jobs boom. More than 4 million jobs created so far this year. That is more than twice the pre-Covid pace. It's actually more than any other year -- as you can see on that chart - more than any other year, except for last year, which was the all-time record. The unemployment rate is just 3.7 percent. Easy to forget but it was almost 15 percent in the spring of 2020.And not only the jobs market is strong, but some of the negatives are getting better, right? Inflation, we learned on Friday that producer prices, they went up at the slowest annual rate in 18 months. We do expect more cooling in tomorrow's consumer inflation report. Also, gas prices, right, they have plunged. The national average is down by 52 cents in just the last month. They're actually lower than they were a year ago, which is pretty amazing. And then there's the Federal Reserve, right, which has been lamming the brakes on the economy almost all year. That is why people are worried about a recession because borrowing costs are going up so rapidly. But the Fed is expected to slow the pace of rate hikes, right? Expected to deliver a 50 basis point increase on Wednesday. That would be down from 75 basis points. I think the question is whether the Fed can stop raising interest rates before it ends up slowing the economy into recession. And we don't know that yet, but that will be the story of 2023.",

They're made in Iran but Russia's been firing them. They fired 15 of them. Ukraine shot down 10. But five of them were able to hit the power grid in Odessa, which, by the way, had just been repaired after the missile strikes last week on Monday that left the city in the dark for three days.This weekend, more than 1.5 million people, almost the entire Odessa region, once again plunged into darkness on Saturday by these drone attacks. And so that was the first thing that I asked the defense minister about. But I will say, in terms of the winter months, the ground freezing over is actually advantageous he says for these counter offensives because they can roll heavy equipment much more easily. So he expects to see the fighting actually increase in the coming weeks once the ground has frozen. But what about these attacks from the air? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And so I think that it is worth doing. It is a bit of a technology hodgepodge right now. We don't have the ability to land on the moon with the Orion spacecraft.

But coming back from the moon, you're coming in at 24,000, 25,000 miles an hour. It's really sporty. And so you want to make that entry as gentle as possible. And the little skip that it does, so it - it plunges into the atmosphere but flattens out, pops back up a little bit, just a few miles, and then back down again. And that gives you a bunch of things. It gives you a gentler ride, fewer g forces on the astronauts. Also, by just slightly changing the angle of that skip re-entry, youcan move where you land by hundreds of miles. And so you don't have to have quite as much of the U.S. Navy covering the Pacific. You can target it a bit more accurately and you can avoid the weather, as they had to do on this mission.
