      "sentences": "That's right, Erin. We know just in the last hour, certainly from the Trump attorneys, that they have received the summons, which shows essentially a basic charge sheet. There were seven charges, according to them. We're told, according to them, that one of them has to do with the 793, which is the Espionage Act. One of them is 1512, which is an obstruction of justice charge. There's a witness tampering charge, according to the list that they provided, conspiracy, again, those are among the charges that we're aware of, according to the Trump attorneys.And the idea at this point, right now, Erin, is that late this evening, the former president's legal team was notified that there had been an indictment in Miami, and he is set to appear on Tuesday at 03:00 P.M. at the federal court for his first appearance with a federal magistrate. We know that, frankly, this was something being held very tightly by Jack Smith, the special counsel, and his team, law enforcement officials, who are going to be in charge of trying to secure the president, secure that courthouse, and secure those judges were caught off guard, frankly, by this. They were not notified about this until after the former president had already gone public with this information on True Social. And we can talk a little bit about more about that. I mean, it's something that I'm a little surprised that the Justice Department is allowing the former president to set the narrative of exactly what the special counsel has done at the end of this investigation. It's almost like they didn't learn anything from last August, when the former president was the first to tell publicly that his house had been raided at Mar-a-Lago, and then, for the next few days, spun out a bunch of lies about exactly what had happened, including allowing for threats against the FBI agents that carried out the search.",

We saw there was activity at the grand jury room, but we don't know whether that grand jury returned that indictment today.So, what we know is that beginning tomorrow morning, certainly someone, perhaps the Justice Department, will go and ask the judge to unseal the indictment. Jim Trusty told Kaitlan Collins in the last hour that he hopes that they can see it before the Tuesday court hearing. Erin, that's the truth, is that until the Justice Department or until a judge unseals it, we don't know what the special counsel is alleging against the former president.

And as you noted, look, this is still sealed. No one that I have spoken to in Trump's political world has actually seen this indictment. They have just heard from attorneys what this looks like. This was something that they were not taken by surprise when it happened, but yet it is still shocking nonetheless, given the fact that the former president and unprecedented move has been indicted by the Department of Justice.And as we've been reporting most of today, Donald Trump himself was starting to tell people that he believed he was going to be indicted. I talked to a number of senior advisers who said, yes, we think that this is going to happen. And his entire team was preparing for this moment. They have had a call with the lawyers, but just as Jim Trusty said to Kaitlan, they don't have all of the information yet. And sources are telling me that they aren't expecting this to be unsealed tonight or possibly even tomorrow morning. They are still trying to piece together what exactly Trump's reaction is going to look like. Yes, he put out this video, but what does this look like in a larger sense? When does he go down to Florida? He has two campaign events on Saturday. He's going both to North Carolina and to Georgia. I am told by officials none of that is going to change. So, the question is, how exactly does he address this? Is he going to bring this up in these speeches? Is he going to give remarks on Tuesday after he goes down to Miami? Is he going down to Miami in person? All of this is stuff that they are trying to figure out right now. And I do want to note, my colleague, Alayna Treene, is in Bedminster. She's talking to several of Trump's advisers who say they are, quote, jacked up, they are ready for this. And I do believe that there is a faction of Trump's world that does feel that way. They feel energized. They feel like this is going to give them the same boost in the polls that they saw from the Manhattan indictment, the same boost in fundraising. But I will note there are a number of people around him who are very serious and very professional this cycle, and they do not feel that way. The people that I have talked to who say that they're not sure that this is an ultimate positive, that the entire way that they believe that Donald Trump can win the election is by broadening his base and getting an indictment in this federal investigation is not a way to broaden his base. So, something to keep in mind there that while, yes, this could, in fact, energize his base, could bring in fundraising dollars, could boost up his poll numbers, there are still people who support Donald Trump who don't think that this is a positive when it comes to an actual 2024 election.",

He says that the Republicans stand with President Trump against what McCarthy says is a, quote, grave injustice. He goes on to say, House Republicans will hold this brazen weaponization of power accountable. Now, it's not entirely clear what he means by that. Some folks in the far right of his conference want him to go as far as calling for defunding or dismantling the Justice Department. That is not rhetoric that McCarthy has embraced, but they have done other things to go after investigations, including in that New York investigation. They have already gone after that prosecutor in that case, trying to call him to come and testify on Capitol Hill, to try to suggest that that was a politically motivated investigation. Expect the same to happen here. It's unclear exactly what at this point. [22:10:01] But, Dana, there is a serious divide within the ranks of the Republican Party. We have not heard of anything from Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell or his number two, John Thune. McConnell is publicly neutral in this campaign, but he wants to move past the Trump era, as does John Thune, who supports Senator Tim Scott, yet to weigh in on this issue, showing the persistent divide within party over Donald Trump. And also, Dana, most members are gone. There are really nobody here in the Capitol left tonight. Most of them are not here until next week. So, really, the only people are speaking out are the vocal ones. A lot of them are quiet now, waiting to see the details before they weigh in, if they weigh in at all. Dana?",

So, there will be a lot more that we can learn once this document is unsealed. But on Tuesday, as we wait for that, I mean, this will be just like any other arraignment. The former president will come in, he will self-surrender to the FBI, they will process him, and then he will appear before a judge here and be asked to enter a plea in this case. Now, the big question also here is what will that look like here? Will this be in the ceremonial courtroom? Will it be in the judges who randomly assign this case? Who will it go to? Will that be a Trump appointee? He's appointed a number of judges in this district. Will it be someone appointed by a Democrat? We just don't know yet how that's going to play out. But then he will make his appearance, as we saw in New York just a few months ago when he made that appearance in the state court, that was a big security undertaking. There were a lot of precautions that they took, but they tried to get him through the actual process, both through turning himself in and then actually going into the courtroom and going through that proceeding. They tried to do that as quickly as possible, given just the big security risk that he faces by being out there and then just kind of issues it causes to a city because of all the lockdowns and the security parameters that they take.

And then, usually, in an arraignment, you do get some additional discussion about what kind of discovery they have. So, sometimes you can learn a little bit something more about the evidence that they collected, how much of it is, how much they've turned over, so all these other little details that sometimes come out that we'll be looking for on Tuesday.

It's about any unauthorized person who knowingly removes with intent to retain at an unauthorized location, those are three points of the investigation, classified documents about the United States defense. And we've seen other cases involving government officials with the same charges, notably the airman up in Massachusetts, another air force suspect in Florida.

Other democracies, of course, have held their former leaders to account. But what does it say about America to have this moment? Well, what would it say about our country if we allowed laws to go unchecked? If we had a notion that people were above the law, if they were no longer the head chief officer in the country? And so, I'm focusing in that realm, but also, I'm going back to this moment that was also extraordinary. A former president's attorney was allowed to testify in the grand jury.

So, the fact pattern here is pretty specific.But nevertheless, when you are investigating this alleged activity, you have to look at it through that lens of, what did this person do and how does that conduct stack up against the law?

But it's a pattern of conduct here that has put him in this position so many times. That's incredibly unusual. And that's actually what really undercuts the argument from a lot of his allies that this is all just a grand conspiracy. You know, Donald Trump was president once. If he wanted to bring charges against any number of his political allies, if it were so easy, he could have done it, if their conduct created the environment to make that possible. I just think it's so difficult to get to this point where on so many different issues, Trump is facing real investigations, real charges, real criminal liability, and that is not going to be washed away by tweets or by political spin. The voters will ultimately decide.

Jack Smith is the special counsel. He has authority to make prosecutorial decisions and declinations. But under this statute, he will have to go to Merrick Garland, the attorney general, with this information. Attorney General Garland has the option to either agree with the decision or decide against it, at which point, Speaker McCarthy and Congress would have to be informed about the decision. So, this is not -- any talking point that suggests that there is somehow, I think Victorian guard is the word that Mr. Trusty used -- lead to the Imperial Army of the Roman Empire, as if Jack Smith is simply that part.
