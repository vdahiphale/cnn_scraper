A good strong gavel to end the week. He's got a lot of bells, but no gavels. Story of my life. One, two, three and there you are. That's the way the market looks, 654 points, a gain of one-and-a-half percent. Doesn't quite erase the losses of the last few days, but the rotation that was taking place, the prospect of lower interest rates, we'll talk about it in a second or two. The events of the day that you and I need to chew over. Lady Gaga, Celine Dion, a star-studded opening so many well and truly underway at the Paris Olympics. The Israeli prime minister is in Florida, he is meeting Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago. And rising prices reinvigorate -- I'm sorry I can't speak this morning -- an old favorite secondhand shopping. I refresh my wardrobe with the chief executive of Goodwill. You can see how our hour is going to be if we get to the other side of it. We are live in New York, Friday, July the 26th, start of the Olympics. I'm Richard Quest and I mean business. Now, the drama in Paris and the Olympic ceremony underway, only after I have updated you on the market, well, the Dow has just closed up more than 600 points, 654 points higher. And at the same time, the Fed's favorite measure of inflation, PCE, has slowed to two-and-a-half percent in line with expectations. It is all boosted the hopes of a September rate cut. Tech, which have been clobbered by the markets in recent days, rebounded as well. Paula Newton, we are still down on tech if you like, over the medium term.",

But also remember, Richard, we had GDP and GDP blew apart expectations, nearly double what was expected. The US economy growing 2.8 percent. And what does that mean? That means that Jay Powell, the Fed chair, may actually pull off something so incredibly historic here and that is to get that soft landing, that means he will have tamed inflation without inducing a recession.

And we didn't see that in the speech to Congress. We didn't see that in the meetings with Biden or before that meeting with Harris. And then when we saw that speech from Vice President Harris following her meeting, that seems to have changed things and triggered something inside Netanyahu. His traveling party was not happy with her remarks. We heard from an anonymous Israeli official earlier today saying that what she said was problematic. And then fast forward to what we just saw from Netanyahu there at Mar-a-Lago, echoing that, essentially saying that what she said, might have given Hamas an indication that there was daylight between Israel and the US. Richard, let's remind our viewers of what she said was essentially that the US commitment to Israeli security is ironclad, and that what we are seeing in Gaza is horrible and catastrophic and she said the war needs to end. There needs to be a ceasefire now. So these are not crazy concepts and yet this was something that they took issue with. Now, to what extent the US administration was able to move Netanyahu closer to getting a ceasefire or agreeing to a ceasefire because the US does believe that the ball is in Israel's court, that remains to be seen. What we know now, Richard, is that in the coming days, perhaps as early as Sunday, there will be another round of high level negotiations about the ceasefire.

And Richard, that is one of the biggest sticking points from what we understand. Harris said, in the first phase of this deal, the IDF needs to withdraw from population centers, so cities, and then in the second phase of the deal, they need to withdraw completely from Gaza. And we know that that is something that Netanyahu does not necessarily agree with because the day before in his speech to Congress, he says that that Israel needs to maintain security control over Gaza for the foreseeable future. So Richard, that it really is the main question, and then there's also some quibbling and discussion about the ratio of how many Israeli hostages to Palestinian prisoners and which prisoners could be released from Israeli prisons.",
