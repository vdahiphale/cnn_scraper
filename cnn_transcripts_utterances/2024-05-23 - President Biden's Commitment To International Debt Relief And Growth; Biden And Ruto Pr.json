A lot of topics that reporters tossed questions at the two leaders about, multiple questions about Haiti specifically. Biden was asked about the U.S. decision not to deploy troops there. The President of Kenya was asked about his decision to send troops in and to lead the effort to help rebuild Haiti after months of cataclysmic political situation there. Notably, President Biden was asked one question about Israel. He seemed a bit irritated at the question. I think it's fair to say, right, he was asked specifically if the United States had any evidence that would either prove or negate the ICC's issuing of warrants out for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, specifically over whether Israel has used famine in Gaza as a weapon of war. The President's saying that the White House has made its opposition to these warrants clear. He said, quote, It's simple, we don't think there's an equivalence between Hamas and Israel.",

But joining us now, let's talk to Judea Moore, senior policy fellow with the Center for Global Development. Judea, thank you so much for talking with us. Tell us a little bit more about this critical moment. Obviously, we're seeing huge shifts in Africa where the U.S. footprint there has been waning. The military footprint has been waning. The U.S. just kicked out of Niger. Chad as well. And Russia and China have really made some way in the continent. How do you see this time?",

But over the last 20 years, new and emerging powers have come into Africa, especially China, who's grown in influence. And so far as the U.S. is concerned, it seems as if every increase in China's influence has come at American expense. And so, the Biden administration came to power looking to strengthen and upgrade U.S. relationship with Africa. And we've seen that happen here. So, I think if you place the Kenya state visit within the context of that, this is just a continuation of what the Biden administration has tried to do in terms of shoring up American presence in Africa.",

Kenya remains one of China's biggest allies and partners on the continent. And I think the U.S. government has gone out of its way to say that it isn't trying to force African countries into that position where they have to make a choice between either the United States or China, because both the United States and China are important. And each of them has unique competencies that makes it sort of difficult for one to replace the other. But I think here, the Biden administration, from the leaders summit to now a state visit and the promise of if he wins the second term of a visit to Africa, I think the cherry on this would be that Biden, if he gets elected, reelected, sees through the reauthorization of AGOA. I think that strengthens the U.S. position vis-a-vis China, although because China spends so much on infrastructure, China is going to continue to be an important partner there.

But we still haven't heard from the former president. Now, there is an entire group of Republicans in his orbit who really hope that he will be gracious, that he will reach out to the former South Carolina governor. They believe that he really needs these kind of independent voters in the Republican Party who are looking for an alternative to Donald Trump. One of the most jarring numbers that I'm pointed to a lot by these Republicans. Who, again, are hoping that Donald Trump can make inroads with these voters is what happened in Pennsylvania after Haley dropped out.This is a critical swing state in 2024. It was critical in 2020 and in 2016. And 16.5% of Republicans, keep in mind, no independents, no Democrats, voted for Nikki Haley in that primary. That is an alarming number to people on the ground in Pennsylvania and to Republicans across the country who think that Pennsylvania is a must-win state.
