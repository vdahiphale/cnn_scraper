And Biden said, look, the program was necessary. He wanted it to give some people some breathing room, so there wouldn't be delinquencies and defaults in the wake of COVID.

But behind the scenes, officials were very much prepared for this outcome, which was in fact viewed as the most likely outcome that the - this conservative Supreme Court would strike this down.I'm told that the President this morning shortly after this decision came down, he got all of his senior aides together and he met for several hours in the Oval Office with those aides to finalize how exactly his administration is going to respond. And we're going to hear about those steps from the President at some point this hour. Now, the President made clear that he thought this program would have been a lifeline to 10s of millions of Americans. But he made clear that he is still going to continue to do what he can to provide that lifeline saying, \"I believe that the Court's decision to strike down our student debt relief plan is wrong. But I will stop at nothing to find other ways to deliver relief to hardworking middle class families. My administration will continue to work to bring the promise of higher education to every American.\" And the President today - expect him to also outline other steps that his administration has taken to try and address this issue of college affordability. His administration has raised the maximum Pell Grant, for example. He has also forgiven student loans for public service employees, stricken debt from individuals who attended for profit colleges. So he's going to lean on those steps and he's also, we're told, going to announce some new ones. We don't know exactly what those will be. But again, this impacts millions and millions of Americans, 26 million people had applied for this program. The White House says that they believe that as many as 40 million people would have been eligible for it. And again, that moratorium on student loan repayments also ends - those payments are going to come due in October. So this is a very urgent issue and we'll hear from the President shortly.",

So what the court is saying here in this case, in the opinion authored by Justice Gorsuch is that the First Amendment protects the right of individuals to not speak in a way that they don't want to, to not be compelled to speak by the state.Colorado says, you must take anybody who wants a - who wants a website. They tried this earlier with a bake shop, if you recall, and you must serve that that person, you must create the website. These websites, according to the court, in its view, have significant creative expression in them, there are about celebrating things and the like. And as a result, they can't - the state can't compel the speech of this individual in this case. And so that's sort of the essential part of the holding. It goes back to a long line of cases involving the First Amendment of compelled speech cases. Can you force a student to say this - to say the pledge of allegiance, right? Can the state require somebody to speak in a creative or verbal way and then this court - the court is saying the First Amendment prohibits the state from forcing them to do that on penalty of being put in educational program or being - or facing other types of penalties. And that's the issue, at least, for the majority. Now, as you know that there's a strong dissent that lays out their side, but that's what the majority at least is saying in this case.",

And the question about can the state compel somebody to speak, right, under the grounds of equal protection and say, well, people have a right to have access to websites that that websites created? Can you force a content creator to convey a message they don't agree with? And what the court said here was, this is a First Amendment case. This is not about discrimination. This is about the First Amendment. And there are reasonable disagreements on that. Justice Sotomayor says, no, this case is not about discrimination, it's about people having access to the services. And if they want this person's services, they should be able to get it regardless of what their background is, regardless of what their gender identity is or the like and it's all about how you frame it.

The simple question was and continues to be, does the President have the unilateral authority under The Heroes Act, to forgive the student debt, that's the question that was presented and that's the question that we got an answer to. I used to be a member of Congress, Congress is where the laws are made. And in this case, we had a law - have a law, The Heroes Act, and what the administration and what the President did was not under - was not allowed - is not allowed under The Heroes Act. If Congress today with the President wanted to do this, they could do it. When the Democrats controlled all of Congress and the White House, they could have done it. There's a way to do this.

My point is not to avoid saying that. My point is to clarify the discussion. This Supreme Court decision is about the law.Now, we can have a policy discussion, which I'm happy to engage in and I think it's a horrible idea to do this, why? Because I took out loans, many, many, many loans for law school, for grad school for undergrad. And you know what, it took me decades to pay them and I paid them myself. And I believe when I finished paying them, that I'm done. I don't want and a lot of Americans who paid their loans or paying their loans, they don't want to find out just when they thought they were done paying their loans off, no, you weren't because now you got to pay someone else's loans off. I mean, I don't know where individual responsibility went, but yes I think it's a bad idea. But I just want to be clear.",
