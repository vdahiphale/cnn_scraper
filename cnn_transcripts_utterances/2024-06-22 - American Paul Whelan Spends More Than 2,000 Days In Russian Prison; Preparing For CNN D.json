I'm Omar Jimenez in Washington.In an exclusive interview with CNN, detained American Paul Whelan is appealing for the White House to help him come back home. As he marks another milestone in a remote Russian prison camp, he's now been detained for more than 2,000 days -- that's five-and-a-half years. Whelan was arrested in Moscow back in 2018 on espionage charges he denies. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison. Now, the State Department says Whelan has been wrongfully-detained and telling CNN, \"2,000 days is far too long for Paul to be wrongfully-detained in Russia. Our hearts go out to Paul and his family, who feel the pain of separation in a way that very few people have experienced. CNN's Jenny Hansler joins me now, who's been reporting on all of this and has been speaking to Paul Whelan. So Jenny, I guess I know we've talked a little bit about it, but what else has he had to say at this point?",

He is calling on the U.S. government to do their utmost to bring both himself and Evan Gershkovich, the detained \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter, home. He says he does feel the U.S. government is taking his case seriously, but he wants them to take it more seriously. He wants them to take what he did describes as decisive action to bring him home.

Incumbent President Joe Biden and his Republican challenger, former President Donald Trump are taking very different approaches to how they prepare for this high-stakes face-off at least as of late. Sources from Trump's campaign, tell us the former president is taking maybe a less conventional approach, holding private and informal policy discussions with potential VP picks coming up with ways to answer questions about his criminal conviction and skipping mock debates altogether. In fact, today, he's not even doing debate prep, at least for now. Instead, he's hitting the campaign trail, holding a rally in Philadelphia tonight.

I would suggest that the moderators ass both candidates, the same questions. They're both incumbents with records to defend. And secondly, I would call on Judge Merchan to lift the gag order. So when the topic does turn to President Trump's conviction, he is free to explain why he believes that conviction is unjust, including his views of the judge and of the testimony at the trial because otherwise, it's not just that his rights are being deprived, that he's losing his First Amendment rights.

The vast majority of people in this country are locked up for murder and all of these crimes against American citizens are American citizens. And so to paint this -- to say there's a culture. There is not a culture. There are some criminal elements who are running rough shod. There's no culture south of the border that celebrates rape and that's the kind of stuff I hope Republican scream that from the rooftops that the Republican, we got one right here that thinks that Latinos have some passion for crimes against women.

HARRY LITMAN, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: Yes. I wasn't surprised. It would have been lunacy for the court to say, you can -- somebody who's been judged by a court to be a threat to a domestic -- someone he's domestically abused, can't have a gun denied from them. but the court was in a corner of its own making because they'd said two years ago, you have to find this precise analogue and it just didn't exist in history because of the way we have treated though its been relatively recent to have treated domestic abuse victims that way. Justice Thomas is the guy who wrote the opinion two years ago and he said, look, this is what we said then and it was consistent.

We're talking about the River Seine, where this iconic river will host the swimming portion of the triathlon and also the opening ceremonies.Of course, this is the first time that opening ceremonies in Olympic history have ever taken place outside of an Olympic stadium. So that's saying something. But this isn't a race that's has to do with sports. It actually has to do with cleaning up pollution levels, namely e. Coli, which have been too dangerously high for the athletes to actually swim in the river. We know that this has a lot to do with the rain that has fallen in France. In fact, anywhere across the country of France, we've had roughly between 120 percent to 200 percent above average rainfall over the past three months. And of course, that seeps down into the local estuaries, streams and eventually into the River Seine. And that can bring along certain pollutants with it as well. Now, despite authorities' best efforts, they've thrown $1.5 billion U.S. to help clean the River Seine for the upcoming Olympic games. But there are still reports of dangerously high e. Coli levels. Now, I asked some of the local residents and tourists on the street -- this is in the Trocadero (ph) leading up to the Eiffel Tower -- whether or not they would swim in the river -- the river themselves.
