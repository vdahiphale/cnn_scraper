I'm Ana Cabrera in New York.No suspects, no motive, and the FBI is now stepping in after a series of intentional, targeted attacks on electric substations in North Carolina. Now tens of thousands of people have no power and might not get it back until Thursday. Schools are closed, shelters are open, as crews race to get the lights and heat back on ahead of yet another cold night. Here's what we do know. The two substations were damaged by multiple rounds of gunfire on Saturday. Officials estimate the damage is probably in the millions. CNN's Whitney Wild leads us off. Whitney, what do you know about this investigation?",

      "sentences": "Well, at this point, police are saying very little. They are only saying, as you pointed out, that these two substations sustained gunfire. At one of the substations, a gate was taken off of its hinges. And, Ana, what they're saying, notably, is that they believe this was intentional, and that this was a deliberate criminal act. And what's notable, Ana, is when you look at the two substations, they're 13 miles apart, so it took effort to go from one to the other.That's about a 20 minute drive, at a minimum. So, certainly, that will be a significant reason that law enforcement is describing this as a -- again, a deliberate criminal act. Right now, there is a little bit of good news, because, here in Moore County, Duke Energy tells me that around 7,000 people have been able to get back online since last night. The number of people out of power here is hovering around 33,000. They are working around the clock. You can see these folks behind me working very, very hard to get this equipment back up and running. But it's, Ana, on because this was so significant. The damage was just so significant that this isn't like a snowstorm, where you can just pop things back up online in 12 hours, 24 hours. I mean, as you mentioned, millions and millions of dollars of very significant damage here. So it's going to take some time. Duke Energy saying that they're not going to be able to bring customers back online until about Thursday.",

I want to be very clear. Law enforcement has not described it like that. But this is something that the FBI would potentially look into as they descend on something like this, because what we have seen is the Department of Homeland Security warning, just recently as November 30. Ana, that attacks on critical infrastructure are possible, that there are lone wolf-style attacks that have potential to cause great damage. They're very concerned about individuals mobilizing to violence. We have seen other types of acts like that, so the Department of Homeland Security warning critical infrastructure, as well as schools, faith- based institutions, large gathering places, those are all places where people may seek to carry out their personal grievances or ideological beliefs and cause real damage, Ana.",

It's going down pretty sharply, getting awfully close to the 50 level that divides expansion and contraction. Some of the internals here were pretty negative. CEOs, they dimmed their views on hiring and on expansion. They also cut their sales outlook. Another survey out, National Association for Business Economics, they're projecting near zero growth next year, 0.3 percent. That is a big downgrade from above 2 percent. That was the forecast as of May. They see the unemployment rate going from 3.7 percent today to 4.5 percent, that translates to millions of jobs lost. Also, only 23 percent, less than one in four, expect a soft landing. Two words of caution here, though. One, these are surveys. These are forecasts. Reality sometimes differs, also timing. These surveys came out -- they were taken last month. New numbers in recent days show some reason for reason for cautious optimism, one, strong holiday shopping sales, two, that strong jobs report on Friday.",

We saw, of course, travel just plunge. This is the number of passengers screened by TSA -- plunged in 2020, bounced back big time last year. It's almost back to pre-COVID levels. One problem here, though, Ana, is, of course, going to be finding all those workers, because Friday's jobs report, it shows that we still have a -- we still have a worker shortage. So they may want to hire 4,000 to 6,000. Finding those workers is another matter.",

It's hard to predict where it will be.But, obviously, this is a problem when your child has a fever or if you're looking for Tamiflu. Obviously, that is a problem. Let's take a look at what's driving this. This map is really striking. You will see that nearly the entire United States has high or very high levels of the flu. To see a map like this, this early in the season is so, so unusual. Put on top of that the fact that RSV has been very high this season, and then put on that -- on top of that COVID is kind of creeping back up again. The numbers are still relatively low. But if you take a look at the week of November 26, there were 33,000 people admitted to the hospital with COVID in the U.S., 33,000. That is not a small number. That's a 27 percent increase over the week before. So, in other words, it's going in the wrong direction. We were sort of enjoying the benefits of having COVID numbers go down. And now they appear to be ticking back up a bit. And so this is really a problem. One thing I will say is that, if you're concerned about medication, please don't hoard. Even if it's for your child, don't hoard it. That will be bad karma that will come back to get you. Instead, get yourself vaccinated against the flu and COVID. That's what can really help -- Ana.",
