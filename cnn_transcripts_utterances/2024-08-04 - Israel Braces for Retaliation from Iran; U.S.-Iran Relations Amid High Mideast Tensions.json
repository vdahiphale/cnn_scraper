Seven countries were involved and 24 prisoners were delivered across borders including three Americans. I'll talk to Putin critic Bill Browder about who got the better end of the deal. Then Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has claimed victory in last week's elections. But the U.S. says his opponent is the actual winner.

I mean, this was seen by them as a deliberate provocation to precipitate a conflict that would ultimately probably bring in the United States into a direct confrontation with Iran. So they saw that in once Israel by killing Haniyeh killed off the ceasefire deal, which means that the Gaza war will go on.And it also decided to carry out the assassination in Tehran. And during the inauguration of an Iranian president, the new Iranian president, which meant that it deliberately wanted to humiliate Iran and also the Iranians saw this essentially as an attack on that inauguration itself. So it's put Iran in a very difficult position of needing to both retaliate, but also to establish deterrence against Israel. And at the same time also not react in a way that would play exactly into what they think Israel wants, which is a larger conflict.",

Last time around Iran and the United States engaged intensively during that two-week period between the Israeli attack in Damascus and the Iranian retaliation, and then the Israeli retaliation in order to manage and calibrate the Iranian response. This was all done through third parties.And all Iranians have not seen that. Obviously the United States, much like last time, either didn't know or can't contain Israel's impulse to escalate. And it doesn't have a say in restraining Israel. And so the United States -- whatever deterrence existed in Iranian attack last time in getting Washington much more engaged in managing Israel hasn't worked. What Iranians are now saying is that they clearly have to do something much more effective against Israel in order to achieve what they didn't achieve last time, which is to make Israel think twice before it escalates and to really assume that there's a cost to do that -- to the kind of action they took in Iran. What that might look like is I think is being debated between Iran, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and others, and is also subject of discussion behind the scenes with the United States. For instance, today the Jordanian foreign minister went to Iran with a specific message from both the king of Jordan and from the United States, which suggests that this is being discussed even between the United States and Iran.",

There's a problem militarily. But I think Vali is right, that there will be a multi-pronged operation, that this is very different from what happened in April, on that you'll see activity on multiple fronts.And because of Iran's missile arsenal, because of what Hezbollah has, they have reached what's known as overmatch, the inability of Israel to intercept or prevent all of those drones and missiles from hitting Israel. And the United States will have a critical role in being there militarily to intercept. Remember it played a huge role in intercepting more than 80 drones and six ballistic missiles in April. Israel will have to have the United States military on its side in order to prevent serious damage if Israel attacks -- Iran attacks.",

In fact, going after Haniyeh on the day of the inauguration of this president who wants to start negotiations with the United States essentially makes it extremely difficult. And the onus is, in some ways the view of Tehran is that the onus is on the United States to show that it can restrain Israel and prevent it from turning the conversation away from potential and possible negotiation to war. I mean, right now, this president was inaugurated. You would have said that this might create -- might have created some kind of momentum for preliminary conversations and instead, we're talking about a potential war between the United States and Iran as American warships are going to Iran and we may end up being in a very different place.

They're there to try to contain ISIS and the resurgence of ISIS.What Hassan Nasrallah, the head of Hezbollah, said, just this week when he threatened that this war is entering a whole new phase. And I think, you know, the guns of August is taking on a whole new meaning. And I think the question is, is anybody willing to step back? We saw when the U.S. assassinated Soleimani, Iran responded with missiles on U.S. forces. But at the same time sent messages to Washington. We want know no escalation in April, again, with the strikes by Israel on Iranian generals in Syria, and then the Iranian response on Israel. There was a sense that that was, you know, it was a tit-for-tat and no further. The question is whether this will end in a tit-for-tat exchange. Retaliation by Iran for Haniyeh's death and by Hezbollah for the death of its commander in Beirut, or will this continue to unravel at a time when there's no diplomacy and no one's really talking much about Gaza.

Why is it that the sanctions against Russia do not seem to have blunted some of Putin's ambitions? Part of it, I assume is that we do still let himself sell oil and natural gas, which is inevitable because otherwise it would -- oil prices will go to 200 and trigger a recession.But what's your perspective on the sanctions against Russia?

We've frozen most of the oligarchs' money in the West. Russian companies, government agencies, have all been blocked from the financial markets. They can't transfer money. A thousand plus companies have left Russia. It's a really painful, difficult, awful situation for Putin. But as you mentioned, there is one enormous truck size loophole in this whole sanction's regime, and that is, that while we're doing all this other stuff, we said we don't want to touch oil. And Russia sells between half a billion and a $1 billion a day in hard currency oil. And that money, that hard currency they're using to buy missiles from North Korea, drones from Iran. And they're using it to pay soldiers to go into battle. And so, we had this terrible dilemma, which is on one side we, the United States, Europe, everyone else, is somehow getting money to Russia to pay to kill Ukrainians. And then on the other side, we're having to give money to the Ukrainians to fight back. And as you say, if we -- if we ban the sale of oil altogether the oil price would go up and we have another inflation crisis. And so, we're stuck between a rock and a hard place because as long as Putin has the money from oil he's going to continue to conduct this war. And that's a very big dilemma.",

The election was considered by many the most consequential in years as incumbent President Nicolas Maduro has led the country down a path of increasing authoritarianism, repression, and economic ruin over the last decade.Before the results had even been formally released Maduro declared a decisive victory, a move that most observers have called blatant election fraud. Since then, thousands have taken to the streets to dispute the contested results. Many countries around the globe have called into question the results including the United States, which has formally recognized Maduro's opponent opposition leader Edmundo Gonzalez as the winner. My next guest has dedicated his career to fighting for freedom and democracy in Venezuela. Leopoldo Lopez is an opposition leader who spent more than three years in prison for leading protests against Maduro. He escaped the country in 2020 and has been living in exile in Spain ever since. Leopoldo, welcome. Pleasure to have you. Your own story as itself fascinating because you ran for president, disqualified. So, you know the mechanics here. What I'm puzzled by, help the world understand incredible opinion polls. The opposition was leading by 40 points against Maduro and yet Maduro claims to have one. How did they manage election fraud on this scale? LEOPOLDO LOPEZ, CO-FOUNDER, VENEZUELAN OPPOSITION PARTY VOLUNTAD POPULAR: So, thank you, Fareed. So, as you say, all of the opinion polls going to the elections were showing that there's going to be a landslide, 70-30. The energy of the election in the street also was talking that there was going to be a massive, massive park participation in favor of Edmundo Gonzalez. The exit polls of the day of the election all showed that it was 70- 30. But most importantly, all of the printouts from every single one of the 16,000 voting centers spoke, and it's printed, and then results are there 70-30 in favor of Edmundo Gonzalez. What Maduro did was to basically read out a different result and is trying to impose a massive fraud on the Venezuelan people's will.",
