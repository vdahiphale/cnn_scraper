I'm Jake Tapper.And we start today with our law and justice lead, and what could be a looming battle between special counsel Jack Smith and the judge overseeing Donald Trump's classified documents case, Judge Aileen Cannon. There already appears to be no love lost between federal prosecutors on Smith's team and Judge Cannon, who was appointed by Donald Trump, and whose performance has been questioned by legal observers. Cannon has been slow to make some decisions which happens to help Trump's delay strategy. And one of her major rulings in the investigation was overturned by a higher court. You might remember just a few days ago, prosecutors took the very unusual step of harshly lambasting her, suggesting that some of the judge's actions seemed based on a quote, fundamentally flawed understanding of the case, though one that has no basis in law or fact. Well, Judge Cannon's now firing back in a filing of her own, leaving one to wonder how far this back-and-forth might go and whether special counsel Jack Smith might try to get Judge Cannon removed from the case. CNN's Paula Reid joins us now. And, Paula, how is special counsel Jack Smith going to handle Judge Cannon's decision yesterday?",

Prosecutors can't go into a trial if they don't know how a judge is thinking about the law. And right now, they are asking the judge to decide whether she is going to let the Presidential Records Act factor into this case. That's at post- Watergate law that governs which records created during an administration belong to a president versus the government.Now, Trump is using this as one of his many defenses, arguing that these were, quote, personal records. The special counsel is asked Cannon to reject that. In that fiery late Tuesday night filing, they wrote, quote, the court should be aware at the outset the Trumps entire effort to rely on the PRA is not based in any facts. It's a post hoc justification that was concocted more than a year after he left the White House. The problem is, Jake, in her opinion yesterday, she didn't really answer the question. So they can't really appeal something she hasn't said or done. But as we get closer to trial, this issue, this question and many others will continue to come up. And if she does decide when they have to put forth their defenses, that she will let this in, then the special counsel can appeal. But at this point, she hasn't decided anything that can be appealed to the 11th Circuit.",

Also in the law and justice lead today, Donald Trump has for a long time now been inaccurately describing the January 6 prisoners as hostages, though he has not been specified to whom he's referring. Finally, though he did name one, although he spelled your name wrong, but be that as it may. Today on Truth Social, Mr. Trump singled out, Rebecca Lavrenz, saying, quote, she is one of Joe Biden's January 6, hostages. Now, prosecutors say that this woman roamed restricted areas of the Capitol on January 6, and a jury ever peers found her guilty of all four misdemeanor counts against her, misdemeanors. We've been examining all of these cases in a series we call \"Trump's January 6 Hostages\" because a whole bunch of them are not like Rebecca Lavrenz who was found guilty of nonviolent misdemeanors, a bunch of them engaged in violent felonies, such as, for example, Zachary Jordan Alam of Centreville, Virginia. Prosecutors say Mr. Alam leap through a broken window to get into the Capitol on January 6, he tried to kick in the door. He threw are red velvet theater rope from a balcony down at police guarding the rotunda in the House speaker's lobby, prosecutors say Alam walked up to Capitol police officers and shouted multiple times and apologies ahead of time for the language here, but he shouted at police officers, quote, I'm going to fuck you up. Again, he said this to law enforcement officers. Prosecutors say Alam punched the glass of the speakers lobby doors with his fist, pushing up against three officers. That's when another one of the rioters, a woman tried to climb through the window and that woman was Ashley Babbitt whom a Capitol police officer seconds later, and he was worried about protecting members of Congress from this angry, violent mob. This police officer shot and killed her in what was later deemed in the line of duty. Prosecutors say as Alam left that area, he yelled to fellow rioters that they, quote, need guns. Zachary Jordan Alam was arrested three weeks later in Pennsylvania. A jury found him guilty of all eight felony counts, including crimes involving assaulting police officers, plus three misdemeanors. Alam is supposed to be sentenced later this month. Once again, that is one of Mr. Trump's J6 hostages, whom he says he will pardon and release as president. Again, these are not hostages. They're criminals Here's video showing the other big story today. The moment one of 4.8 magnitude earthquake rattled than northeastern United States this morning.

This follows the IDF's release of its preliminary investigation, which highlights a series of mistakes behind those three airstrikes that took out three World Central Kitchen vehicles in Gaza earlier this week, killing seven.CNN's Jeremy Diamond has more on what were learning from Israel's internal findings as U.S. Secretary of State Blinken is calling for an independent investigation. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Six months into the war in Gaza, the Israeli military tonight delivering its most thorough and public admission of wrongdoing for killing civilians in Gaza. Four days after targeted air strikes killed seven aid workers, the Israeli military says several of its commanders violated military protocols and made errors in decision-making, leading to a fatal sequence of events. At 10:00 p.m. on Monday night, a World Central Kitchen aid convoy departs this pier on the Gaza coastline, heading south on Al Rashid Street. Twenty-eight minutes later, the Israeli military says its forces identified a gunman on top of with one of the aid trucks. As the convoy passes the World Central Kitchen welcome center, four additional WCK vehicles join the convoy, driving south along Al-Rashid and then east, arriving at a warehouse just off Salaheddin Street at 10:46 p.m. As aid pallets are unloaded at the warehouse, Israeli forces misidentify a bag slung over one of the passengers shoulders as a weapon, and soon Israeli commanders make a deadly and false assumption that the car is accompanying the trucks are not part of the aid convoy, but rather carrying Hamas militants. World Central Kitchen had cleared the convoy, including the cars with the military, but the Israeli military says the commanders involved in the strikes had not seen that information. As three vehicles carrying the seven WCK workers leave the warehouse heading south on Al Rashid Street, Israeli commanders give the order to strike. The first vehicle is hit at 11:09 p.m. and Israeli military official says, some of the passengers survive fleeing into the next vehicle. But two minutes later, an airstrike hits that vehicle a half-mile down the road at 11:13 p.m., a third missile hits the final vehicle. In just four minutes, seven members of the World Central Kitchen team are dead international uproar ensues, triggering the most comprehensive Israeli military investigation into its deadly actions in Gaza to date. In the statement, the Israeli military said, the investigations, findings indicate that the incident should not have occurred. Those who approved the strike were convinced that they were targeting armed Hamas operatives and not WCK employees. The strike on the aid vehicles is a grave mistake stemming from a serious failure due to mistaken identification, errors in decision-making and an attack contrary to the standard operating procedures. General Herzi Halevi, the IDF's chief of staff, dismissing to Nahal brigade officers involved in the incidents. Colonel Nochi Mendel, the brigade chief of staff, and an unidentified major serving as the brigade fire support officer. Three others are formally reprimanded. Colonel Yair Zuckerman (ph), the Nahal brigade commander, Brigadier General Etze Cohen (ph), the division commander, and General Yaron Finkelman, head of Israel southern command. In a statement, World Central Kitchen called the disciplinary actions important steps, but said without systemic change, there will be more military failures, more apologies and more grieving families, calling for an independent commission to investigate the killings.

The memorandum of understanding that President Biden issued just a few weeks ago applies to all countries to which we provide defense assistance and so that's the mechanism that's in place. But at this point, we have to remember that Israel was attacked on October 7, as you know. What Bianna said in the -- in your conversation with her just a few moments ago, is absolutely accurate.
