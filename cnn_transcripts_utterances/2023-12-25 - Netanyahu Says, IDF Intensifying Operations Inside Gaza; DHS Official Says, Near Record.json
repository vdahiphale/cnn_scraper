You have, as you mentioned, at least 70 people dying on Christmas Eve in Gaza in the latest Israeli expansion of their military operation, now that they essentially say they have operational control of Northern Gaza for the most part after dismantling a massive Hamas tunnel complex, they're now moving their operation to Central Gaza and Southern Gaza.And what that means, unfortunately for people, is that they might get notices, being told that they have to move yet again. A lot of these families, 80 percent of those who live in Gaza, 80 percent of more than 2 million people are already displaced. And some of them have had to move twice, even three times or more. And now they have to move again in order to avoid a potential death in an Israeli airstrike. And well over 20,000 people have died so far, according to the Hamas- controlled health ministry. The one Christmas miracle today is that we do have beautiful weather after several days of thunderstorms and chilling, intense rain, cold wind, the kind of conditions that just make it miserable for you if you're living out in the elements. At least today in Gaza, the sun is shining, and hopefully people can find some semblance of comfort in that, even though everything else about life is extraordinarily difficult right now for them.",
