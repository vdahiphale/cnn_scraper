Parts of New York set rainfall records.I'm Kate Bolduan, with Sara Sidner. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. This morning, another surprising twist coming out of Russia. Mercenary boss Yevgeny Prigozhin hasn't been seen in public since the attempted mutiny, but, get this, the Kremlin now says the Wagner boss sat down with Russian President Vladimir Putin just days after he tried to overthrow him. The roughly three-hour meeting was held on June 29th. That is according to the Kremlin, five days after Prigozhin's short- lived rebellion. For weeks, though, Putin and the Kremlin have really been dodging questions about Prigozhin's whereabouts. And now you can add another question to the mix, what is Putin trying to signal now? CNN's Fred Pleitgen has the very latest for us. He's joining us now. Fred, what more is Russia saying about this and what is your read on it?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think the first and most important read, Kate, is that everybody who's been monitoring reporting about this probably getting whiplash right now trying to find out where Yevgeny Prigozhin is and also what his status is as well. But certainly I think one of the things that we can read into this is that Yevgeny Prigozhin and the Wagner mercenary group are extremely important to Vladimir Putin, extremely important to Russia's war in Ukraine and on the battlefield. And that's probably why that meeting took place. And it only took place about five days after that mutiny happened. Yevgeny Prigozhin was able to go into the Kremlin.Now, some of the things that we're hearing from that meeting, which are coming from the Kremlin, from Dmitry Peskov, the spokesman for the Kremlin, are quite interesting, where apparently Vladimir Putin came out and gave his assessment of what the Russians call their special military operation, but also all the mutiny itself. And then there was a little side sentence in what he said. He said, he talked about possible future use of the Wagner group and battlefield deployment. So that could indicate that possibly Wagner is back in the game. Certainly that could be a really interesting development because there's so many things that are unclear. The Kremlin itself has said that Yevgeny Prigozhin was going to go to Belarus. Then Belarusian Leader Alexander Lukashenko told our own Matthew Chance that he wasn't actually - Prigozhin wasn't actually in Belarus, that he was actually still in St. Petersburg, in Russia. So, it seems as though, for now, it appears as though Yevgeny Prigozhin is still in Russia, but it's unclear how much control he could retain over Wagner if any. And not just Wagner, of course, on the battlefield in Ukraine, but all of its other assets like, for instance, the dealings that he has in Africa and in the Middle East as well, Kate. A huge development potentially.",

So, this is what Charles likes to do. He likes to bring together, with his convening power, senior figures on particular issues. And on this issue it is, of course, climate change. So, we're finding out that they're having a discussion about climate change inside. And I think it's going pretty well, Sara, because they're running late. These are two men that clearly get on. But there is a real tension at the moment in the U.S., U.K. relationship, if I can call it that. There -- here we call it the special relationship because the U.S. is such a key ally for the United Kingdom. That tension really comes from Ukraine and how the two countries have slightly different views on the way the U.S. is handling it. Cluster bombs is one issue. The U.K. doesn't support the U.S. sending cluster bombs to Ukraine. So that's really setting up the scene going on to the NATO summit. But, at the moment, they're discussing an issue which both men really care about, which is climate change.

Now, the Kremlin saying that Prigozhin met with Putin for hours and it was just five days after the attempted mutiny. I mean what do you think this means? A sign of weakness or a sign of strength for -- that we're hearing this from the Kremlin? KURT VOLKER, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO NATO: Well, I think what it shows is that Putin actually was very concerned that he was in a much weaker position than he realized. And the fact that Prigozhin could launch a rebellion like that, get as far as he did, has actually, I think, shook Putin a little bit. And this is why I think he wanted to try to re-establish control, get Prigozhin back on side, and then maybe see what he has to do to retain that support from the power sources in Russia, the military, the intelligence services, to try to keep it together.",

And like everyone else, you were saying -- you were kind of questioning if Putin really could survive it if he didn't take Prigozhin on directly.So, this seems like such a surprising turn of events that then five days later, you know, the -- he has -- he's sitting down with Prigozhin.

And we don't want to turn Russia's war against Ukraine into a NATO war against Russia.But we do need to send a very clear signal to Vladimir Putin that Ukraine will become a member of NATO. His effort to extinguish Ukraine and to disrupt European security is going to fail, and that we are serious about protecting security in Europe in the future.

But that being said, I think we have to start thinking about the long-term. NATO's job, its only real job, is the security and defense of its members. And we've seen that with Ukraine outside and a few other countries outside, these gray zones that are there in Europe, that has been an invitation to violence in Europe.

The high risk, that is a rare level four of four from the Weather Prediction Center has now been extended further south to include all of south central Vermont. And, look at this, we have flash flood warnings encompassing much of the state. In fact, some of those actually tagged with a flash flood emergency in and around the Ludlow region. We have a stationary band of rainfall moving across the area. So it's training over the same regions, allowing for those inch to an inch and a half rainfall totals that we've been experiencing. So the potential here for a half a foot of additional rainfall still exists as this kind of convergence of moisture starts to really move into northern New England. Now, we had impressive rainfall totals across eastern Pennsylvania and into southern New York, across the Hudson Valley. Six to 10 inches of rain where that one in 1,000 year event actually took place. Just incredible amount of precipitation for West Point, New York.

Molly Ball.Molly, thank you for being here. Can we just quickly talk about the fact that this presidential caucus in Iowa is happening a bit earlier than it normally does. Does that even matter? MOLLY BALL, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"TIME\": Probably not. You know, we've seen this calendar go through this kind of churn. Every cycle there's a bit of a dance between the early states. But, you know, I think if you zoom back on what Harry is talking about in the last few cycles, and the lack of sort of a predictive power, particularly for Iowa, really on both sides, I think we've seen a diminishment of the early states overall as this primary becomes more and more nationalized. You know, so many voters these days, especially the types of highly engaged voters who vote in presidential primaries, are tuned into the national news. They're watching CNN. They're watching national cable news. They're getting their news from national sources. And so there aren't necessarily paying as much attention to, you know, which candidate went to the pizza ranch in my town or which candidate, you know, appeals to voters like me on local issues specifically. I think we're just seeing a declining influence of all the early states.",

You know, I mean he maybe could have said this in the first couple of weeks of his candidacy when we didn't have a robust array of polls showing just how far behind he is both nationally and in those early states. But at this point, it's a very strongly evidence-backed claim, and, as you mentioned, you know, some of his own allies have noted it. He simply is pretty far behind Trump at this point. Now, that doesn't mean he can't make it up. That doesn't mean he's dead in the water.And, you know, I think in a lot of significant ways this remains a two-man race. He remains the only candidate in strong position to take down Trump. None of the other candidates who are not named Trump have come this close. But he hasn't built on his lead. He hasn't broken out. He hasn't managed to have a sort of viral moment that I think would stick in people's minds and really show them why he ought to be considered in that top tier. And so you can understand the frustration but, you know, I just don't think it's going to get far blaming the media when we have so much evidence to support this fact.",
