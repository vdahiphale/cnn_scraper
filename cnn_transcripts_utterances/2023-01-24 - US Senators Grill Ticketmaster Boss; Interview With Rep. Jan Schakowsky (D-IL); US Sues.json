It was actually down earlier by the way, more than 300 points. Now, you can see it's in the green already up about 150 points. Those are the markets and these are the main events: US Senators accuse Ticketmaster owner, Live Nation of running a monopoly at a hearing on Capitol Hill. The US Justice Department wants to break up Google's ad business, claiming it unfairly stifles competition. And Germany appears ready to send tanks to Ukraine after months of debate with NATO Allies. Coming to you live from New York. It is Tuesday, January 24th. I'm Zain Asher, in for my colleague, Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Good evening. Tonight, there appears to be bad blood between US lawmakers and the head of America's biggest ticket seller. Obvious, not so subtle reference to a Taylor Swift song, we couldn't help ourselves here. Senators grilled CEO Joe Berchtold over Live Nation's market dominance. His company has been fiercely criticized for mishandling Taylor Swift's upcoming concert tour. The ticket sales last November left millions of fans angry and out of luck. Berchtold apologized for it at the time, and again, now. He said the company's Ticketmaster service was overwhelmed by bots. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And secondly, it has managed to bridge the partisan divide in Washington. Listen to what Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said about that issue. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT): Mr. Berchtold, I want to congratulate and thank you for an absolutely stunning achievement. You have brought together Republicans and Democrats in an absolutely unified cause. Unfortunately, your approach today in this hearing is going to solidify that cooperation because as I hear and read what you have to say, it's basically it's not us, it is everyone, but us.

TheLive Nation executive, you know, he was blaming bots, he was even blaming cyberattacks. He did apologize to the fans. Now, I think all of this raises questions about what can be done here. One solution that was floated is the idea of making these concert tickets and sporting events tickets nontransferable to cap some of the prices, but a lot of people think the issue here is competition or lack thereof. And on that front, you have to wonder whether or not today's hearing gives the Justice Department political cover to file an antitrust lawsuit against Live Nation, much like the antitrust lawsuit that was just filed today against Google. Another idea that was mentioned today, Blumenthal, he said, maybe the Justice Department should just unwind the 2010 merger between Live Nation and Ticketmaster that formed this ticket behemoth in the first place. Effectively, the DOJ would be saying and I have to do one more Taylor Swift pun here, effectively, they would be saying, I knew you were trouble when you walked in.",

So what are the solutions here, do you think? When you have, you know, this fiasco caused in part, there were obviously other issues at play, but in part by market dominance by this one company who sort of gobbled up other elements of competition, what is the solution, do you think, Jan? REP. JAN SCHAKOWSKY (D-IL):\tWell, there are a number of solutions to a number of problems that we see with Ticketmaster, but clearly when you have monopolies, and that's why the reason that we don't want to see this concentration, then it leads right to price gouging. That's what we're seeing. And the other thing, they hide what the real costs of that Ticketmaster additionally adds. So someone might be trying to get a ticket, let's say it's $30.00 or as much as $50.00 which for many consumers is a big deal. It isn't until the end of the transaction, that they find out that, you know, there may be 50 percent or more added to that cost in order to complete the transaction. Ticketmaster apparently, acknowledged that this was a problem in the hearing today in the Senate. But you know, the bots problem that is that, you know, these bots can go online and just swallow up. We passed a Bots Act in 2016, and yet, Ticketmaster has no inclination to be working with the Federal Trade Commission to stop these bots from buying up all the tickets and that is where we got into the Taylor Swift issue. But you know, right now, 93 percent of the tickets bought for football games, the NFL, are through Ticketmaster. And that, you know, a large, number 87 percent, when it comes to basketball. So we see that consumers are really placed in a very bad position, and let me just add one other thing that Ticketmaster also owns a number of the venues, and they are very punishing to some of the artists as well.",

And so we need to as a Congress insist -- insist. And so, the beginning of December, a bipartisan group wrote to Ticketmaster and said, we want a clear briefing on what exactly you're doing.

Now the allegations here are that it, first of all, bought up rivals, pressured publishers and advertisers to use its technology. So illegal domination of the market, but also that it just simply owns too many pieces of the digital advertising ecosystem. So first of all, it owns the technology used by major website publishers to offer ad space. Secondly, that it owns the tools used by advertisers to then go buy that space. And then thirdly, that it owns the largest automated ad exchange that essentially link the two together. So it says this dominance is unfair in the market. And as you say, it makes it far too expensive for advertisers. It means website publishers aren't receiving enough money, and it is a very interesting case in terms of its huge -- given, it's the DOJ -- and it is going to be looking at antitrust, I think much, much more with these Big Tech giants. It is a very different area than it was just ten, twenty years ago. Anticompetition has gotten incredibly complicated given the domination of these Big Tech players in the market.",

That's the statement we've had from Google. I'm sure they will fight this.

For instance, you take last week, when we had that massive strike by a Russian missile on a building in Dnipro, the deputy head of the presidential administration, Timoshenko, he was the one who was sent over there to make sure that the rescue and recovery efforts were going as planned, but also, of course, to show face for the administration here in Kyiv. So clearly, he is also not exempt. Now, as we recall, all of this started with the arrest of a top level official for embezzlement last week, and that really set off this cascade of people resigning, of people being pushed out of office as well, and it is not only about the government in Kyiv, it is also regionally as well. There were some regional governors, who have also been told that they will have to resign or will be pushed out of office. For instance, for the Dnipropetrovsk region, a big region right in the center of Ukraine, the Kherson region as well, which of course right now is so important after the Ukrainians managed to push the Russian forces out of large parts of Kherson. The European Union has now also come out and said that they praise the government here in Kyiv, saying it shows that Kyiv and the Zelenskyy administration that they take fighting corruption very seriously. Also, a senior adviser to the presidential administration, he came out and he said all of this shows that Volodymyr Zelenskyy understands the pulse of the people.
