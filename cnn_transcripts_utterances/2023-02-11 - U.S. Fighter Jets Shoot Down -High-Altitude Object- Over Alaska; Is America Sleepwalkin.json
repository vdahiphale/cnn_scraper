On Friday, President Biden gave the order to shoot down a, quote, high-altitude object hovering 10 miles off the coast of Alaska. Of course, last Saturday fighter jets shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon in the Atlantic Ocean after flying across the entire country.Joining me now to discuss is Retired Air Force Lieutenant General David Deptula. He was the Air Force's first Chief of Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance. He's a fighter pilot with more than 3,000 flying hours. He was the principal attack planner for the Operation Desert Storm Air Campaign, Commander of no-fly operations over Iraq in the 90s and served on two congressional commission's focused on America's future defense strategy. These days, he's the dean of the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies. General, thanks so much for coming back to the program. So what is NORAD responsibility? And what's the framework through which it determines a course of action? LT. GEN. DAVID DEPTULA, U.S. AIR FORCE (RET.); DEAN, MITCHELL INST. FOR AEROSPACE STUDIES: Well, Michael, it's good to see you again. It's been quite a week for the commander of North American Air Defense Command. Essentially, their responsibility is to provide aerospace warning, ensure air sovereignty, and then protect the Canadian airspace as well as the continental United States. So they've certainly had their hands full in these past two weeks.",

And that this object that was shot down yesterday was about 25,000 feet lower than the Chinese balloon that entered U.S. airspace about two weeks ago. So that puts it at about 40,000 feet. And that makes it a possible collision hazard for commercial airliners. So that was the logic for shooting it down once it was identified as being uninhabited. SMERCONISH",

But when you think about it, airliners fly, what are known as great circle routes. So when you have airline traffic going from the East Coast of the United States, say over to anywhere in Asia, Japan, China, Australia, Thailand, India, they head over Alaska.So it is a concern that any object flying in that airspace, particularly if it's not controlled, like it appears this one wasn't. Quite frankly, the classification of this object is pretty quizzical. Because first there has been no indication of its origin. Second, it was described in the short news conference that the Pentagon had is not resembling an aircraft. But then again, they didn't confirm that it was a balloon. So it will remain an unidentified flying object until we get further verification of what it might have been.",

So whether there's a concern about the impact on elections or not, it's hard to see how in a democracy like the United States, we get billions and billions and billions of dollars being spent on political campaigns, with hundreds of millions of people participating at the polling place, how a small dollar wager or forecast would negatively affect. In fact, I would say, Michael, that it's a positive impact. Because the studies show that these people who have a little bit of skin in the game, whether it's a sporting event or a political event, they pay more attention to the political news. And they are more likely to be able to filter out fake news, which is a much bigger threat to our democratic process than tiny predicted. SMERCONISH: John, is there anything to be learned from these markets? I want to put a couple of things up on the screen. First of all, let's talk about the GOP 2024 nomination fight. Like the polls that I've seen say that right now, in a multi-candidate field, it's like Trump at about 50 and DeSantis at 25 to 30. But in your market, it's 37 cents and they're deadlocked. Now I'm going to put up another one. Which party wins the presidency in 2024? Democrats, 51 cents, Republicans 50. And finally, 2024 presidential election winner Joe Biden, 34 cent. Now look, DeSantis ahead of Trump, 29 cent versus 26 cent. The pollsters, you know, do modeling, right? The pollsters want to make sure that they've got demographic balance, geographical balance, gender balance, I don't know who's betting on this site.

But it takes it away, even as the landscape changes, it still matters that virtually every NFL game and every one of importance is on broadcast television. It's more broadly accessible. For some people it's an obsession. For others it's a passing interest. There are some who have turned away of the game because of its undeniable brutality. And there's a larger number that recognize it, but somehow they make their peace with it. And that includes many people who cover the game. They can't help but know the reality of what it does to a very large percentage of its long-term participants but there's a draw to it.

It would have kept me unemployed for six months. And I agreed to it. I thought I had to. I also thought it was the cost of being a radio host or a television personality. But like the president, I have since come to realize that non-competes are much more pervasive than just among media folk. Those 30 million Americans that the president referenced in his State of the Union, they included CEOs and construction workers, hospitality employees, chefs. I even had a guy call my SiriusXM radio program this week and tell me he was subject to one as a New Jersey gas station attendant. [15:45:02] But as the president also said, the Federal Trade Commission is now proposing banning all non-compete clauses and rescinding all existing ones saying they hurt workers and competing businesses.

And if you're a worker, you know, you probably don't know what the state law is on your non-compete clause and your employment contract. And that means is that those clauses, even though they're unenforceable, can have the same effect of chilling workers from looking for new jobs, looking for better pay, looking for better working conditions, and ultimately be productive workers for our economy. So we do think a federal rule that's very clear will have a major impact for workers.There was a recent Ipsos poll that said that two in five Americans who were polled would be more likely to switch jobs if this rule were enacted. That's a huge, huge impact. The other thing that's important to know is, you know, labor markets aren't confined to one state or the other. So if we really want to see the important impacts, and I should say they are important, we estimate that wages could increase by $250 to $300 billion if non-compete clauses were banned. If we want to see those kinds of impacts for workers, we have got to ban them.",
