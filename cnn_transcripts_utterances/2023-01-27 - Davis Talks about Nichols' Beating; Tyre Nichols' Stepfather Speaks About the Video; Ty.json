And that they propped his son up and then used expletives when he slumped over. So, here is some of this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RODNEY WELLS, TYRE NICHOLS' FATHER: He said, what did I do? Why are y'all doing this to me? What did I do? And they proceeded to snatch him out of the car and was trying to wrestle him to the ground. And he got scared. So, he was athletic enough to get out of their situation and run. And he was trying to run home because we were -- he was three blocks from the house when they stopped him. So, after the initial encounter, we didn't see everything because actually when the body cam started they were already engaged. And then there was the second body cam with the sky cam that videoed the encounter. And when I saw the police officer -- you know they have this little like stick, this metal thing that they pull out.",

I saw some fire department people come out there and they just walked around. Nobody showed him any aid. And they're supposed to be trained in first aid. By the time the paramedic truck pulled up, this is when we couldn't see anything because the paramedic truck blocked the camera.
