This week, we're devoting time to the worst flare-up of violence in the Balkans in decades, as an uneasy piece between Serbia and Kosovo appears resistant to efforts by the United States and E.U. to de-escalate and normalize the situation. This goes back to the 1990s when the United States and its allies helped liberate Kosovo, a province of Serbia, after decades when its Muslim majority were literally under the boot and the gun of the minority Serbian population. The latest trigger came after Serbia moved thousands of troops to the joint border last week, following a shoot-out that killed both Serbs and Kosovars. Last night on this program, we hosted the Serbian president for an exclusive interview. And Aleksandar Vucic told me they don't want war. They don't want to invade Kosovo and they're moving forces back from the border as the U.S. demanded. So far though, Washington says it can't confirm that withdrawal. Vucic also told me that he would hold the instigator to account. And today, Belgrade announced that they detained the Kosovo Serb politician who admitted that he planned and took part in the incident. But the U.S. and the E.U. also want Kosovo to do its part to normalize their volatile Balkan region. So, tonight, my exclusive guest is Kosovo's president Vjosa Osmani.

First of all, there's clear video evidence when it comes to the trainings that have been taking place within Serbia, in the military bases of Serbia, organized by the army of Serbia for these terrorist groups. Secondly, the weapons that we have confiscated show that they have been introduced as recent as six weeks ago in the military bases of Serbia. So, these are not the kind of weapons that are used by ordinary citizens but only by the state, only by the army. And thirdly, Radoicic, the criminal who was arrested today, of course, if we look at his connection with Serbia's president, Vucic, he has been his closest partner in destabilizing the rest of the Western Balkans for quite some time. He is a guy that is in the blacklist of the United States and the United Kingdom, but he participates in meetings of the National Security Council of Serbia, sitting on the right-hand side of the President Vucic. So, now, they are hiding behind Radoicic in a cowardly way. But we have very clear evidence, which will be published in the days to come off direct orders coming from Vucic.",

Serbia does not have a good track record when it comes to delivering justice. There hasn't been a single case where the criminals that have committed war crimes and genocide in Kosovo and Bosnia actually were put in front of justice. Secondly, there is only one constructive party in that dialogue, and that has been the Republic of Kosovo, which has implemented over 99 percent of its obligations from these 12 years. It's exactly the opposite what Vucic has been doing. As he stated in your interview, he says, I'm ready to negotiate. But in fact, he never implements, he never walks the talk. There's a very long list of obligations that he has taken aboard as Serbia since 2011, you've mentioned diplomacy, you've mentioned the rest. In 2013, Serbia committed to dissolve all illegal structures, parallel structures in the north. What happened in that they got strengthened and turned into a gang. A Transatlantic criminal group that is now committing terrorist actions in an act of aggression in Kosovo by the order of Serbia.

REP. ELISSA SLOTKIN (D-MI): Yes. I mean, look, Michigan, the state that I'm from, we have a huge Albanian American population. So, we are very focused on what's been going on recent events. And, I mean, look, we want both sides to come to the table. I am really concerned with some of the Serbian activities in the past couple of weeks. I put out a statement to that effect, and it's obviously, you know, no one want to be rehashing history in that part of the world given our history there. But you know, it is the process.

The system -- so, what happened was, as we created this system of mass incarceration and mass supervision, this happens at the sametime as a major taxpayer revolt in the United States, we start to reduce social services and support, we certainly don't want to raise taxes to pay for somebody to be on probation, to pay for somebody to go to prison. So, we're trying to do all this tough on crime stuff on the cheap, as elected officials. And a natural outgrowth of that is to charge people to go to jail, to charge people to have a public defender, to charge court fees and to charge people to be on probation and parole. So, now, you're taking this group of folks that wasn't really making it all that well to begin with and saying, you got pull extra money out of your pocket to be able to pay for your probation. And when I interview probational officers about this, they hate it, right? They hate having to chase people around for money and how much of their time goes into strategizing, how to get the money out of this person. So, they're doing things like showing up on the days that checks arrive before the guy's wife and children get a chance at that check.",

So, imagine instead of having a bunch of bureaucrats follow people around and have them pee in a cup and violate them for noncriminal acts, if we put that into drug treatment or put them into jobs or put them into housing, I think that when you talk to the public about things like this and even a lot of elected officials, they can see that there could -- it could be a reasonable trade-off here. Not when you just do nothing, but when you do something but that that something makes more sense. When I interviewed for my job with Mayor Bloomberg, that's exactly the conversation I had. I said, imagine I came to you with $80 million, which was my budget, and you know, 30,000 troubled and troubling souls and said, do whatever you want to fix this problem. I'm pretty much what you wouldn't do is run out and hire a bunch of civil service protected, disinterested bureaucrats to have them meet with them for five minutes, you have a caseload of 100 people, five minutes would be a lot to meet with them once a week. I'm pretty much you wouldn't do that. They said, no, I wouldn't do that. I said, well, I'm betting -- I went to your probation department, I'm betting that's what you got right now. And he looked over at his deputy mayors and they said, that's pretty much what we got. And so, it (INAUDIBLE), it just doesn't make sense. I mean, you get a few minutes with most elected officials, they're kind of with you on that one. It's different than prison. This is -- and I'm not saying all the people in prison believe -- need to be there. But in prison, at least you have incapacitation that you're buying. You're not buying that with probation and parole. These folks are walking around on the street today without enough resources to make it and we're spending a ton of money on curfew violations. It just doesn't make sense. And a lot of politicians when they hear it, they believe it.",
