The Fox News viewers won't get to hear it because it's monitored. We looked at -- say, we checked the Fox News website last night. There was no mention of it on their homepage.

And just having them be in court, to me, felt like a little bit of a level of accountability. Their media analyst, Howie Kurtz, did end up covering it towards the end of the trial. He said in the beginning, he wasn't allowed to.But to your point about not making an apology, you know, the thing that actually makes me more upset is they don't have to issue any corrections or any retractions. In a journalistic entity, if I get something wrong, I have to correct it. That's the way that it goes. But to your point about what are the broader implications here, you have to remember, Fox is facing many defamation suits. It's not just Dominion. They have a suit from Smartmatic. They also have a suit with one of their own producers that's suing them, claiming that they misled her during testimony. And so what happens is when you settle a case like this, you're setting a precedent for how you legally are going to likely need to handle all of the other cases. In this case, we know that what they're willing to do is pay up in order to make sure their execs never have to face a trial. You can best believe that Smartmatic, who's, by the way, their lawsuit is much bigger than Dominion's, it's going to leverage the discovery that they found during the Dominion hearing to strengthen their case and they're going to leverage the fact that Fox just made a huge payout to a different competitor when they're trying to negotiate for their settlement, if they do.",

And what we're learning is that these teenagers were in an a parking lot of a grocery store, which is basically used as a carpool spot because they travel hundreds of miles round trip just to have these practices to compete nationwide. And one of the cheerleading girls got out of her friend's vehicle, there were four of them in the car, tried to go into what she thought was her car, opened the front door in the passenger seat as a person she didn't recognize, she kind of freaked out, went back to the friend's.

They exposed a blunt U.S. assessment of the war in Ukraine, as well as details on U.S. intelligence collection on allies. They also revealed advancements that we've just learned about in The Washington Post today, serious advancements in Chinese spying military operations, including, according to The Post, that the Chinese military could soon deploy a high altitude spy drone that travels at least three times the speed of sound. Let's talk about this hearing and what questions he has with Senator Angus King of Maine. He serves on the Intelligence and Armed Services Committees. He and other senators will receive a classified briefing on these leaked documents today. Well, Senator good morning. I bet you have a whole lot of questions, and I wonder what the top ones are. SEN. ANGUS KING (I-ME):  Well, first, let me with two disclaimers. One is I haven't yet had any classified briefings on this, so I'm not talking about anything that's not in the public domain. Secondly, this young man has been charged. He hasn't been found guilty. So, we got to be careful about assuming guilt. However, having said that my principal question is how in the world did a 21-year-old National Guardsman have access to this level of top secret information? One of the classifications is called TS SCI. That's just about the highest classification TS stands for top secret, SCI, secure compartmented information. That means there are people, for example, in the CIA that can't even see it. You're only supposed to be able to see that information if you have a need to know it in some operational sense. So, there's no way to sugarcoat it. This is a really serious breach, and it also shows a serious gap in the structure of our intelligence organization.",

I think we should have a public hearing.But, again, here's the real danger here. The term is sources and methods. The information that's become public is bad in many ways, it's not a good thing to have this out in the public and among our adversaries, but the other problem is it can compromise how we got the information. In other words, if we learn something, they can take the fact that we know and reverse engineer and say, oh, here's how they got that. And that can compromise people's lives.

That's why there are sort of two levels of problems here. One is the content itself. But the second is compromise of what's called sources and methods, which can put lives at risk.",

How did this fellow get a security clearance? He had to have some level of security clearance. The question then is -- we've done a lot of work on security clearances. The question is, would this -- should this -- have been his proclivity to do this, should it have been picked up? And that's really hard to determine if he was just showing off for his buddies, which is what it looks like. I don't know that any kind of security clearance process would have picked that up.
