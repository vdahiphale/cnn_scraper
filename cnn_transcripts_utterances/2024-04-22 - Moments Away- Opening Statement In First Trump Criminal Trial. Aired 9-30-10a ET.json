They are trying to figure out ways to keep him on the campaign trail, keep him interfacing with voters, even if that means keeping him local to New York and various areas like outer boroughs, Staten Island, places that he won in the election or at least is more popular. Now, what we did see was a politically motivated stop at a Harlem bodega last week that was celebrated by his team. But then they were dealt a blow in North Carolina when he had a rally that was canceled because of weather. And when you talk to these senior advisers, some of them insist that this is going to help Donald Trump in the long run, that being in court, people are going to see that this is unfair. But I did speak to one adviser who told me that that's just not entirely the case. They believe that they are in uncharted territory. They know that anything could happen at this time and they believe that he needs to get out there on the campaign trail. They are doing what they can do. They are making the most of him being in trial. But this advisers said they would really rather be focusing elsewhere, Jake.",

Three things that he prioritizes and values and typically is used to capitalize off of as, you know, since he was in the White House, when he was on the campaign trail.
