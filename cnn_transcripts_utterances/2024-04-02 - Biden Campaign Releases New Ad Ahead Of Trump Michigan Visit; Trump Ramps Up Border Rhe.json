Former President Trump is in the middle of a Midwest swing after spending several weeks forgoing the campaign trail, and he's hoping to blast through Joe Biden's 2020 blue wall, primarily by ramping up his inflammatory rhetoric on immigration and targeting Biden's border policies.But President Biden has been equally relentless going after Trump on abortion restrictions. A new campaign ad today laying into Republicans on reproductive rights as Democrats turn to a new battleground in the fight over abortion access, Florida. Let's start with CNN's Kristen Holmes, who is in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Kristen, explain the significance of this return to the trail coming in these two states, Michigan and Wisconsin.",

Michigan and Wisconsin are two critical battleground states, and they're also states that Donald Trump won in 2016, lost in 2020 and really believes or at least his team believes, that he needs to win them in order to take back the White House in 2024.So what we know now is that Donald Trump is currently in Grand Rapids, Michigan. As you said, he's really leaning in to his anti-immigration rhetoric. As you mentioned, Biden really trying to hit on reproductive rights to carry him to the White House. Donald Trump's team believes that this anti-immigration, talking about Biden failing at the border, is what's going to carry him potentially to the White House. Now, Wisconsin itself is a very interesting state. Trump lost by a very thin margin. I talked to a senior advisor who called this state a must-win state for the former president and for his team. They say they're building out a robust, volunteer-driven, aground game here. And if they're talking about support for the former president or people who are enthusiastic, it is interesting to see here today. It is sleeting outside. They're expecting about a foot of snow, and there are hundreds of hundreds of people lined up to get into this rally. Now, part of that might be the fact that Donald Trump hasn't set foot in this state since 2022. Joe Biden, on the other hand, has visited this state. He got a number of surrogates in this state, but it really goes to show you just how critical Wisconsin is going to be in that 2024 election.",

Vice President Kamala Harris saying that women there now confront the cruel reality of either putting their lives at risk or having to travel potentially hundreds or thousands of miles to get the health care that they need.The Biden campaign, for its part, is obviously using this to make one more fresh push on the issue of abortion rights access. This, of course, is not a new strategy. We've heard both the White House and the campaign talking about this for months as an issue that they believe is politically potent. They think that it is one that will help mobilize voters and that they saw that happen in 2022, in 2023. We also are seeing a new ad coming out of the Biden campaign. As you noted, Boris, this is not the first time that they have used this issue for a political ad. The first ad, you might remember, featured an emotional testimonial from a woman who talked about her inability to get access to abortion. But this new ad from the campaign is notable because it starts with Donald Trump. Basically, this is the campaign trying to place the full blame on Donald Trump for the overturning of Roe v. Wade.

Trump famously dislodged three bricks from the wall, continuing our musical metaphors. In 2016, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, Biden won them all back in 2020.In fact, Democrats have shown a lot of strength in all of them since 2016, now holding the governorship in all three states. Brianna, in 2016 and 2020, if you count down the states from the most Democratic to the most Republican, each time Wisconsin was the 270th Electoral College vote. It was the 270th for Trump in '16, and then conversely, the 270th for Biden in 2020. This time, Wisconsin actually looks a little better, as does Pennsylvania for Biden, than Michigan. Michigan looks like what might be the toughest place for Biden to defend, the weakest link in that wall for Democrats, both because of the discontent over his policy in Gaza and the Arab American community, but also because Trump is making a very strong play for blue-collar auto workers around the idea that the transition to the electric vehicles will decimate the industry and their jobs.",

      "sentences": "I think it's more likely the latter, Boris. I think Florida is very difficult still for Democrats, and it reflects the - some of the complexities in the politics of abortion that aren't always fully discussed. It's true that in virtually every state, there is a majority in polls who believe that abortion should be legal in all or most cases.And in fact, when voters have been able to vote directly on it, even in red states like Kansas, Kentucky and Ohio, they have voted to support abortion rights. But the electoral impact of abortion is more nuanced. There's no question that in 2022, it was a very powerful issue for Democrats in swing states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, where, by the way, it is a huge challenge for Trump in 24, as well as places like Arizona. But in red-leaning states that actually banned abortion, it was not a silver bullet for Democrats. What we saw, for example, in Florida in 2022, is that one-third of voters who said - who basically described themselves as pro-choice, still voted for DeSantis. It wasn't enough to overcome their inclinations to vote Republican on other issues, like crime or immigration. Whereas in states like Michigan and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, only about one-sixth to one-quarter of voters who said they were pro-choice voted for the Republican gubernatorial candidates. So this was a very powerful issue for Democrats in kind of swing terrain and blue-leaning terrain. But by itself, I think we saw very clearly in places like Ohio, Florida, Georgia, Texas, Tennessee, it was not enough to overcome the usual Republican lean of GOP-leaning voters.",

I remember a pollster in a presidential campaign after a losing presidential campaign once saying to me the bitter irony of this whole process is that the voters with the most influence are those who pay the least attention and are the least engaged. And we probably still have months to go before the last few points of voters who are probably who are probably pretty down on Biden and the economy, but also with residually negative images of Trump ultimately have to sort that out. And I suspect we're going to see a certain amount of volatility until the end, because those voters paying the least attention are probably pretty heavily overrepresented in what are now - what political professionals call the double haters camp, people who are negative on both sides. And I don't think we have any idea yet how they are going to weigh their offsetting discontents with both Biden and Trump.",

But very few answers so far from the Israeli military about how this could have happened.Keep in mind that two of the three vehicles from the World Central Kitchen were clearly marked as belonging to that humanitarian aid organization, one of the most prominent aid groups in Gaza, which has even cooperated with the Israeli military itself to build that pier off the coastline, off of Gaza's shore. One of the missiles that struck this - one of the vehicles - actually went right through the logo of the World Central Kitchen that was on the rooftop of one of these vehicles. And they were struck separately, it appears, each vehicle at least a half a mile apart, three vehicles along this coastal road in Gaza that has been used repeatedly for humanitarian aid missions. World Central Kitchen says that they informed the Israeli military of the movements of this convoy beforehand. And so, clearly, something very, very wrong appears to have occurred. And obviously, this is drawing international outrage. It is not the first time that the Israeli military has actually struck an aid convoy, but it does appear to be at least one of the first instances of foreign aid workers being killed in these instances. Six of the seven World Central Kitchen workers who were killed here are foreign nationals, one of them is a dual American-Canadian citizen. The others are British, Australian and Polish nationals. One of the workers was a Palestinian. He was the driver and translator for this group. The Israeli prime minister, in a sign of how seriously he understands the international uproar is around this, speaking directly about this in a video statement, calling this a tragic incident, saying that his force has unintentionally struck innocent people, Brianna.",
