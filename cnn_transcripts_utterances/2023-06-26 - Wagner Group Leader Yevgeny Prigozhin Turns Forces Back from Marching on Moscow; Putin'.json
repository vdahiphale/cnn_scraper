The Kremlin just put out moments ago new video of Vladimir Putin following that mercenary rebellion inside of Russia that threatened to topple his regime. It's not clear, we should note, when this video was actually recorded. And it doesn't mention anything that happened over the weekend. No mention of the mutiny. We haven't heard much from Putin after the most dramatic challenge ever to his 23-year rule. The mercenaries ended their march on Moscow when they were just about 120 miles away from the city. The revolt appears to be over for now. The fallout, though, likely just beginning. We don't know where the Wagner mercenary group's leader is this morning after he supposedly struck a deal with the Kremlin to stand down and go into exile in Belarus. Take a look, these are the last images we have seen of Yevgeny Prigozhin leaving a military headquarters that his troops had seized in southern Russia. Putin had vowed to punish him for treason.",

And of course, Vladimir Putin, who has obviously been at the center of this astonishing few days, this incredible weekend, he hasn't appeared, either. But there has been a prerecorded message that's been put out, a speech by Vladimir Putin, addressing the International Youth Industrial Forum, which is taking place in the Russian region of Tula. And president Putin is giving his remarks to that forum in prerecorded -- in a prerecorded speech. But nothing from him in terms of where he actually is now. There wereconcerns he may have -- or suspicions that he may have fled from Moscow during the height of this crisis, but the Kremlin says he's been working here in his office, in the Kremlin itself, in the Kremlin compound itself. But so many questions still about what will come next, what has been unleashed as a result of this incredible weekend, and what Vladimir Putin will do, of course, in the immediate aftermath.",

This is the initial cleanup mode that Putin is going to get into. So he's basically going to try to tell everybody, look, it's all OK, this is all behind us, nobody is going to fall from power.But I really think that the key thing that Putin has to be most concerned about right now is not whether people are going to rise up in the streets. Yes, there was some populist sentiment that was thrown in Prigozhin's way over the weekend, but what he's really got to be concerned about are these people that I refer to as the Siloviki. These are the close advisers to Putin who are also watching him for cracks. And if there is much more weakness, if things get much worse, I've got to think that people in the Siloviki, guys Patrushev, for example, are going to say, do we need to continue with this guy? Are we going to get another coup next month? At some point, that worm might turn.",

I think what happened was he must have been confronted with some stuff from Putin, from Moscow where he basically said, I can no longer do this.

He has a very important job bringing the coalition together, and he's correct.Look, the interesting thing from this weekend, as we had talked about where was the Russian army, I think this exposed what we've basically already known and we've seen in this war is, the Russian army is really not that good. The Russian army may not have quite the forces to muster that we thought they did. Keep in mind, very terrible infrastructure across Russia. Russia's very big, so you want to move forces anywhere, it takes forever. Kadyrov, they can be out of tough, but they're also called the TikTok brigade for a reason, because they always stay out of the fight and take pictures of themselves pretending to be in it. They were taking pictures of themselves at some bridge in the middle of nowhere this time. And so I think the thing that came out of this is that if we continue to support the Ukrainian military and we get out of this idea that we have to give Vladimir Putin an offramp, we have to give him honor, and we just say, look, we have to have a victory for Ukraine. We don't need Ukraine invading Russia, of course. Nobody is even talking about that. Ukraine isn't even talking about that. But we need Ukraine to win this war. It may be much easier to win than we think. Certainly, it is winnable. And frankly, that's how we stop this continued Vladimir Putin fear and this continued fear of Russia, is to have them actually lose in Ukraine.",

Could they have gotten the Chechens, hopscotched ahead of them in time to keep fighting from breaking out on Moscow's outskirts, audible to those inside? One of the things that, of course, as Steve can explain to us in detail, the centers of Russian political power are the populated areas, the big cities. If this happens in the hinterland, Rostov-on- Don, well, you can keep that off of the front pages for the most part.

Media and internet is only for mostly for young people and it is difficult also to penetrate and to get some news from abroad or opposing news, because they have trolls and other ways to control the internet information, too. So Russian people have very simple and very little idea of what is happening. And this is police state, it does not mean that they are mighty state, but they are police state which is able to control the public. So public politics are not so important there and that is the mistake the West makes mostly when they think that Putin has deadlines, that Putin has to count with some kind of -- he only threatened by his wolf pack, the contenders, but that would not change much, even if he is overturned. And also what we saw these days in Moscow is that the only red line for either of them, for Putin is his personal survival. Nothing matters for him. He was prepared to cede the military in Moscow, and he probably went someplace else. So for him, the red line is not a defeat in Ukraine.
