The Bulwark's Sarah Longwell, on the other hand, says, hell no.Longworth -- Longwell writes, \"The Case For Staying Optimistic About Harris. Undecided voters haven't turned on her. They just need to hear more from her. The debate is an opportunity to start closing the deal.\" Longwell conducted nearly a dozen focus groups with swing and persuadable voters and says, the more they see Harris, the more they like her.

What's your sort of big picture takeaway in addition to what we just said about the piece that you wrote?[12:35:01] LONGWELL: Yes, so, I mean, look, I've been listening to voters talk about Kamala Harris now for years because she was the vice president. And people would always say, look, I don't see her, I don't know her, I don't know what she does. And so they had this kind of negative impression of her. But as she has become the presidential candidate for a lot of Democrats, like the speed and alacrity with which she just reconstituted that Democratic coalition was wild because I was watching people really fall away from Joe Biden, even soft Democrats. And so now we're in persuasion territory, right? She's got a win over these sort of right leaning independents, these soft GOP voters, and they're still in the, well, I don't know that much about her, I'd like to hear more. But what's interesting to me is, those voters, they are out on Trump. Like, when you see a poll, like the New York Times poll, what you see is that Trump is stuck at 46 percent, 47 percent. That's his ceiling. He doesn't have anywhere to go. She's got room to grow. And so she's got -- but that this group, it's like, it's not enough just to vote against Trump. She's got to give him a reason to be for her. And that's what they're looking for. They want to be like, yes, I like this thing about her as opposed to I'm just doing it because I hate Trump.",

And so one of the things that's interesting in this dynamic is, the more people see of Kamala, the more they like her.The more people see of Trump, the less they like him, and that has always been true about Donald Trump. That is why his campaign team, you know, for all their bluster about, oh, you don't see her, it's him they often are like, here, give us your phone and go to the golf course. Because they want this guy out of the public eye, because they can see the relationship to Donald Trump being high profile in the news and his approval ratings going down among these swing voters.",

Most people don't have a clue about vice presidents on either side of the aisle, unless there are extraordinary times. And with her in particular, that was the case.Tom Friedman wrote an op-ed this week that's entitled, \"The 23 Words Harris Needs To Say To Win. Joe and I got a lot of things right, but we got some things wrong too -- and here is what I have learned.\" You think that's good advice?",

      "speaker": "LONGWELL",
      "sentences": "It's -- I agree with the spirit of the advice. So, in the sense that, look, I think that what voters really have their antennas up for is authenticity. I think what Kamala has struggled with in the past is, look, it's hard being the vice president. You got to be out there on somebody else's behalf, right? You don't get to say what you think.I even think part of the reason she seemed to struggle a little bit in 2019 is because she was trying to run to the left of this big Democratic field. I'm not sure that's who she is. I think that she needs to go in there and say what's true. I know this is crazy advice, but I think she should say what's true. She should say, if she thinks that she and Joe Biden got some things wrong, she should say they got some things wrong. I do think voters really like it when they actually hear a politician say something like, you know, while I was vice president, I learned a lot about how to be president for all Americans. But I think that we play a parlor game here in D.C. of like, she has to say these words. This is exactly how she has to do it. Look, she has been so much better at this when she has been able to speak for herself and say exactly what she thinks. And so I think she should go in there and be as authentic a version of herself as possible. Say what's true to her because I think for her to win this debate, she has got to -- people have got to be like, I see this, I like this and I think there's a lot of -- I was listening to your panel beforehand, this question about should she try to rattle Trump? Here's what rattles Trump. A woman showing a competent command of the policy details and sort of what she believes, that'll rattle him plenty. He rattles himself. She doesn't need to do things to get under his skin. Forget about him. Talk to the American people. They want to meet you.",
