That is the sign of a candidate on the rise. There is no doubt that DeSantis got many of his conservative record across. That, of course, is key to Iowa evangelical voters and other conservatives. So at the end of all of this, it's difficult to say that this may have changed many minds, except for perhaps the open ones. And as we talk to voters, there are still voters with open minds.
