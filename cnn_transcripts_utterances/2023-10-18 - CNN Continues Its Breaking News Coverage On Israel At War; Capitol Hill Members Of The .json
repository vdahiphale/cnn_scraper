I think nobody's going to buy that story. People are outraged that he just reported. I think, Israel willing to have an independent international investigation into the crime. Until it does so, nobody in the region would believe that it was not Israel, given the fact that we've seen the thousands of missiles coming out from Gaza into Israel, and none of them was capable of producing any damage, even near the humongous damage that we saw last night.

We have a hospital operating in Gaza since 2009. Within a week, it will run out of supplies and it will not be able to operate. So, we haven't seen that happen.

We will never allow another population transfer,which, by the way, is by international law a war crime, by the Geneva Convention and Protocol of 1977, a war crime. So, that's something that just we will not accept. We will not allow Israel to transfer the crisis to Jordan. If there is any real attempt to do that, Palestinians don't want it, Jordanians don't want it. So, what it will do is, let me be honest, it will be just another war in the region. It will be expanding the area of conflict. It will not bring peace. So again, make no mistake, when it comes to that, our position is unwavering. We will never allow a population transfer from Palestine into Jordan, and that will just take the conflict into a whole new dimension that will be dangerous and disastrous for the whole area. So, no. That will not happen. Palestinian homeland is on their national soil. The two-state solution is the only way to go forward. Israel has to understand that. The world has to understand that. It is enough. And let me warn of something here, Becky, and we say it as a country that you know has tremendous good relations with all our Western friends and allies. The growing perception on the street, as they see this unequivocal iron clad support for Israel in this war -- it is a growing perception that this is a Western Arab-Muslim war. That's a place we don't want to get to. That's a place that we should all work to prevent getting into, and that's why the guns must go silent, common sense must come back, reason, rationalism must come back, and we figure out a way out of this darkness. We took a clear stand in condemning the killing of civilians. The world needs to do so, otherwise it is risking being equated with the crimes that are being committed. We do that because we care about peace, because we've all worked about peace. That is His Majesty's mission that is non-stop. We keep trying to work for peace. It's time we listen.

Biden had been scheduled to meet them in person before his visit was abruptly canceled on Tuesday following that deadly hospital attack in Gaza. The White House cited a period of mourning announced by Abbas for the change in plans. Well, for more on this, let's bring in Michael Oren in Tel Aviv. He served as the Israeli ambassador to the U.S. from 2009 to 2013. He is also a former IDF officer and has served as a visiting professor at Harvard, Yale and Georgetown. Ambassador, it's great to see you. So, first of all, it's important to note that the U.S. assessment behind the attack on that hospital seems to corroborate with Israeli intelligence and that it did not come from Israel. That having been said, the President also today had noted that there are a lot of people, quote, \"out there who are not sure\". So, we've got to overcome a lot of things. And we are seeing all of those people in nations, we should note, that have normalized relations with Israel. We're talking Egypt. We're talking UAE, Turkey, Jordan, where we are seeing increase in protests. And we just heard from the Jordanian foreign minister when he was confronted with the analysis from the U.S. by Becky, saying, quote, \"try and find someone who believes that it was Israel\". So, how do you quell this bubbling tension now? MICHAEL OREN, FORMER ISRAELI AMBASSADOR TO U.S.: Great question. And I just want to say before I begin that this was not just the most difficult and complicated diplomatic mission of President Biden's administration. I think it's probably the most complicated mission of any president. Maybe going back to John F. Kennedy when he flew to Berlin during the Berlin crisis in 1963. I can't recall anything as complicated than this. Not an easy wire to walk at all. And it's important to note here that the - - that President Biden's declaration that the attack on the hospital last night was not committed by the United States, by Israel, but by a falling Palestinian Islamic Jihad rocket was confirmed not just by Israeli sources, but by independent American sources. His own Pentagon and intelligence sources confirmed that. So, President Biden is going to have to come out and say, listen, these are the facts. We understand you have political -- you and the Arab world have public opinion. We want to stay on the same page. And we are going to -- we in the United States are going to ask the Israelis to make certain concessions, which we, which will make my job as president easier and actually make my job helping Israel be easier. And what are those concessions? One would be to open this corridor for humanitarian aid to the displaced Palestinians in the southern Gaza Strip. And the images of Palestinians in open fields, without shelter, without food, maybe without water, is certainly inflaming passions around the world. But I think it's also inflaming passions of -- segments of the American population. And so that is important. I think the Israeli government is going to yield to that request. Not an easy lift, by the way. The Israeli population here is not particularly in favor of that, you should know. They don't view the Palestinians, civilians, as particularly, you know, innocent bystanders in this. They were deep supporters of Hamas. Also, the President wants to know what's Israel's long game? What's our end game? What's our plan for the day after? Israel enters Gaza and uproots Hamas. Who's going to be left holding the keys to Gaza, the President wants to know.",

For its part, the Hamas-linked Islamic Jihad continues to insist that it also was not responsible for the blast either. Israeli Defense Forces spokesperson Doron Spielman joins us live now from Tel Aviv. Thank you so much for being with us. As I just mentioned, the IDF has put out evidence, several pieces of evidence showing that Israel was not responsible for this blast. But I do want to start by saying, regardless of who is responsible, what happened to this hospital is catastrophic. I mean, it is awful. And some of the images coming out are gruesome, really difficult to process for anybody watching or reading about this story. We're talking about hundreds of people dead, 50 percent of them apparently children. Israel coming out and saying, they're not responsible. The idea has put forward, as I mentioned, several pieces of evidence, as well. Joe Biden saying that he agrees with the Israeli assessment. But as you well know, there are always going to be skeptics. There are always going to be people who, regardless of what the IDF says, people who believe that Israel was responsible. Obviously, public perception is important here. Given some of the images that are coming out of Gaza, both yesterday and before yesterday, do you feel that perhaps you are losing the war of public opinion, of public perception? And how does that change Israel's strategy going forward?",

If this was Israel, which it is not, we would take responsibility. We know that Hamas that have no problem -- no moral problem whatsoever in slaughtering innocent Israeli civilians, have no moral problem in lying to the world. And this is right off their playbook. It's an ISIS playbook. Massacre innocent civilians, flee back into Gaza, go underground, wait for Israel to attack. Some civilians will unfortunately be killed, blame Israel. The International Community will stop Israel. And then Hamas regroups and carries out another massacre. This is Hamas' cycle of violence, and it rests upon deceiving the world. So, I hope the world now is wise enough to see through because we are going to go out and not only disable, we are going to destroy Hamas.

And I don't believe that's what Israel is doing. Israel is going out and approaching this, not in a state of rage. Israel is approaching this in a state of what it's going to take to protect our civilians. We have no qualms whatsoever with the Gazan civilian population. We have only one qualm. It is called Hamas. And when we defeat Hamas, I think what we're going to see is not only a better life for Israelis. We're going to see a better life for Gazans. I think we're taking care of a problem that is a global problem. Hamas is part of a global terror network. We may be the first in line. We're only a couple miles away.

He said, there is no doubt that this is a nationalistic moment par excellence. It is one of the big, strategic monuments in the history of our cause.
