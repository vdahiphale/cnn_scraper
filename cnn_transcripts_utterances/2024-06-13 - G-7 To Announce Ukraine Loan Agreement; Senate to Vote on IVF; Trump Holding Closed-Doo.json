At the top of the agenda, securing sustained military aid for Ukraine. They're expected to announce a $50 billion loan for Ukraine using foreign Russian assets.Our senior White House correspondent MJ Lee is traveling with the president in Italy. MJ, good morning. Very grateful to have you on the show. What are the details here? What do you expect from the president today?",

It is a $50 billion loan that would be made to Ukraine, coming from the interests that comes from hundreds of billions of dollars in frozen Russian assets. Officials from the G-7 countries have been really negotiating over these details for a while now, trying to answer some really thorny financial questions, like, who actually would be making the loan? What would be the form of disbursement? Who would be carrying the risk of this loan? And sources are now telling CNN in recent days that this would be a lone mostly made by the U.S., but supplemented with funds from Europe, and also that all of the countries would carry some risk. And the $50 billion in loan to Ukraine would likely be made before the end of 2024.The sense that I've gotten is that the details, trying to figure out really all of the details that would go into this very complicated loan really comes down to the wire. We know that the leaders and officials from these countries have been negotiating for the past few days as well. But U.S. officials are making clear that there really is a shared sense of urgency here with all of the countries wanting to make sure that this agreement does get announced because they do believe that this could make a big difference in Ukraine's ongoing war time efforts.",
