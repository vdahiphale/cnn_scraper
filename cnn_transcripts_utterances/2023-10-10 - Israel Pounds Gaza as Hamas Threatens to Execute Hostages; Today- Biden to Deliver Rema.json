And here is the breaking news that developed overnight.Israel pounding Gaza with another wave of air strikes, despite threats from Hamas to execute hostages. Israelis' prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, says the strikes are, quote, \"just the beginning\" of Israel's response to the Hamas attack. They say fighter jets struck more than 200 targets. Up to 150 hostages, including Americans and children, are believed to be inside of Gaza right now. Hamas is threatening to kill them on camera in retaliation for the strikes. And there are growing signs that a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip could be coming soon. Israeli troops and tanks have been massing near the border. A military spokesman tells CNN a ground offensive could be necessary to stamp out the Hamas terrorists. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. JONATHAN CONRICUS, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES INTERNATIONAL SPOKESPERSON: At this stage, we continue to strike from the air. And there are plans to, of course, expand that. And the troops, the reserves, and the regular units that are amassing along the Southern border, are readying for their tasks. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Look at these burnt-out vehicles here. Again, testimony to the ferocity of the fight here. We've just seen bodies that are being taken out of some of the houses, of some of the young families that were here, being loaded and taken away. This is really only just the clear-up phase. This is now a militarized area. There are hundreds upon hundreds upon hundreds of troops now in this, what was until Saturday morning a peaceful village. I mean, just look over here at the houses. Don't go in. There are some bodies, still, of Hamas here, so we won't -- we won't show those. But these houses here, you can see everything pulled, strewn outside. Lives brutally upended, killed in some cases. But this is the picture all along the border with Gaza now. All these small villages, all these small kibbutzes that were along, close to Gaza, within a mile or so. This is what happened. Hamas stormed them all. The populations are gone. The death toll here absolutely massive. But now back under control of the Israeli Defense Forces. And they say that, even now, you just heard the general speaking there, even now it's not possible to say with 100 percent certainty that there are no Hamas here. But it does feel like an area that is much more under the control now of the Israeli Defense Forces. An area that is getting more and more troops in. There's a tank I saw just over the gate there before. It is still a moment there when you pause and look at these terribly upended lives of the civilians who were living here. This is what Israel is coming to terms with. And this is what the general says is looking at the next 100 yards. And that's how it feels here at the moment.",

And I think it's quite literally going to take some time before you can begin to say with certainty. Dozens is the figure that they're going with now. Other estimates have been much higher.

What we can see on the horizon is -- that was another detonation coming from Gaza. You can see plumes of smoke rising from Gaza. And this is what we've been hearing all night long, really, is just more and more heavy impacts coming from Gaza. That was another one. You sort of -- there's a -- there's a synchronicity to it, if you will. You -- you hear the jets fly over, and then you can hear explosions coming up afterwards. Just going to walk through to this area. Again, we're going to be careful going in here, because there are still bodies here. And we don't want to show those in graphic detail. So I might just stand myself here. Bodies have been -- they're of Hamas fighters. We've seen quite a number of them around the kibbutz. Particularly when you come in, you can see there was a fire fight to get in here. The Hamas fighters seem to be sort of along the road, the approach road coming in here. Number of them dead there, their vehicles at the side of the road. Here, deeper in, this is perhaps where they were trying to hold out, where some of the last -- the last gun battles were. And that's why the bodies are still here. But you can see the buildings where people were living until Saturday morning. Until Saturday morning people were living here. This is -- this is what it's going to look like all up and down this border region here. Kibbutz after kibbutz after kibbutz. We know that the government has helped evacuate civilians from about 20 different communities. We haven't seen any civilians here today. This is essentially a military zone now. As I said before, hundreds upon hundreds upon hundreds of troops here. Heavily armed. We've seen heavy mechanized armor here. Tanks, we've seen here. But most of the troops that we're seeing here are real combat -- combat soldiers. These are the guys who are going to be at the sharp end of the spear when there's contact with Hamas.

      "sentences": "Well, it will be interesting to hear from President Biden today, because up until now, what we have heard from the president is really this expression of unwavering support for Israel in the wake of Hamas's deadly surprise terrorist attack in Israel this past Saturday.President -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last night, in a prime-time address, made a point of calling out President Biden, thanking him for the continuous contact that he has had with him and for that very same unwavering support. We know that that contact has happened at all levels: at the national security adviser level; the Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was in touch with Israeli defense minister, as well. And in particular, one of the main issues that they have to talk about, beyond how Israel is going to proceed with its response, its retaliation for these attacks by Hamas, is this question of hostages. And that's because, of the 100-plus hostages and captives that Hamas has taken into the Gaza Strip, we know that there are Americans. We don't know exactly how many. But there are Americans, some of them dual American/Israeli citizens. And so that has been part of the coordination between the United States and Israel. We're told that the United States has offered Israel intelligence support and surveillance support for its -- a potential hostage recovery operation. We don't know exactly how that is going to proceed, but that's certainly something that is very important to President Biden. But one of my questions right now, as we prepare to hear from the president today, is how far will his support for Israel's military response go? We have seen in the past, most notably in the last conflict in 2021, when President Biden started to express concerns about the high toll of civilian casualties in Gaza, urging Israel to exercise restraint. We have not yet heard that from President Biden. And so the question is what is the tolerance for that from the U.S. Side going forward? We know that as these campaigns continue inside of Gaza, there are going to be increasing civilian casualties. It is simply the nature of this kind of congested space in Gaza and the Israeli military targeting the Hamas targets in that very congested area. So it will be interesting to see how much further the president is willing to go in that unwavering support and whether or not he calls for any kind of restraint.",

To start, you know, we hear constantly about just how tight it is in Gaza, for lack of a better term. About 2 million people, an area about the size of Chicago. What complications does that bring for any type of ground offensive? MAJ. MIKE LYONS (RET.), U.S. ARMY: Yes. I mean, tremendous. I think we're going to potentially see casualties and civilian casualties like we haven't seen since the Second World War, just based on what Israel has said. They've declared war here. They've said -- use the word like \"siege.\" Siege from military perspective means flatten. It means we're going to surround, choke off, you know, the supply that goes in here. I want to talk a little bit about that courageous CNN crew. Because they're sitting right here in Kfar Aza here. And they're so close to that Gaza border here. And what the -- what they're still under is missile fire is coming from on the other side. They still have capacity. Hamas is still firing rockets inside of Israel.

Obviously, this is where the center of gravity is in here with regard to where the Hamas troops are. But I think Israel has got to be very concerned overall about, from a strategic perspective. They have potentially -- they have enemy here coming in this direction. They have Hezbollah coming up from the North. And if they can mass troops in the West Bank, this is going to be the problem here of trying to fight war on three fronts. And that's why they've called 300,000 troops up.
