I do think that what's happening is that the United States and Europe basically have Ukraine's back. The Biden administration is saying for as long as it takes. But there's real concern, also, about avoiding escalation into a wider war if the U.S. and its allies were to provide more capable weapons to the Ukrainians. The challenge is that, if they don't provide those weapons, then it's going to make it more difficult for the Ukrainians to actually decisively win this war. And the greater risk is you end up with a stalemate that actually benefits the Russians because they can claim a victory. They have a chance to then rebuild their forces to go again in two or three years' time and to launch another war, or to be able to, essentially, menace NATO's Eastern frontier elsewhere. So I do think that the Biden administration and NATO need to recognize that there needs to be a decisive victory by Ukraine in this war, and we need to push forward towards that, rather than simply giving the Ukrainians the bare minimum that they need in order to essentially hang on by their fingernails.",

So I mean, it's quite reassuring to see that situation.But also, you know, they want to know that the global importance, the systemic banks, are ring fenced. And by -- by shoring up the capital in these banks, it does feed back into them. And ultimately, we've got the terms of the loan that are going to come through. But ultimately, it's the big banks that are going to benefit from this. We are seeing migration into Bank of America. We're seeing migration into JPMorgan, into the big banks. The stronger become stronger. Depositors aren't fleeing at these banks. So ultimately they're benefiting from this, but it's nice to ring fence, you know, those systemic banks, as well.",

You know, policy makers are saying this current situation is different from the financial crisis in 2008.You said that this lifeline that First Republic just got was able to sort of draw a line between the big banks and the more wobbly ones. But then you've got that data that came on on Thursday, showing the banks are seeking a record amount of emergency liquidity. So what's your read on that situation?",

We're looking at the U.S. We're looking at, yes, as I say, I think the market is doing the numbers at the moment at the common -- common equity tier one ratio, adjusted for the unrealized losses.There's a number of banks that are on people's radars. One suspect that depositors are already leaving. I think it was JPMorgan who put out reports at the tidal (ph) end of last year into the beginning of the year, showing this metric. And that's when deposits started fleeing from Silicon Valley Bank. And that's when the management sold out, effectively. And that's when the regulators should've ticked up. But at the seized (ph) banks that everyone's looking at, saying, should I hold my deposits in there, we know that, yes, they've provided us with the roadmap of how deposits are going to fare under this new system, but not everyone's protected. Some of these deposits, if we see further failing banks, may have to go to Congress. So smaller banks could continue to fail. So if people who are depositors will have to wear a higher premium for wearing those deposits, but they've already probably migrated across now.",

And it will be someone that the Fed have got.There's two -- there's two levers that are in place. One is that the dual mandate that the Fed have, and that is obviously, price stability and inflation and for maximum employment. And that means that they're going to continue using interest rates as that lever to tackle that problem. The balance sheet, on the other hand, is what they're using for this instability in the financial sector, the liquidity issues that have been arising. We've already seen the Fed's balance sheet increase this week by $400 billion. It's not quantitative easing. Its credit going into the system. At the same time they're going to be using interest rates to continue to try and quash inflation. They go to 25, in my opinion. The market's pricing at about 20 basis points there. The question is, is what happens towards the end of the year. We're into the second half. We're pricing (ph) quite an aggressive rate hikes. Which I'd probably suggest is open a door to something a bit more systemic. And I don't think we're going to see a systemic crisis coming out of the banking situation.",
