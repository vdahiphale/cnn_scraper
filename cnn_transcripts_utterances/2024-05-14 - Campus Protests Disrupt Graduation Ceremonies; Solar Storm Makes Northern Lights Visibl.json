The university said the intensity of feelings fueled by both social media and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East created substantial risks relating to security and disruption at commencement.",

BERNAL (on camera): And in terms of protests, we did see at least a dozen students walking out of Virginia Commonwealth University commencement event. This was after the governor of Virginia began his address to students here in California at UC Berkeley. The commencement ceremony briefly stopped after protests and chanting. And the dean of students telling those protesters to leave and saying that they could speak to her after the event. But eventually, these protesters did leave voluntarily and no one was arrested. Of course, that`s the type of thing that universities like USC that canceled their main commencement ceremony wanted to avoid. What we saw here was a focus in the school graduations that happened from Wednesday all the way up until Saturday. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

If you said stored magnetic energy, then go on and bask in a sunny glow because you are correct. A solar flare is a massive explosion on the sun that happens when stored magnetic energy is suddenly released. Check out these incredible scenes from this weekend`s Northern Lights. This extraordinary phenomenon lit up the sky with dancing hues of green, purple, sometimes pink, and it`s expected to continue this week. The official term for these lights is Aurora Borealis. They`re named after the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, and the Greek god of the north wind, Boreas. But most people just call them Northern Lights. So how are they formed? Here`s CNN`s Kristin Fisher with the cosmic science behind it all. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And when they hit the Earth`s magnetic field or any other planet`s magnetic field, they interact with that field. And those changes generate currents which can damage power grids, satellites, anything that has an electrical conductor involved. FISHER (voice-over): The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is describing this storm as an extraordinary and very rare event, one that also has them a little concerned. The biggest threats are to satellites and to global power grids. NOAA says it notified critical infrastructure operators and that mitigation efforts have been taken. But it`s still warning of possible widespread voltage control problems.",
