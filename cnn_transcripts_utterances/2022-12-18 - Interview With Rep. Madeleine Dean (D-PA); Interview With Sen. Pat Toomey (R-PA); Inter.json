While many Americans are focusing on last-minute shopping and holiday gatherings, legislators are actually facing one of the busiest weeks in recent memory Tomorrow, the January 6 Committee is expected to publicly vote to refer criminal charges against Donald Trump to the Justice Department. On Wednesday, the Trump era immigration policy known as Title 42 will expire, which will certainly bring even more asylum seekers to and across the Southern border, exacerbating an already horrific humanitarian crisis there that too few in Washington are prepared to tackle. And, by Friday, Congress needs to pass a massive funding bill to keep the government from shutting down, with so many important priorities, from helping Afghan allies, to protecting consumers from big tech monopolies hanging in the balance, this busy lame-duck holiday season, just over two weeks before a power shift in Washington, as House Republicans make preparations to take over. Among their new priorities, taking on the threat from the Chinese government with a new House select committee chaired by Wisconsin Congressman Mike Gallagher, a Marine with a national security background, who has already introduced bipartisan legislation to counter China's influence legislation that is gaining steam in Washington. And Congressman Mike Gallagher joins us now. Congressman, or, should I say -- well, I guess it's early to say Mr. Chairman, so I will just call you Congressman for now. You're the incoming chair of this new Select Committee on China. You say we're in the early stages of a new Cold War with China. Do you view China as an enemy of the United States? And what is your biggest priority for this new committee on day one of the new Congress? REP. MIKE GALLAGHER (R-WI):  I view the Chinese Communist Party as an enemy of the United States. But it's important that we don't conflate the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people. I think that's absolutely critical to our long-term competition with China. And I view the CCP in some ways as an enemy of its own people. Look at the way in which Xi Jinping has repressed the nationwide protests surrounding his failed COVID zero policies. Look at the way in which they have used some of the tools of techno-totalitarian surveillance they're perfecting in Xinjiang province in a modern-day concentration camp, and exported that around the country to control the rest of their citizens. So, it's important that we make that distinction constantly. And the most important thing we want to do as -- with this new select committee is make this a bipartisan effort. Speaker-elect McCarthy wants the Democrats to participate in this. He wants us to be serious. And, to the extent possible, we want to identify where Congress can speak with one voice when it comes to the policy that best positions us to win this long-term competition with the CCP.",

You have a bill to ban TikTok completely nationally over its ties to China and because of national security risks.[09:05:04] For the 100 million TikTok users in the U.S., including two-thirds of teenagers, including two teenagers I know very well, what information could the Chinese government be collecting about them?

But the fundamental problem is this, Jake. TikTok is owned by ByteDance. And ByteDance is effectively controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. The editor in chief of ByteDance, for example, is the CCP secretary and has talked about making sure all product lines, all business lines follow appropriate political control. So, the question we have to ask is whether we want to give the CCP the ability to track our location, track what Web sites we visit, even when we're not using the TikTok app itself and, increasingly, since a large percentage of young Americans use TikTok to get their news, whether we want them to have the ability to selectively edit that news. It's as if, in 1958, given that TikTok is on the cusp of becoming the most powerful media company in America, we would have allowed the KGB and Pravda to buy \"The New York Times,\" \"The Chicago Tribune,\" \"The Washington Post\" all combined. I think this is a bad idea. And I'm proud to say that my bill is now bipartisan. I have a Democrat, Raja Krishnamoorthi, who is joining me in introducing it. We have heard Senator Mark Warner voice concerns in the Senate. So my hope is that we make that bipartisan case. And now every member of the Senate is on record saying that TikTok is a national security concern, and that it should be banned from government phones. So we're making the case. We have a long way to go legislatively.",

      "sentences": "The short answer is, we don't know.But Brendan Carr has called it digital fentanyl. And I think that comparison is apt for two reasons. One, as he points out, it's highly addictive, highly destructive. It's increasing the loneliness, isolation and rising rates of suicide and depression we're seeing among America's youth. And also, like actual fentanyl, ultimately, you can trace it back to China. The precursor chemicals for fentanyl come from China, of course. So I think it's a very good comparison by FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr. And that's one of the many reasons why we need to take bipartisan action to ban it. And, as I said before, the ability to edit the news, I just think is a massive tool and weapon that we don't want to give the CCP. The other thing is this. Whether or not they're doing it intentionally, there's another asymmetry in our relationship. Chinese propagandists, Chinese wolf warrior diplomats are all over our social media companies, Twitter, Facebook, spreading dangerous lies about the United States, attacking us, while, at the same time, they deny their own citizens in China access to those very same technology platforms. That doesn't make sense. That's not a reciprocal relationship. So, one thing I have encouraged Twitter executives to do is to apply a standard that says, if you deny your citizens access, we won't allow you access to our platform to spread dangerous lies. There's all sorts of ways we can get at the information competition, the ideological competition. That's an essential part of winning this new Cold War.",

Nobody was ever attacked more than Donald Trump was, sometimes legitimately, sometimes not. And he fought back aggressively. And so when Republicans had criticisms of him -- I certainly think mine were valid -- that doesn't always sit well with folks who see him as carrying the fight to the other side. So, some of that tribalism is built into political systems anywhere. Again, I think, as his influence wanes, the sort of conventional understanding of what words mean kind of gets restored over time. I'm not -- I'm not too worried about that.",
