Ben Wedeman connecting us from Eastern Ukraine. This attack in Kramatorsk providing memories of that awful strike on the train station there in the first weeks of the war. Just describe what you have seen and heard. BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Becky, within the last hour, we have seen rescue workers carry out a black body bag. So it appears that the death toll is now at least 11. We watched as relatives watched this body being brought out; they're very distraught. He was one of the workers in the restaurant. It appears, in fact, that the missile hit directly in the kitchen itself, because we are told that they found the body under a refrigerator that had been knocked over. So this really has been a devastating attack for a city that already has suffered so much since this war began.

As far as what hit the restaurant, yesterday we heard in his nightly address President Volodymyr Zelenskyy saying that it was an S-300 surface to air missile. Now it appears in fact that it was an Iskander missile, which is a hypersonic ballistic missile, that has a much bigger payload than the S- 300, which would account for the level of destruction here.

They painted a very different picture than the one that was to emerge later from that video that has now caused such controversy. You see it very clearly, the car in which he was traveling with two other passengers being stopped, you hear someone say they are going to shoot someone in the head. Seconds later, that gunshot ringing out, a very different picture than initially the police had tried to paint. Of course, that goes to the heart of the controversy. Here in France there have been, over the years, so many examples of either police brutality or fatal police interventions at traffic stops or random identity checks. There is also in this country a history of one version of events being given by police only through video or eyewitness testimonies to come and contradict that. This appears to be one of those cases. There is also the age of the young man involved. Just 17 years old, his mother has called for a march in his name tomorrow. You heard the French president urge calm. Calm is clearly not what French officials are expecting. Last night, those images which came very suddenly, those outbursts of violence, because of that context that I mentioned, the sense that, at times, the police act with impunity. There is very little then in the way of justice for victims. And these kinds of instances have happened all too often, with unarmed citizens involved. What they did last night was to put 350 police officers to try to bring calm to streets. What they're doing tonight, Becky, is deploying more than 2,000 police officers, not just here but to other neighborhoods that are considered to be at risk of seeing this kind of violence, this kind of disturbance again. They're trying to keep the peace. The fact that deployment tonight, the fact that you are hearing politicians speaking out, the French prime minister speaking out just a few moments ago, saying that she understands that the official version given and what we saw in that video simply didn't correspond to what should have happened, how the law should have been applied. All of that tells you that authorities are extremely worried about what this might lead to and how far and wide and angry this controversy might go.",

They include indecent assault and causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent. The instances take place between 2001 and 2013. Why is this all happening in London?

The foreign minister has already been Kyiv but of course, Netanyahu has not visited since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The prime minister's office said that no decision has been made. But the fact that it is being made public, that there are discussions being had about a possible visit, that is seen as an important step, at least on behalf of the Ukrainian ambassador. This is coming as tensions between Ukraine and Israel are back at a new high. There has long been tensions between the two countries, mostly because of what Ukraine sees as Israel's, they call it, neutral stance on the invasion. Israel will defer; they say that it's actually voted against Russia in the United Nations. They accept  humanitarian assistance. But they often cite their own security concerns. Russia's presence in Syria on the northern border about why they don't want to get more involved in the invasion. But there was a very, very strongly worded statement from the Ukraine embassy in Israel just a few days ago, where they essentially say that, this is their words here. \"The so-called neutrality of Israeli government is considered as a clear pro Russian decision.\" The statement also cites some diplomatic negotiations between Israel and Russia, especially it cites statements made by prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In a recent interview with the \"Jerusalem Post,\" where he says, one of the reasons why Israel is not sending weapons to Ukraine is because of, his words, \"concerns that any system we give to Ukraine could be used against us. It could fall into Iranian hands.\" He is even saying that this has actually happened, that Western anti-tank weapons are now being found at Israel's border. When I spoke to the Ukrainian ambassador, he took specific issue with especially that statement. Now the Ukrainian ambassador has actually been summoned to the Israeli ministry of foreign affairs next week for a meeting over this scathing statement. And when I asked the Ukrainian ambassador about this summoning, he sort of chuckled, really even said clearly they're not that concerned because it is not an urgent summoning. It is for next week. He says by next week he hopes that tensions and emotions on both sides calm down. But he says he's going to ask the Israelis for specific evidence about the assertion, about weapons in Ukraine ending up on Israel's borders. He did say however that he feels a visit by Netanyahu to Kyiv will be an important step in what he called repairing the relations. What is really interesting is the comment he made to me. He said, Netanyahu wants to be invited to the White House and he believes that the fastest way to the White House is actually through Kyiv -- Becky.",

So Netanyahu is trying to balance this. He said in a statement, calling on people to not try to grab land illegally in the West Bank, telling them to go through the proper government channels. And actually just the last few minutes on that settler violence, we have learned four Israeli settlers who've been placed on what is known as administrative detention. This is being imprisoned without charge. It is actually a tactic we often see used against Palestinians. But the minister of defense has issued this order for this administrative detention against the Israeli settlers, which is a unique step, essentially saying that these people have committed violent acts in the past. They say that they were involved in the attacks we saw last week. And they're placing them on this administrative detention before they can carry out further attacks. So you are hearing sort of different strains from the Israeli government, from the defense minister, from the foreign minister, who recently spoke with Antony Blinken about the settler violence, condemning it. And the strongest message we actually saw was from the Israeli security (INAUDIBLE) and from the IDF, who equated settler violence with terrorism, Becky.",
