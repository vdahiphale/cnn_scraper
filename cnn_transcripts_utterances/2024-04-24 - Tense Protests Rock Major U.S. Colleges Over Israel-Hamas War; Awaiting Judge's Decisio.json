Texas state troopers in riot gear, some on horseback started breaking up a group of pro-Palestinian protesters.

Now, earlier this morning, this was pretty peaceful until college security tried to move in to clear this grassy area of tents. It very quickly got ugly. There was cursing, there was pushing. There were shoving. It was an ugly scene. One older security officer I saw being pushed backwards by a group of younger protesters. He was trying to keep them at arms length, then an arrest was made. That arrested protester was taken to a police car, and that car does then surrounded, so it could not leave the area. The crowd were chanting, \"Let him go, let him go\". And you know what, eventually they did. We spoke with seasoned LAPD detective who when he arrived, he realized that Jews wasn't worth the squeeze, that it was not worth keeping that protester in custody for a relatively minor offense because of the absolute chaos it was creating. So that protester was released. And now, we have a loud but peaceful protest marching around this area of grass. Now, the LAPD here is here because they have been asked by USC to come in and clear this area of tents. Frankly, protesters have already cleared much of it already, so it is unclear if the LAPD will actually have to come on. As you are seeing right now, it is a peaceful protests. Now if some of the t-shirt, some of the banners suggest a slightly superficial understanding if the history and the reality, but these are some serially held beliefs, and these people here say they are here in solidarity with what has been happening at Columbia and elsewhere in the country.

And universities have a responsibility to ensure the safety and well-being of their students, and to make sure that the rules of the university are being followed.

The gag order prohibited Trump or was supposed to prohibit him from making any public statements about any witnesses or jurors or court staff, or family members, or staff of the judge or prosecutor.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Today, the Supreme Court heard another historic case on abortion as protesters on both sides of the issue gathered out front. The high- stakes hearing focused on Idaho's abortion ban and how it applies in medical emergencies. The state allows exceptions when the life of a mother is at risk, but the Biden administration sued the state, arguing that federal law requires the state to allow the procedure if it is needed to stabilize a patient even when the mother's condition is not yet life- threatening.

Because they're getting more diverse, they're getting more highly educated. They're getting less white. That factor is still stays. There are a lot of doubts about Biden though with his age, however, now everyone is aware of Georgia is battleground, really fascinating. People say, wow, that's ballot (INAUDIBLE), I have to vote.

Madam Chairwoman, thanks so much for joining us. So let's just start with the news. The Chamber of Commerce is suing you and the FTC.
