I'm Jessica Dean in New York, and we begin this hour with breaking news as more than 62 million people are set to feel the worst of the winter as a powerful storm stretches across 1,300 miles this weekend.Freezing rain and high winds already hitting the plains with potentially historic snowfall expected tomorrow. More than 30 states are currently under winter weather alerts, with officials urging people to stay home and stay off the roads. A look at I-70 in Kansas City shows you why, as conditions are only getting worse out there. Meteorologist Elisa Raffa is tracking the latest conditions from the CNN Weather Center. Elisa, many people potentially going to be affected by this. When might we see the worst of it?",

That's just the appetizer.The radar has only had a little bit amount of freezing rain, which just goes to show you don't need a lot of ice to cause problems. The impacts span from the Central Plains, we are talking Kansas and Missouri all the way to the Mid-Atlantic, Washington, DC by Monday. We are talking about difficult to nearly impossible travel, heavy and blowing snow, significant ice, and that will cause sporadic power outages. In fact, for some parts, we are even looking at extreme impacts that the Weather Service is calling it a major disruption to daily life from Louisville over towards Evansville, there in the purple, and that is because of this significant icing that can happen. It weighs down trees and power lines. I mean, look at the alerts. We have a new blizzard warning in effect now from Wichita to Kansas City, because you'll have that heavy snow blow around and drop visibility. You have the ice storm warning, which you don't see these all too often. South Central Missouri, the bottom tip of Illinois, and then parts of Kentucky where that ice would be significant. And the winter alerts again continuing to be issued, stretching all the way to the East Coast, more than 1,400 miles for these alerts. Just incredible. So the storm continues to blow up as we go into tomorrow. We are looking at heavy snow and ice as that cold air squeezes in all of this moisture from the Gulf, and really just creates a recipe for just heavy, all of this snow, ice, rain as we go through the day tomorrow. Then it continues to push east. The Monday morning commute looks like a mess for some places like Charlotte, DC and Philly. Some of it with snow and ice, some of it with that heavy rain. So just really incredible. When it comes to that snow footprint, look at how far stretching it is. Looking at the heaviest totals for parts of Kansas and Missouri, some six to twelve inches there, some totals over a foot possible. Where you don't get the heavy snow, you get the heavy ice. Look at these ice totals, looking at a half an inch to three quarters of an inch of ice for parts of Missouri, Illinois and Kentucky. When you have ice like that, it can get very heavy on the tree limbs and the power lines weighing them down, and that is where you get some significant outages possible -- Jessica.",

And what is happening is we actually have a wedge of warm air coming into this storm, and it seems counterintuitive, right? How could warm air give you ice? But what is happening is, as the snow and rain is falling out of the clouds, what this warm air does is it will kind of melt and refreeze anything that is in the middle of the air, so you have this cold, freezing air just only at the bottom and its warm over here. You have rain falling until it hits the cold air and then its freezing on contact. That is freezing rain.If you have that wedge of cold air a little bit deeper, then it refreezes into those ice pellets and you get sleet, or if it is all cold, then you get snow. So this is why this forecast has been so difficult, because you get just two degrees difference of change anywhere in this part of the atmosphere and it could totally change your precipitation type from sleet to freezing rain to snow, changing those impacts and making it very difficult, which is why this is just going to be so far spanning and also including some severe weather -- Jessica.",

One phone, they were able to recover some letters that were written, they believe, by Livelsberger.One of them calls for action to remove Democrats from the federal government and the military, including the possibility of occupying roads and federal buildings, not ruling out the use of force. Another letter talks about his grievances in politics and grievances in society and culture, expressed support for President Donald Trump and Elon Musk. Let's read you some of the excerpts that investigators read to the media during a press briefing, in hopes that the context would shed some light, perhaps on his state of mind. One says, \"Time to wake up. We are being led by weak and feckless leadership, who only serve to enrich themselves.\" Another excerpt says \"Why did I personally do it now? I needed to cleanse my mind of the brothers I've lost and relieve myself of the burden of the lives I took.\" And another excerpt says, \"We are the United States of America, the best country people to ever exist, but right now we are terminally ill and headed toward collapse.\" Now, he had visited the military behavioral health program multiple times in recent months and was diagnosed with depression last year, but he had not been assessed to be a risk to harm himself or others. The day before this explosion, he had sent an e-mail to some online media outlets saying that he was armed and that he had a vehicle borne improvised explosive device. So authorities are really looking through his phone data now to see what else he might have written. There seems to be a log of activity that he wrote for the ten days leading up to this explosion. Again, he had rented this cybertruck, driven it from Colorado to Nevada, purchased two guns legally shortly before this happened, and investigators say he killed himself and set off these explosives almost at the same time, right in front of that Trump Hotel on New Year's Day. Seven people in the vicinity had minor injuries, but they were treated and released -- Jessica.",

KAYE (voice over): The city's more permanent barriers are bollards like these, portable steel structures that were designed to prevent vehicles from entering Bourbon Street. They move up and down and can either lay flat or be raised to close the street to traffic when needed to protect pedestrians. Despite warnings years ago that this area was at risk for terrorism, including vehicular attacks, the bollards were not used.

And now, in the last week or so, they're coming back to us saying, look, you know, maybe we need your help. Maybe we need you to stay. Don't leave just yet. And as has also been reported, the United States Military did double its presence in Syria. So I think it seems we are making all the right moves. I think it is something we need to be very careful of. But again, keep in mind this ISIS is an ideology. You can't necessarily stamp it out, but you do have to pursue that tactic of mowing the lawn every now and then and it is not just in the Middle East.

But I do think it is in our interests to keep certainly an eye on what is going on and have the capability, if need be, to use lethal force to take out ISIS leaders, to take out groups, to knock out training camps. You know, I think Central Command, which has responsibility for that region over the past year or so, has conducted nearly 200 attacks against ISIS trying to keep them down.

You want to put out as much as you can as soon as you can, but don't jump to any conclusion based on the person's name or their ethnicity or what they may have done in their past.

I think when you look at this in total, though, these Republicans that got elected along with Donald Trump, they didn't get elected by those same voters to go up to Washington and oppose Donald Trump. And if Donald Trump says we are going to do energy, we are going to do immigration, we are going to extend the tax cuts, we are going to do the Republican platform. There is going to be an enormous amount of pressure on these guys from back home and from Trump on top of them to go ahead and get it done. But I agree with you, I do think there is going to be some pressure from those people who were holding out against Johnson to try to show some movement towards reining in spending, reducing the debt, and reducing the size of government. I think Trump is going to have to give them something on that and I am certain that throughout the course of this year, that's going to be part of the conversation.

So that's definitely going to be a big fight.And then there is also the ways in which especially conservative Republicans are going to want to make cuts, which are basically cuts that we think are things that will hurt seniors, poor people, veterans, you know, sort of constituency groups that actually were really core to President Trump's win, and Democrats are the ones who every time go to protect them. So I would say that if they are going to want any sort of concessions from Democrats, whether it is to support this big package in its entirety or even big pieces of it, but there is going to have to be concessions that, for Democrats, look like spending increases on core values, right? So they are on this really tough collision course right now.",

He said at virtually every - overpass for more than 150 miles but certainly that was felt here at The Carter Center where the family arrived late this afternoon for a private family service. Now, politics was rarely discussed today. In fact, Republican governor, Brian Kemp, met the motorcade at the Atlanta capitol here. That's where Jimmy Carter first served as a state senator and then governor, of course, before making that improbable run for president in 1976.
