Our photojournalist Mattia (ph) Sum (ph) was able to get a closer look from this position where we are at some of the damage in Beit Hanoun, which in the northeastern most city inside of Gaza, where we know that Israeli troops have been operating. And you can see in some of this footage some of the destruction to the buildings in that area.What we've also been watching over the last several hours is heavy artillery fire directed at the Gaza Strip. We've been seeing flares going up and smoke from the Gaza Strip. And what we've also been hearing over the last several hours includes drones, helicopters, and heavy machine gun fire, indicating active battles between Israeli troops and Hamas militants inside of Gaza. Now, the IDF told us that overnight, they killed dozens of terrorists in buildings and tunnels inside of Gaza as they've been operating now. And this expanded ground operation is entering its fourth day now. Over the course of these last several of days, the IDF said that they struck over 600 targets in recent days, which includes weapons depots and dozens of anti-tank missile launching points. It's been interesting to watch the way in which they've been operating. We were anticipating the possibility of an overwhelming large ground invasion with hundreds of thousands of troops going into Gaza. That is not what we have seen thus far. Instead, they appear to be methodically going after some of these reinforced positions that Hamas fighters have prepared in anticipation of an Israeli ground offensive inside of Gaza. But we are learning now that the forces are operating not only in northern Gaza, northeastern Gaza, which is right behind me here, but also south of Gaza City. A video just came out showing an Israeli tank in southern Gaza City on a main road there, apparently firing on passenger vehicles, according to a Palestinian freelance journalist in the city. We can actually see in the video that tank operating and appearing to fire on passenger vehicles. So this is very much an ongoing, very dynamic situation, and the IDF says that they're going to continue to expand these operations, continue to add more troops inside of Gaza and these operations continue.

He told authorities he and his father would \"... work with Robert to make sure he does not have any other firearms.\" It's unclear if any further action was taken after that, and a source told CNN the case appears to have been closed on October 1st, twenty- four days before the shooting. According to sources, the Maine National Guard initiated a wellness check because the reservist started hearing voices in the spring and say they had only gotten worse. The National Guard also informed the Sagadahoc County Sheriff's Office of his history of mental illness, including his stay at a psychiatric facility in July.
