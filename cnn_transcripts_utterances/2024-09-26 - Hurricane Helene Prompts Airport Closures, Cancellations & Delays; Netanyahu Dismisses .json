We've got about a whole 1,100 cancellations in the U.S., about 2,400 flights delayed.The most impacted airline right now it's Southwest airlines because it operates the second-highest number of flights in Florida behind American Airlines when it comes to Miami. Southwest has captured number one in every flight cancellation today. American, Delta, United and Spirit round out the top five. There's so many airports in Florida that are closed right now. Tampa International Airport has been closed since 2:00 a.m. local time this morning. Tallahassee International Airport also closed. Same story at Clearwater International Airport. In Tampa, they had a group of airport workers who will ride out the storm inside the terminal. The goal there is to have the airport back up and running by sometime tomorrow. Now American, Delta, United and Southwest have all waived change fees for passengers who want to change their flights from, to or through airports that have been impacted by Helene. That includes most of the airports in Florida. Also in some cases, Mexico and Cuba. But it depends on the airlines. You have to check with them. The FAA tells me it is also getting ready for the impact form Helene. It's preparing air traffic control facilities right now. Holding a conference call at about 6:00 p.m. Eastern time. At Atlanta airport right now, Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, the biggest airport in the world. Things, you can see, are getting a little bit more flooding there. The weather's no looking very good.",

The U.S. and a host of other countries are all backing it.But today, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed reports of an imminent pause in the conflict across the border with Lebanon. Instead, calling on his troops to continue fighting with, quote, \"full force.\" Now earlier, the Israeli military says it carried out what it called precise strikes in the Lebanese capital of Beirut, killing a Hezbollah commander. According to Lebanese state-run media, though, the Israeli strikes targeted a building near a busy intersection, killing at least two people and injuring more than a dozen others. For more on this, let's go straight to CNN's Jeremy Diamond in Haifa, Israel. Jeremy, is this ceasefire proposal gaining any traction among Israeli officials?",

Evelyn Farkas is with us now to discuss. She is a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia. She currently serves as the executive director of the McCain Institute. Evelyn, the U.S. just announced a $375 million aid package to Ukraine, may commit many billions more before the end of the month. What does that do? And what can it do if the U.S. doesn't grant this request for Ukraine to use long-range weapons inside of Russia? EVELYN FARKAS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, MCCAIN INSTITUTE &amp; FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR RUSSIA, UKRAINE &amp; EURASIA: Yes, I mean, Brianna, this aid package is really important because, right now, what we see is that the elections are coming up. And so President Biden, President Zelenskyy, they want to make sure that they, I guess, Trump proof support for Ukraine and get as much as possible out to Ukraine right now. But the other part of this, of course, is Congress. And so even if you have a Harris administration, the president -- both presidents want to make sure that Ukraine has as much assistance as possible. And then there's the reality that they're really tired in Ukraine right now and the Europeans are really worried about the war spreading. So the assistance package will let Ukraine continue to fight. I'll hopefully provide better air defense. I understand there are Patriots in this package. But I'm not really sure exactly what is going to be a game changer here.",

I think that risk is -- you can't dismiss it entirely.But it's pretty small because he just does not want war with the United States and our NATO allies. Russia can barely win the war right now with Ukraine. So that is a risk. People talk about the nuclear escalation. And of course, I believe it was yesterday, Vladimir Putin made nuclear threats again. They have a doctrine that calls for a use of nuclear weapons if the existence of the state is in danger. And of course, that interpretation of whether the existence of the state is in danger is up to Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin. But again, I see that risk as not -- not something we can dismiss entirely but also not very high. The -- on the plus side of the ledger, you know, if the Russians -- if the Ukrainians, rather, have this permission to use these long-range missiles and they can take out some strategic targets inside of Russia, for example, military depots. We saw recently, just a couple of days ago, the Ukrainians took out a depot in Russia that caused them to lose a significant amount out of military hardware. Some of these can be certainly at least game changing in the short term, maybe even in the long term.",

Yes, that's not a swing state this time. But -- but there are quite a few swing states or red states or maybe even swing districts. And so I can see that maybe they fell into this without thinking about it clearly. It's unfortunate there were no Republicans there. I mean, that's just something you should make sure that you cast your net wide enough that you get some Republican members of Congress.

That's kind of a big red flag. Also, another bucket that I would put it into is just kind of a haphazard op structure where we had to command centers and, in some cases, not everybody even knew that there we're two command centers. I think local law enforcement was clear on what it was that they we're supposed to do, but not necessarily this is certainly read into the whole program. And I think that those kinds of things left me with a real anxiety about the organizational structure of the Secret Service, but also the culture of the Secret Service as well.
