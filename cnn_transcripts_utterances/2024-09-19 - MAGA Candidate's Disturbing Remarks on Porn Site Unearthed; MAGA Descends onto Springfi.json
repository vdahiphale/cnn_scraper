There is an explosive report tonight from CNN's KFILE that could very well impact this election. It is about the Republican candidate for North Carolina's governor race, Mark Robinson. He is the man that Donald Trump once called Martin Luther King Jr. on steroids.But now we are learning that he posted disturbing comments on a porn site years before entering politics. Going by the name Mini Soldier, he called himself a black Nazi. He said he wanted slavery to return. He said, quote, buy a few himself -- he would by a few himself, and he called himself a perv. He said he liked trans sex and attacked Martin Luther King Jr., and that is just a sampling. Now, this comes as early voting in the state has already begun and on the last day, actually, that a candidate can drop out of the race. But Robinson has refused to do so. And tonight, he is denying this whole thing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
