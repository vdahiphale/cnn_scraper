He's just got three days now to come up with $464 million for bond to appeal his civil fraud case in New York. That's nearly half-a-billion dollars. The state's attorney general has made the necessary preparations to seize some of his assets if he doesn't, that includes properties like the Seven Springs estate in New York's Westchester County.Trump posted again on social media just minutes ago, \"No trial, no jury, no crime, no victim, only a crooked --\" OK, there was a trial, by the way. The judge ruled there, but he's writing about that and ranting about it overnight, as you can see by his post on Truth Social, which just keep on coming. CNN's Kara Scannell is with us now.

Of course, this story has been moving every single day, so we could learn new developments as this deadline approaches. But he still is on the hook to come up with half-a-billion dollars, has until Monday to do that, unless the New York appeals court steps in and grants has request to post a lower amount, or not required to post any money until this entire appeal is over.Now, the New York attorney general's office has opposed that. They say that they don't even know so to the extent Donald Trump has really tried to get a bond and raise money for this. So they have pushed back on that. And as you said, they've already started to lay the groundwork to begin the process of potentially moving to enforce this judgment as soon as Monday. They have filed paperwork in Westchester where Trump has that Seven Springs family compound. He also owns a golf course in the nearby town of Briarcliff. And there's also all of the properties in New York City where this judgment was originally entered, including Trump Tower, his triplex apartment in that tower, 40 Wall Street, a number of hotels and apartment buildings. And those could all be assets that the attorney general's office could try to move on. It's unlikely they would be able to seize a property immediately. The Trump Organization structure is rather complex. They would have to take initial steps in that to try to penetrate some of those complexities. But also, they could move to put liens on some of these properties, tried to collect rent from some of the apartments to really try to go after these assets as well as going after an airplane and his bank accounts. So that's all potentially on the table. And this deadline is really approaching. But one thing that is sure is that Donald Trump is expected to fight this every step of the way. John?",

Here we already have one, and I looked at the average of polls and looked at our previous CNN poll, and they all show the same thing, which is that Donald Trump is ahead of Joe Biden in the wolverine state.You go over to Michigan. Look no clear leader. That's the key thing going on. These two gentlemen are tied. But again, this is a state eight that Joe Biden won last time around by a little bit more than a percentage point.

Now, you'll remember, Manafort and Roger Stone, both, convicted of crimes. Later, they were pardoned and commuted in different ways by Donald Trump.

The one that stands out to me is Paul Manafort, and here is why. He was obviously implicated in the Russia investigation. He had a number of -- his actual charges were more related to his taxes and so on, but he was single-handedly responsible for getting support for Ukraine taken out of the Republican Party platform in 2016.

Israel has been broadly criticized by countries around and the world, including the United States for not allowing enough in, for restricting humanitarian aid into Gaza. And also they will be talking clearly about the ceasefire that every what is working towards it this point, potential release of hostages, but also Israel's very clearly stated plan that they want to do this major ground offensive in the southern part of Gaza, in Rafah, where well over one million Palestinians are currently sheltering at this point.  Secretary Blinken, whilst he is being here in the region has been very blunt saying it would be a mistake, saying the US does not support this particular plan. Now, we know an Israeli delegation will be going early next week to Washington where the Biden administration hopes to give them alternatives to this major ground offensive. But it really is an important meeting for Secretary Blinken to be meeting the War Cabinet at this point and really pushing the Biden agenda to try and make sure that this Rafah offensive does not happen. Here in Doha, of course, we are expecting the negotiations to continue and to resume. We are expecting that the CIA director, the Mossad director, Egypt's intelligence chief along with Qatar's prime minister to sit down and try and secure this six-week ceasefire with the Palestinian prisoner release and a hostage release. We did have the counter proposal from Hamas just last week and this is what they are talking about or will be talking about here in Doha.
