And when you think of it as an American sports fan, you know, we kind of celebrate mediocrity and, like, you - you're the worst team in the league? Well, here's the first draft pick. And so what's wild about these stories is, some of these players that have side jobs, you know, they're kind of semi- professionals.

It's a legitimate question. It is a question that I and I know each of the three of you have asked Democrats repeatedly, because this is a policy that has not had to be set for 50 years while Roe was in place.And so as these states are coming up with their individual new laws, the question is, not just, for example, Florida, you cannot have an abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, but the sort of more liberal states, how long is it OK to do that?
