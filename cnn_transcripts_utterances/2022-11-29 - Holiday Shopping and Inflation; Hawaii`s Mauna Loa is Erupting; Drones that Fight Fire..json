The eruption isprompting an ash fall advisory for Hawaii`s big island and surrounding waters. The good news, there`s no evacuation notice at this time. Lava flows are contained in the summit area and are not threatening to harm downslope communities according to the Hawaii Volcano Observatory. The bad news is asphalt from the volcano could damage vehicles and buildings, contaminate water supplies, disrupt sewage and electrical systems. It could even damage or kill vegetation. Mauna Loa has erupted 33 times since 1843 and covers half of the island of Hawaii and it`s only 21 miles west of one of the most active volcanoes in the world, Kilauea, which is also currently erupting. When it erupted in 2018, it destroyed more than 700 homes. All right. From lava to dragon eggs. There`s new drone technology that`s improving an effective technique used to prevent wildfires, right? But it might not be what you think, not a soaring fire extinguisher or a water dropping drone. They`re drones that drop fire in the form of, quote, dragon eggs to perform something called prescribed burning or starting a fire in order to avoid one later. But some experts say that the technique is dangerous for firefighters. CNN business producer Jon Sarlin is here with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
