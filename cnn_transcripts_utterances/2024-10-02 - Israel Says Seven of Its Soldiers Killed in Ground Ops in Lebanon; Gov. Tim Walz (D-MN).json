You have to go back to the 2006 war for when Israel last sent significant numbers of ground forces into Southern Lebanon. And to have this death toll this early in those operations is a measure of the danger, the danger on the ground there as Israel confronts Hezbollah, not just from the air, as we've seen with a significant number of airstrikes, but in ground combat.This comes as Israel is considering retaliation for last night's unprecedented missile attack. Some 180 ballistic missiles fired here at Israel, the vast majority of them shot down, but some striking the ground, including around us here in Central Tel Aviv last night. Joining me now is Democratic Congressman Jared Moskowitz of Florida. He serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Congressman, thanks so much for taking the time. REP.

Our understanding, this was in a firefight between an Israeli commando unit and presumably Hezbollah fighters on the other side of the border. This brings back echoes of the 2006 war when Israel suffered significant casualties with an uncertain outcome after the end of that war. It lasted about a month.

And we saw this actually just yesterday in Tel Aviv with a terrorist attack that's killing people, you know, that were just on the high speed rail.And so this mission is going to be dangerous. It is limited in scope. It is trying to push Hezbollah back away from the border so that people in Israel can return to their homes. Remember, Hezbollah has fired 9,000 rockets in the Northern Israel. 50,000 plus people have had to flee their homes there. So, Israel is trying to establish some sort of normal to normalize, you know, the situation in the north so that people can return to their homes, but also to reestablish deterrence with Iran and its proxies.",

That being said, I don't think we should take Israel or the United States should take any options off the table militarily as far as the response is concerned. We shouldn't telegraph what we're not willing to do.At the end of the day, if you're Iran and you don't want your nuclear facilities to be taken out, well, one way to guarantee that is to not launch 180 ballistic missiles at another country that has the ability to take out your nuclear facility. If you don't want your oil fields taken out, don't launch 180 ballistic missiles at another country. And so, you know, at the end of the day, Jim, we'll see what Israel's response is going to be. I'm sure that's going to be done with talks with the United States. But, yes, this is a very serious circumstance and Israel will have -- there will be severe repercussions for firing 180 ballistic missiles at another country. If that happened to England or France or any European country, it would be significant. We can't just brush it off and be like, okay, they fired 80-plus missiles, let's get to a ceasefire.",

Did you watch it this morning? Both campaigns are claiming victory following a surprisingly civil vice presidential election, one that we're not really used to seeing one that featured policy over personal attacks. But did the candidates do enough to sway those undecided voters, those movable voters, in a razor thin race that has seemed stuck? Let's go straight to CNN's M.J. Lee for the latest on last night's debate. So, M.J., how is the Harris campaign reacting to the debate today? M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, you know, this was the vice presidential debate, but, of course, the focus really was overwhelmingly on the two people at the top of the ticket, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, throughout the night. And what we saw was the two vice presidential nominees sparring over a number of most important issues to the voters, including, of course, the issue of foreign policy right off the top, including this unfolding situation in the Middle East, reproductive rights and immigration, two of the most politically salient issues here in the U.S., of course, and also the all important issue of the economy and inflation. There were no serious fireworks, as you mentioned, Pamela. We didn't see the two candidates doing name calling or trading personal insults or anything like that, but we did see some sparks fly towards the end of the evening when the issue of the January 6th insurrection came up and the question of whether Donald Trump believes that he lost the 2020 election, J.D. Vance would not directly answer that question. And for the Harris campaign, this was a standout moment for Governor Walz. And overnight, they have already turned this exchange into a political ad. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN), U.S. VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  He is still saying he didn't lose the election. I would just ask that. Did he lose the 2020 election? SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH), VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  Tim, I'm focused on the future.",

It's like the fighter who lost who gets up and says, I want a rematch. CNN's Steve Contorno joins us now. So, Steve, how is the Trump campaign viewing last night's performance by Senator J.D.

They believe that he has been an articulate defender of Donald Trump in many of his media appearances, and they feel like he delivered on some pretty lofty expectations last night. He has been a very good at explaining Donald Trump in ways that Donald Trump himself is somewhat unintelligible on.And you look at when he talked about Donald Trump's remarks about they're eating the pets in Springfield, Ohio, or that he has, quote, concepts of plans on healthcare. Vance was asked about both those issues last night in those remarks by Donald Trump, and he was able to not only defend Donald Trump, but also go on the offense and explain away those issues. The question, of course, is how voters ultimately will feel about J.D. Vance's performance. He entered last night with more people having an unfavorable view of him than a favorable view of him, and he certainly tried to project a different kind of personality than the caricature that Democrats have turned him into over the past few months. However, we'll have to wait and see whether voters actually respond to the J.D. Vance that appeared on their television screens last night.",

So, we're hearing from both campaigns, right, spinning this as a win for each of them. No surprise there. But we've heard from the voters who are really -- they're the ones that matter right now, and a lot of them told us that, look, they were pleasantly surprised. It seemed like a breath of fresh air. They expected a heat of back and forth and attack after attack. It really wasn't like that. Joanna, what is your take, and how much do you think the debate could impact voters in the end?

I thought Tim Walz did a good job of promoting Minnesota. I think he failed to land a few blows on J.D. Vance.And I think probably J.D. Vance woke up this morning feeling hugely relieved. He went into this, as you said earlier before the break, incredibly unpopular, startlingly unpopular with his own party, as well as voters. He wants a national abortion ban. He's admitted making up stories about immigrants eating pets, which has led to all sorts of problems in Ohio. Even the Republican governor has come out and asked him to stop doing it. And he's the man that said he wouldn't have ratified the 2020 election. So, I think he woke up feeling happy this morning. I think Don Jr., who clearly recommended him to his father woke up feeling a little bit more relieved that his man delivered. And I think what you saw is a man who's really good in a T.V. debate studio, which is what you get from learning law at Yale. But I think the polls looks as if voters were sort of split either way.

I mean, this has been a race that's been pretty stuck and stubbornly stuck for a while. TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION: Yes, I would say, like Georgia, there are enough voters to swing an election and a close election, like we expect battleground states like Georgia, like North Carolina, (INAUDIBLE). So, undecided voters do count. You mentioned J.D. Vance did not have a great answer and just admitting to the truth that Donald Trump lost the 2020 election, which is very obvious yes answer. And we know that Democrats have already cutting at replaying that clip over and over again. The question is, how many voters who are undecided are like the gentleman who you guys just showed, that that could be a deciding factor, know that usually for undecided voters, they're more motivated by the economy, the cost of goods and things like that. And that's where I think not so much the debate last night, but the overall messages from the campaigns, there has to be contrast. That's what the debate last night showed us, that when you have a good debater, like J.D. Vance, you can blur some of that contrast and make either side more (INAUDIBLE).",

And I think Tara's point about people giving him a little bit of grace for the fact he was clearly nervous is probably true. But what's sort of fascinating is how comfortable he is on big rallies, on a big stage, how comfortable he is also in a donut shop but actually how much more he's got to learn about being in a television studio. And I did think there's one point. It's fairly typical that people say, oh, the vice presidents don't really matter, they don't swing it either way. The only thing that I think is different about this election is that it is at the top of people's minds that Donald Trump has actually been -- you know, come within quarter of an inch of actually losing his life in an attempted assassination. So, President Vance is actually much more of a possibility than one would normally think. And I thought last night, actually, he appeared much more presidential than he has done to date. And also what's interesting is that the debate format in each of the three debates we've had this year has favored the younger candidates, so Trump over Biden, Kamala over Trump, and I think last night, J.D.

This is actually on top of the already hundreds of North Carolina National Guard who are working around the clock to try to clear out roads, try to get more resources into these hardest hit communities. Now, this announcement comes as President Biden in just the next hour is expected to leave the White House to travel down to see some of this devastation first hand. He will be making stops in South Carolina and North Carolina, really focusing on emergency management. He will also be taking an aerial tour of Western North Carolina, one of the hardest hits areas. Officials explaining the reason he's doing an aerial tour is because so many of the roads are inaccessible in that Asheville area, as you've seen these devastating images play out.
