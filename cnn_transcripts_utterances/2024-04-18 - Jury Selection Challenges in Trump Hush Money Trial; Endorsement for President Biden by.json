Today, two jurors who were seated earlier this week were dismissed from the trial. One over concerns about identifying information that was made public. The other related to prosecutors' concerns about the veracity of their answers. Now, the judge wants a total of 18 jurors in this case, including alternates, and right now we have five impaneled for the trial. Let's check back in with CNN chief legal analyst Laura Coates who is outside the court. Laura, you have been monitoring this since it started. What are we expecting once they get back from lunch?",

We started the day with having seven, only having to get to 11 more jurors, those including the 12, you have to have, and then the six alternates, only to find that at least two now who are already seated have now been dismissed for some type of a cause. It's important to know that after lunch, the lunch break concludes around 2.15 today, they're going to come back to questions from both the prosecution and the defense. The 18 who were sitting in what's known as the jury box now, having left the well of the audience and now sitting in the box for about a 30-minute period asking questions similar to what we saw the other day, questions perhaps about social media, questions that give you more detail about the nuance of the questions they've already answered and trying to get an understanding of whether they could indeed be impartial. Interestingly enough, there's a lot of world politics that is now playing into all of this. We had at least one juror earlier who was dismissed because he believes he could not be impartial, Jessica, because he is born and raised in Italy and that the Italian media, he says, has really put a split screen of Donald Trump and the late Prime Minister Berlusconi, who himself, had corruption and sex scandals. So now you're seeing world politics and media coming into play even in a local Manhattan courtroom.",

So, you know, even poor Gabby Marshall, who played for UConn, I'm sorry for Iowa. I mean, she got death threats. So I think people people get skittish. And I think it's totally normal. And it really underscores that this is no ordinary trial. And I think it also underscores that the process that they have adopted to select jurors or deselect them, it's got some problems. And if you're trying if you're disqualifying people after you've already vetted them, I think that's a symptom of a problem.",

And specifically, I want to ask about this other juror that was excused, because he had been impaneled on the jury and then further investigation discovered that he'd previously gotten in trouble with the law for destroying yard signs, political campaign signs. Is that something that would have come up earlier in researching a juror? Or is that just kind of something that naturally comes about later when more research is done?",

And so both sides weren't scrambling in open court with lots of people there trying to on the spot figure things out. They had time in advance to really scour the landscape to make sure that on the day of jury selection, people are properly vetted. So you're not going to have surprises like that. So again, I think it's the way this particular jury selection was set up. From my own professional opinion of looking at the questions, it struck me as a system designed to not really learn that much about prospective jurors unless they've got the gumption to raise their hand and say, you know what? It's hard for jurors to say that. I can't be fair. This happened, full disclosure. That's why a written questionnaire is so much better than the process they've adopted in this case.",

And a lot of people, people don't have the time and the opportunity to come up with, how can this work? How can this be efficient? How can jurors really feel comfortable disclosing something that can be so, you know, this case is unlike all others. This case is huge. And I think this process is underscoring. I don't think people really realize how big it really is. So hindsight is 20- 20. A lot of judges have never used written questionnaires before. So, and it's a lot like, legislation, it just becomes this process where people think it's a good idea. They sign onto it and before you know it, that's what you're doing. You get into a rhythm and, you know, that's why they're losing people though.",

The House is done for the day, meaning that no one can pull the trigger on ousting him until tomorrow at the earliest. But he's still caught between factions within his party. On one side, some rank-and- file Republicans are urging him to make it more difficult to remove a speaker by raising the necessary threshold to move forward that motion to vacate. It currently takes a single member to do so. On the other side, a number of Republican hardliners want him out over his plans for that proposed foreign aid package, which includes billions of dollars for Ukraine. Johnson has said he plans to put the bills up for a full vote this Saturday. CNN's Manu Raju is live for us on Capitol Hill. Manu, of course, all of this is unfolding with the backdrop of this foreign aid that folks have been calling on, Johnson, to put on the House floor now for several months.

Now, the question for Johnson and for the leadership, is whether or not they will decide to move forward with changing the House rules to make it harder to throw out a sitting speaker. That is under consideration right now. There are active discussions ongoing in the House to do that as part of this process to move to the final vote on this foreign aid package.That has not been resolved yet, but that has caused enormous tension in the ranks and also has caused some of the members to consider trying to move ahead, trying to force that vote, calling for Johnson's ouster as he weighs whether or not to make this significant change, this rule that was used last fall to throw out Kevin McCarthy that now these detractors on the right are using to potentially throw out Mike Johnson. Now, Mike Johnson has decided to move ahead with this foreign aid package that will be split up into several different proposals, Israel aid, Ukraine aid, Taiwan aid, and some other measures as well. But ultimately, it will be all wrapped up as one big package and sent over to the Senate. What it will not include is border security provisions that he initially said would be essential to moving forward with any Ukraine aid, but he couldn't get the votes to do that, so he set that aside and is moving that on a separate track, and those hardliners are the ones who are furious at that decision. Now, in talking to some of the people who are aligned with Mike Johnson, they are making very clear that he should take on the far right, and they are saying there should be repercussions for those who are warning that they may try to oust him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE LAWLER, (R) (NY): That committee is there to advance the cause of the majority. That committee is not there to advance the cause of Chip Roy or Thomas Massey or Ralph Norman. And so if they're incapable, if they're incapable of doing the job, they're not entitled to that spot. And so they should resign if they're unable to fulfill the duties of that committee. And if they refuse to, they should be removed. REP. ANTHONY D'ESPOSITO (R-NY): There needs to start being repercussions for those who completely alienate the will of that conference. People gave us the majority because they wanted Republicans to govern, not because they wanted Republicans to lead us to a halt. REP. DON BACON (R-NE): So they don't represent the 215 or 210 of us right. We're trying to get things done. We want to work as a team with these guys. It's not good enough just to vote no. They want to stop any vote. (END VIDEO CLIP) RAJU: Now, there's still a lot of questions about the timing of this when Marjorie Taylor Greene, for one, will try to force a vote seeking Mike Johnson's ouster. And then what will Democrats do that is still undecided at this key moment about whether to save Mike Johnson's job. Boris.",

There are several NYPD buses here because the group, they were all inside the campus. They had sent a set up encampments on the campus. And then around one o'clock, the university president ordered, asked the NYPD to come in and start making arrests. And we're told about 30 people or so at this point, at least 30 have been arrested. And they have been brought over to this area about two blocks away from the school. And this is where they're being processed. So this is why many of the protesters have gathered here. We're being told by the NYPD, now that at any moment that this group here, there's probably about 200 or so here, are going to be told that they have to leave, that they're going to have to get out of the street and onto the sidewalk.So potentially we could see more arrests out here. I want to just set the scene here for you. You can see some more of the, there are NYPD officers lined up across here, ready to move the crowd onto the sidewalk. And there are also more NYPD officers across the street here. They're all wearing helmets and potentially just ready for any activity that they're going to be ordered to take. We do expect for this group to be ordered off the streets here and onto the sidewalks and be threatened with potential arrests. That should happen at any point. You know, when you ask some of the students here what they want, you know, these are pro-Palestinian protesters. They feel that the university is not doing enough to support them, to support their views. And so they have set up camp inside the school. And things were relatively okay for quite some time. And then for whatever reason, the university president ordered that the area around, in the middle of the school be cleared. And that is when the NYPD moved in. And it's certainly an escalation in this, because for the most part, they've been allowed to be here, allowed to be inside the school, on school grounds, protesting. But today, that, for whatever reason, has changed. But as you can see here, Boris, they continue to be out here. They are chanting. They are protesting. And they came to this area to support those who have been arrested. So we wait to see here what the NYPD does with those that have gathered here on the street. But this is now, you know, going to continue likely for several hours with the NYPD outside here, as they continue to process the people who've been arrested on the bus here.",
