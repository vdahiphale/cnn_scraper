Tonight, on LAURA COATES LIVE.We're literally minutes away from, well, the unknown. We don't know if a truce that has already been extended at least once will be extended again. And if it doesn't get extended, does that mean that the fighting will begin again and perhaps how soon? The truce between Israel and Hamas set to expire at 7 a.m. local time, which is midnight Eastern, our time, a little over 59 minutes away from right now, and the only thing that can extend it is a last-minute list from Hamas of the names of hostages still to be released Thursday. But we, in the meantime, have got a lot of unanswered questions. And these questions, the answers, well, they're a matter of life or death. Israel says there are about 143 hostages that are still in Gaza. But where and who's got them? Is it Hamas or some other group? And for their desperate families, these are the real questions they're asking today. In just a moment, I'll talk to Ela Shani, a 14-year-old survivor of the massacre on October 7th. Imagine what it is she has seen, what she has experienced. At just 14 years old, her father and many of her closest friends were murdered. She saw her cousin, Amit Shani, who turned 16 in captivity, abducted, ordered into a car, and driven away. And today, 53 days later, he's free. But what about the rest of the hostages? And in the midst of all this, hate is fueling a poisonous rise in antisemitism. Jewish men, women, and children now feeling the fear. Swastikas on our streets. Allegations of antisemitism on campuses around the country. UC Berkeley, really thought to be a bastion of liberalism, they're now being sued over allegations of -- quote -- \"unchecked antisemitism.\" And today, on the Senate floor, the majority leader, Senator Chuck Schumer, the highest-ranking Jewish official in American history, in a passionate denunciation, calling the rise in antisemitism -- quote -- \"a five-alarm fire,\" and he's warning that some of the left -- on the left are unknowingly aiding and abetting bigotry. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY):  After October 7th, Jewish Americans are feeling singled out, targeted, and isolated. In many ways, we feel alone. Not long ago, many of us marched together for black and brown lives. We stood against anti-Asian hatred. We protested bigotry against the LGBTQ community. We fought for reproductive justice out of the recognition that injustice against one oppressed group is injustice against all. But apparently, Mr. President, in the eyes of some, this principle does not extend to the Jewish people. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They've more than likely move the remaining hostages that they have control of, and they think they can fight the Israelis on a better footing after the pause is over. Israel has had this operational pause, which slowed momentum, but it also has allowed them to generate some intelligence, not only from the normal kind of intelligence capabilities like signals intelligence or human intelligence or overhead platforms, but actually getting some information from the hostages.

House Republicans are promising to put their feet to the fire over claims of growing antisemitism on campus. And now, there's a new lawsuit filed by Jewish students, faculty, and alumni.

And my understanding is that UCPD (ph) is not investigating these as hate crimes. So, it's one thing to call it a hate crime. It's another to not even investigate it as a hate crime.And just to give you a comparison, there was an Islamophobic hit-and- run incident down at Stanford recently. And my understanding is that Stanford, they don't know who the suspect is, yet they are still investigating it as a hate crime. So, I think that this further illustrates that there's a disconnect between issues affecting Jewish students, what policies are in place, and why it appears to me that the university is selectively enforcing the policies as they see fit.",

I hadn't planned on doing a second season and -- but there were about a thousand voicemails from callers, from listeners during the first season that I hadn't listened to. So, a couple of months ago, even though I wasn't going to do a show, I felt that the least I could do was listen to all these people who called in.So, I listened to about 46 hours of people's calls, and it was one of the most moving experiences of my life. And it motivated me to start going through these boxes of stuff that belonged to my dad and my mom and my brother, which I'd stopped going through when the first season of the podcast ended because it was so overwhelming. And literally, the first box I opened up when I went down the basement to start doing this again, turned out to be a box of my dad's papers. And the first file I opened and took out of paper was this essay he wrote 40 years ago entitled \"The Importance of Grieving.\" And in it, he was writing about what happens to kids who don't -- aren't able to grieve as children when they experience a loss and the ripple effects of that throughout their entire life. And it's literally what happened to me. And I just found it, kind of this extraordinary moment, really just stunning moment that -- what is the chances that I would be reading this, that my dad wrote, and it relates to me. It compelled me. It made me realize how little I understood about grief and really that I frankly never allowed myself to grief, that I buried it as a child when my dad died and when my brother died. And like a lot of people, I just have been kind of running away from it. I realized that's not something -- it doesn't go away and it doesn't stay buried forever.",

That wasn't enough for the Israelis. That's why we've had this delay.
