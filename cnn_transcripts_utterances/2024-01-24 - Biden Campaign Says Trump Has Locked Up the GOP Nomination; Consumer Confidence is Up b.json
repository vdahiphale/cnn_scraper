Does this indicate that the campaign is moving into general election mode today, and more specifically how does that change? What does that look like for you that's different from yesterday?",

Inflation is down, 14 million jobs created, capping the cost of insulin, reducing the price of energy, reducing the price of health care.But more importantly, we have to let them know that we understand that things are not where we want to be, and we're going to continue the president's moral philosophy which is to build the economy from the middle out and the bottom up. And the contrast to that is to continue what Donald Trump and Republicans propose, and that is to build an economy that rewards the very wealthy and our corporations, and that does not build a solid middle class. And so, we get to go out and remind people of what has happened over the last three years, and tell them what we want to do in the next four.",

Protesters in general are not a new thing, but this was pretty intense and I am going to ask you about it because it does speak to a very important part of the Biden coalition, some of these sort of staunch progressives who he's going to need to win in 2024.

We allow others with different opinions to voice that opinion. We don't silence them. We don't bully them. We don't ask people in the crowd to rough them up like President Trump did during his rallies.And the president's taking the issue very, very seriously. His role as Commander in Chief is one of the roles that is most solemn, and it's a role that he thinks about and works on every day in terms of getting to the right answer. And so, we will continue to push for peace and that we protect innocent lives wherever they are. And I think that we will again talk to the American people about where we are.

That's something that several of the Haley supporters we've spoken with have voiced concerns about.Now look, she is putting her money where her mouth is. She is already up on the air, part of a $4 million ad buy with two ads. One of them touting her experience as governor, but the other talking about a refrain that we have heard from the former governor about America not wanting a rematch of Trump and Biden.

Now whenever we ask that question, I sort of hesitate to figure out which one I should focus on first. I mean, 54 percent saying yes, he is still fit is wow.

It's one of the reasons why I like Ronna McDaniel, she's a friend, but I actually disagree with her assessment here that we should wrap this up. You need to give voters like that, who have concerns, a chance to voice their opposition. Because if they don't do it in the primary, they may have a trouble actually coming around to voting for Donald Trump should he be the nominee in the general election.So, I'd say this could be -- ultimately, come down at the end of the day, between Trump versus Biden, which candidate is able to hold the core of their base together and their core party. We saw one of the challenges for Donald Trump in 2020 in states like here in New Hampshire. I happened to be on the ballot with him that year, was a supporter that year. It's a challenge because you -- not only do you have independents, but upwards of 10 percent to 15 percent of Republicans at least who may have trouble voting for him.
