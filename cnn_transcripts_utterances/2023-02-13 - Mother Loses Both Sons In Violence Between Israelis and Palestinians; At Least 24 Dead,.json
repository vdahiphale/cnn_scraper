And while there are no signs of surrender the Ukrainians say that look, there have been some fierce battles, particularly in and around that area and particularly, in two towns -- two to the north and two to the west of Bakhmut.They also say that look, their access in and out is increasingly coming under fire. And now you have the head of the Wagner private military contractor -- the Russian private military group saying that they have captured this town called Krasna Hora, which is just a few miles to the north of Bakhmut. All of this collectively suggests that the Russians are, in fact, making some progress and actually surrounding Bakhmut. And we've seen this before in so many other towns along the front lines, Christine. No major breakthroughs but just a slow, grinding move forward by the Russians. The Ukrainians, for their part, say that look, it's not the Russians grinding down the Ukrainians, it's actually the opposite and that the Ukrainians are grinding down the Russians' ability to actually launch more larger-scale attacks in that area. But that seems to be a pretty optimistic view of what is a pretty difficult situation right there, right now -- Christine.",

Jurors last week heard dramatic testimony from Murdaugh's housekeeper who described what she witnessed the day his wife and son were killed. CNN's Randi Kaye has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RANDI KAYE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  There was a dramatic moment in court when the defense started pushing for a mistrial. It was denied by the judge. But they were pushing for that mistrial after the prosecution started questioning the Murdaugh's former housekeeper about Maggie Murdaugh's state of mind and how Maggie Murdaugh felt about the money situation in their marriage. The defense basically said that is hearsay because Maggie Murdaugh is no longer here and cannot testify about that on her own. But much of the day the housekeeper spent testifying about what she saw Alex Murdaugh wearing the day of the murders. Both the prosecution and the defense asked her about this and here's what she said.",

TURRUBIATE-SIMPSONKAYE (on camera):  All of this matters because the prosecution has been laying the groundwork that Alex Murdaugh allegedly showered and changed his clothes after killing his family, so that's why there was so much talk about the clothing. Now, the housekeeper did testify that she found a pair of khaki pants that Alex Murdaugh had been wearing the day of the murder. She found those the following morning. And on cross-examination, the defense asked her did you see any blood stains on those pants? Did you find any blood stains or any blood in the shower? And her answer was no. Looking ahead, the state expects to rest its case on Wednesday. The defense will pick it up from there. And they say their defense case could likely last another week.
