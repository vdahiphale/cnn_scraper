I appreciate your company as we continue our breaking news coverage of Israel at war.And we begin with a warning from the United Nations that we are on the verge of the abyss in the Middle East. The U.N. secretary general calling on Hamas to immediately release the hostages it has been holding since its terror attacks in Israel on October 7th. The IDF now says more than 1,400 people in Israel have been killed by Hamas since the attacks began. In retaliation, Israel's military says it's preparing for combined and coordinated strikes from air, sea, and land. But we still have no word on exactly when that offensive might begin. The U.N. is also calling for immediate humanitarian access in Gaza, which has been under intense airstrikes during the past week. Palestinian health authorities say the death toll is now surpassed 2,600, including more than 700 children as tens of thousands of people moved southward for safety. Diplomats by racing to try and stop the crisis from getting any worse to our secretary of state, Anthony Blinken, making visits to Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan. After meetings in Cairo, he promised that the crucial Rafah border crossing will be addressed soon and opens soon. And that progress is being made. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: I had very good conversations both with the crown prince in Saudi Arabia and here in what Egypt with President El-Sisi, I've heard good ideas with some of the things that we need to do moving forward including ideas of assistance to Palestinians in Gaza who are in need, but also good and important conversations about the future and where we hope all timothy together we can bring this in a much more positive way.

The former prime minister of Israel, Naftali Bennett, says that his country is eager to hit back. He shares his take on what could be to come in the Hamas Israel conflict. That's when we return. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [22:36:40] HOLMES: Aid groups say conditions in Gaza are deteriorating rapidly. The enclave, of course, has been cut off from water, electricity, fuel, and everything else, food as, well for days now as Israeli airstrikes continue to pound towns and cities. Tens of thousands of Palestinians, perhaps hundreds of thousands, have already fled from northern Gaza to the south to a safe and expected Israeli ground incursion which will likely start around the north. Israel's ambassador to the U.S. tells CNN that Israel is working with the United Nations to establish a humanitarian zone in southern Gaza. And, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters earlier that he believes the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt will be open at some point, perhaps soon. The Rafah checkpoint is currently the only viable way in or out of Gaza, after Israel declared a complete siege of the territory. The U.S. President Joe Biden says he believes Israel will follow the rules of war in its conflict with Hamas. This was in an interview with CBS program \"60 Minutes\". He also said that he believes Israel, quote, has to respond to the attacks that killed 1,400 people, including 30 Americans that issued this call for restraint. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Another full on war between Hezbollah and Israel, one worse perhaps in the more than month-long battle they fought in 2006.Throughout the day, Hezbollah fighters targeted Israeli military positions on the border. Firing guided missiles, and communication observation and surveillance equipment, and also hitting some Israeli towns, killing one Israeli civilian and wounding several others. Israel fired artillery and launched air strikes on what it called Hezbollah military infrastructure. As a result of the fighting, Israel declared a four kilometer deep closed military zone along the border to keep civilians away. In the afternoon, a volley of rockets was fired into Israel most intercepted by the Iron Dome, but it wasn't Hezbollah but rather the military wing of Hamas that claimed responsibility. At roughly the same time, a rocket hit the headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping force, just north of the border, slamming in to the helipad there, no one was injured. The U.N. is trying to determine where the rocket was fired from. All of this doesn't amount to war yet, but it's getting dangerously close. Ben Wedeman, CNN, Southern Lebanon. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So people are going out to protest nonetheless, many of them carrying placards protesting the ban itself. So there is a strong feeling, but you're quite right, Michael, France is a particular country. You have to bear in mind that it has not only what is estimated to be the largest Jewish population outside of Israel or the United States, but also, of course, the largest Muslim population in Western Europe. That has led to fears that there could be divisions that you are seeing there, all of that motion and violence could spread here. In fact, when Emmanuel Macron spoke to the French people in his televised address last week it was to urge the country to remain united and to avoid bringing the anger or the issues of the Middle East that home. So far that has seemed to work, there has been those protests, there have been those protests, there has been a significant rise in antisemitic acts and speech here in France, but, again, a very strong police presence. The sentinel patrols the street, the visible police presence they hope will try to deter any actual violence, any further violence beyond what we saw on Friday when a schoolteacher was tragically killed in an attack that has now been linked with events in the Middle East -- Michael.",

The one thing the Chinese have not said in all their official pronouncements or statements is the word Hamas. They have not mentioned this term and they have not really mentioned in their initial reaction the Israeli casualties and suffering by the heinous acts launched by Hamas on the 7th of October, and that obviously did not go unnoticed by Israeli and its allies. Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, was also visiting China last week when it happened with a bipartisan delegation. He told us he actually felt compelled to raise this point with Chinese leader Xi Jinping when they met in person. That was why, later, we saw a tweet statement from the foreign ministry expressing condolences to civilian victims and also condemning violence against civilians from all sides. But that is very much for reflection of China's long-standing policy and priority in this region, even as it tries to grow its influence and assert its influence in the region. Remember, they recently brokered that deal between the Saudis and saying that the Chinese foreign minister has been very active and getting on the phone with all the regional powers, not just around the Saudi Arabia, but also Turkey and the Palestinians of course, and also the Israelis even though at a relatively low level. But, at the end of the day, a lot of analysts say they lack the expertise and experience in dealing with, perhaps, the world's most complex and sensitive issue. So they kind, of in a way, fall back to their default position of those long-standing positions of advocating for Palestinian statehood. They may not be the only ones saying that, but, in the short term, that obviously is not going to happen and then there is all of that ideological indoctrination, if you will, -- explain when the Israeli embassy this brutally attacked in broad daylight and on Friday there is not much sympathy on Chinese social media for him, Michael.",
