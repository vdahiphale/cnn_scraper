And one of the big questions has been the process all along. This is not just a sequential debate -- how to sequence his agenda -- it also carries significance because when Congress gets -- goes down one road and it does not go its way it could all collapse if the process is not executed to perfection. They'll need perfection given the narrowness in the House Republican majority and the fact that in the Senate they can only afford to lose three Republican votes on any party line vote. But not only does Donald Trump want to add all those issues into potentially one bill but also the debt limit. Raise the national debt limit with spending cuts as well. Complex issues that they want to get done as soon as the first quarter of this year. But when Trump emerged from this meeting, he expressed confidence that the party would be in line. And also Sen. John Thune, who I asked him out of this meeting whether or not he is on board with the House's approach, wants to put this altogether in one big bill even as Thune has suggested narrower bills in order to score some early wins and punt on more complicated issues like taxes for later. Are you in line with what Trump and Mike Johnson want -- just one bill? SEN. JOHN THUNE (R-SD), SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  We're in -- all in line with getting the result.
