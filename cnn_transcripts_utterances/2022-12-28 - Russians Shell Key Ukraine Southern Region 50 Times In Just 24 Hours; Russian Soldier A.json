Tonight, one Russian soldier is now accused of killing his commander.Plus, incoming Congressman George Santos under even more scrutiny tonight. A district attorney now looking into the New York Republican's litany of lies as CNN's KFILE uncovers even more discrepancies about his education. And a COVID crackdown. The U.S. announcing it will now require travelers from China, where COVID is raging, to show a negative test before entering the country. What's China's response? Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. I'm Sara Sidner, in for Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, 50 rocket strikes in just 24 hours. That's the extent of Russia's brutal onslaught in the Kherson region of southern Ukrainian according to a Ukrainian official. And now, civilians there are being urged to evacuate immediately. It comes as intense fighting is underway in eastern Ukraine where Russian troops are moving out of a key city of Kreminna, according to a Ukrainian military official, who says it could be a crucial first towards cutting off Russia's logistic lines in the east. All of it happening amid reports of chaos within the Russian military. Russian troops abandoned on the battlefield and taking incoming fire from one of their own tanks. That is according to a newly obtained phone intercept that Ukraine's defense intelligence says it from one irate Russian soldier, though CNN cannot independently verify that or when the call happened. But take a listen to this. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP, INTERCEPTED RUSSIAN SOLDIER PHONE CALL) SOLDIER 1 (through translator):  We only have 700 men left. A third battalion joined us. Then there were three strikes, three rockets, and they high-tailed it out of here. They just abandoned us. They just (EXPLETIVE DELETED) ran off. SOLDIER 2 (through translator):  That's (EXPLETIVE DELETED) up. SOLDIER 1 (through translator):  Seven of us were left alone. We walked half the day. Then we just found a spot to lie low for the night. We didn't sleep at all. We waited for the first sunlight and set off again, eventually coming across our own guys. There were only 30 of them left. Our tank, our own tank was shooting at us, 17 of us up real good. (END AUDIO CLIP)",

There doesn't seem to be any logic to it, and often the victims are the most vulnerable.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WEDEMAN (voice-over):  Fighting grinds on in Ukraine in a largely unchanged front line. Russia's failures on the battlefield have pushed the Kremlin toward escalating strikes on civilian infrastructure. The latest target: maternity hospital in Kherson. This is where we put women and children, says this head obstetrician Inna Filofeeva. When the bombs fell, women fled to the basement with their newborn babies. We helped those who just gave birth, she says. They're the type of women who will go where they have to go with their children. Everyone was here and worked together very quickly. Somehow, no one was hurt. But the attack spreads fear among the few who remain. I was thinking about that baby that was lying there, says Olena Yatsyk, another obstetrician, about our women, about the children we are welcoming to this world. It's all scary. We are giving birth here, and someone is taking it away. For what? Whether from mortars, tanks, rockets or artillery, Kherson has felt the full force of Russian shelling in recent days. The southern Ukrainian city was liberated in November from occupying forces still eager to make their presence felt. [19:05:10] In Kyiv, French defense minister met Ukrainian counterpart. The pair laid a wreath at the capitol's wall of remembrance. According to the U.N., as of December 26th, 6,884 Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the war began. Plus, nearly 11,000 injured. And the U.N. says the actual number of dead is probably much, much higher. (END VIDEOTAPE) WEDEMAN (on camera):  And this evening, we are hearing reports that there were multiple attempted Russian strikes on Dnipro, Kharkiv, and Mykolaiv, apparently using drones.

The Ukrainian military says that Russia is in the process of leaving Kreminna and that the ferocious Russian assault in Bakhmut is not breaking the Ukrainian's positions. Those are two key cities in the east. Does any of this mean we are any closer to some sort of an end to what is now a protracted war?",

But as President Zelenskyy said today in his address to the country, there have been over 1,800 cities that have been retaken by the Ukrainian military. Kreminna and Bakhmut are certainly strongholds, and they are the key to other locations in the Donbas region.But from a tactical perspective, you have to gain those territorial key points in order to make more headway. It doesn't mean the end. Certainly there's a whole lot more fighting going on. But it does mean that the Ukrainian forces have been continuously successful in the Donbas front. And it's causing the Russian forces to maneuver forces between the Donbas and the Kherson region. Because Russia cannot afford to lose either of those territories, as President Putin said today when he disregarded the potential for peace talks and said we have to keep these four territories. And, of course, President Zelenskyy of Ukraine said there is no way that's happening because we have been so successful. So, yeah, those are Kreminna and Bakhmut, critically important tactical battles. But it's certainly not the end of all this. SIDNER:  All right. That's helpful. Doug, Kherson, as you just heard, has been enduring some 50 Russian rocket strikes in just the past 24 hours. And we heard from Ben Wedeman, one of the targets was a maternity ward. Months ago, Putin declared Kherson a part of Russia. What is the logic of destroying it, then? DOUGLAS LONDON, FORMER CIA COUNTERTERRORISM CHIEF FOR SOUTH &amp; SOUTHWEST ASIA:  Thanks, Sara. It makes no sense to us, right? It doesn't make any military sense. But Putin is losing control on the battlefield. What he can't afford to lose control of is the information war. And this is part of it. Putin needs to come out to appear strong, certain, in charge. And he's striking back with memories of Leningrad and Stalingrad during the siege in World War II, to show that Russia will not let the enemy take their territory, having said Kherson is Russia forever. So, this is very consistent for what we'll see. We'll see these actions. General Hertling mentioned the retaliation, the need to show a projection of power and strength. He's using the young people at home. Military-aged males are leaving the country. He's got to aim for that generation that wants stability, that wants a strongman, that remembers the financial meltdown of 1998. So we'll see more of this over the course of events.",

The memo dated just days before the Supreme Court halted the end of the COVID era policy that allows U.S. border officials to swiftly expel migrants. This as thousands continue to flock to the border despite no guarantees. Rosa Flores is OUTFRONT in El Paso tonight. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Four-year-old Ajerde (ph) and his dad Angelo Sanchez are in line at this El Paso Catholic Church that turned into a migrant shelter, hoping for a warm place tonight. Sanchez says he left his native Columbia because his son was hungry. He says his whole breaks when his son asked for food and he can't give him any food. The wind burn on Ajerde's face, a sign he injured the recent frigid conditions out in the elements without a jacket. So, he describes that this is what his son was wearing throughout the journey. Sanchez and his son are part of the growing number of migrants who despite the threat of Title 42, which allows border agents to swiftly expel some migrants to Mexico, they are flocking to the southern border, turning themselves into authorities and some are allowed to stay in the United States pending their immigration cases. Tuesday's Supreme Court order keeps Title 42 in place while the legal challenges play out in court. It's deemed a win for the Republican-led states who want to keep the Trump era pandemic public health rule. But even Joe Biden says its end is overdue.",

This is what else the ministry affairs spokesperson had to say.He said, quote, China has always believed that the measures taken by countries to prevent the epidemic should be scientific and moderate and should not affect normal people to people exchanges. But, Sara, the irony here is that since the very start of the pandemic China has had some of the strictest border controls in the world, but now that China is finally opening up and cases here are surging -- well, other countries are getting nervous. So, in addition to the U.S., so far, Japan, India, Japan, Taiwan and Italy have all put COVID testing requirements in place. In fact, Taiwan and Japan said if the traveler from China tests positive for COVID upon arrival, they'll have to quarantine for several days. Now, the big concern from countries like the U.S. is a lack of data from China that could help detect new variants. But the global consortium that maintains a data base of coronavirus sequences, they said all the genome sequences China has shared so far do closely resemble the variants already circulating in other parts of the world.
