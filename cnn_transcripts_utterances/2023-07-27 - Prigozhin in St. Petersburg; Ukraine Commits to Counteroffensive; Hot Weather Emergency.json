He is charged with killing three women, and authorities believe he could be responsible for more murders.A fiery rescue caught on camera in San Diego. Take a look at this dramatic video. A FedEx driver pulled a man from a burning car after the vehicle veered off the highway, and slammed into a guardrail. The car's driver seriously injured his leg and so he couldn't walk, as the car was engulfed in flames. So, the FedEx driver drags him to safety and stays with him until first responders arrive. The investigation - the crash is now under investigation. And to a nail biter at the World Cup. The U.S. Women's National Team rallied to come back from an early deficit to a 1-1 tie against the Netherlands. Both teams are among the best in the world and faced each other when the U.S. took the title in 2019. Team USA now faces Portugal on Monday for a spot in the knockout stage. Omar.",

      "sentences": "My main question is, what were we doing tying with the Netherlands? It's a long - it's a long World Cup. We'll see what happens.Now, shifting gears. New this morning, Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin spotted inside Russia. This is the first time the mercenary group founder has been seen in public in Russia since he led an armed mutiny against the country's military leadership last month. In this image he's alongside an African dignitary on the sidelines of the Russia Africa Summit in St. Petersburg. You can see it behind me. The same summit Vladimir Putin addressed just this morning. CNN's Nic Robertson is following this for us. So, Nic, how significant is this given what Prigozhin led not too long ago at this point? NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Yes, a mutiny, where Putin said that there were going to be severe punishments. And the punishments seemed to be that Prigozhin was going to be sent in exile to Belarus, which is where some of his mercenaries have shown up and where he was seen at dusk giving them a pep talk about a week ago. But here he is, within a few miles of President Putin, back in Russia. We know that CIA Director Bill Burns has said that he's aware that Prigozhin is both in Belarus and he moves in and out of Russia. But here he is in a very high-profile position. And I think one of the things we can take away from this is that Prigozhin, as boss of Wagner, that has Kremlin-backed interests in some African countries, central African republic, Mozambique, Mali, Libya, Sudan, just to name but a few, is putting out a very clear public statement that he is still in business with these countries. And this kind of backs up a message, a voice note, that he sent out to an African broadcaster just earlier this week where he said, look, Wagner is still going to do business in Africa. We're still out there. The only thing we can't do is cut across Russia's national interest, which appears to be part of a slap on the wrist from Putin for the mutiny. But the fact that he can be in public, mixing with these dignitaries, pushing Wagner's interest perhaps speaks to the fact that Wagner and the Kremlin and Prigozhin himself are so tied together in these business interests, gold, diamond, other things, in some of these nations that they can - that Putin cannot untangle him that fast. We just don't know the limits of the constrains that have been put on Wagner, other than he is running out of some cash, according to the British ministry of defense.",

The heat waves - from the heat waves on the land to the heat waves in our ocean, we are here on a follow-up story for the ecological disaster that is literally unfolding before our eyes. Namely the dying of our corral reefs, our precious corral reefs. Remember, corral act as a natural barrier from storm surge and hurricanes here in south Florida. They also provide billions of dollars to the tourism industry within the state.Unfortunately, the Corral Restoration Foundation has found 100 percent corral mortality in some of the southern lower keys. So we are kind of bracing for impact, per se, here in the Key Biscayne region and into the Miami-Dade area as well. Now, did you know that 90 percent of excess greenhouse warming is absorbed by the oceans, like the one you see behind me? And it was very apparent this week because water temperatures reached near global record highs. So, 101 degrees reported in the Everglades. Just incredible, incredible amounts of heat. And, you know, it's not just the corral that is being impacted by this marine heatwave. It's also fish. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission actually reporting that some of this warm water is actually reducing the level of oxygen in the water. So they're seeing fish kills. They're also noticing that sharks are changing their behaviors. They're seeking cooler waters. It's all interconnected, right? Well, we're on site here to determine just how much this warm water will impact the corral reef ecosystem. We're going to go diving later with some of the experts in the field and we'll report back throughout the day.",

But first let's bring up that statement that was released by Circleville PD just yesterday announcing the termination of their officer, Ryan Speakman. The department, in their statement, which you can read for yourself, but in short, basically saying that this review board determined that the K-9 policy was followed. However, that Speakman's actions, quote, did not meet the standards and expectations of their police officers. So, we've cued up this video that we're about to show you. And what you'll see here is Ohio State Troopers holding the driver of this big rig, Jadarrius Rose, at gunpoint. Then you will see Circleville Police arrive on scene.
