It is for this reason that the presidents personal attorney's do not know the precise number of pages in the discovered materials. Fine.

The standard in law is wasn't worse than what Trump, did the standard in law is, was it illegal? And if you take the rhetoric that these guys were using against Trump, he had a lot of mainstream journalism talking about normal people who went to jail for doing much less than what Trump did. Well, normal people going to jail for much less than what Biden did, too, and that is just an enormously difficult political thing. And on this timeline, I agree with what everybody has said, they had two months. It was November that this ball got rolling, you would think, as a matter of confidence, whatever you want to blame on staff, you would just see the enormity of the political problem that could come from this and say, let's search everywhere, now.

Whenever there's a government shutdown and a government shutdown is just stupid -- let me just stipulate that. But -- and they're bad -- they're bad for the country, they're bad for our solvency and all that.But there's this tactic where the federal government will shut down the most popular aspects of government first to sort of highlight the problem with the shutdown so like social security offices, the Washington Monument, national parks -- the things where people actually interact with the federal government and I think that's part of the thinking here, learning sort of bad lessons from previous shutdowns. I kind of -- what I find fascinating about this is you had four years under Trump, you know -- wild, hypocritical, unprincipled spending by Republicans. And now -- and everyone said, you know, the Tea Parties are dead, you know, fiscal responsibility is dead and then Republicans find themselves, many of the same people who are very Trumpy find themselves impossible not to go back to a sort of a Tea Party stance of like limited government stuff. And the only thing that bothers me about it is I welcome more fiscal responsibility but none of them are willing to understand -- admit the hypocrisy for the inconsistency of it.

I mean you saw the president two weeks ago with Senate Minority Leader McConnell in Kentucky while Kevin McCarthy is getting dragged on the floor and having to go through 15 votes ultimately.You know -- so the White House knows that they may have some allies in some Senate Republicans who want some cover from the new House majority themselves because they don't want to be associated with the small group of the Freedom Caucus that is effectively running the House floor and pushing for things like what we talked about on the debt ceiling and threatening the country to default. And so it's going to be interesting where that goes and if that relationship sours further, whether that just sort of drives everything off a cliff or if that's something that, you know, the White House and the Senate can align enough that there can be some pressure to at least get things to the floor in the House where you get some moderate Republicans and Democrats to move legislation. M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Democrats and the White House have been plenty happy to draw the distinction between Senate Republicans who can be reasonable, they can be adults in Washington. And then there's crazy guys over there, the House Republicans. But I think when we're talking about Kevin McCarthy and the different negotiating tactics that he has used, the different concessions he made (INAUDIBLE) when it comes to the debt ceiling, that's fine. That's fine to talk about. But I think the real issue for him is this fight is about to expose the really tenuous position that he is in and that he is now a House Speaker without much power and without much control because what is to say that these members, these colleagues that did agree to these concessions won't just suddenly take them back? He can't say well, we had a deal. We had a deal so that I could become House Speaker and you better stick to that deal. There's just no mechanism for him to enforce those concessions.",

She wanted to get out there, get out front, start raising the money, try to get some support because it is quite likely that some major constituent groups might get behind another candidate when it is all said and done. It's quite likely that the establishment might get behind another candidate like an Adam Schiff. So there are other candidates that could get support in ways that I think Representative Porter knows that might now -- she might not get it but what she can do is harness her ability to kind of go viral on social media, raise money nationally and I think she hopes she can build up a war chest and put herself ahead.

Now, many presidents have made the pilgrimage to this historic site, but Biden's visit marks the very first time a sitting U.S. President has addressed the Sunday morning church service.

And these are the numbers that I think his team is probably going to be looking at when it comes to the black vote. You've seen since 2018 a little bit of a dip here nationally in Democratic support and a little bit of a rise in Republican support. But I think the more important numbers are at the state level.
