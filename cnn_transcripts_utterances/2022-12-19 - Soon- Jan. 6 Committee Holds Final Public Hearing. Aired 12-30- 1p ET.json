We all watch that day in horror. There's a reason that you're sitting here with four people who are senior White House officials for that President speaking out against him like that, in and of itself is incredibly unprecedented because of what he allowed to happen that day.

He chose not to act until at the very last second, you know, he sent something out. But let's also not forget, later that day, he sent out a tweet saying that this was a day to be remembered. He kind of seemed like it was a celebratory occasion to him. So he really can't have any defense. TAPPER",

We've lost a lot of wonderful, principled Republicans. As a result of the events of January 6th, we've lost Peter Meijer in Congress, we've lost Rep. Gonzalez and Ohio, I think about all those people who took a stand for what was right.And yet all of these other individuals, there's been no accountability for them in terms of what they did that was wrong.

Or in fact, they decided to spread conspiracies put bad information in front of him, give him ridiculous legal advice, which is what allowed it to happen.And I think that's the moment we have to kind of step back and remember, in all this, because we've learned so much through these Committee hearings, is that people in a position of power, who could have done the right thing, just time and time again didn't and allowed this to go as far as it did.",

And then on the other end, Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, they were very much on Trump's side pushing him to overturn the results. And then you have members of the Trump campaign Jason Miller, former senior adviser Bill Stepien, the Trump campaign manager, Justin Clark, former senior adviser also testified to the Committee behind closed doors, Alex Cannon, the former Trump campaign lawyer and Matt Morgan, former Trump campaign General Counsel, they could have provided significant testimony on what was going on behind closed doors and the legal advice that the former president was getting. And then you have Trump White House officials. Many of these offered just bombshell testimony to the Committee including Cassidy Hutchison, the former aide to Meadow. She said many things that were pretty explosive, as you'll recall at the time, including the story about Trump lunging at the driver of his secret service motorcade. And then you have Matthew Pottinger, the former NSC official who testified alongside Sarah Matthews, the former deputy White House press secretary who was just on our air and Kayleigh McEnany, the former White House press secretary. And over at DOJ, several DOJ officials testified to the Committee whether it be in public or behind closed doors, including Steve Engel, the former head of OLC, Jeffrey Clark, former acting head of the DOJ Civil Division. He has been a big target of the Committee and efforts to overturn the election results, also BJay Pak, the former U.S. attorney who abruptly resigned after the election. He was told that he would be fired so he decided to resign. And then Richard Donoghue, former Acting Deputy Attorney General, Jeff Rosen, the former acting Attorney General at the time during the election, and of course, William Barr, former Attorney General, who you'll recall, said during his hearing that Trump was detached from reality. And then Pence staff, Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg, Mark Short, Gregory Jacob, five pleaded the 5th, did not exactly cooperate with the Committee, plead the 5th.

We've been told that what we've reported thus far, which is conspiracy to defraud obstruction of a proceeding, insurrection, is really just a small piece of the pie. So what other names are they going to put out there?We've also been hearing that it was likely that the Committee would refer to the House Ethics Committee, the Republican members of Congress who were subpoenaed, but did not show up for their to testify. I just want to point out of those five, one of them, Mo Brooks is no longer going to be a member of Congress.

It has a high bar. You have to prove intent. So what evidence are they going to put forward to support that beyond what we already know, and the other two claims? Also, you know, they have done all these interviews with Secret Service agents since our last hearing. I want to know what came out of those interviews the transcripts from Tony Ornato, Secret Service agent who worked in the Trump White House. Do they provide any evidence to support what they have said that there was perjury, there was witness tampering?

So there's only so much they can get done.And at the end of the day, they've gotten as far as the Electoral College Reform Act for the Electoral College count, doing one of many things, which is saying the vice president cannot judge or overturn certification results. So they have -- they've got something to show for the end of this year legislatively, probably not as much as they would like.
