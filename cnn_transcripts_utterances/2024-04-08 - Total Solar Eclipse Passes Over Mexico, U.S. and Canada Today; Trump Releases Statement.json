Millions of people are waking up to check the forecast and to make sure their glasses are ready for this total solar eclipse moment soon, making its way across Mexico, the United States and Canada.More than 32 million people in the U.S. will be in the path of totality, which stretches from Texas up to the northeast. Along the path, the moon will appear to completely cover the sun for about 3.5 to 4 minutes. And for people not perfectly positioned for today's event, you should still be able to get a show of some sort. 99 percent of Americans will be able to see at least a partial eclipse today, and this is definitely one of those must see, do not forget, mark the calendar, set a timer, take a moment to enjoy types of events because after today, it will be another 20 years before a total eclipse will be visible from the United States.

So, I'm hoping that you can help me. Because these are kind of cool but like I could see better with these, and this is where we have our public service announcement. Friends if you're going to watch the eclipse make sure that the real glasses, like if your finger can go through the glasses, that will let you know that those are not the ones that you want to use so that, you, can protect your eyes.These are the ones that you want. Make sure they fit the international standard, and these can give you a third eye of wisdom. You can see right here in the center, it says eclipse times two. Well, that's because Kerrville will have two eclipses in a matter of six months. We have the map from NASA. Take a look, because this is really fascinating. X marks the spot. There was an annular eclipse back in October, and you see the path of totality there. There's another eclipse today and you see the path of totality. And in the center, that's where Kerrville is. Now, I talked to the mayor of this city about this. She was very excited. She's welcoming people from all over the world. She has already declared a disaster in the town, not because she thinks it will be a disaster, even though they do say that this town has been getting calls about, well, is this going to be the apocalypse? Is this the end of in the point of no return? No, friends, nothing like that. They are going to have counter-flow, according to the mayor, once totality is over to make sure that everyone can get out of town safely. And the mayor also told me that she tapped into the supernatural to make sure that these 100,000 people that are expected to be here will get a good show. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And the reason for that is we have the potential for some strong to severe thunderstorms later on today. Now, the good news is the bulk of those storms will actually be after the eclipse. But we all know a lot of those clouds are going to start building ahead of time, and it's how quickly can those clouds increase during the eclipse time that's going to be a concern. But also after as everyone is leaving the event is over. Maybe they're heading back home. They may end up encountering some of these strong to severe thunderstorms. That will include large hail, damaging winds and the potential for some strong thunderstorms, especially through the evening hours. So, let's say you're traveling to three, even four hours away, you may encounter some of those. But, again, we also have some really good spots too. Take, for example, Indianapolis. A lot of those clouds are going to be decreasing through the day. So, even if you wake up this morning and you look outside and you see those clouds, don't worry, we are going to start to see a lot of those fade away during the day today.

That statement is now out. At question has been would Donald Trump come out with a definitive position on where he stands on a federal national ban on abortion? Over the last several months, he has talked about possibly a 15-week ban. We now have the video. We've been going through it.CNN's Alayna Treene is with us now.

And that's kind of where this video leaves us. It doesn't give many answers into exactly what -- how many weeks. We've heard Donald Trump repeatedly say -- or float, I should say, a 15-week or 16-week abortion ban. This says that it's up to the states. And, again, he does take credit for stacking the Supreme Court with three conservative justices in overturning Roe versus Wade, but also doesn't go as far as many people on the right and in the conservative movement wanted him to do. And so that's kind of where this statement leaves us this morning. Of course, we're still going through it. But I think, you know, again Donald Trump isn't leaning very hard into a national abortion ban. He is saying, look, that this is a state's issue. And it's also the kind of statement we saw his team release last week in news of the Florida law, the six-week abortion ban being slated to take effect in a couple weeks now. They had said, look, Donald Trump believes in preserving life, again, another vague statement from the campaign, but also insisted that he believes it should be a state's decision.

He will have the right to vote on the constitutional amendment when it comes up in November. They have refused so far to say what he will do. Instead, they really are trying to say that this about the state's decision, that, for many years, conservatives, people of the pro-life movement have wanted abortion to be the states, that he overturned Roe versus Wade, and so that's where it should continue to be. But, again, I don't think this is going to leave many of those people happy, particularly those who voted on this issue and helped him in 2016 get into the White House because of this issue.

The IDF is saying they're maintaining a strong force in the north of Gaza, the 162nd Division there in north around the major cities, like Gaza City. So, this is far from a full withdrawal, far from an end of military operations. In fact, a warning there could more to come. However, potentially in the context of the talks that are underway or have happened overnight in Cairo, this could put something different on the table that may shift the dynamic and lead to a deal over the hostage release and the contexts and contours of what a ceasefire might look like. It may change or it could go towards another breakdown in talks and then the indication that potentially this could lead to a ground operation in Rafah. And we're certainly hearing from members of the prime minister's hard right cabinet saying that if the prime minister is not going to go into Rafah and finish the job on Hamas, then perhaps they need to look at -- then he's not representing the will of people. So, that's a threat to the prime minister, but this is one that at the moment he can certainly appear to withstand.",
