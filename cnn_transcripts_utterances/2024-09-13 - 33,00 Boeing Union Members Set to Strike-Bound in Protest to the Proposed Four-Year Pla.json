Thank you so much for being here with us. So are you surprised at what has happened here? Explain how it came to this. JEFFREY THOMAS, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF AND MANAGING DIRECTOR, AIRLINERATINGS.COM: Well, look, yes, we certainly -- Look, there's two sides to it. Yes, I'm surprised, but then possibly no, I'm not. Because the Boeing workers have over the last 16 years had several contracts that they have not been happy with at all and were forced to accept them. And so this combined with the auto workers last year in the U.S. negotiating a pay increase from $20 an hour to $35 an hour, that's almost a doubling of their salary, has really set the tone for what the workers believe big corporations can pay. Now balancing that, the problem for Boeing and the problem for the workers is that the aviation industry is incredibly competitive. You've got new aircraft coming out of China. Are you going to get larger aircraft coming out of Brazil with lower cost bases? Boeing's going to face more and more intense competition in one of the market segments that's traditionally one of the most profitable, the 737 type aircraft. So, you know, a galloping wage increase.

People's minds are mostly made up.We're really now talking about a set of voters who political scientists might call low engagement or low information voters and what we really mean by that is people who aren't paying much attention to politics. What I would say is that the particular line that has attracted the most attention from this debate, Donald Trump's line about the pets, may seem ridiculous, indeed racist to some viewers, but to others, it may be something that catches their attention for people who aren't particularly interested and involved in politics. I mean, if you think about messages that get engagement on social media. Things that have animals or pets in them will often be shared and people will engage with them. And this is all to say that I think we need to be careful about how we think about the impact of this debate on the polls, because for many who are watching it and are highly engaged in this election, it's a clear win for Kamala Harris. For people who are just hearing discussion about it, that story about the pets may entice their interest in the campaign. And immigration is one of those issues, one of the few issues where Trump is streets ahead of Kamala Harris. So there could be unpredictable effects from the debate.

Her campaign has not really stumbled, it's not really fallen back.Just before the debate, there were some people starting to say, well, perhaps the momentum is slowing down, perhaps the enthusiasm is starting to fade, the novelty of her candidacy is not what it once was a month or two ago. And I think what the value of the debate is from her side is that it has reinjected energy and enthusiasm into her campaign, and she needs all of her activists and her core supporters out there. I mean, there still is an issue if you look at some of the polling, that there are still certain weaknesses that she needs to address African Americans in the \"New York Times\" gender poll, only 75 percent of them said they're backing Harris. She needs to be 10 percent. 10, 15 points higher with that group really. 52 percent of Latinos said they're supporting her. She should be 10, 15, 20 points higher with them going by recent elections for Democratic candidates.
