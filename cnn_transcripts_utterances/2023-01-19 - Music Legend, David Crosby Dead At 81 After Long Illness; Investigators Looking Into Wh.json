They learned about it in the press today, specifically, just about 15 minutes before they were contacted by the District Attorney.They are planning to see this through trial. He is not going to take a plea deal, not that one was even offered on the table. You know, and when I sat down with Alec Baldwin back in August, he has said that this is a tragic accident and he has said, Anderson, that there was a breakdown in the chain of command on the set. Hanna Gutierrez-Reed, the armorer on the set should have known that there was a live bullet, and his big question is, how did live bullets get to the set? But what was interesting today is that the DA is basically saying that it doesn't really matter, and that we may never know how live bullets got to the set in the first place. But he believes that that is where this all should start, and also Dave Halls, the assistant director who took the plea deal, telling him that this was a cold gun. So Alec Baldwin's attitude being you know, well, if the gun goes off, there never should have been a live round in the first place. Also Anderson, maintaining with me in August and still maintaining that he never pulled the trigger, although the DA does not believe that.",

If he wasn't a producer, I don't know -- I mean, does being the producer, does that add a level of legal responsibility potentially here?MARK O'MARA, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Yes, I think actually, it might. Remember that involuntary manslaughter, which is what they're charged with is not an intent crime. It is a crime of negligence. A couple of ways that you can do it in New Mexico law, one, is to commit an unlawful act like a misdemeanor, not a felony, fireworks that caused the death, that can be involuntary manslaughter. The other way is to do a lawful act. Let's just say that using that gun in that scene was, \"lawful,\" but doing without proper contemplation and caution, and that is where the strength of the State's case is going to go. Even though they are aggressive charges, they are going to say, look, a gun is a dangerous instrumentality. We know that and you have to presume that it is loaded and if you didn't do everything you should have done, that's not enough caution and he could find himself with a conviction of involuntary manslaughter.",

CNN has learned that CIA director Bill Burns traveled to Kyiv last week, he met with Ukraine's president to discuss U.S. expectations for Russia's battlefield planning in the spring. That is, according to U.S. official and two Ukrainian sources. According to the Washington Post, which first broke the story, both sides discuss strategy and concerns for how long the U.S. electorate would support the war.The meeting comes at a critical moment obviously for the alliance in addition to a possible spring offensive, Ukraine's Western allies or a standoff over whether to send Ukraine German tanks. Germany has demanded that the U.S. send its Abrams M1 tanks as well. The Pentagon today says it doesn't make sense to send U.S. tanks quote, at this moment. Officials say the Abrams tanks cost more to maintain, specifically, they cite the Abrams use of jet fuel versus diesel in the German tanks. Plus, they say the German tanks can cover more ground before needing to refuel. Defense secretary Lloyd Austin arrived in Germany today for face-to-face negotiations. I'm joined now by CNN national security analyst, Steve Hall, former CIA chief of Russia operations, and John Hudson, national security reporter for the Washington Post, which first broke the story about the CIA director's visit.

There's been billions and billions of dollars we're coming up on a year. How strong is it? And obviously, first and foremost on their mind was the GOP takeover of the House. The Director reiterated the Biden administration's ironclad support for Ukraine in this discussion. However, it's not all up to the Biden administration. Congress has an important role. The GOP has some far-right members who are very much opposed to aid to Ukraine, and so that's going to be a big thing to deal with.Also in this briefing, the Director shared the latest U.S. intelligence on Russian military planning. Obviously, it's a critical juncture right now. There's a huge war of attrition between the Russians and the Ukrainians forced to make very difficult decisions right now, are they going to expend a lot of resources on the war of attrition in the east, or are they going to save up a lot of those resources for the coming offensive in early spring?",

Now that he's on the intel side, he sees some of the real politics stuff. Remember, as the article points out correctly, Burns was the guy who was trying to convince Zelenskyy and the Ukrainians at the very beginning based on intelligence that, look, the Russians are indeed going to attack. But what you were alluding to there for a second agonis is the important part. The Ukrainians are in a really difficult position. They need to know how best to use their limited resources, and that's when strategic intelligence is at its strongest.

In terms of your question on track record, Burns himself traveled personally to Ukraine a month before the war started, and he told them where specifically the Russians wanted to stage their capture of the capital of Kyiv. It was at an airport outside of the country. That information has been credited by some people as helping the Ukrainians get a heads up of where they needed to put troops and how they needed to defend themselves. And that's why Kyiv remains a free city right now, according to some.So, you know, they do have a strong track record. Obviously, there has been some frustration over the last year. U.S. officials want to know more about Ukraine's planning. Sometimes they feel like it's a black box, sometimes they feel like they don't know that much about what's going on.

What's more, on those records, she lists both of her parents as being born in Brazil, which would undercut another Santos claim that his maternal grandparents fled the Holocaust. Now, OK, that is awful enough. It gets worse. There's also a new allegation that he took off with money raised to save the dog of a veteran who was homeless at the time.And Santos isn't exactly denying the charge either. In a tweet today, he said the reports of this allegation are, quote, shocking and insane, but he doesn't specifically deny them. The veteran Rich Osthoff and his mentor say that they knew Santos by the name Anthony Devolder and that Santos has set up a GoFundMe site for his Pitbull Sapphire, who had developed a tumor. He says $3,000 was raised. They never saw it. Osthoff said that after a series of back-and-forth text messages which were provided to CNN, Santos, quote, blew up and refused to give me the money and then just wouldn't answer the calls anymore. The dog died months later. Santos told CNN in a statement, quote, I have no clue what he's talking about. So, we want to spend some time on Santos 9/11 claims with John Feal, 9/11 first responder at the World Trade Center, whose FealGood Foundation assist emergency personnel who have faced injury and illness.
