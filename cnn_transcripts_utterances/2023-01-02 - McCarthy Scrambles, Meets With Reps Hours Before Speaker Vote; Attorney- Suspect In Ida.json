And Putin suffering a devastating setback on the battlefield. Dozens of Russian troops killed in a massive strike. Outrage over the losses now going inside Russia. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. I'm Erica Hill, in for Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, down to the wire. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy still on the Hill this hour, still meeting with members of his party, which is hours to go now before that critical vote for speaker of the House. Today, dozens of Republicans have been seeing going in and out of McCarthy's office. Among them, Congressman Matt Gaetz, and that's significant because he is, of course, one of the Republicans who's been a hard no on McCarthy's bid for the gavel. Just moments ago, leaving McCarthy's office, Gaetz offered this update. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That's when the entire Republican conference will gather, to hear McCarthy make his final case to the speakership, and shortly after that meeting comes a vote. Now, if Kevin McCarthy does not get the support of 218 members, it could plunge the house into a scenario not seen since 1923. That was the last time someone wasn't not able to clinch the top House post after one vote. McCarthy can only lose four Republicans. Remember here, there are five conservatives who vowed publicly to deny him the gavel. Congressman Matt Gaetz, who you just heard from. In addition to, Biggs, Ralph Norman, Matt Rosendale, and Bob Good. Now, Gaetz as you heard clearly there, said he's a no. It's unclear if there's any others are willing to budge, despite a number of concessions he's made in the last few months, and over the weekend, when he agreed to a rule that would allow just five members to call for a vote to oust McCarthy at anytime, and yet despite all of this, McCarthy, who has spent the fastest 15 years climbing the Republican ranks was upbeat, at least publicly about his chances.

But they just don't know when, they also don't know how long it will take, underscoring how wild and how predictable unpredictable tomorrow could be, and underscoring the fact that this is the first time in 100 years that we have seen the speaker race go on to multiple ballots that's because he has no margin for error.And a narrow House Republican majority can only afford to lose four Republican votes. Already five say they are hard nos. There are other nine Republican members who want a number of other demands. That is leading to an enormous amount of tension within the Republican ranks, talking to Republican members, they call those numbers narcissist. They call them chaos agents. They say they are not willing to negotiate in good faith. And they are projecting all of the demands that they are making, trying to urge Kevin to essentially weakening the speakership, and empower those members over the speakership. Now, Kevin McCarthy is still negotiating with some of those members. You mentioned Matt Gaetz, I talk to him immediately afterwards. I talked to him about this meeting. He says it was brief, and productive. He did say that he is still a no. He does still expect that five Republicans will vote no. But, Erica, if that happens tomorrow. What happens after that is anyone's guess. They could vote endlessly through the day, through a course of several days, and until someone eventually gets a 218 votes. But, Erica, at this moment, no Republican has those 218 votes to become speaker. Not Kevin McCarthy, not even Steve Scalise, the number two Republican who now is publicly supporting McCarthy, always in questions about how Republicans will resolve this issue as they come into power, and what will be a very messy first day of their new majority -- Erica.",

He doesn't need 218, in fact, Nancy Pelosi and John Boehner, and Newt Gingrich all at different times were able to get to speaker with 216 votes. If there are members that are both present, or members that don't show up to vote for that particular ballots, his threshold goes down.

And that attitude has held true for a big part of the base, a big part of the conference.And it's why we have seen the struggles, and shutdowns, and all of these things. It is going to be a tough job for Kevin. It's going to be a tough job for anybody. But a few things of context, the congresswoman hinted at this. One, we hear so often about moderates flexing their muscles. And they never do so to the point where they know if the House gym is. But we see this time, they are only Kevins, not never Kevins. There are some of those. They are only Kevins, and they're vowing to stay until the end, there are flexing their muscles for the first time in a long time. And the other I would say is this conversation, understandably so, and so many others have been, have been about Kevin, Kevin, Kevin. And this is bigger than one person. It's whether or not Republicans are going to be able to govern. It's a very real question regardless of who wins, but if we just focusing on one person, we're losing sight of what the real issue is, and it should be one thing that unites this Republican conference, which is a conservative majority in the House of Representatives to not just block Biden's policy but to put forth conservative ideas, and Kevin's best poised to deliver that.",

In a rare admission, the Kremlin says at least 63 soldiers were killed as Ukrainians are claiming it may actually be in the hundreds.Either number, though, would mark for the biggest single losses of life for Russia since the start of the war. All of this as Ukraine is saying Russia unleashed a ferocious barrage of artillery strikes on the eastern city of Bakhmut, firing on 224 times in the past 24 hours. Ben Wedeman is OUTFRONT in Kyiv. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The Russian army barracks reduced to rubble. In the first hours of 2023, Ukraine's army delivered one of the war's deadliest strikes, killing scores of Russian conscripts stationed in the occupied city of Makiivka in eastern Donetsk. Moscow said 63 died here, but the Ukrainians claim the death toll is much higher. Some military bloggers in Russia are outraged, asking why troops were allegedly housed next to a stash of ammunition, which exploded under fire. The daring assault say came after Russian missiles hit the Ukrainian capital at the start of the New Year holiday. Kyiv's mayor said that two people were killed and many others wounded Saturday when rockets hit a hotel and residential neighborhoods. A new reminder, in needed, that this war threatens Ukrainian lives far from the front lines. Many in Kyiv spent the last day of 2022 sheltering in metro stations and underpasses. Others put on a brave face to venture out. I guess this is how they can congratulate us with the New Year, Veronika Kolihina (ph) said. We were very close to where the first explosion happened. It was very frightening. Added Serhii Tolirador (ph), shelling people on this day is nothing but villainous. They are just animals. Russian shelling continued Sunday, hitting the children's hospital in the southern city of Kherson according to local officials. In Monday, Kyiv faced its third straight day of attacks as more than three dozen drones were launched overnight at the Capitol. The Ukrainian military says that they intercepted 39 of them, but the falling debris caused damage and injury. (END VIDEOTAPE) WEDEMAN (on camera):  Already, Russian politicians are looking for someone to blame for the deadly Ukrainian attack on the Russian base at Makiivka, the head of the A Just Russia party has said that so- called higher authorities need to be legally held responsible for the fact that so many Russian soldiers were in an unprotected building without any form of air defenses. The fact that the Russians came out so quickly and reported that 63 of their soldiers have been killed in this attack would indicate that the actual death toll is probably much, much higher -- Erica.",

One of the key things to think about, Erica, is the Russian targets is the civilian infrastructure, while the Ukrainians are working against the Russian military infrastructure, the military formations that the Russians have on their territory. The equation is different from each side. But given that particular situation, these particular facts, it is pretty clear to me that the Ukrainians could withstand it, but it's going to be very difficult.What the Russians are trying to do is, they're trying to integrate some futuristic concepts of swarm warfare where drones are used in swarms against particular targets. They're trying to do this against civilian targets and it's kind of a window to the future where robotics was going to be purportedly part of the military equation. That's what the Russians are trying to do, but I don't think they can get there from here.",

Especially as it relates to the pressure of the former vice president into throwing out the election results in 2020 and to sit these fake electors that might have kept the former president power.So, if you hone in on some of these calls that he was busy doing to Doug Mastriano, for instance, in Pennsylvania, he was talking with Jeffrey Clark, somebody who was very involved in his fake electors, trying to get the idea that there was fraud in the election. Those are the calls that the Justice Department is very much focused on as part of the criminal investigation. You know, there is a trove of documents that we have seen now from this committee. One of the more fascinating things is these text messages that were released by -- they show the anger inside of Trump circle about exactly what had happened. For not exactly the reasons that you might expect, Hope Hicks who is a very close aide to the former president was texting with Ivanka Trump's chief of staff, Julie Radford. In it, you see her say in one day he ended every future opportunity that doesn't include speaking engagements at the local proud boys chapter. All of us they didn't have jobs lined up would-be perpetually unemployed. You can see her anger here as she says, we all look like domestic terrorists. In another text, she says, again from Hope Hicks to Julie Radford, she says this made us all unemployable. Like untouchable, God, I'm so mad. It gives you a sense, Erica, that the palpable anger within his own circle may not be because of democracy or what happened at the Capitol, but more about their own future well-being and their employment prospects. HILL:  Interesting to see there, we all look like domestic terrorists now. When we look at everything that is happen, because the committee is shutting down tomorrow, the select committee also sent a warning to the White House about its own investigation.
