I'm Phil Mattingly with Poppy Harlow in New York. We are just three hours away from the Supreme Court hearing arguments in one of the most consequential cases of our lifetimes, one that has huge implications for the presidential election. Can Donald Trump be thrown off the ballot for his role in the deadly January 6th attack on the Capitol? Now, Trump, his legal team urging the highest court in the land to overturn a ruling in Colorado that he engaged in an insurrection that he's ineligible to run for president under the 14th Amendment that bans insurrectionists from office.",

In its ruling the Colorado Supreme Court pointed directly at what Trump said before the rally. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  We're going to walk down to the Capitol. You'll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong. We fight like hell.

He has really used these various cases as campaign stops, opportunities for him to cry out election interference or political persecution, even if his legal issues had nothing to do with politics. But in this case, he's not going.And, actually, he was going back and forth about whether or not he wanted to attend. Up until yesterday, when I was frantically texting them, asking, should I be getting on this plane, or is he not going to be in Palm Beach when I get here today? But, ultimately, they did decide he's going to stay in Palm Beach, stay away from the Supreme Court. Instead, he spent the week talking to his lawyers as they were preparing for this. And it really shows, gives an indication of how much more seriously and how carefully he and his team are handling this. Now, I am told that at Mar-a-Lago, he is expected to do something, unclear what exactly that would be. However, after that, he is going to Nevada, where he is going to the caucuses. He is expected to win there. They are trying to focus on the political. Now, sources tell me that Trump privately has been talking about how he feels confident about this case in the Supreme Court, something we've also heard from his advisers, as well as his legal team. They believe they have a solid legal argument here. And they are trying, at least for Donald Trump, to just focus on his politics now, bringing home the nomination.",

Lawmakers struggling to find a path forward this morning after Senate Republicans blocked a sweeping bipartisan border deal and foreign aid package after months of negotiations. This bill contained strict border security remedies that Republicans had originally demanded, but have now rejected under heavy pressure from Donald Trump.It also includes more than $60 billion for Ukraine, 14 billion for Israel. Now, that critical aid is in jeopardy as lawmakers debate a slimmed down foreign aid package with the border portion totally out. It is unclear if even that is going to get the 60 votes needed to advance. Lauren Fox is joining us on Capitol Hill this morning. Where does this go?",

The problem is they had a border security proposal, they didn't like it, they rejected it yesterday, and now there's sort of this question of what exactly are they going to be okay with. And one of the things that can happen in these Senate talks is that members can get amendment votes and that that can really help to unlock any stagnant negotiations over these kinds of things. But one thing that you're starting to see is some members are just so frustrated with McConnell's leadership, people who have been long-time critics of him, people like Josh Hawley and Rick Scott, that it's really unclear right now what is going to unlock the 60 votes necessary. Again, Republicans are going to huddle this morning behind closed doors. That's going to be a really crucial meeting to understanding whether or not they're ever going to be able to get to 60. This has been a longtime priority of minority leader Mitch McConnell to ensure that that $60 billion goes to Ukraine. But just taking a step back, it's important to note that even if this gets out of the Senate, it's so unclear what the path right now is in the House of Representatives. I was talking to a number of moderate Republicans yesterday in the House who said that they are really fed up with the fact that Ukraine funding has not been delivered yet, but they're not sure if Mike Johnson is going to put it on the floor.
