And today, officials in several European countries have made terror remarks and related arrests. Details are still coming in. But here's what we know as of right now. German authorities say they have arrested long-standing Hamas members for an alleged terror plot.And officials in Denmark have apparently made what they call unrelated terror arrests. Let's bring in CNN's Fred Pleitgen in Berlin. There are so many moving parts here. It's frankly a little bit confusing. But tell us what we are learning from Germany about all of this.",

And it's all taking place in three European countries, which are actually all neighboring countries. Of course, everything in Europe, very close together. And the borders also are open. Now, the Germans are saying that in total, four people were arrested. And they say three of those people have direct links to Hamas or long-standing Hamas members.And those three people were all arrested right here where I am in Berlin. Now, there was a fourth person who was arrested in the Netherlands who apparently was also part of what was going on. The Germans are saying that these three people who were arrested here in Berlin had long-standing ties to the Al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas. And that they were essentially tasked with finding a weapons depot that is buried somewhere. And they've been trying to do that for a couple of months now. Bring those weapons to Germany for what the Germans say would have been attacks on Jewish sites in Europe and across Europe. Of course, security has been increased a great deal at Jewish institutions here in Germany since the October. 7th attacks and, of course, also Israel's military campaign in Gaza. In fact, tonight, the German Justice Minister came out and he talked about how urgent the situation is for Germany. He said the following, and this is a quote. We must therefore do everything we can to assure that Jews in our country do not have to fear for their safety again. And our security and law enforcement authorities are working flat out to achieve this. So, a lot of arrests have happened here in Germany and one in the Netherlands. And in Denmark, there were raids across the country as well. Four people also arrested in total. Three of those in Denmark and one also in the Netherlands. Again, totally unrelated, as you've mentioned, Pamela. The Danes not mentioning Hamas by name, also saying they foiled attacks, as they say. However, the Israelis have come out and say that this happened at the direction of Hamas. That these were foiled attacks at the direction of Hamas. So, as you can see, the European authorities in these countries taking this extremely serious take it saying this is a very, very dangerous situation, Pamela.",

It's designated a terrorist organization, but it's not used to launching attacks in Europe. Having said that, I would be astonished if there are not more tries at terrorism and whether some are successful. And by the way, there could be American targets as well, because we're partying to this. We're partying to this war, as you know.

But the point is, American intelligence, the FBI, are on high alert. They're looking at all Palestinian groups, but more worrisome are, of course, the lone wolves which were very hard to catch. And the fact that weapons are so easily procured here, and they are in Europe, too, more than they were like 20 years ago, it just, it's a very, very dangerous period.

And Hamas, I'm going to go out on a limb here, is going to focus on Israeli targets or Jewish targets in order not to undermine what support it has in Europe. It's not going to be a general attack against markets or the rest of it. Simply because Hamas is more focused than the Islamic State ever was.",

It comes as not only the civilian death toll is mounting, but also as growing international pressure is also mounting on Israel and being acknowledged by the United States, including by President Biden, days ago, talking about Israel's indiscriminate bombing of Gaza. And so, enter the picture, Jake Sullivan meeting with top Israeli officials, including the Israeli prime minister, to discuss not only that mounting civilian death toll, the ways in which the United States wants Israel to be more targeted in its operations, but also beginning to think about a timetable for transitioning the high-intensity fighting and bombing of Gaza that we are seeing from Israeli forces right now to a lower-intensity phase.That's according to John Kirby, the National Security Council, spokesman. There is an acknowledgment from the Israelis that that is part of the discussion here. But for now, the Israelis seem committed to maintaining this current tempo of the war effort for weeks, if not months, to come. Yoav Galant, the defense minister, we're told, told Jake Sullivan that this war could last more than several months. And the Israeli prime minister, for his part, he said that the fighting will continue until the complete destruction of Hamas, until victory. And so there is a question here about whether the message from American officials is going to be the same as the message from the Israeli government. We know that the question is being received by the Israelis. We know that another key question that's being discussed is also the fate of Gaza after Hamas is destroyed, if indeed that goal is achieved. But also, at the moment right now, the fate of those hostages, including at least eight Americans who are believed to be held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip. John Kirby also addressed that point moments ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
