I was in the courtroom today and the vivid and graphic details that Stormy Daniels shared about the alleged sexual encounter were excruciating. How did the jury respond? Also breaking tonight, the judge in Trump's classified documents case postponing that trial indefinitely. Former Trump White House attorney Ty Cobb has a lot to say about Judge Aileen Cannon, and he's OUTFRONT tonight. And I'm going to head to Wisconsin for an exclusive interview with President Biden. What do voters in this crucial battleground state think? A special report. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news, the explosive day in Trump's criminal courtroom. I sat behind Trump today in that courtroom as Stormy Daniels took the stand. Now, Daniels, of course, is the adult film star at the center of this case. Her testimony was riveting and at times deeply uncomfortable for everyone in the room. During all of it, Trump was 15 feet away from Stormy Daniels as she was asked for explicit and excruciating detail about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump in a Lake Tahoe Hotel room. She described coming get out of his hotel room bathroom to find Trump on the bed and boxer shorts and a t-shirt. And then she was asked more and she gave all the details. And she said, I had my clothes and my shoes off. I removed my bra. We were in the missionary position. And this is the non-graphic part. And Trump was clearly angry, scowling, and impatient, tapping his attorney on the arm repeatedly, prompting her to object. Now, the judge was also uncomfortable, even himself objecting at one point and then when the jury was not in the room after lunch, Judge Merchan actually admonished to Trump's team, by saying he did not understand why they failed to object more. But Judge Merchan made it clear that Trumps move for a mistrial after Trumps attorney said Daniels' testimony would, quote, inflame the jury, was not appropriate at this time. As for the jury, they were listening intently, their emotions not visible, but a lot of note- taking and people in various angles of the room were describing furious note-taking, just incredible intensity from the jury today. And the pace of the questioning was very fast. Then when the cross- examination began, ill tell you, wow, in the room that was at tense and angry tone, the defense attorney, who was female kept saying things to Daniels in this tone, you made up the story, you hate him. Trump's attorney pointed to this tweet from 2022 that Daniels had posted, quote, I'll never give that orange turd a dime. Now, Daniel said, okay, sure, I must have said that and I did it in retaliation for what he said to me, referring to Trump calling her a horse face and a sleaze bag, which already had been adjudicated. Now, Trump's attorney then shouted back, that's you making fun, you despise him and you call them names all the time. Daniels responded: Yes, because he made fun of me first. Defense attorney replies: So one of you started it, but you both continue it. I mean, this was the sort of tone in the room, right? The pettiness, the smallness, but yet the heart of it, and this cross-examination a sign of what's to come on Thursday, Stormy Daniels back on the stand. Cross will continue, redirect, re-cross for this crucial witness. Paula Reid is OUTFRONT live outside the New York courthouse to begin our coverage. And, Paula, this was by far the most compelling and dramatic day of testimony so far.",

My motivation wasn't money. It was to get the story out, she testified.But when she found out Trump and Michael Cohen, were interested in buying the story for $130,000. She told the court it was the best thing that could have happened because then I'd be safe. And the story wouldn't come out. Then in a searing cross-examination, Trump's attorney, Susan Necheles pushed Daniels. Am I correct that you hate President Trump? Yes. Daniels replied. \"You want him to go to jail?\" Necheles asked. I want him to be held accountable, Daniel said. If he's found guilty, yes. Daniels' casual and relaxed demeanor changed as the defenses questions became more pointed, attacking her credibility and trying to establish Daniels has always just been trying to make a profit. You've been making money by claiming to have had sex with President Trump for more than a decade, Necheles asked. That story has made you a lot of money, right? Daniels responded: It's also cost me a lot of money. (END VIDEOTAPE) REID (on camera): Court is not in session tomorrow, but Daniel speak back on the stand Thursday to continue that cross-examination. But, Erin, we'll all be watching for the next 72 hours, if Trump can continue to abide by the gag order that prohibits them from attacking witnesses, in this case. Daniels clearly got under his skin today, but the judge has threatened him with possible jail time if he violates the order again.",

But the judge was like, that's as far as it goes.

And so I think the fact that he felt cornered with all of these true statements is why he was so aggressive. In my experience with Donald Trump it's when he knows he's caught or he feels cornered that he becomes extremely agitated and then expects everybody to come out fighting even harder for him.It's really interesting, same with his grooming products.

You're not saying things on TV that are strong enough.

So I think that after the lunch break, he clearly let them know what he wanted and she his lawyer was very aggressive with Stephanie Clifford towards the end.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Israeli tanks rolling into refer for the first time early this morning, crushing the last remaining signs of Palestinian control over Gaza's lifeline to the outside world. The Rafah border crossing with Egypt now firmly under Israel really control. For now, that means nothing in or out at this critical crossing point for humanitarian aid, fuel, and medical evacuations. As plumes of smoke rise over the area, the Israeli prime minister touting the operation as a play to bolster Israeli leverage in cease- fire talks with Hamas, which put a new proposal on the table hours before Israeli tanks rolled into Rafah. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Military pressure on Hamas is a necessary condition for the return of our hostages. The Hamas proposal yesterday was intended to torpedo the entry of our forces into Rafah. It did not happen.",

You know, obviously, not the lie that a propaganda ceasefire that Hamas put out yesterday, that many in the world's media took as factual, meant as propaganda by Hamas, but a real ceasefire that leads to the release of hostages. We've obviously, unfortunately reached the point where those ceasefire negotiations have failed, mainly because it's not clear how many hostages, unfortunately, may still be alive. Hamas now changing their position to releasing bodies. And so, look, I've listened to the president, I agree with the president on this. We want to make sure obviously that anything that happens in Rafah is limited, but that we're making sure that humanitarian aid is getting in through those corridors that were limiting civilian life as much as possible.
