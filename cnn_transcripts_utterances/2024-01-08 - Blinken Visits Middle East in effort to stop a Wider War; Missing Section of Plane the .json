It is 5 pm in Riyadh, 6 pm here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Becky Anderson. This is \"Connect the World\" also ahead over the next two hours. A school teacher has found in his backyard a crucial section of the Alaska Airlines plane that was ripped off a Boeing jet on Friday. A diplomatic spat festering after three Maldives government officials mocked the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in online posts. And later this hour, we'll look ahead to the Africa Cup of Nations with a very special interview. Well, the markets in New York will open in about 30 minutes from now and the major U.S. Indices could remain in the red today. Although we've got a little bit of a -- just a jump into the green there with the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P, but ultimately, we've had a negative start to the year which snapped the market out of strong gains. All eyes today will be on those Boeing shares. Dozens of Boeing 737 Max-9 aircraft grounded after Friday's incident when a fuselage section blew out on an Alaska Airlines Flight, more on that later this hour. Well as Israel's war against Hamas enters its fourth month America's top diplomat is on a high stakes trip aiming to prevent a wider conflict from erupting. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's latest stop is Saudi Arabia at a press conference in Doha in Qatar on Sunday Blinken criticized what he called irresponsible and inflammatory statements by Israeli ministers and lawmakers who have called for Palestinians to be resettled outside Gaza. He is set to meet with Israeli officials on Tuesday. Nic Robertson joins us now from Tel Aviv with the very latest. And I have to start with some breaking news as Blinken is in region trying to effort de-escalation. CNN is just alerted that a Hezbollah militant from the Iran- backed Lebanese group has been killed in an Israeli airstrike on Southern Lebanon, that according to a security source. What do we know at this point, Nic?",

The Islamic resistance the military front, if you will of Hezbollah have released a number of photographs with him that show him with Qasem Soleimani, the top Iranian General who the U.S. killed in a drone strike four years ago. Imad Mughniyeh another very senior figure in the pantheon of Hezbollah seniors and also Hassan Nasrallah, the spiritual leader of Hezbollah. There's a photograph of him with Nasrallah as well. So, it does appear that this was a senior figure when it comes today when Israeli fighter jets, helicopters and even drones have been flying over and targeting areas in Southern Lebanon. The IDF said that those targets have included sites where anti-tank missiles have been fired across the border. But Israel has not so far taken responsibility for the killing of Wissam Tawil. It is a potential escalation he does appear to be a senior Hezbollah commander. But the escalation perhaps came two days ago when Hezbollah targeted with 62 missiles they said. And Israeli military outposts and our surveillance station on the top of a hill near the top of a mountain actually near the border with Lebanon, which they said was in response for the killing of the Hamas Leader Arouri, Saleh Al-Arouri in Beirut Wednesday last week. Israel didn't take responsibility -- publicly take responsibility for that and the U.S. officials said they were responsible for that strike. So what we're seeing here is a pattern of potential slow escalation. And that is exactly what Secretary Blinken is coming into the region to try to tamp down, Becky.",

And we heard from Israel's President, very clearly I've heard so over the past 24 hours very clearly saying that is absolutely not Israel's policy to force anyone to leave Gaza or the West Bank. And Secretary of State Antony Blinken has also made that very clear that the United States is opposed to that, that kind of movement of people not only out of Gaza but also the West Bank. And we did hear from King Abdullah of Jordan over the weekend. Secretary Blinken was there of course, yesterday saying that he wants an immediate ceasefire. Secretary Blinken is going to come here in to Israel and say look, all those displaced people in Gaza obviously they're not going to leave. But what Israel needs to do is as soon as the conditions allow is to allow those people to get home 90 percent of the population of Gaza. And we're talking about 1.9 million people here are displaced according to U.N. agencies. So there is a vast displacement. Many of those people are crammed into the south. And particularly Blinken is calling them for -- calling for them essentially to be allowed to go home back to their homes in the north of Gaza, where the fighting has subsided. And Israel has more of a control above the ground. But of course so many homes are destroyed there. It's hard to see how they can go back without a massive humanitarian support and influx. And of course, this is something that Israel has not appeared willing to countenance that volume so far.",

Now while he was there, he did upload a few pictures and videos promoting local tourism that doesn't seem to have gone down well with people back in the Maldives because a huge number of tourists to the Maldives are from India. In fact, India topped that list last year in 2023. Now as you mentioned, those officials did mock Indian Prime Minister Modi. There was a huge backlash on Indian social media after the comments they made, which of course were insulting. And on Sunday the Maldivian Prime Minister did suspend these three officials indefinitely. The pressure to sack them has been high in terms of you know people back in India supporting Modi asking for that, but for now they have been suspended. Even Maldives Foreign Ministry came out with a statement I'm going to read an excerpt from there. The government of Maldives is aware of the derogatory remarks in social media platforms against foreign leaders and high ranking individuals. These opinions are personal and do not represent the views of the government of Maldives. Now, this response from Malik (ph) comes after there has been a boycott called by many people within India to boycott visiting the Maldives as part of the holidays and vacations.
