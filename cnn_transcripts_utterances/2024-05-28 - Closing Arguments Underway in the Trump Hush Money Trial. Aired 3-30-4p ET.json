What's important is the defendant's motivation.They also talk about how Donald Trump has essentially deputized Michael Cohen to David Pecker. Why that's important is because, you remember from the congressional testimony of Michael Cohen and how Trump intimates things, does not say things, we've all been wondering about the trial, how would he prove that Donald Trump had his fingerprints on something. They are talking about a moment when Trump essentially says to Pecker, I'm paraphrasing here, speak to Cohen about these issues, which is why now you're hearing him talk about him being the fixer. By deputizing, so to speak, Michael Cohen, it gives the link to say this was all at the behest of Donald Trump. And remember, one important jury instruction here could be to include that the defendant is guilty for the behavior of somebody else if they essentially sanctioned that conduct.",

And certainly the fact that he served the former president for a long time works to his benefit, I think, as a witness. I think this idea of how much does someone's credibility issues hurt them as a witness, I don't believe that there is any witness who is so incredible or uncredible that they're going to tank an entire case. Anyone who has ever tried a homicide or gang or drug or mob case knows that witnesses come in with tremendous baggage. And often jurors will think, OK, you know, that's not great. However, considering that this person was under oath, considering the other evidence in the record, this is quite credible. Joshua Steinglass, just a few moments ago, to this point about how we look at motivations and credibility did sort of pick up on Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels saying their motivations are not relevant. What is relevant are the behaviors of the defendant and any co- conspirators with him. And if the jury can believe those things, the fact that Michael Cohen has credibility issues and prior convictions and lies in his past don't help him, but certainly don't sink the case.",

I'm back now with our Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent, Paula Reid and National Correspondent, Kristen Holmes.All right, so here we are waiting and they're listening. They're in there listening. Just a couple of points to make from this as this is about to go to the jury. Your sources in Trump world are telling you sort of how they see this going. When they get optimistic about how the jury will come out, when they start to believe it, what are you hearing?",

So, and they know just about as much as anybody. So this is kind of just speculation.But they believe that there are some options here. One is that the jury comes back and it comes back quickly, 45 minutes, and that it is a conviction and they move from there. The next part of this is that every kind of interim after that, any five minute period even, gets closer and closer to it being potentially a hung jury. And that is when they start to get more optimistic about it. The longer the time the jury is out, the better that they feel about the case. Now, just a reminder that I have spoken to almost no one who believes that Donald Trump, at least on his team, is being acquitted. They believe that there's two options here, that he's going to be convicted or that there's going to be a hung jury. They're hoping, obviously, that they turned at least one jury, made one jury sympathetic in this case.",

And that's not what the legal system is supposed to be. We don't want to open that Pandora's box for people to succumb to political pressure, bring charges in districts that are not unfriendly to a certain politician, former politician.This needs to be the facts presented, the evidence presented, match the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. And right now we see prosecutors walking through, now chronologically, their case. Right now they're really focused on the conspiracy because they charged this as a felony, arguing that these business records were falsified to help Trump win in 2016. So they've spent the better part of an hour focusing on that part, the helping Trump win in 2016.",

How much time, Kristen, when you look at this, are they spending on sort of the underlying motive, the kind of did he or he didn't he, which I know is not relevant to it, whether or not he had the affair with Stormy Daniels, but obviously Trump has tried to make it at the core of it.

You know, pointing out that now it's something that they want, that they know that their client wants to hear. They want a continual denial of this alleged affair with Stormy Daniels, something that Donald Trump has done.But regardless, I think what we're seeing back and forth here now, and what we've been watching, is they're talking about the fact that the prosecution, or excuse me, the defense was trying to muddy up the tape about Karen McDougal and about Michael Cohen opening up a bank account. You hear Trump on the tape, they're trying to say that the defense was trying to say that it was edited in some way, give me a break. Going through each of these various parts. But again, I really do have to go back to the fact that a lot of the reason why they have to do this enormous amount of cleanup and going through these facts is because they seem to know that their main witness is a bit unreliable.",

REID: Exactly, it seemed like the judge was aligned. They didn't want the prosecution to leave because they have no time limit. Clearly, they have no time limit. To leave, you know, an extra 30 minutes and get that extra crack at the jury right before they went to deliberations. But here's what the judge is on board.

They already have a perspective of what they think.And so the closings provide, number one, give the contextual story of what that evidence means. It also is supposed to provide a roadmap for the jurors between the evidence they heard and the actual questions on the verdict form. And finally, what's really important about closing argument is for each side to understand that they're not necessarily at the point where they need to convince someone who's on the other side. What they need to do is use that closing argument to provide the ammunition, to provide the argument for those jurors who already believe in their side. So that once the jurors are back in that deliberation room, lawyers can't have any more influence. They've already closed, they've already said everything they have to say. They need to make sure that they've provided the jurors who believe in their side of the case what they need to fight for them in the deliberation room.",

Yes, Michael Cohen is a convicted felon, he is a liar, and he is the person that Donald Trump chose.
