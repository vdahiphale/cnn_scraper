Since that speech, 12,000 more Palestinians have been killed. We're now at 27,000 killed. Why are you still supporting this war, when this government that is the most extreme in the history of Israel, led by someone who refuses to recognize any political rights for the Palestinians and with elements that are calling for ethnic cleansing and displacement of Palestinians? Do Palestinians have the right to dignity, as you said in Angola when I was with you on the trip, you said the future belongs to those who could think dignity, not trembling? LLOYD AUSTIN, U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY: Yeah. I said that in the speech at the Reagan forum. I've said that to my counterpart, Minister Gallant, every time that I talk to him, and I talk to him every week. And I emphasize the importance of protecting civilian lives. I also emphasize the importance of providing humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians. It's critical. It's really important. This is -- there is no question that this is a tough -- it's been a tough conflict. But, we're -- as I've said earlier, we are starting to see the Israelis kind of shift their stance and change their approach to a more focused and controlled -- control is probably not the right word, but a more focused effort focused on a discrete set of objectives. And so, I think -- we talked to him about that weeks ago, and they said they were going to do that and they are doing that. But, I will continue to emphasize, and I know Secretary Blinken and President Biden will continue to emphasize, the importance of addressing the issue of the Palestinian people. It's critical. And we're doing more, but we're not doing enough.",

In terms of informing the President, again, I admit that that was a mistake to not talk to him about that early on. When you're the President of the United States, you got a lot of things on your plate. And so, putting my personal issue on, adding to his -- all the things that he has got on his plate, I just didn't feel that that was -- that was a thing that I should do at the time.

Look, to Leigh Ann's point about this being a private matter, look, he is obviously a very private person. We've heard from those on his staff. He is a private person. He made a point to say this is about privacy, not secrecy. I think people will disagree. This was a secretive. This was unfortunate, the way that they handled it, and good thing he acknowledged. The problem moving forward is his inability to transfer the authority, as you say, given these important decisions. The question is, his deputy, what did she know and when did she know it? He wouldn't even answer that question today, when he was asked, when did you alert your subordinate about this that could handle these responsibilities? He wouldn't answer that today. He said that will come out in the review. There were some key questions that I think a lot of people still have that were not answered. And the question is -- also, one person asked, if this happened to anyone else in the Defense Department, they would have been terminated. Why did this not happen to you?

After months of sluggish poll numbers, he leads Donald Trump in ahypothetical head-to-head matchup, one that also really highlights a widening gender gap among supporters of the President. A new Quinnipiac poll shows Biden with a six-point edge over Trump, 50 percent to 44 percent. This is, again, it's national. It's with registered voters. It's really just kind of a way to keep track of what's going on. It's not going to tell us who is exactly going to win the electoral college, but it's helpful for us to know because this is an improvement for the President from December when there was no clear winner in that same poll. He was basically tied. The key to Biden's lead is pretty obvious. It is women voters. 58 percent of women are backing him. Just 36 percent are supporting Trump in this poll. The Biden campaign's message that Trump is a threat to democracy also appears to be resonating. About one in four voters say that preserving Democracy in America is the most urgent issue facing the country. Immigration is top of mind for 20 percent, and another 20 percent say it's the economy. Our panel is back with us now. I want to start by digging into this question of women voters, because we can, I believe, put up what their previous support was. Well, I guess, maybe we don't have that. It was 58 percent Biden, 36 percent Trump. If you go back to December, that number, there we go. There it is. It's 53 percent, 41 percent. So, Brad, you can really see that a lot of this shift is driven by women. I think my also -- my big question here -- right. The Biden team has been under all kinds of pressure, right --",

I think one, the gender gap here that we're seeing, which has grown since December, I thinkit's partly because, if you were paying any attention to the Republican primary, you heard a lot about abortion. You heard Donald Trump brag about overturning Roe v. Wade. You heard every major Republican candidate endorse a national abortion ban. And so, I think that's part of what's going on. I think the other thing that is going on in this poll is that people are -- political reality is catching up with economic reality. And we've seen that. Consumer confidence is up. Consumer spending is up. Employment is up. The stock market is up. Wages are up. Inflation and gas prices are coming down. I mean, it would defy a political gravity at some point for the President not to get some credit in the polls. It may not be decisive. It may not mean he is going to win, but to get some credit in the polls for the way the economy is going. And then, I do think, probably I don't have not scientific judgment here, but I do think that probably women, probably related to freedoms like a woman's right to choose, probably care about democracy, right? And the President, what do you do on January 6? He went out and he gave a major speech about democracy, about his defense of it, and about Trump's threat to it. So, I think it's a mix of things, the economy, the abortion issue and democracy that are driving these poll numbers.",
