Some corporations, we should note, are concerned about the safety of their executives and are reaching out to private security firms. CNN's Matt Egan is following that part of the story. Matt, it's only natural that these companies are going to be worried about this. What are they telling their employees?",

      "sentences": "Well, Jim, there is a real sense of nervousness and even fear in C suites really across the country. This fatal shooting in Midtown Manhattan, not far from where I am right now, has been a real wake up call for business leaders and for boards of directors. The security firms that are paid top dollars to protect executives, they say that their phones have been ringing off the hook ever since this news broke.One veteran security executive told me that corporate America is nervous. And he said, healthcare is the target now, but who's next? And so, yes, companies are considering a range of steps to try to ramp up security, including reassessing the security protocols that are already in place and the budgets. They're increasing the number of security personnel and the amount of technology in offices and even in the residences of executives, they're urging executives to delete their digital footprints, including stuff like the floor plans of their homes and any information that's out there about where their kids may go to school. And they're also enhancing mail screening. There's also a sense that this killing really made it clear that companies need to extend the security blanket that exists for those top-level CEOs down to their lieutenants, because there are a lot of massive corporations out there, like UnitedHealthcare, that maybe the security for those division CEOs does not rise if it's close to the level that it does for the number one CEO, but perhaps it really should. There's also this growing concern about the risk of a copycat, both because of the positive reaction that this has gotten online and also the level of attention that this suspect has received. And New York Police Department intel report obtained by CNN's John Miller said that the online reaction to the killing may signal an elevated threat facing executives in the near-term, with the shooting itself having the capability to inspire a variety of extremists and grievance-driven malicious actors to violence. Jim, it looks like it's very clear that companies, really across the company -- across the country, are going to have to ramp up how much security that they spend to try to protect their executives.",

They're doing it on homes that were staged for sale, have unbelievable electronics in it. They'd fly the crews in the crews go to a rental truck that the ones here got, they would take all the high-end electronics and then they'd leave the next day. And all these South Americans, and there's plenty of people willing to come up, do this quickly, get paid and go home.",

I mean, this is pretty brazen stuff.D'AMICO:  It is. It used to be that they targeted someone who was at the Super Bowl and away from their house, but their family was home. I always tell them, don't put your family there because you're putting them at risk, if they bump into someone that they weren't expecting. But I think they've now gotten more brazen where they're doing home games, where they just know that they're going to be gone for four or five hours and no one's at the house. They probably looked before to see what he did at another home game to figure out if someone's at the house or not.",

So, I mean, you have to think they're going to be hiring security guards, upping the security at these kinds of homes because they're just -- no question about it, just targets. I do want to ask you, Rob, about another story that we're following, these mysterious drones that are being spotted over New Jersey. Apparently, two dozen mayors were reportedly meeting today to discuss this and used to head up the FBI's counter drone unit. What's your take on all of this?D'AMICO:  I think it is people telling him to look for drones because when we went out as a Counter Drone Unit, as soon as someone heard that we're there for the Super Bowl, the World Series, they started looking up in the sky and they started saying that all these lights were drones and they're actually manned aircraft. They have apps like Flightradar24 that can tell us what manned aircraft. They all look the same. To be able to judge distance. So, I think they're self-propelling this notion that there's drones there when they're -- when they say they're all lined up, well, that's an approach for major aircraft. And frankly, drones can fly over these areas. They're G rated except for over military bases or airports. Secret Service may put one up over Trump's golf course if he's going to be up there and it is temporary flight restriction. But I think they're just self-imposing this hype. And even if someone was flying a drone, there's really not anything illegal about it.",

Is it because -- there's just a proliferation of these drones out there, a lot of people own them, all shapes and sizes? And so, they can give some people the willies if they're not expecting to see something like this flying over their neighborhood?D'AMICO:  They can. And it's going to get more and more because, again, they've gotten very cheap and people like to fly them. And now, you know, companies are going to start using them for deliveries. There's a whole series of things that drones are going to start taking over. I think people will get more used to it, but it does spook people highly.",

But when we talk about the Assad regime, fear of the regime, fear of detention permeated every single cell of every single person's fibers of being. Everybody was terrified of detention systems.

And if we take a look right now at what HTS, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, its leader Jolani have been doing and saying, it is the right thing so far. Of course, everyone is also aware that it might just be lip service, but we also need to remember that, you know, as far back as 2012, I remember talking to, you know, some of the young Syrian activists on the ground, talking to members within serious political opposition who were saying, we're fully aware that we might need to have a revolution after the revolution. People are not going to give up on what they fought so hard for. Remember the core that started all of this were calls for democracy and freedom, and Syrians have been very active behind the scenes for the last 13 years, getting ready for the day after, even though, of course, no one expected that it was going to happen like this or this fast.",

So, from, you know, the humanitarian perspective under Assad, Syria was never properly funded to begin with. Syrians were still going hungry and Syrians who lived in, you know, what we call the, you know, liberated or rebel-controlled areas were also really struggling when it came to just basic necessities of, you know, access to food, to clean water, to education.And so, the country is already from that sense at least broken. The economy has been completely devastated and shattered. And nothing has really been done to try to rebuild that. So, you are, in many ways, kind of starting from scratch, which could prove to be an opportunity, but also ends up creating a very unstable situation for people who want to return, especially for those who are hoping that they'll be able to return to areas that were completely and totally obliterated. So, there's going to be a bit of a scramble, I think, on the side of the humanitarian entities to try to provide basic services, not to mention, you know, a big push to try to get the funding that is going to be needed to do that. But this also provides an opportunity for the International Community that is woefully abandoned Syria to actually prove that maybe this time around, it's not going to.",
