Appreciate your company, and we begin with a dramatic turn of events in Russia.At this hour Moscow is calm. Highway restrictions across the country are lifted and an insurrection led by Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of the Wagner mercenaries came to an end as suddenly as it started. The Kremlin said on Saturday cut a deal with him to stop the march of these forces towards Moscow. It was the most serious threat to President Vladimir Putin's rule in decades. Under the deal the Kremlin says Wagner troops will not face any legal action but they'll sign new contracts with Russia's Defense Ministry, while Moscow will drop its charges against Prigozhin who will then go to Belarus. Wagner's leader says he agreed to that in order to avoid bloodshed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN, HEAD OF WAGNER GROUP (through translator): Therefore, realizing all the responsibility for the fact that Russian blood will be shed from one of the sides, we turn our columns around and leave in the opposite direction to the field camps, according to the plan.

Even more so over the course of the last year and a half. And since the Russian security forces helped Lukashenko face down his own uprising after very contentious elections that he was accused of rigging.So now out of the blue, in the midst of the biggest challenge and potential power struggle to face Vladimir Putin, which he compared to the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, he himself, when addressing the nation on Saturday, out of the blue, Lukashenko apparently, according to the Kremlin, brokers a peace deal with Prigozhin that ends the specter of bloodshed inside Russia. We don't know the details of it. We don't know what kind of situation Prigozhin might be under if and when he does get to Belarus. Will he continue to fire his rhetorical broadsides against the Russian defense minister, against the chief of general staff in Russia? Will he continue to have command and control over the Wagner mercenary forces? That we don't know. But the Kremlin alleges or claims that Lukashenko came up with this brilliant solution to overt bloodshed in Russia. So we'll just have to watch and see where that goes next. And just an additional little piece of context in the last month, Russia has announced that it will be moving nuclear weapons on to Belarusian soil as part of an agreement with Belarus.",

It has really been dominated by Russia especially in the last almost three years since the protesting in Belarus in August, 2020.So it's not like Prigozhin has gone into exile. It is possible that he agreed to be on another country's territory, just to kind of help law enforcement save face. But this is clearly no kind of permanent solution. I think it's entirely possible that Prigozhin himself wanted the Ukrainian world. He wants to go back to Africa or to concentrate his troops in Africa where he actually has a thriving mercenary business, especially in Central Africa. That is a huge loss for Putin on the Ukrainian front. These were his literal shock troops. And so while Ukraine is mounting his counteroffensive it is losing this aggressive force and this bottomless source of counter fodder that's significant.",

The Wagner leader showed just how easily he could take over a major Russian military installation and city and then send columns of troops racing towards Moscow.

The leadership in Russia, Vladimir Putin, no chance because Vladimir Putin's popularity now is something about 80 percent. And everybody, everybody, the deputies, everybody expressed his support to Vladimir Putin. But also on another hand, for Vladimir Putin, to crash by military waste Yevgeny Prigozhin, Wagner Groups, it's a very bad solution because Wagner Partner Group is the best private army in the world. It's needed on the frontline in Ukraine. And also to crash them, Vladimir Putin will have to take a lot of Russian troops on the Ukrainian floor which can open that window, the door for the Ukrainian army counteroffensive.

You know as well as anyone, Michael, the amount of money that has been made by the Russian elites at Putin's knee, this invasion of Ukraine, the war has cost them dearly as well. And when they see this debacle with Prigozhin today they will wonder to themselves, is it time to try and promote a new leader? Never has Vladimir Putin had this kind of a challenge to him. And I want to point out one other thing. You know, when I was in Russia, we were covering the conflict in Chechnya. Putin had come to power. And the Russians, while they understood that young men were dying in Chechnya and the brutal nature of the war being prosecuted there, they had a bargain with Putin that he would keep things very calm. It was not a calm day in many cities and towns throughout Russia today. And they are wondering the more that this conflict in Ukraine inches closer to the Russian doorstep, they too will wonder whether or not Vladimir Putin is the leader for them.

And of course they kept monitoring that over the last several months or so. And this week, U.S. intelligence officials did brief the White House, the Pentagon, and also a significant member of Congress about these preparations that the Wagner Group had and was taking to take these steps that he eventually did take. Now I think in the White House, it has never really been at the forefront of their intelligence that President Putin could somehow lose power because of what is happening in Ukraine. At the same time, there are always these contingency plans for whatever may happen on the ground there. But it is interesting that they did see this coming sort of step-by-step. Eventually, it happens today. But I think that there was some surprise at how quickly it escalated over the course of the day. And you saw that in this scramble. A number of American officials have been planning to travel overseas, including the Joint Chiefs chairman Mark Milley, also the president's National Security adviser, Jake Sullivan.

      "sentences": "A quick recap now on our top story. The abrupt end of a dramatic armed insurrection in Russia. The streets of Moscow calm right now after Wagner paramilitary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin agreed to leave Russia and head to Belarus, thanks to a deal brokered by Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko. And this video is of Prigozhin leaving military headquarters ofRostov-on-Don in Southern Russia, although we don't know where he is right now. In return Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov says Russia will drop the criminal case against him and he says Wagner fighters who marched towards Moscow will face no legal action and can sign contracts with Russia's Defense Ministry. The rebellion represented a huge threat to Vladimir Putin's grip on power and, according to Ukraine's president, it even frightened him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ZELENSKYY (through translator): I will say it in Russian. The man from the Kremlin is obviously very afraid and probably hiding somewhere. Not showing himself. I am sure that he is no longer in Moscow. He calls somewhere and asks for something. He knows what he is afraid of because he himself created this threat. All evil, all losses, all hatred. He himself who spreads it and the longer he can run between his bunkers, the more you will all lose. Everyone who is connected with Russia. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That is not a mystery that he's not as strong as he appears to be or says that he is. It is more important that he is there because none of them, or so it appears, have enough power to take over and undermine the rest.So if somebody goes up, somebody goes down. And those who go down cannot afford to go down. So that has been going on. And I think that's kind of Prigozhin and his -- and I'm sure the people behind him, close to Putin, who was able to take advantage of. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
