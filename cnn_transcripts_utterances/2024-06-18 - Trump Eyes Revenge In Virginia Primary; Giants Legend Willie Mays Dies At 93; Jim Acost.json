Congressman Bob Good tonight, the head of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, is fighting for his political career. Results in the primary there show him neck and neck against his Trump-backed challenger, John McGuire. The race at this point, you see it on your screen right now, it is too close to call. Now, if Good loses, it'll be a major win for Donald Trump, no doubt. But what if Good pulls this one out? You saw those numbers a few moments ago. It is close. What then? After all, Trump did try to put his finger on the scale in this race to try to exact revenge on Good. The sin that Good committed, it was endorsing Governor Ron DeSantis in the primary against Trump. Good tried to make up for it by eventually endorsing Trump. Look at this. He showed up -- even showed up at Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan. That did not work. Good was also one of the eight Republicans who voted to remove Kevin McCarthy as speaker of the House. McCarthy has not gotten over that. He, too, has spent time, energy, and money to try and get revenge on Good. And joining me now, former Republican congressman from Colorado, Ken Buck. Congressman, thanks so much for being with us. What's your impression of watching these results come in? You served alongside Bob Good in Congress and as a member of the House Freedom Caucus. This one is tight. I mean, for -- for Trump getting involved in the race and getting behind the -- the challenger in this race, it's -- it's pretty darn close.",

But Kevin McCarthy has put a lot of money in this. Other donors have put a lot of money in this. The primary endorsement that a candidate can have in this race, Donald Trump's endorsement, was against Bob. So, to be as close as he is at this point is impressive.Bob came out very strongly against funding Ukraine. It's another issue that I think upset voters in his district and certainly donors in his district. So, it's a close race. I don't think that Donald Trump wins this race, even if his candidate wins, because it is so close that clearly people didn't ignore all the other factors involved and just go with President Trump's advice.",

And in fact, I'm standing here outside the watch party here in Lynchburg, and they are wrapping up for the night and sending people home because the race has been too close to call.And Bob Good just put out a tweet and he said, \"The entire D.C. swamp was aligned against us with over $10 million in attack ads. But with your help, we were able to make this race too close to call.\" And I think it is worth reflecting here on just how much national attention this race has gotten. Normally, this would be a relatively sleepy race. We probably wouldn't have paid that much attention to it. But Donald Trump got involved and that's why so many people are paying attention. As a reminder, Bob Good did endorse Ron DeSantis initially over Donald Trump. He did eventually throw his support behind Donald Trump after Ron DeSantis got out of the race. But Trump really never forgave him for that. And so, he was actively campaigning for John McGuire. He was railing against Bob Good on social media. He did a tele town hall last night for John McGuire. He even told the Bob Good campaign to stop using signs that had Donald Trump's name on them, although I should point out, we saw some of those signs earlier tonight inside. And then in terms of other enemies that Bob Good has made inside the GOP, Kevin McCarthy is another one. Bob Good was one of those eight House Republicans who voted to remove Kevin McCarthy as speaker. So, Kevin McCarthy and his allies have also been going after Bob Good. So really, the odds seemingly have been stacked against Bob Good leading up to this moment. He was outspent by his opponent. This has become the most expensive House republican primary race in the country. There has been a ton of outside spending from other groups. So, we'll see in the end where this ends up. He could still hold on. Again, the race has not been called yet. It's really neck-and-neck here. But in the end, we're going to see this as a test of not only Trump's influence in the GOP, but also a test of the strength of Kevin McCarthy's revenge tour.",

He ousted McCarthy in many ways. He has caused or led, some Republicans would argue, for the conference to lose some seats because of the constant and perpetual infighting when the party wants to keep those seats and potentially expand them in November.

If you took someone to a ballpark and they had never seen a game before, and if Willie wasn't having a particularly great day, he was 0 for 4, there wasn't a spectacular play to be made, he just made that basket catch, just by the way he carried himself, just by his presence and magnetism, your eyes would go to him.

He understood that it wasn't enough just to be a great competitor. He often said, you have to entertain people. And he said, I will make an easy play look hard, I'll make a hard play look easy.

It's difficult to compare eras, especially if you talk about those who played, both Black and white, when the game was segregated. But there are people who have greater batting statistics. Ted Williams had greater batting statistics. Stan Musial in some sense. Hank Aaron, his greatest contemporary, you could argue that Hank, who was an excellent all-around player himself, you could argue that Hank was by a small margin, maybe a better hitter. But the overwhelming consensus is that Willie Mays is the greatest all-around player who has ever played. And as sad as it is, there's something poetic about the fact that he passes while much of the baseball world is gathered in Birmingham, Alabama, in Ringwood Field, for a game that was to be dedicated to Willie and still will be. The Cardinals playing his team, the Giants, on Thursday night in a major league game that will count in tiny Rickwood Field, the oldest ballpark that is still in use that not just Negro League players played in, but as Bob Kendrick will verify, I don't know the exact number, but pretty close to half or more of the players in the Hall of Fame, black and white, played at one time or another at Rickwood Field, right, Bob?",

It is always meaningful. It gave me goosebumps. And it still does every time I walk out on that field. And this game on Thursday, you know, while we're all in somewhat of a somber mood, it will be, I believe, the ultimate celebration of Willie Mays's life. There will be a number of former Negro League players gathered there. I know how much he wanted to be here, to be there with them, particularly Reverend Bill Greeson, who mentored and nurtured him as a player with the Birmingham Black Barons.

Now what the president has done is enable these people to access that path without having to leave the United States to be able to stay with their family members. It is about family unity.
