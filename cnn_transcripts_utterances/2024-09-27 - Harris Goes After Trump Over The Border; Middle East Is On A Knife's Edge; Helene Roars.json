He's 21, his mother died of cancer last month, and he has legal custody of his four siblings.

And sometimes, you don't hear about the good stories. And while this is not necessarily good because a young man lost his mother, I think the fact that he has taken on this responsibility, he does have a GoFundMe, so people go support it, says something about this young man's character.

And a natural disaster unfolding in real time as Helene drowns parts of the southeast. The destruction and the stories of survival, tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\"It's a trip Republicans have been shouting about for years. A Kamala Harris visit to the border. The place Donald Trump sees as his strength and key to his chances in November. So tonight, Harris went there. It was her first time at the U.S.-Mexico border since June of 2021. And it was also her first time as a Democratic nominee for president. Her mission, bridge the gap between how voters see her and Trump on immigration. Her message, a promise to up the ante on border security. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I will take further action to keep the border closed between ports of entry. Those who cross our borders unlawfully will be apprehended and removed and barred from reentering for five years. We will pursue more severe criminal charges against repeat violators. And if someone does not make an asylum request at a legal point of entry and instead crosses our border unlawfully, they will be barred from receiving asylum. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's interesting to see that split screen of Trump in the Rust Belt where Harris is ahead and Harris down in Arizona where Trump is ahead. These are on each other's turf.I think immigration is obviously going to be an issue that Trump needs to push the advantage on.

Kennedy Jr. there before him speaking, actually saying, don't vote for me. Remember, Michigan is keeping RFK on the ballot. So, a lot of this is going to come down to really small margins there and trying to maximize his vote there and getting up to as high as he can with those messages, with those themes.

The Israeli military has been providing warnings an hour and a half before their strikes. But these people still have nowhere to go. One of these people telling AFP, they were only given 30 minutes to evacuate before the explosions. Israeli official telling CNN, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was the target of the strike.

Adams appeared in court today to plead not guilty to federal corruption charges.Now, as that was happening, investigators with the Manhattan D.A.'s office searched the home of one of his closest advisors, Ingrid Lewis- Martin. They also seized two cell phones from her at the airport right when she landed from a vacation in Japan. It's not clear if this is related to the Adams case at all, and Ingrid Lewis-Martin denies any wrongdoing. But it does add to the growing list of people within the inner circle of Adams, who have now been searched by investigators. Now, for his part, Adams denies any wrongdoing, and he is vowing to keep his job. Only a handful of prominent Democrats have even called on him to resign. But a source tells CNN, New York Governor Kathy Hochul is considering the possibility of removing Adams from office. She can do that, by the way, under state law. Now, publicly, of course, all she has said is that she hopes Adams will find -- quote -- \"an appropriate path forward.\" Not really the ringing and door slam sure that Adams wants to hear. But the question is, if Adams resigns or is even pushed out, then what? Who would become the mayor of New York? Well, the job would fall to my next guest, New York City public advocate, Jumaane Williams. Jumaane, thank you so much for being with us. What a turn of events this past few days.
