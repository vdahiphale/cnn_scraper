I'm Ben Hunte and this is CNN Newsroom.We're obviously beginning with the rising death toll from a horrific plane crash in Muan, South Korea. At least 176 people are dead. 181 passengers and crew were on board the Jeju Air Boeing 737-800. Two people have been rescued. Three people are unaccounted for and officials say they're presumed dead. Meanwhile, victims' family members have gathered at the airport, hoping to find out more about their loved ones and the crash. Officials say they've recovered the plane's flight data and cockpit voice recorders, but they say it could take years to complete their investigation. CNN Correspondent Mike Valerio is following all of this breaking news from Seoul for us. Mike, thank you for joining me. This is horrible news and at a time when so many families will be celebrating holidays, being excited for what's coming up. For anyone just waking up now, just tuning in, what is the latest, please?",

      "sentences": "Sure. Well, Ben, this is a Jeju Air Boeing 737-800 that was leaving Bangkok, Thailand just after 2 a.m. local time, pushed away from the gate to 11 in Bangkok, due here in South Korea in the 9 a.m. hour. So as you mentioned, the context here, Ben, this is an airline that takes a whole multitude of people to and from idyllic vacation destinations throughout Southeast and Eastern Asia. So we're talking about a whole host of families coming back from Christmas week, getting ready to celebrate the New Year across South Korea.So they're taking this flight before sunrise, coming in during the 9 a.m. hour, but there for some reason is a warning, according to South Korean officials, that is sent out from the control tower at Muan International Airport to the Jeju airliner. And the control tower says that there is a risk that the flight needs to know about of potential bird strikes and birds flying around the approach to the airport. Two minutes later, the pilot declares mayday, but for unknown reasons, it could be a potential bird strike, could be something else. We don't know. We just know that the mayday is declared around 9 a.m. And then four minutes later, Ben, that's when the airliner crashes. So, you know, there have been several authorities throughout the day here in South Korea who've mentioned the possibility of a potential bird strike leading to a cascading series of events. But it's unclear, and our aviation experts here at CNN have certainly noted, how a bird strike could lead to this airliner touching down its belly, scraping the pavement of the runway so close to the end of the runway. Why was the landing gear not deployed? What would a bird strike have to do with that? Why were the flaps of the wings on this aircraft not deployed? Certainly one of the primary elements of slowing the aircraft down, the nose is pointed down rather than pointed up, coming in hot to this runway. So, as you mentioned, it could take up to two, three years for South Korean authorities to finish their reports, which is, you know, it takes a few years for authorities in the United States, Europe, most of Asia, the rest of the world, to finish their reports. But because, Ben, of everything that South Korea has been experiencing, from martial law declared in the late hours of December 3rd to the early morning hours of December 4th, we're on our third person in charge holding presidential powers after President Yoon was impeached, then the acting president impeached. Now we're on our third person with acting presidential powers. There is a pall that's been cast over South Korea, with this catastrophe leading so many to be so angry of just what has been happening across the country over the past few days and weeks. So there certainly will be mounting pressure for authorities here in South Korea to figure out just what went wrong, what caused the landing gear to fail, to have any connection to any possible bird strike, Ben.",

I think that's what all of us are asking here across the country.As soon as we saw that video of the explosion, the plume seen from miles and kilometers away, we just thought, oh my God, like what -- how could anybody survive that? So there was hope, Ben, as most of the rest of the world was asleep, that there could be some miracle. First responders expressed optimism that, OK, we've seen this cataclysmic event, but two people have survived. Perhaps more people could survive as well. But I'll tell you, Ben, that hope faded extremely quickly. We're eager to know what exactly the two survivors are able to tell investigators and reveal about what happened. We don't know the conditions that they're in at the moment, obviously so fragile to have gone through what they did, but it will be key to learn what they are able to describe in the last moments that this flight was in the air and it came crashing down, Ben.",

      "sentences": "Look, indeed, if the undercarriage is not deployed, the ground proximity warning system, for instance, which is built into all these aircraft, gives you a multiple series of alarms. Also, there's warning lights as well to tell you the undercarriage is not down. But what we're hearing now, though, is that the air traffic control data from the aircraft, called the ADS-B, this is the data which the aircraft sends out telling the air traffic control its altitude, speed, direction, et cetera. That's how they track aircraft. Typically, that's on all the time, from pushback to arrival at the gate.On this aircraft, it stopped at 900 feet. And it stopped just after the bird strike that the aircraft suffered. Also, ground observers are saying that there were three explosions related to a bird strike. Because there was a warning of birds in the area. One minute later, the flight crew declared an emergency. That was at 8.58. And then the air traffic control directed them to approach the airport from another direction. They did that from the north to the south. And the air traffic control data from the plane failed. Now, what that tells us is that these crew might have been dealing with multiple electrical failures as a result of the bird strike. They might have lost not just one engine, but possibly two engines. So, with this cascading series of problems, they may have had no choice but simply to land without the undercarriage because they just didn't have time to crank it down. This is observations from several different folks on the ground and also aviation experts as well that we have spoken to. So, it appears as though these crew members were suffering or dealing with multiple problems which has led to this terrible, terrible crash.",

And there is an all-out effort to try to find the presumed remains of the three people who have not been accounted for yet.And there are, if you can imagine, just scores of families who are gathered in a pretty small conference area of the international airport about three and a half hours south of Seoul, where we're broadcasting from right now, who are waiting to see if those firefighters right there under the floodlights are going to be successful in finding their three loved ones who are the last to be found and identified in this calamity that has cast a pall over South Korea. So the main questions, in case you're just waking up with us and are waking up to this news, that we certainly have been asking all day throughout Southeast and Eastern Asia is what exactly happened to cause the landing gear to fail? We have all of these dramatic videos and pictures that have come in where you see a plane trying to land, coming in relatively fast, coming in towards the very tail end of this runway of Muan International Airport. And without the flaps of the wings deployed, which certainly one of the primary elements of slowing down a plane, we have the added aspects of the storyline here with numerous emergency officials saying that a bird strike could have happened and perhaps could have contributed to a chain of events that led to this catastrophe. So, as you mentioned, Ben, in the intro to the segment, this is just before 9 a.m. local time here in South Korea. Two minutes -- or I should say, two minutes before the first mayday is sent from the cockpit of this aircraft, there's a warning that's received for the control tower that says, paraphrasing here, hey, there are birds near the runway, near the approach to the airport. Try a different approach and certainly watch out. So then we have two minutes later, the mayday called. Four minutes after that, the plane crashes. But what all of the experts and certainly members of government and first responders are trying to figure out is, would a bird strike lead to the chain of events that perhaps could impact the landing gear? And right now, that is certainly puzzling. So many analysts and emergency officials on both sides of the Pacific Ocean and from all of the experts we talked to, you know, throughout the realm of context that CNN has access to. So, again, the gleam of hope here is coming from the two people who survived this crash miraculously. They were seated in the back of the aircraft in the tail portion, the only part of the 737-800 that sort of looks as it did. Everything else is unrecognizable. There are two crew members, a man and a woman, and one of them is en route to a trauma one center here in Seoul. The man is already here in Seoul. So the hope, Ben, again, you know, just in closing, is that they both can help gleam what happened here with the voice and data recorders. Just such an unbelievable chain of events, Ben. HUNTE: It's horrible. The fact that we've even seen that video of the plane going down the runway, it's mad. The fact we've even got all of this, these videos and this content, those live pictures there. Mike, thank you for reporting over the past few hours and to your team in South Korea as well.

      "sentences": "My concern is that after it touches down, that there are blockades and items on near the runway that they collided with that may have caused this severe explosion once it hit the ground. So a well-designed airport would not have had any kind of blockades there.The aircraft could have landed and slide off the runway onto the grass, and it should not have been able to, it should not have had any interference with these blockades. So that would be the first thing, as an investigator, I would be looking at is certainly this tragic loss of life perhaps could have been avoided had the airport been designed and prepared for this type of emergency landing. If a pilot knows that they're going to have to land an emergency situation without the landing gear, they radio ahead to the airport and the airport can do some things to prepare for that. They can put foam on the runway. They can have emergency vehicles standing by so that when the aircraft does have this emergency landing. So it appears to me that no one was really aware of the fact, at least on the ground, that the aircraft was landing without the landing gear down. So that indicates to me that possibly it was an oversight during the emergency landing to not deploy the landing gear. That's one of the things that I would be looking at, again, as an investigator.

Investigations are still ongoing, but nearby Ukrainian drone attacks in the moments preceding the crash have led some officials to believe that the plane may have been downed mistakenly by Russian anti-aircraft defenses, with officials in Azerbaijan saying that the plane came under external physical and technical interferences while in Russian airspace. Meanwhile, several aviation experts and U.S. officials have said that perforations seen in the fuselage are consistent with shrapnel damage from an explosion, but the cause of the holes in the wreckage has not yet been confirmed. Investigators are continuing to assess the evidence, including two black box recorders which were recovered from the wreckage, as well as, of course, eyewitness accounts. Remarkably, 29 people out of 67 on board the flight survived the crash, some of whom filmed their final moments on the flight, one survivor describing a loud bang being heard and felt before the plane began to descend. But it could still be a matter of days or even weeks before any final conclusions are made by investigators.
