Of course, on top of that, he is now also facing federal charges for threatening the family member of a public official as well as attempted kidnapping, that pertaining to his alleged desire to try to kidnap the House Speaker herself.Now, in this hearing that just now wrapped up, the judge entered a protective order indicating that this defendant cannot have any contact with the Pelosi family. He is also not allowed within 150 yards of the Pelosi residence. Of courses these charges, very serious. He has been accused of entering that residence early Friday morning and engaging in an assault of Mr. Pelosi, Mr. Pelosi suffering significant injuries including a fractured skull. He remains in intensive care at this hour. Now, just as this hearing was wrapping up, the public defender in the case stepped before the microphone, spoke to reporters.

As you'll recall, within a five-year period, from June 1963 to June 1968, we lost to assassination Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, John and Robert Kennedy. That's one on average every 12 months.And, I look back at that period. I think that this environment that we're in now is at least as combustible as the mid-1960s. In one respect, we've been remarkably lucky and fortunate. I'm sure the Pelosi family does not feel that way at this moment. What happened to Paul Pelosi is terrible. But, it's a miracle that no member of Congress was seriously injured on January 6 that the Speaker herself who the mob was looking for was not seriously injured on January 6 that the Vice President was not injured on January 6 despite the calls for his hanging on that day. And so, I look at the current environment, and I think it should not require someone to die before our leaders who command a microphone, who have a voice, get together and decide we need to take the temperature down does someone need to die before Republicans and Democrats can all come together on this issue, to say we need to turn the temperature down on this environment. Members of Congress, individual members of Congress, are not - do not have protection details. But, regrettably, we're moving in a direction where all 535 of them may need to have 24/7 protection. There is an additional issue with families. I remember well, my time as Secretary of Homeland Security, I was constantly in the security bubble wherever I worked, wherever I traveled, where I stayed, my family would move in and out of the security bubble simply because we don't have the resources to protect the official as well as the members of his or her family.

The idea that this is a choice, not a referendum on his administration, and that choice is between Democrats and in their views, extreme Republicans. And they look at Governor Ron DeSantis and Florida Senator Rick Scott has primary examples of those things. In fact, the President just a short while ago at a closed-door fundraiser told donors for Charlie Crist that he believed the current Governor Ron DeSantis was Donald Trump incarnate, according to our colleague, Kevin Liptak.

Blue currently held by Democrats, red currently held by Republicans, but this battle for control of the Senate, it's going to come down to basically seven states, right? That toss up state of Nevada, you were just talking to Manu about. And Arizona and Georgia, another Democratic incumbent having a tough race and New Hampshire.Those are the four seats with Democratic incumbent senators in real tough reelection battles. And then Republicans have to try to hold on in Wisconsin, in North Carolina and Pennsylvania. So this is where I want to show you. That is where the battle is most concentrated, Wolf. But take a look at the path here, right? Let's say Republicans do hold on in North Carolina. Let's say Ron Johnson gets reelected, and Republicans hold on there as well. And for the purpose of this exercise, let's just say John Fetterman, the Democratic candidate in Pennsylvania wins and flips that state from red to blue. Now you're left with those four Democratic incumbents, OK? So if indeed Maggie Hassan holds on, and Mark Kelly holds on in Arizona, you're at 49-49. At this point for Republicans to win, they need to flip both Georgia, have Herschel Walker win there, and Adam Laxalt would need to win in Nevada, that would give control to the Republicans.",

And that I can't find any times in the last 60 years of American economic history when the Fed did too much.Because the Feds got a goal. They've been very explicit about it. 2 percent inflation and even if there is something of a downturn or recession, I don't see any reason to think that there's any real prospect without a lot more fed action that they're going to push inflation durably below 2 percent.",
