The Belarusian president tells CNN, Yevgeny Prigozhin is now in St. Petersburg. A new study reveal reveals just how pervasive forever chemicals are in drinking water. Live from New York. It's Thursday, July 6th. I'm Paula Newton, in for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. And good evening. Tonight, Meta's new social media app posts a strong start as it seeks to take on Twitter, 30 million people have now signed up for Threads. That's just in one day. Users are able to post short messages. They can also reply and quote other Threads just like on Twitter and celebrities are already taking part. Gordon Ramsay in his first post asked if this is where he could find the lamb sauce. That's jelly to you, sir. And actor Chris Hemsworth seem to lament the existence of a new kind of funny platform. Kind of funny. Clare Duffy is with me. I know you've been following all the jokes, and for some large media companies, this is no joke. I mean, the uptake is certainly impressive, but I've got to ask you to what end? I mean, I was on it. It's a fairly simple product, right?",

You know, you can sign in through your Instagram, you can import over your following list. It is really simple to get started. It looks like Twitter, so it feels familiar, and it's easy to use. And so you can see why so many people have jumped on this bandwagon. But Meta executives have acknowledged that it is much easier to get people to sign up for a new platform when we're in this exciting launch phase than it is to get people to stay there and continue engaging long term. And they will have to add more functionality to this app. It is still missing a lot of the things that people really like about Twitter, like direct messages and hashtags, trending topics. And so they'll have to add things to this app to get people to stay on there. The other thing that I think they're going to have to do to really maintain this momentum is that make sure that Threads doesn't just start to have some of the things that people don't like about Twitter, things like spam, harassment, misinformation. They are going to have to be intentional, especially going into an election year about protecting users on this app if they want people to stay there.",

Instagram has two billion daily active users globally, and so those people now can all really easily join this new app. And Mark Zuckerberg has said he wants one billion daily active users on Threads. That's his goal, and it does seem attainable. If he gets there, that is so much bigger than Twitter.

So if you think about it, Twitter was really a place where politicians, celebrities, and journalists could gather with all of humanity to have unfiltered conversations, where if you were just a basic citizen, you could post something, and quite possibly a journalist or politician or an activist or a celebrity might see it and might act on it. And there was a chemistry in there that was caught, lightning in a bottle, over a period of years and I think it is unbelievably difficult to replicate that. And we've seen journalists are really desperate to have an alternative to Twitter. So you saw them initially go to Mastodon, and then to Post News, and then to Bluesky, and now they're settling on Threads. And I do believe that Meta has huge advantages. The enormous install base and the scale of Instagram made this much easier for them. But I do think they have their work cut out for them. The product today is actually pretty poor.

And the reality of this thing is that people are desperate for the credibility that comes from being on these platforms and for the dopamine hit that comes from people reacting favorably to your work. And so I do think that they're going to get to build a large audience. The question is, can they create a community around it that really keeps celebrities, politicians, and journalists engaged in the platform? And I think that's going to prove to be very difficult and I think it's going to take a long time, but I would not rule it out and I think investors are right to view this as the best opportunity available to Meta, the Metaverse has failed completely.

These people are not even remotely interested in protecting democracy. They're not even remotely interested in protecting public health or public safety. Why? Because they have no economic incentives to do that. Shareholders reward them for generating earnings, not for protecting democracy, public health or public safety, and until that changes, we can't expect their behavior to change.

Now, US stocks are sliding as investors react to better than expected -- I know, again, jobs data. The US added nearly half a million private jobs in June -- that's just extraordinary-- more than double what economists expected. The private assessment comes from a day before the government will now release its jobs day, which is July 7, you remember, it is tomorrow, Jobs Day Friday. Now, the numbers, obviously, the Fed watches all of them quite closely, and that I can assure you is an eye-popping number. Now, top Fed official, Lorie Logan said they should immediately resume hiking rates and that the Fed should stick to signals that there will be at least two more -- two more -- rate rises this year.

I think the thinking right now on Wall Street, unfortunately, is that good news is badnews because the stronger the economic numbers are, the more that that is going to embolden the Federal Reserve to escalate its war on inflation and that was very much the story today. I mean, markets were modestly lower heading into the day, and then boom, we saw that ADP blockbuster jobs report come out. I mean, almost half a million jobs added in a single month. That is more than twice what economists had been expecting. And so the moment that that hit the tape, we saw stock futures go down sharply, and importantly, we also saw bond yields go up very sharply.' And so the thinking is that tomorrow's jobs report, the far more important government jobs report is going to tell a similar story, in that it will be a jobs market that appears to be defying gravity, right, more hiring, a lower unemployment rate, that is the expectation. And if that goes as scripted, then that is going to just sort of cement the thinking on Wall Street that the Federal Reserve really is not done here. At last check, there is a 92 percent chance being priced into the futures market that the Federal Reserve raises interest rates by a quarter of a point later this month. And Paula, given how strong these economic numbers are and given that inflation is still nowhere near back to that two percent goal, you've got to wonder whether or not they will indeed raise interest rates, two, three who knows how many more times because clearly, the economy can handle it at this point.",

Today, President Lukashenko said he would impose a similar deal if Wagner troops were in fact to come to Belarus. Ann Simmons is the Moscow bureau chief at \"The Wall Street Journal,\" and she joins me now. Really good to have you on this story. I mean, firstly, can you try and make sense of today's developments? Because it could imply two drastically different scenarios, right? One, that Prigozhin is a marked man or is he a free man? Which is it? ANN M. SIMMONS, MOSCOW BUREAU CHIEF, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Well, it's really an extraordinary turn of events. The very fact that President Lukashenko came out and said that, you know, Prigozhin is not in Belarus., he is in Russia, was actually quite stunning for many people, because Vladimir Putin had made clear that he thought that the actions undertaken a couple of weeks ago, this revolt, so to speak, this mutiny was actually treacherous. It was a betrayal, he said. He said it was a stab in the back not only to Russian troops, but also to the nation. So it's really the $6 million question right now, where is Yevgeny Prigozhin? And it really does kind of shine a light on the fact that there is a level of confusion right now in Russia, in the halls of the Kremlin, they are trying to very much put a lid on this story, they want it to go away. So in that regard, they're not commenting, they're saying that, you know, what, we're not tracking his movements, we don't care. It's not our desire. But that in itself speaks volumes.",

Now, a Ukrainian city far from the frontlines has become the target of a deadly Russian missile strike. Lviv has declared two days of mourning for at least five people killed earlier today. CNN's Ben Wedeman reports now from Ukraine. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Even away from the frontlines, nowhere in Ukraine is safe. This is the aftermath of a Russian attack in the western city of Lviv. At least five people were killed and dozens injured when a cruise missile struck a residential building overnight, Thursday. Ages of the victims ranged from 21 to 95, including a World War Two survivor. Authorities are calling it the most devastating attack on civilians in Lviv since the war began. (VIRA LUBIN speaking in foreign language.) WEDEMAN (voice over): \"The Russian say that they are bombing military objects, but they hit a peaceful house. People were sleeping,\" says Lviv resident, Vira Lubin (ph). \"How could they do it? World, help us.\" The nighttime attack smashed the roof and top floors of an apartment building and damaged several others. Ukraine says the attack was carried out by a Russian KALIBR missile, a long range hypersonic missile that carries a payload of a thousand pounds of high explosives. KALIBR missiles are extremely accurate and have been used frequently in Russian attacks on Ukraine. Emergency workers and firefighters had been removing chunks of rubble from the blast site and have evacuated over 60 people so far. Standing atop the damaged buildings, they continue to sift through the rubble for any sign of life or death. The Ministry of Internal Affairs says as many as 10 bomb shelters were locked shut in Lviv when the attack happened. An investigation is ongoing to understand why. But considering the city's relative safety, the strike was probably a shock for many. In the early days of the war, the city served as a refuge for tens of thousands of Ukrainians fleeing Russian attacks. Given its proximity to the borders of Poland, a NATO member, many hoped they would be safer there. But as rescuers continued to clear the rubble and repair the damage, it's clear no place here is beyond Russia's reach. Ben Wedeman, CNN, Eastern Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Now the recent launch of some of the newer AI technologies, like generative AI, extremes that we don't know exactly what role is going to play in the future. They will definitely play a role in that. But what I talk mostly about is the large number of companies in and around the world, have already been doing in using the current state of AI to build and renovate. It's helping, for example, we are thinking about sort of, how do we make sure we can feed a global population across the world, where protein is lacking. And, where it's hard to actually grow rice for so many people. And, AI no natural language processing, (INAUDIBLE), things like that, play a very crucial role in that for those companies.",

You also discussed the importance of access to data. And actually, without smart, accurate, efficiently labeled, for example, data, the tools that we have for artificial intelligence in many ways are worthless. This is a key, fundamental part of the future uses of artificial intelligence.

A government study revealed the estimate andspeculates the true amount of polluted water is even higher. The chemicals in question are PFAs. That, those are used in countless consumer products. Further research shows almost all rainfall on Earth contains some levels of these chemicals. And that exceed the safety limits. Now three U.S. chemical giants recently paid more than $1 billion  to settle claims, that they knowingly contaminated water with PFAs. CNN health reporter Jacqueline Howard has been following all of, this and examining the study force. And of course, we've got a lot of questions, Jacqueline.

And then, there is as I mentioned, ongoing research into this, public utilities and, here in the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency is looking into ways that we can reduce our exposure to PFAs. But the difficult thing with that is, because these chemicals break down very slowly, these efforts will take some time and take a lot of resources.
