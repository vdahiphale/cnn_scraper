Plus, Donald Trump on the border, the draconian immigration policies he is promising in a second Trump term. And amid a troubling increase in antisemitism, Ron DeSantis just can't seem to condemn Elon Musk for agreeing with an antisemitic conspiracy theory. Good day, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. To our viewers watching the United States and around the world, it is 11 a.m. here in Washington. It's Monday, November 20. There are 56 days until the Iowa caucuses, only 350 days until Election Day. This is today's State the Race. President Joe Biden is turning 81 today. It will be a quiet celebration at home, as polls show the President's age is voters' top concern about sending him back to the White House next year. The oldest President in American history, currently on track for a rematch against Donald Trump. Trump is just three years younger. If he is reelected, Trump would become the oldest President ever at the end of his second term. Let's dive into all this with today's panel, former Chief of Staff at the Department of Homeland Security, Miles Taylor, former Deputy Press Secretary to Vice President Kamala Harris, Ashley Etienne, and Senior Congressional Reporter for Punchbowl News, Andrew Desiderio. Thank you all for being here. Ashley, I'm so sorry. You get to be the Democrat at the table. ASHLEY ETIENNE, FORMER DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY TO U.S. VP KAMALA HARRIS: No. I am having a great day. It's President's birthday. He is a fantastic President. I'm ready. (CROSSTALK)",

They're sort of framing it up is like, who would you want it the wheel here? You want someone who is not only empathetic, but has the experience to unite the nation. You've got a Congress that's in complete disarray. Who has been able to bring Congress together the pass these big bills? It's Joe Biden. So, they're shifting gears not just like making fun of in light of it now, but really talking about it, and how it matters to people in terms of the experience and what that delivers for the American public on issues they care about.",

Of course, I'm referring to the two times that Mitch McConnell throws up in public, reminded people of how old he is, reminded people that he has been in the job for a while, and maybe said to some people, hey, we need a new leader. We need a new Senate Republican leader, and it could feel the opposition. They're worried about the same thing happening with President Biden here. And another thing I wanted to mention about polls too, one of the things that President Biden's allies say to push back on the age narrative here is that he has got a lot of experience, especially on the world stage, dealing with foreign policy crises. Look at how he has handled the war in Ukraine. Now, the war in Israel. You look at his approval of his handling of the war between Israel and Hamas. There was a poll that came out over the weekend that said only 60 percent of Democrats approve of how he is handling that war.

I'll let you Google it. But, it was reported that that's the word that the President used for David Axelrod. So, Axelrod talked to Maureen Dowd over the weekend in a column and she wrote, \"I think -- I'm sorry, Axelrod says, \"I think he has a 50:50 shot here,\" he being Biden, \"but no better than that, maybe a little worse.

A lot of what we're seeing with insecurity at the border is legislative. It requires a change in the law. It requires comprehensive immigration reform from Congress. And this is where I'm going to come to Joe Biden's defense. The border chaos is not some direct result of Joe Biden's decisions. Donald Trump himself was not able to secure the border because he refused to go engage with Congress and strike a bipartisan deal. And I know Joe Biden would like to do that. But, there is not a Congress willing to strike a big bipartisan deal. The one caveat to that is, it looks like there might be a possibility with a trade and aid funding to Israel and Ukraine, to strike some kind of a border deal, but it's not going to be the big comprehensive reform that's needed. So, when Donald Trump says he is going to secure the border, he can't possibly do that if he is not talking about working with Democrats to pass comprehensive legislation.",

He has an opportunity to really, to some degree, upset some factions of the Democratic Party, progressives primarily, and strike a deal that's more aggressive and forceful on the border, less balanced than we would like, that would inoculate this -- inoculate him and nullify this as an issue going into the election. As I said, as we talked about previously and as we all know, the President actually did not and could not stop the money to fund the border wall.

That's not coming from me. That's coming from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I mean, when Donald Trump came into office, there were roughly 1,000 domestic terrorism investigations in the United States. By the time he left, that increased fourfold to about 4,000 domestic terrorism investigations, and that level has remained high. We just saw the FBI Director testifying about it the other week on Capitol Hill. It's their biggest national security worry right up there with China is the explosion in domestic terrorism threats. And a lot of that is also targeting the Jewish community. I mean, you see across the country right now, Police officers standing guard outside of synagogues, because this fear that some of that violence is going to spill over and result in actual attacks.

I don't think I want to say is about what Congress can do about this. They're going to appropriate an extra $1 billion for this national security grant program that allows for places of worship churches, synagogues, mosques, etc., to take grant money from the federal government to boost up their security. And it's obviously troubling that that's even necessary in today's day and age, but they aren't going to plus up that fund as part of the funding bills for next year, because they see that it is necessary. This is something that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has been leading the charge on. When it comes to these tech platforms, TikTok and others, where this sort of hate can be disseminated more easily and sort of more exposed to the public than it ever could be -- could have been in the past, there is a bunch of legislation out there. There has always been legislation about trying to regulate social media ever since what happened with the 2016 election. What we're seeing now is real warnings that the 2024 election could be -- could make 2016 look like child's play in terms of how foreign actors were able to manipulate the algorithms, in terms of how they were able to gin up hatred and sort of get people to attend these rallies that were fake in 2016, just to stir up this chaos. And foreign governments are looking at that, for sure. Russia is looking at it again. China is looking at it. And that's something that Congress really is paralyzed right now in terms of addressing, because they can't come to any sort of bipartisan agreement on it. There is all these plans out there. The elements of a deal are there. But, there has been no deal. And they really -- they have not shown an interest.

Loads of things will happen that will change people's perceptions. And this age issue is a perfect example. It's not going to change. The good news for Biden is he won't have another birthday before the election. So, if there is less of an opportunity to make it a major issue, he'll already have the election over with one way or the other by the time he turns 82. But, in the scheme of things, it's a legitimate concern. But, assuming Donald Trump is the Republican nominee, how much difference is there really between 77 and 81? I say that as somebody who is 71. I'm not ageist. I'm just simply saying I don't think there is a whole lot of difference there.",
