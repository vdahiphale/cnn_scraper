I'm Laila Harrak.Face-to-face, U.S. President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy meets in front of the cameras at the G7 summit as the U.S. announces hundreds of millions of dollars in new aid. And voters are going to polls in the parliamentary election in Greece, but a clear winner may not emerge. And President Biden hopes to talk with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy this morning as the clock ticks down to extend the debt limit. G7 leaders meeting in Hiroshima, Japan, are wrapping up one of their most consequential summits in recent memory. The war in Ukraine dominated much of this year's agenda, and Ukraine's president was there to make his case in person. For the first time since the war began, an agreement was finally reached among the U.S. and its allies to begin supplying Ukraine with advanced fighter jets. Well, U.S. President Joe Biden soon returns to Washington to deal with the debt ceiling crisis in Congress, but he and Ukraine's president did meet within the past couple of hours. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: Today, I'm announcing the next tranche of U.S. security assistance to Ukraine, a package that includes more ammunition, artillery, armored vehicles to bolster Ukraine's battlefield abilities. And the United States continues to help Ukraine respond, recover and rebuild. We're also supporting their pursuit of a just peace. Just one aspect of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial territory has to be nonnegotiable, it just has to happen.",

Russia's defense ministry issued a statement touting the, quote, liberation of the city. And the Kremlin released its own statement on behalf of President Vladimir Putin congratulating the Wagner Group. While CNN cannot independently verify Russia's claims, the Ukrainian military said in its daily update that, quote, battles for the city of Bakhmut continue. But Wagner Group Cheif Yevgeny Prigozhin says his forces would hand over control of the city to the Russian military on Thursday. CNN's Scott McLean joins us now from London. Scott, Wagner's boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, claims the city has fallen to his mercenaries, but what has President Zelenskyy said about it?",

This is not the first time that Wagner has claimed to have captured the town. It was just last month that they said, or Yevgeny Prigozhin said, in legal terms, Bakhmut has been taken. The enemy is concentrated in the western districts. And at least from the Ukrainian military standpoint, that is still the case.Yesterday, the deputy defense minister said that her forces were still controlling a very small toehold in the far western edge of the town. The operational update from the Ukrainians this morning said the battles for the city of Bakhmut are continuing. No one disputes that Wagner and the Russians have managed to take the vast majority of the city itself. The question is whether the Ukrainians control any of it at all. And as you mentioned, President Zelenskyy was asked about this during a bilateral sit-down with President Biden that you played some of earlier, and his answer wasn't all that definitive, but the Russians, the Russian media at least, is claiming that this is acknowledgement from the Ukrainians that they have lost the battle for Bakhmut.

He had plenty of criticism for the Russian bureaucracy, which he said only stood in his way. And he also recorded what he called a short version for T.V. where he acknowledged President Zelenskyy directly saying, without sarcasm, your guys fought bravely, fought well. He went on to say, that if you see -- when you see Biden, kiss him on the top of the head, say hello for me.So, clearly, Bakhmut has had an outsized symbolic value in this war. It has also been extremely well fortified by the Ukrainians, which is part of the reason why even when things were not looking great for them, they held on there, which required the Russians to put a heck of a lot of manpower and resources and equipment into actually capturing the town. And so now the question, when it comes to this Ukrainian counteroffensive, is now that the Russians perhaps don't need to put as many resources into Bakhmut, will they move their forces anywhere and does Ukraine's calculus change as a result?

I remember as a reporter in Tokyo 30 years ago seeing Boris Yeltsin talking to Bill Clinton, invited as a guest to the G7 meeting in Tokyo in 1993. And that was the beginning of the U.S. lifting of sanctions on Russia and so forth.Speed forward 30 years, the Russians, of course, are nowhere to be seen. They were thrown out of the -- what became the G8 after the annexation of Crimea. And here was Volodymyr Zelenskyy playing the role that Russian leaders previously had played.

It is simply that the war changed, that initially what the Ukrainians needed were Stinger missiles to defend Kyiv, and then they needed artillery pieces to defend the south and the east, and now the F-16s may be useful for a long-term deterrent of Russia, but they probably won't actually be in the field until sometime next year. So, they're trying to think out ahead in a situation in which this war drags on at some low level, and Ukraine needs a true deterrent to keep Kyiv from being taken again. But the real question is, if this was considered to be so provocative to Vladimir Putin a year ago, has Putin's own willingness to go put up with American and NATO weapons changed or have we just changed our assessment of what his red line is?",

On China, as you suggest, Laila, I think it was actually a significant bit of progress. Two years ago when the G7 met in Cornwall, it was the first time China was even mentioned in the g7 communique. This time, they actually came up with a set of principles, vague but a set of principles nonetheless, that would unify how the United States, Canada, the other G7 members all in Europe, would deal with China and Japan signed on to those as well. That's of critical importance to Japan.There were, in addition to that, some interesting discussions about what the future of regulation of artificial intelligence might look like. I never recall an artificial intelligence discussion, or really much technology discussion at the G7 before. There's been some on cyber attacks. This was not a conclusive discussion, but it actually does set the seven countries on the way to begin thinking about some transparency measures and ultimately some regulation measures for generative A.I., what you've seen in ChatGPT.",

It's the economy in a longer perspective, so how is the country doing generally, growth, which the government has promised, that it will deliver if it is re-elected. But it's also what people feel in their personal finances.Greece has undergone a huge financial crisis throughout the 2010s. A lot of people have not seen the benefits of the growth that the government that is now still leading in the polls has delivered and is running on a platform of going to deliver more. But for many people here, it seems to be that unemployment, salaries and pensions are the key things that they're looking for. The government has said that in its second bid, it's going to improve the financial status of Greece. It said, well, look at the numbers. Greece is one of the fastest economies in Europe. And the main opposition has also focused on economic policy, but also on the rule of law. Until a year ago, the government was doing extremely well in the polls. But following a wiretapping scandal, where the government seems to be involved and the prime minister's reputation has been tarnished as a result, they have seen their ratings dropped. And this is something that the main opposition is capitalizing on and has helped boost its ratings to a point. However, it seems that people here are not particularly enchanted by any of the main parties. And this is because these are not newcomers. These are people we have seen in power before, both the main opposition in 2015 and now the prime minister and his government in 2019 are known entities. So, for a lot of people, there seems to be a lack of hope that was there before in the last two previous elections.",

Salvadoran National Police initially said three people had been killed, as they were crushed, but that death toll has increased over the several hours.
