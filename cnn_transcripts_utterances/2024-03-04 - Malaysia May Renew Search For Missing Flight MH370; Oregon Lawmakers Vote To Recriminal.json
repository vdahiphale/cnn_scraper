The Boeing 777 was headed to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur back in 2014 when it mysteriously vanished. Remember, some 239 people were on board,Since then, debris linked to the plane has washed up along the African coast and various islands. But the aircraft itself has never turned up. Let's bring in CNN Business editor-at-large, Richard Quest. Richard, you spent a significant amount of time covering this story. You even wrote a book about it. Why is Malaysia launching a new investigation? And what are they hoping to find?",

It's all done on the basis of \"no find, no fee.\" So the financial risk is with Ocean Infinity. What was interesting in 2017 is that the Malaysian -- the then- Malaysian government refused to renew that contract. This is a new Malaysian government, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. And now Ocean Infinity is coming back. But we don't know what, to be blunt. We don't know why and what and how and why they think they'll do a better job this time than they did in 2017.",

Some would say it's long overdue. It was just a few years ago, in 2020, Oregon voters passed a measure that decriminalized some hard drug use. After that, and as the pandemic gripped the U.S., opioid overdose deaths have climbed steadily. Let's bring in CNN correspondent, Josh Campbell, on this story. Josh, you went inside enforcement efforts by Portland police as the city is facing this Fentanyl state of emergency. Tell us what you saw.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Bri, well, parts of this city are in a state of crisis. We went along with Portland police. I was interacting with people who are homeless, that are addicted to Fentanyl, and they talked about this struggle.And just look at some of the recent data from the state of Oregan itself showing this spike in overdose deaths. From 2019 to 2022, they saw an increase of 280 deaths, up to 956 deaths. So quite a stunning spike there. That's what authorities are contending with as they've declared this state of emergency. Now, most of the focus of the state of emergency is on outreach and getting treatment to people in need. But there is an important enforcement effort by police, particularly going after drug dealers. Now of course, using drugs in Oregon, it's not legal. It's still -- you can be cited for it. One officer said it's essentially like writing a ticket. And it's important to point out that Fentanyl has ravaged communities across the nation. So this isn't just a Portland issue. But what's so interesting is, here, this is happening in a place, one of the few places where it's been decriminalized to actually possess hard substances. This all fell under what was called Measure 110, passed by voters themselves back in 2020. I'll read you part of what proponents put forth in that measure. They wrote that \"people suffering from addiction are more effectively treated with health care services than with criminal punishments. Law enforcement should spend more time on community safety.\" But of course, in the wake of this, critics have blamed this measure for the mounting toll that Fentanyl has taken there in the city. But nevertheless, I spoke with the police chief in Portland who said that he wants to get past the politics. He understands that this issue can get politicized very quickly. His focus, Brianna, is on the humanity itself. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I asked her office what she will do. They say that, right now, she is undecided. She will study the bill once it gets to her desk. The main lens through which she'll be looking as she assesses this bill is what impact does it have on treatment, trying to get that balance between enforcement and treatment to those in need.
