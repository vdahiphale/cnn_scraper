Well, I take you back to yesterday when this what is usually a babbling brook basically overflowed its banks. And all of that debris large and small was pushed up against some of the -- against some of the area homes. The good thing is for these two homes here, according to their owners. They told me really the flooding was contained to the basements so the damage was limited. But still going to be quite the cleanup process. The house behind me, an 80-year-old man that has lived there for 55 years. He said he's never seen it like this. But yet, he considers himself lucky even with a really tough cleanup task ahead. That's because just north of here, according to authorities, an Orange County woman was -- sadly lost her life. She was trying to evacuate -- swept away as she was trying to evacuate her home with her fiance and her dog. And sadly did not make it. We heard from New York Governor Kathy Hochul today saying that right now, it's all about damage assessment looking at communities like this one here in Rockland County and the neighboring ones as well to get a better idea of what it will take to make some of those repairs. But again, to be clear, this is a preview of just the damaging potential of the storm system as it continues to threaten millions of Americans north of here.

So, essentially, the biggest question here is whether Ukraine is going to have a path to NATO membership. And if so, how fast is that path going to be, and what is Ukraine going to have to do to actually get that membership in NATO that has sought for so long? That is one of the biggest questions going into the summit tomorrow. And it is something that President Zelenskyy has made a really big priority, something that he has said he's not doing for fun, just you know, attending the NATO Summit if he does, in fact, end up doing that. He's not just coming here for talks. He's coming here for concrete plans as to how Ukraine is going to one day become a member of NATO.Now, the allies are not unanimous on this at this point. President Biden in an interview with CNN over the weekend said that he does not believe that Ukraine should be a member of NATO right now. Of course, Zelenskyy doesn't necessarily believe that either. He has acknowledged that it is very unlikely that Ukraine is going to become a full- fledged member of NATO while it is at war with Russia because that would imply that the United States and other NATO Allies would have to go to the frontlines and fight this war for Ukraine. And so, this is something that he has realistic expectations about. But the U.S. and other allies are still not on the same page about what this is actually going to look like in terms of timing. A concrete timetable for Ukraine's potential membership here. Now, of course, there are also questions looming about the U.S. and NATO's support for Ukraine, practically the kinds of weapons that they will continue to provide and how long they can continue to produce the level of weaponry, including ammunition that we have seen them provide over the last year. Of course, now, the U.S. says that it's running low on ammunition. So, these kinds of practical things will be at play. And then, of course, another major topic will be Sweden's accession to NATO. Turkey has been blocking that. They were hoping this would be resolved by tomorrow. It doesn't look like that's going to happen, Boris.",

He's now a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. Good to have you on, Sir. On Biden's statement on Ukraine's NATO membership, I've spoken to multiple European officials who said privately now is not the time for Ukraine to be in NATO because of the mutual defense agreement that would in effect put the Alliance at war -- in direct war with Russia right now.

And he wouldn't have said something like that if it wasn't happening. So, that's a positive sign for Ukraine. But yes, there were a lot of fears among Alliance members that should Ukraine become a member while it's at war, this could escalate things with Russia.

Providing security assistance to certain governments in Africa.
