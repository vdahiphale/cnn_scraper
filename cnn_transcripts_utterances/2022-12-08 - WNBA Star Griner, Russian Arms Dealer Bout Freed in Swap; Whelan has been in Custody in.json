U.S. President Joe Biden says the American basketball star is safe on a plane and heading home after he agreed to release convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout to Russia. The pair was swapped earlier Thursday at the airport in Abu Dhabi, in exchange secured through joint mediation involving the UAE and Saudi Arabia. President Biden invited Griner's wife Cherelle to the White House Thursday morning, as that swap was announced. Both spoke about Griner's release with a mixture of relief and resolve to get other Americans home, including Paul Whelan, who remains in Russian custody. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He'd already served the majority of his time there after a conviction in a U.S. court in New York after a lengthy extradition battle out of Bangkok. It was in Bangkok where I interviewed him in jail as he fought that court fight to try and keep himself out of the U.S. justice system. What he was essentially extradited for, though quite distant to the career history that he was often accused of, the one him The Merchant of Death title so to speak, or even the Lord of War as the fictitious film starring Nicolas Cage was called. He's always denied being this mythological figure of arms dealing despite the UN investigations. The analyst despite the home videos I've seen of him in conflict zones around the world, saying essentially he was a pilot and a businessman who was in these places, yes, but not dealing arms. Like everybody said. He was extradited, though because of an elaborate sting by U.S. DEA agents who claimed to be Colombian terrorists and got him to agree on camera to sell them sophisticated weapons that could potentially have been used to kill Americans. That's why he ended up serving those many years in the U.S. facility, not because of the many things he's been accused of un-denied in the 90s and early 2000s in Africa and other areas too. But an outsize character is certainly a polyglot speaking multiple languages, even Sanskrit. He told me an e-mail exchange in the past years. And in fact, yoga was something he found solace in, in jail in the United States, a charming man, certainly a man who can talk about his personal relationships with multiple historical figures in geopolitics in conflict zones around the world. None of that should detract from the victims of what he's accused of, certainly and their suffering, but an outsize character who ultimately Moscow appeared to be willing to expend all sorts of diplomatic capital to get back to Russia.",

And itis, of course, absurd to exchange a basketball player accused of sort of the wrongdoing of carrying a tiny amount of cannabis or for a man accused of the kind of arms dealing and crimes that Viktor Bout is. But you have to remember the different systems they're functioning in the different weight they carried within them and how frankly, the current issue of Ms. Griner and her family and the popular calls for her to be released and the open statements made by the Biden Administration, they would do all they can to achieve that. Versus yes, what the Kremlin had said openly about Bout too, but really, it does appear the pressure possibly may have been more on the Biden Administration in a democracy, for those kinds of results. There was nobody willing to hold the Kremlin necessarily to account if they didn't come off in their side with the Bout deal, so certainly different circumstances there. And it's not uncommon for the Russians to at the very last minute to completely change the terms of a deal. That's often I think, why many are reluctant to deal with them diplomatically when it comes to the conflicts they're involved in, specifically the Ukraine war there. Now they're not always the most trustable negotiators, they would say that's possibly one of their skills to suddenly uproot the deal at the last minute and still see it go through. But it is interesting at this point, though, to see how valuable someone like Viktor Bout still remains and that the Kremlin were willing to get involved in high level diplomacy with the United States who are busy arming, very successfully Ukraine with whom Russia is at a war after Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine and those arms supplied by the U.S. are killing Russian soldiers daily. So it was a high stakes move certainly for Moscow, but one that they possibly felt was worth doing. And you have to wonder whether or not they were in their own way sending signals to Russia's elite its intelligence community to those who might see Viktor Bout as a figure who they desperately needed to get back to prove to paraphrase of Russian war slogan that's often disastrously used. They don't leave their own behind and maybe the case on the Russian battlefield in Ukraine, multiple Russian bodies left behind there. Maybe in this one instance, they wanted to show in a high profile prisoner case like Victor Bout. But all their years of diplomacy and pleading would actually come to something, Lynda.",

In the end, it was Viktor Bout, a Russian arms dealer, major arms dealer in exchange for a basketball player who was accused of smuggling a minor amount of cannabis oil. How do you think this is playing out for Putin? Like, obviously, he seems like he had the upper hand to some extent he knew that the U.S. wanted both Griner and Whelan back. But he wasn't willing to consider a two for one deal here.",

Many U.S. organizations have people of the United States have followed it. And it's clearly, you know, a political win for President Biden when this happens. President Putin has not been in this position the people of Russia; do they ever demand anything of Putin? Because they don't because it doesn't, it doesn't do them any good. This is an autocracy. But there has been no demand on the streets of Russia or anywhere else for Viktor Bout is released. So, Putin has not been under pressure for that. So, you know, in that context, I think we can judge how this plays for Putin when Viktor Bout arrived home. How is it played on state media? How do are the sort of the principal Russian propagandists who beat the drum for the Kremlin and the Kremlin's views? How do they play this? Do they play it as a big victory? Do they move on very quickly? So you know we can better judge that question, I think when he arrives back in Russia. But we do know that the Russians initially wanted a second person released a convicted Russian murderer who's sitting in a German jail beyond the jurisdiction of the United States. They initially wanted him released as a two-for-two deal. Obviously, he wasn't the murderer wasn't in U.S. jurisdiction, so not under President Biden's purview to move forward on the deal on those terms.",
