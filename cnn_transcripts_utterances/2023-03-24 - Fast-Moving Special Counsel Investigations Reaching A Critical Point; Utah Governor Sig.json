Meanwhile, a laundry list of Trump's advisers have now been ordered to testify before the grand jury that's investigating January 6th. That includes Mark Meadows, Donald Trump's chief of staff.

I did some reporting around this at the time and found that studies have shown that there is, in fact -- there are direct links between depression in teenage girls and social media platforms, but there is also debate within the psychological community about whether social media use is truly an addiction. I recently interviewed the pediatrician who leads Boston Children's Hospitals, Digital Wellness Lab. His name is Michael Rich, and he calls himself the mediatrition, because he's the expert on these topics.
