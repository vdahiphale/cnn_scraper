You are the best source here in the DeSantis campaign. What happened last night? MARC CAPUTO, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"THE MESSENGER\":  Well, they are not pleased and not so happy they trusted Elon Musk and Twitter to pull this off. After all this is a guy who can send off rockets but they couldn't pull off a Twitter Spaces interview. Throughout you heard the moderator, say, oh, well, this happened but we fixed it. It did not help to remind the audience there was a failure to launch. So they are not too pleased about it. But overall, one of the things that animates the Ron DeSantis campaign is their general loathing of the mainstream news media. So the more the media talk about it, the more they believe it proves it was not a problem and they are kind of over the target.",

He is just going to roll downhill. That's going to be decided in January or February. So for DeSantis, who has the money, the message and the organization, he is essentially, in the words of one adviser, basically moved to Iowa and he's going to set up an unofficial residence there and spend a disproportionate time there with the aid of a super PAC. And he'll spend a tremendous amount of time in New Hampshire. In 1976, when Iowa was the first in the nation caucus state or contest in the Republican primary, no Republican been able to secure the nomination without winning either Iowa or New Hampshire.

House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries just spoke, the top Democrat in the House, and this is what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY), MINORITY LEADER:  It is clear to me that President Biden is continuing to hold the line as it relates to the types of devastating cuts that Republicans are trying to jam down the throats of the American people, including making sure that he stands up for our veterans. It is unacceptable that, on one hand, you have Republicans pretending as if they would never cut anything that adversely impact the health, safety or well-being of veterans and military families but doing the exact opposite.

There is some discussion about a deal that is now being discussed and no final agreement between the White House and House Republican leaders. And talking about possibly increasing the debt limit through the 2024 elections and including a part of that a range of spending cuts that the Democrats do want to have a long-term debt ceiling increase. The Republicans want a shorter one to have more leverage. But Republicans are pushing for stricter spending cuts. That's something that the White House is resisting and caused some Democratic concern. I spoke to both Kevin McCarthy and the lead negotiator in the room, Patrick McHenry.

And he said, quote, \"We absolutely don't think there will be a scenario where we cross the X date and interest payments will be missed.\" And the last part, missing an interest payment, is key, because that is the red line for Moody's as far as what would trigger an actual default or a downgrade. So why is Moody's so confident? Well, they pointed to two things. One, that the leaders in both parties, they say they don't want to default, which is nice to hear. And two, they pointed to the history. America has always paid its bills. Foster said, quote, \"There has never been a default.\" And of course, a lot of -- (CROSSTALK)",
