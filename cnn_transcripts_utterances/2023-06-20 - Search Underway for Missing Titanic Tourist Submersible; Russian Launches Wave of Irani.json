A huge search-and-rescue operation is under way right now, really racing against time, trying to find a tourist submersible that went missing on a trip to see the Titanic shipwreck.Five people, we know, are onboard. The United States and Canadian Coast Guards have launched an all-out search with planes, with ships, and with buoys equipped with sonar. As of yesterday afternoon, officials estimated the passengers could have been somewhere between 70 and 96 hours' worth of air. That's all they had, they believe, and that was yesterday. We're learning more about the people who are on the submarine. The passengers included a British billionaire explorer, a Pakistani businessman and his son, and CBC News and CTV News in Canada reporting that a world-renowned French diver and Titanic expert was also on this trip. CNN has yet to confirm, though, that he is, indeed, onboard. Take a look. These are some of the last images of the submersible as it prepared to dive down on Sunday. The ocean is about 13,000 feet deep in that area. The deepest ever underwater rescue was less than 2,000 feet, just for some perspective. So we begin this hour with our colleague, CNN national correspondent Jason Carroll, live from Boston. Any updates this morning, Jason?",

We are expecting to get another briefing from the U.S. Coast Guard here in Boston. So perhaps at that -- at that point, we'll be able to get some more information about how these sonar pings are going to work, more information about the C-130s that are in the air at this point, searching from the air.

It's certainly something that a lot of them had anticipated. And we spoke to some units on the ground and, I have to say, all the ones that we spoke to were still very much in good spirits, but they do say that the Russian defenses are really tough and that the Russians certainly are putting up a fight, as well. The Ukrainians right now, as they say, are sort of penetrating the early stages or the first stages of those defense lines, but they haven't even reached the main defense lines of the Russians. So they understand there is going to be a tough battle ahead. And one of the things that they have said again and again, the biggest problem for them on the ground, is Russian airpower. It's being discovered by Russian drones. They're getting blanketed by artillery. But also, Russian helicopters and jets, as well. So the Ukrainians are saying they need to do something on that front to try and improve their own short-range air defenses as they move forward. It is an extremely tough battle. But certainly, the Ukrainian president seems to be correct. And this is something that we've seen over the past 24 hours, as well. Right now, it is Ukraine that is on the offensive on pretty much all parts of the frontline. The Russians on the defense on pretty much all these parts, Victor.",

      "sentences": "OK. What you need to know is that -- how highly unusual it is for this storm to form in the month of June in the location that it actually is.This is called the main development region. We look for the African wave train, kind of these clusters of thunderstorms that move off the West coast of Africa; traverse the Atlantic Ocean; eventually start to form into hurricanes or tropical storms, since (ph) this Tropical Storm Bret. But the water here is running about two to five degrees Fahrenheit above average. This is like jet fuel for development of hurricanes and tropical storms. So that's what we have here. We have another wave that's going to likely be named later today. Let's focus in on what Bret's about to do, because this is the official forecast track from the National Hurricane Center. It does show a strengthening storm, into a low-grade Category 1 hurricane, by Thursday morning. And then you see some gradual weakening as it travels towards the Windward Islands, the Lesser Antilles, so Granada into Barbados, St. Vincent and then the Eastern Caribbean. We should see some further de-strengthening -- or de- strengthening as it continues to travel across that area. Here's a look at the forecast rainfall. We could get a couple of inches of rain, especially across the Windward Islands, and certainly, the potential for hurricane-force gusts. But this is wind shear. Hurricanes and wind shear do not work well together. So any time we get that upper-level, high-level winds, that's going to kind of shear apart the storm. So the potential exists, at least some models indicating that this system will start to become disorganized in the five- to seven-day time frame. That's good news for the United States. But the not-so-good news is the severe weather threat that continues to move across the Deep South. This area has been battered with day after day of severe storms. In fact, I think I've counted on maybe 7 to 8 days of continuous severe storms across this region, from New Orleans into Mobile. You say some of the flash flood video out of that area. Level two of five of flash flood exists for that region today -- Victor. BLACKWELL: And the heat some people are dealing with.",

But they also stress that the carbon-fiber structure of Titan could reliably pull off a mission like this, and they did not spare any expense or cut any corners to pull that off. That's what they repeatedly said to me. I've interviewed Stockton Rush several times. And not just him but also his staff and his crew. They would talk about safety over and over and how confident they were in the technology of this vessel and of the other vessels they have designed over time. But we have since learned that Titan has had some issues before with communication, that they've lost communication with support crew on the surface of the ocean before. CBS News reported that last year the vessel was lost for more than two hours, unable to get messages from the surface, which they rely on to figure out where they're going, because there's no GPS onboard. So in this case, Titan's last communication with their support group was Sunday at 11:47 a.m. local time.
