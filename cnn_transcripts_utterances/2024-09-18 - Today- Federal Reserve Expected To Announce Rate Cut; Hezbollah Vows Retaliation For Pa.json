Later today, a major announcement expected that could have a big impact on the economy less than seven weeks out from Election Day. The Federal Reserve widely expected to announce they're cutting the benchmark lending rate after keeping it at a 23-year high for more than a year. Here's what Fed Chairman Jerome Powell -- Jerome Powell's announcement could mean -- would mean for Americans. Borrowing would get cheaper. Ideally, that leads to more business investment, resulting in companies hiring more and selling more. Probably because consumers would feel more inclined to spend money with these expected lower rates. This could be just the first of many cuts to come, but the move already expected and is already being politicized. Donald Trump trying to get ahead of this big announcement. He's claiming the cuts are needed because of the Biden-Harris administration. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We saw a letter up from senators -- led by Senator Elizabeth Warren, who many people are familiar with is often tries to take the pro-consumer stand on these kinds of issues and they say that if the Fed is too cautious, they wrote this letter in cutting rates, it would needlessly risk our economy heading toward a recession.They're actually arguing in this letter for 7 -- you know, 0.75, not -- three-quarters of a point rate cut. That seems clear. It seems clear that that's not going to happen. But again, this seems to be about jobs and whether the unemployment rate is going to get too high.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. You know, there are reasons to worry that the unemployment rate is going to get too high. We've seen unemployment move up to 4.2 percent over the course of the past year. That's up from 3.4 percent. So it's a pretty dramatic increase over a relatively short period of time.That said, 4.2 percent is still pretty low by historical standards. And overall, the economy is sort of looks like its returning to something that pure sort of roughly in line with the normal we were used to before the pandemic, rather than falling to pieces. And so I think that's the challenge for the Fed. They have to look at this job market and figure out, is this return to normal? Or is this a slowdown that we need to be concerned with? And I think those call for two very different policy prescriptions and that's sort of the tricky balance that they're trying to strike at the moment. HUNT:  Jeanna, there seems to be this perception that if Donald Trump gets reelected, the rate environment would be much different than if say Democrats like Kamala Harris were to keep the Democratic hold on the White House.

They do not set policy based on what the president wants. It does not matter what the president is telling them. They do not have to listen.So, Donald Trump is promising to drastically cut interest rates but that is not actually a power within his toolbox. He doesn't have that capability. And he'll usually couch it in this idea that he's going to drive inflation down because he's going to cause so much its drilling and so much oil production. I've talked to a lot of oil economist about this. They tell me that it's just -- can't push oil prices down like that. It doesn't work. The math doesn't work. Oil companies wouldn't produce the levels that he's -- he's promising. So, that first link in that chain doesn't work. And in fact, most economists will tell you that a lot of the other policies Mr. Trump is suggesting would potentially push inflation up and so if we had a situation under Mr. Trump where inflation was rising, you could actually see a little bit higher interest rates under his watch.",

We're not quite sure exactly how that would work.[05:15:00] But there were initial reports that this was just a case of overheating the batteries and getting them to explode. But now, we understand there was actually explosives within the pagers. They must have got there somehow, either via Mossad or the defense ministry or some sort of system that they had in place. But we don't know where it happened. So, whether it was in the factory, you know, on the way to the factory, that's what people are investigating at the moment, but it's early days, but a really sophisticated operation and deadly as we've seen.",

On Monday, the Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said during a meeting that the time for diplomacy with Hezbollah has passed and military might could take center stage. Literally hours later, their enemy's entire communications infrastructure was hit with an attack that according to Lebanese security source, used pagers purchased by Hezbollah in recent months. And so this necessitated a long lead time in the operations planning. So, basically, they're saying, this has been going on for a long time. And while we've, of course, focused on -- I mean, the pictures from these attacks, the sort of idea that you're something you have in your pocket could explode at any moment is all very dramatic. The reality is the leader of Hezbollah had warned his people off of using cell phones because of the possibility of for surveillance.

You've got to remember, you know, there are tens of thousands, if not hundreds. Its a thousands of Hezbollah members and, you know, it was awful as this incident was and deadly and people injured, including civilians, it seems, you know, they -- we're talking about hundreds low thousands of Hezbollah members who have been affected by this.
