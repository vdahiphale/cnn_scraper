Some believe that Trump was done, would never come back again, or ready to move on. But, as we know, time has changed. Trump, well on the way to becoming president again, and a lot of Republicans simply don't want to relitigate what happened January 6, 2021, want to move on. And that's a message that Senate Majority Leader John Thune gave me in the aftermath of this week's election certification, saying that he's ready to move forward, doesn't want to go back into his view of that day.

But I can tell you this has now become a national priority. It was just a few hours ago that we heard from Chinese leader Xi Jinping. He issued some remarks calling for all-out efforts to search and rescue any survivors from this quake, which, as you can see on this map, is very close to the Himalayans. This is a very remote part of Tibet, about 100 miles away from the epicenter is the nearest city, that being Shigatse. And as you can see in some of this video, the rescues are taking place.People are in many cases covered in debris from when the earth began to shake at around 9 o'clock this morning. Rescue crews have been able to finally be deployed. The Chinese Air Force is also part of this effort. But there are a lot of challenges. Number one is infrastructure, as we see from these images. Some of the roads and highways are covered with debris. That makes it difficult for people to get out of the earthquake zone and for rescue teams to enter to see exactly what they are facing. There have been some communication issues. At one time, phone service was down in some of these very remote villages. And then the other challenge being weather. As we look ahead to this night, this night of uncertainty, of course aftershocks are going to be a concern. At one point today, 49 individual aftershocks were recovered. And those can be just as destructive and just as damaging. As far as the rescue effort, we know that a drone is on the ready to try to get an aerial look. That is really the challenge right now, it appears, to try to assess just the scope of all of this. The Chinese New Year is actually about two weeks away. It's supposed to be a very festive time, a very sacred time for many families.

Since becoming president-elect Donald Trump's advisor, Musk's words have more muscle. The power pair have teamed up on calls with world leaders, notably with Volodymyr Zelenskyy one day after the U.S. presidential elections. But it is Musk's right-wing push picking up on what former Trump strategist and advisor Steve Bannon began eight years ago, championing Europe's far-right populist disruptors that has Europe's leaders worried. EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT (through translator): Ten years ago, if we'd been told that the owner of the largest social media networks would support an international reactionary movement and directly intervene in elections, including Germany.

But Musk is going further right than Bannon, attacking a staunch Trump ally, Nigel Farage. Saying Farage doesn't have what it takes to lead his upstart Reform U.K. Party. Farage, the British populist who pushed Brexit just hours before Musk's put down, had counted the tech titan a supporter who might finance his fledgling party.
