Moscow says Ukraine has fired U.S. supplied longer range missiles into Russia just days after getting permission from the Biden administration. U.S. officials say Kyiv used the ATACMS to strike a weapons arsenal in the Bryansk region.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy would not confirm the attack but said now that his military has longer range capabilities, it will use them. In an apparent response, Vladimir Putin updated Russia's nuclear doctrine. The Kremlin says Russia now has the right to use nuclear weapons in response to conventional attacks. More now from CNN senior international correspondent Frederik Pleitgen in Moscow. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): Ukraine not wasting any time, striking deep into Russian territory, using U.S. supplied ATACMS surface-to-surface missiles only days after getting the go ahead from the Biden administration, the U.S. confirms. Ukraine's president coy when asked about the strikes. We now have ATACMS and we will use them, he said. Moscow up in arms, claiming Ukraine targeted military installations in southwestern Russia overnight. The foreign minister ripping into the Biden administration. The fact that ATACMS were used repeatedly tonight in the Bryansk region is, of course, a signal that they want escalation and it's impossible to use these high tech missiles without the Americans. And Putin has spoken about this many times, and now, Putin has reacted. Breaking news on Kremlin controlled TV after the Russian president signed an order changing the country's nuclear doctrine. The use of Western missiles for strikes into the strategic depths of Russia means direct involvement of NATO in the war, the host says, and now Moscow's hands are untied. Among the changes, the Russians now consider attacks by non-nuclear nations like Ukraine with the help of nuclear nations like the U.S., worthy of a nuclear response, at least on paper. The spokesman for the Kremlin says the reason why the Russians decided to update their nuclear doctrine is so potential adversaries of Russia know that retaliation will be inevitable if Russia is attacked. (Through text translation): We're with the American channel CNN. Can we? Okay? This morning, your president Vladimir Putin signed an update to Russia's nuclear doctrine. What do you think about it? UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through text translation): What is there to think about? What kind of response can there be? Only this kind. PLEITGEN (through text translation): He has greatly expanded the possibility of using nuclear weapons. Do you think this is a good idea? UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through text translation): What should our president do? He has to think of something. We need to scare someone.",

First and foremost, the air component, air power.Without air power, neither the United States nor their allies in NATO would fight the war and so we lost a lot of lives and a lot of infrastructure, a lot of time. And now the Biden administration is trying to fill the gap and help us to cope with the increasing pressure from Russia. The Russians are on the verge. They are trying to portray that they are winning. They are pushing people away from the wave on Ukraine. They are losing up to 1600 people weekly but -- and they brought some Northern Koreans to the frontline. So we need something, we need technological advance over this mass of the Russians, and the Biden administration is trying to help us with that. But certainly it's not a part of the strategy. It's just like the willingness of Mr. Biden to help Ukraine to be in better position with possible new policies from Mr. Trump. The Biden administration is trying to sort out things with almost $6 billion U.S. approved by the Congress and they are now in Russia to provide Ukraine with material and other assistance that we need to protect ourselves.",

It's about new security architecture in Europe. You may recall the situation of 2021, when there was a first threat of the Russian full-fledged invasion of Ukraine. At that time, Mr. Putin blackmailed the United States and their NATO allies.And he demanded the United States to pack their belongings and get out of the European continent and for NATO to expel the Central and Eastern European nations. [00:10:07] So he wants to control Ukraine, but he wants to have an upper hand over Europe. It's something that Mr. Trump could not provide Putin with and we just had a track record of Mr. Trump. He didn't achieve any resolution with the Northern Korean nuclear program and in the Middle East. So this conflict between Russia and Ukraine, between Russia and the West overall is more complex than we've seen in the Middle East and in the far east. So I don't think that it's possible to have just a lasting peace. It's possible to pressure over Ukraine that Ukraine give up on some territories, give up on some bits of our sovereignty. I mean, our willingness to be a member of NATO, which the only way how to protect Ukraine in the future. But it's not going to solve this problem. We will see nuclear proliferation because the rough states across the globe would see that you can commit genocide, attacking other country without any consequences because the West would be hesitant and would not help and would not stop such a genocide. The other nations, the peaceful nations living in such neighborhood, would seek nuclear arms because they understand that even the goodwill of the American people and the policies they are not capable of protecting them, not to mention that the Europeans would be insecure and they would not be able to join the Americans in the Pacific, deterring China from taking over Taiwan because they would need to invest more and more in their security. So the prospects of pressuring Ukraine over this conflict, they are there just dire for Europe and the rest of the world.",

However, there are still several candidates as Donald Trump had expanded the field in recent days, all of them have met with Donald Trump and the transition team.

However, again, they are hoping to get this out as quickly as possible specifically given that so many of Donald Trump's policies on day one that he has said are related to the economy.

Good to see you, Kristie. So this is a significant day in the national security trial of Jimmy Lai and a measure of just how much press freedom exists. Walk us through this first day of testimony. KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Lynda, here in Hong Kong, I am standing outside the court where the jailed media mogul Jimmy Lai is speaking for the first time in his national security trial. He has already pleaded not guilty to several charges of sedition, of colluding with foreign forces, serious charges that, if convicted, could send him to prison for life. Now earlier today, we witnessed about 100 people show up outside to wait in line for the opportunity to get a seat to sit inside the courtroom. We also witnessed how security has been very tight here, with police selecting individuals who were standing in line to question them and to search them. Inside the courtroom, we heard and we saw Jimmy Lai. He is now 77 years old. He appeared visibly thinner. He waved to his supporters and his loved ones who were inside the courtroom including his wife, including his daughter, including Cardinal Joseph Zen. He said that he always opposed violence. He said that any advocacy for independence in Hong Kong is, quote, \"crazy\" and he also talked about the reasons why he founded his media empire, saying that it's all about more information, providing more information. The more you're in the know and the more free you are. This is a case being closely watched by people here in Hong Kong and around the world. Watch this.

And for 77-year-old Lai, life would most likely mean life. He has already been in custody for nearly four years. His arrest after sweeping national security laws imposed by Beijing, which China said restored stability to Hong Kong after months of antigovernment protests in 2019. At that time, Lai had lobbied foreign governments to apply pressure on China. But his lawyers deny that happened after the new laws came into effect. In 2020, Lai was marched out of the offices of Apple Daily, the pro-democracy newspaper, which he founded. Today, most of Hong Kong's political opposition have either fled the territory or are in prison like Lai who after a lifetime of speaking up for democratic freedoms may be getting his final chance to speak publicly before spending the rest of his days behind bars.

Well, South Korea's intelligence agency believes that around 11,000 North Korean troops are now in Kursk, Russia, and that some have already participated in battles against Ukrainian forces. South Korea says that Pyongyang is supplying Russia with new, longer- range weapons. Mike Valerio has more details from Seoul. Good to see you, Mike.

      "sentences": "Yes, big weather maker for the West Coast of the U.S.But this is an atmospheric river and a bomb cyclone all at the same time coming together. Now, the warm bombogenesis has nothing to do with social media. This is not made up. We've been using the term in literature since 1980, and likely just in talk since World War Two. It is a storm that rapidly intensifies. We talk about rapid intensification in hurricanes, as well. This is not a hurricane. It is equivalent to the pressure equivalent to a Category 3 major hurricane in the Atlantic. But the good news is the low itself is not going to come onshore. What will come onshore is wind guests, probably around hurricane gusts. Other than that, an awful lot of rainfall. In fact, an atmospheric river event that's level four out of five. So, an awful lot of rain. Some of the forecasters going for 10 to 15. I've even heard numbers up to 20 inches of rainfall, because this is a long-term event. It's still going to be raining tomorrow, and even some showers still on Friday. So, yes, we are going to see significant numbers here when it comes to rainfall accumulations. But the good news is at least this part of Northern California has not been wet. So, a lot of this can soak in. It may rain too hard for all that to happen everywhere, but there will be some soaking rainfall here coming in. And even with the high risk here of some flooding, that's a possibility for your Thursday from Eureka all the way down to Ukiah. That's the thought process where the floods are possibly going to be the worst. There will be floods. How bad will they be? We don't know yet. The good news is, the land is not completely saturated. So right now just flood watches in effect. Of course, we still have those snowstorm events here coming in, with blizzard warnings just to the East of Seattle in the higher elevations. But you get the idea. In fact, some spots here with the wind could still pick up 60 inches of snow, and that snow getting blown around, especially on the top of those peaks. I guess that's some good news for skiing. Skiers will take that. You just don't want to be on the mountain when that happens. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
