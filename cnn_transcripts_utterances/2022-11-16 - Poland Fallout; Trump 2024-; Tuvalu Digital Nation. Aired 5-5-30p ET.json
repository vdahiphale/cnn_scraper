Among the victims on Tuesday was this 69-year-old woman. She was visiting her husband's grave in Kyiv when a piece of shrapnel tore through her body and killed her. As winter sets in, Russia is making Ukraine's civilians suffer with reckless abandon. But what happened here in Poland shows just how dangerous that is for the whole world, too. This, while Ukrainian officials, are redoubling their request for more advanced air defense systems from the United States and Europe. They've also committed to cooperating with an investigation into what happened here and admitted their air defenses were active in the area. But officials are clear, Russian President Vladimir Putin is responsible, dragging millions of Ukrainians and now a sleepy one-street Polish town into his war of choice.

How he could know that so early on is quite interesting. He is also saying that all of the data from this missile strike that NATO and his allies in Poland have, they would love to see in Ukraine. He's also said that he would like to be able to send Ukrainian officials to inspect the site where the two farmers were killed. So, he is sticking to the whole position that it wasn't a Ukrainian missile, it wasn't even in Ukraine. There was no fault for Ukraine, which is peculiar because as Matthews pointed out, the international community does not blame Ukraine for this event. It points the finger of blame very firmly in Russia. Ironically, it may even result in an improved level and greater volume of surface to air missiles for the defense of Ukraine coming in from those countries around -- particularly Western Europe who haven't yet contributed in that way, because, of course, any more of these accidents and things couldn't get much more dangerous with the danger of sucking NATO further into a conflict with Russia directly.",

He said that American investigators are on the ground in Poland helping polish counterparts figure out exactly what happened, and that he will let the investigation play out before saying anything more definitively. What is clear, Austin said, is that Russia ultimately bears responsibility. President Joe Biden had been in Bali, Indonesia for the G20 summit and after convening in an emergency meeting, he said it was unlikely that the missile had originated in Russia. Meanwhile, the top U.S. general defended previous comments about possible peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, saying that with winter approaching and Russia on its heels, there will be a slowdown he said in the fighting which could provide a window for a possible political solution.

Russia has fired over 100 muscles over our territory yesterday, over 100 missiles. So, of course, there have been different situations. It could've been Russian missiles or ours, protection of ourselves, our attempt to save ourselves and to stay alive. We are right now fighting for our existence. We are trying to protect ourselves from 100 of bombs and for missiles that are coming there to kill us and everything that we love. So, this is why it is so, so important that no matter what the investigation will show, the response will be clear. The response should be only one, give Ukraine more air force protection systems. Give us an ability to protect ourselves and protect our neighbors. Give us an ability to continue.

But his big announcement isn't getting the fanfare he may have expected. The twice impeached former president is looking to serve another term after he refused to accept defeat in 2020 and incited an insurrection. Some fellow Republicans blame him for the party's losses in recent midterm elections. It is time to move on. Even \"The New York Post\" who traditionally supportive of Trump buried the story. The bottom line on its cover says, a Florida man makes announcement page 26. Let's bring in CNN's Steven Collinson in Washington. Stephen, conservative media clearly having a bit of fun with this today, but underpinning all of this is a pretty serious question because after the failure of the Trump in the midterms and with the string of lawsuits against Donald Trump.

      "sentences": "Well, I think if you look at what is happening when Trump was making his announcement last night athis beach resort in Mar-a-Lago. The current president of the United States, Joe Biden, was multiple time zones away, surrounded by American allies trying to stop the war in Ukraine spiraling out of control after that explosion of a missile across the border in Poland. That was the kind of leadership that the world didn't see from Donald Trump who tried to drive allies apart. He was very hostile to NATO, who was much more comfortable in the company of dictators than American allies. So, when Donald Trump left office, there was a sigh of relief from many democratic world leaders, especially after what happened with the Capitol insurrection. When Joe Biden told him that America is back, they wanted to believe it and they welcomed it. Yet, at the same time, they were a little skeptical. The reason they were skeptical is because of what happened last night. Donald Trump was basically trying to win the presidency again if he has a second term. It is likely to be even more disruptive, not just in the United States, but around the world. His America first philosophy will again crash with the traditional expectations of the rest of the world has for American leadership. There are many people who thought if Trump had gotten a second term that he would try to pull you not say that NATO. You can just imagine what implication that would have had for the situation we have seen with the Ukraine War and the Western alliance uniting against the Russians.",
