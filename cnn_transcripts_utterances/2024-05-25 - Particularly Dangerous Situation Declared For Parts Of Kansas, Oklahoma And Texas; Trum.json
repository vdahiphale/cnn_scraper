It is getting late in the day, that sun will set soon, so you need to know that before you go to bed tonight, make sure you have your emergency where it is turned on and turned on loud.Here is a look at all of our tornado watches right now from Wichita, Kansas, through Oklahoma City, down into San Angelo, Texas. The part that is labeled the particularly dangerous situation spans from all of this part here in Oklahoma, so including Oklahoma City. This tippy top part here of Texas, and then going into Kansas, into Wichita. It goes until eleven o'clock this evening again, again, particularly dangerous, but not only are we expecting tornadoes, but we could have tornadoes that are strong and violent. Here is a look at what is on the ground right now. We do have a batch of severe thunderstorms, a couple already with tornado warnings there in parts of Northern Texas, and then headed up towards Oklahoma City. Youve got that strong band of storms there as well. Here's a look at the overall risk. It is that level four out of five moderate risk there in the red from Wichita Falls up to Oklahoma City into Wichita, Kansas. And now even into Springfield, Missouri, the way it turns here. In this area, especially in the red and the yellow, that is where we can find the intense tornadoes, hail up to the size of even grapefruits possible and damaging wind gusts up to 80-plus miles per hour. This is the bullseye for the tornado threat that I mentioned. Again, the strong and violent EF-2 or greater for tornadoes really centered there in Oklahoma City. And then as we go into the overnight, this will start to turn into a damaging wind threat as you go into parts of Missouri where we could find these winds up to 80 miles per hour, that's why the threat was extended into Southwest Missouri on the overnight. So let me show you how this plays out. You see all of these little discrete cells. Those are the strong violent tornadoes across parts of Kansas there in Oklahoma. Then you can see them continuing, again 10:00 PM, that would be while you're sleeping, discrete cells with violent tornadoes. Then here comes that wind part. You see how they start to come into a line, that's where you get the threat of damaging winds across parts of Southwest Missouri. It continues going into the morning hours into the Ohio Valley, look at stripe. We week you can see damaging winds there as well and the threat continues as we go into Sunday. So as we go into Sunday, here is that threat for tomorrow. We've got that level three out of five in the orange from St. Louis to Nashville up towards Louisville. Additional tornadoes, more damaging wind gusts and large hail possible. All of this in what has been a crazy active year so far, more than 900 tornado reports since we started the year. Average to date would be about 700. So it has been very active -- Jessica.",

An investigation into that incident is ongoing. Let's turn now to the war in Ukraine where Russian missiles have been raining down on the critical city of Kharkiv. Ukrainian officials say Russia launched a third strike there this afternoon, leaving more than a dozen people injured, that includes a 13-year-old boy. Hours earlier, a Russian strike hit its crowded shopping center, official saying at least two additional people died there. Three dozen were injured.

What is the significance besides being the second largest city. COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Right, Jessica, yes, it is good to be with you. One of the key things to note about Kharkiv, which is right here, is its only 20 miles from the Russian border. The Russians also have this town of Belgorod, which is a major staging area for the Russian forces and has been really since the beginning of this war. But Kharkiv is really important, as you mentioned, second city, but it is also the key to Northeastern Ukraine, and when you look at all of Ukraine, you can see that there are so many different parts of this area, but this is basically the key to everything that is coming to the south and everything that is basically in the eastern part of the country right here.

This terminal, right here was basically key to all of that and it is based on basically getting data from low earth orbiting satellites, and then transmitting it like a Wi-Fi system to a local area network around this particular terminal. And that's the kind of thing because when you look at the kinds of things that have happened in Ukraine, if they don't have Starlink, what really happens is that they are in essence cut off from communicating with all of their forces. And when it comes to this, this is really part of Russia's electronic warfare effort, which is designed to really prevent US weapons from working, as well as preventing the Ukrainians from communicating with each other.",

Well, that's no longer the case. That is the big turnaround here. And what we see is in fact, the percentage of Americans who believe that a recession is coming has dropped off significantly. Just from last year, a recession now or in the next year -- last year at this time, it was 66 percent. Now, it is just 40 percent. That is the lowest level we have seen since before for the COVID pandemic. So yes, there are fears about the economy. There are a lot of folks who are thinking that the economy isn't necessarily doing so well, or certainly isn't doing as well as it was before the COVID pandemic, but the fears that the absolute bottom will drop out have alleviated somewhat and I think that there are a lot of folks who are saying, you know what? My fears of the economy dropping completely out are not there as much as they were anymore.

And the provocation was the inauguration of a democratically elected leader, who was previously serving as vice president. So there's very little change in actual policy. So what that tells you is that the Chinese government is looking for almost any event that they can find to do this demonstration of force that they could take the island if they wanted to.The last big one was Nancy Pelosi's visit two years ago and they used that moment to go across the sort of central line in the Taiwan Strait. They've kept doing that in the years since. And so they're making no pretense now about their ability to encircle the island. The question is, do they actually have intent to take it over one day or is this just intimidation.",

We've had three or four times where the president has said not only would he defend Taiwan, but he would send American troops, which is something that he never said and has never done in the case of Ukraine. The difference has to do with our agreements with Taiwan that emerged from the Nixon-Kissinger decision to begin to open up to China and then later on the full diplomatic recognition of China. So the question is do the Chinese believe him and do the American people believe him; would Americans be willing to lose the lives of large numbers of American soldiers, sailors, marines to defend an island that was central to the last Cold War, but seems to have diminished some in the minds of many Americans since. And we simply don't know. I think what President Biden was trying to do there, Jessica, was probably create some doubt in the minds of the Chinese themselves about how far we might go.",

It's the one that is most likely to bring about a big reaction from the United States, the West, and so forth. The second is to do the slow squeeze, to basically declare Taiwan just a part of Chinese territory, begin to intercept shipping, make sure that internet communications have to pass through Chinese hands. In other words, just do the slow boa constrictor act.And I'm not sure the U.S. is quite prepared yet for how it would react to that because there would be no single dramatic moment.",
