I find these moments unusual because they could play into Trump's narrative that this is not just the judicial system looking at the facts and the law, as they would for anyone else, could potentially play into the narrative that this is somehow politically biased.",

And according to our friends in the room, she laughed out loud at that comment. So she's not even staying quiet inside the courtroom. She's not speaking, but she is visibly responding to some of the lines of questioning and Trump's answers.",

But she has a choice, whether she wants to engage or just remain stoic. And she is leaning into this in the court of public opinion, making remarks before everyone goes into court, interacting with him in the courtroom and joking with reporters about where their attention should be focused. Again, I think it's worth pointing out that that could feed into his narrative that there is some sort of bias against him as opposed to facts and law that do not favor him.",

He said to the court, quote, \"Yes, I had a lot of cash.\" Of course, a bit of a humble brag. But at the core of this case is the question about whether he fraudulently misrepresented his net worth to get more favorable terms on loans and more favorable terms from insurance companies. So while he's sort of joking a little about how much cash he had on hand, his net worth, what that was, is critical to this case and whether these loan applications were legitimate, whether they were accurate. He said here that he believed, as part of that loan agreement, it also required him to have a net worth of $2.5 billion. He was asked, do you believe you complied with this loan? According to our colleagues, he said, \"Yes, I do.\"",

Nobody was arguing he didn't have money. What he was trying to argue earlier was that, actually, the property values of some of these places were underestimated, undervalued rather than being overvalued, which is not -- and he acknowledged some were up, some were down. But for the most part, he was saying undervalued, which is not what the judge has already found.",

And then he started to be called out that maybe this wasn't accurate. Now, it's one thing to lie to the press but another entirely to lie to banks or insurance companies. And that's what he's up against here. You can tell it is a sensitive subject for him whenever the valuation of certain properties comes up. He has, in the past, the past line of questioning over the past few minutes, since they've been back from the lunch break, he has remained more disciplined, more composed and more on script. Certainly, more so than right before lunch where he was attacking the judge, he was attacking the attorney general. He was all over the place.",

There's still a chance that he will not have a conservatorship, the chance that he would be able to self-retain and do business in that court in New York City and New York State, more broadly. He's missing the forest through the trees, because as he's trying to get notches under his belt to get under the judge's skin, that is the person that could be more generous in what he'll allow to happen there. But image this. You're talking about counsel. In other cases in this world, where he's going to be relying on the defense of guidance and advice of counsel. If, in this context, if he says, I don't listen to those attorneys, or I don't have reason to do so, how does that play in the other cases he will be in? Because what is good for the goose is good for the gander to the other prosecutors in this case. Ultimately, Trump still has a shot to not have the book thrown at him in liability. He keeps messing around and thinking the only way to win this case is to get under the judge's skin.

That's probably the reason the judge stepped back from the more antagonistic in the trial today, and said, all right, prosecutors, it's your job now to rule and control this witness. Otherwise, it becomes him doing all this as opposed to the A.G.'s office. But it goes back to what his role is. His role is fact finder, it is a credibility assessment. Those are virtually untouchable on appeal. [14:45:02] So the more that he makes credibility findings, the more he makes statements that they're not being objective, or go back a little bit in time to when he had that second sanction for the gag order and said, I do not find you to be credible.

The tricky thing this puts on the judge is that the judge has to, when ruling on a mistrial or anything else, at least state his reasons for why.
