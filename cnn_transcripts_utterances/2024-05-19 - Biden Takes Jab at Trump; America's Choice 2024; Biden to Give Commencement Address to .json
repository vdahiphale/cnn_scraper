That is an issue that has been of key concern to many young voters. The White House dispatched a senior official just last week to Morehouse College to meet with a small group of faculty and students. That meeting lasted a little over two hours, and I'm told that about half of it focused specifically on the issue of Gaza. But President Biden will face a very delicate balancing act as he gives his remarks on Sunday. One, there is the potential for possible protest due to his support for Israel in its war against Hamas. But then also the president is trying to navigate shoring up support among black voters, including young black men. Black voters comprise a core part of Biden's constituency and coalition back in 2020 that sent him to the White House. But recent polling has shown some lagging support from that group. Now, President Biden stopped to meet with some black voters, supporters at a restaurant here in Atlanta, Georgia on Saturday and talked about the accomplishments of his administration, but also warned the threat that Trump could pose if he's reelected. President Biden also took a bit of a swipe at his rival. Take a listen.",

That body has now been recovered. The IDF isn't saying where, but we understand it was recovered along with those three other bodies whose recovery was announced on Friday.And we've been having these protests by the families and their supporters of those who are still being held captive in the Gaza Strip. And polls show that the majority of Israelis rank the recovery of Israeli hostages, returning them to Israel as a higher priority than destroying Hamas militarily. What they are trying to do is put more pressure on the government to do whatever it takes to get their hostages home. And it's worth noting that hostage talks mediated by the Egyptians and the Qataris have hit another roadblock, hit another impasse. And I suppose their big concern now is that we are seeing bodies being recovered of hostages who were presumed previously to be alive, and they're worried that if things aren't sorted out soon that they will not be getting their loved ones back alive.
