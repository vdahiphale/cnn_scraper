According to a law enforcement source, yesterday there were about 2,000 migrant apprehensions in this area. Last week, the daily average was about 3,000.And you can see that behind me because when we talked last week, there were thousands of migrants in the field that you see behind me. Right now, that field looks empty. Now, this is a lot of Border Patrol work, too. They're decompressing. They're trying to figure out ways to process these individuals as quickly as possible so they're not outside waiting. But there are many factors that the Border Patrol is dealing with right now. And according to a senior CBP official, they're not out of the woods yet. They are dealing with smugglers who are trying to push migrants into the U.S. southern border illegally. And different parts of the border are dealing with different challenges. In Arizona, for example, large groups of migrants are being dropped off by smugglers in very desolate and rural areas. And we've also learned from a CBP official that pseudo-legitimate travel agencies abroad are promising trips to the United States. And lo and behold, they end up connecting passengers to smugglers south of the border. Now, that might explain this scene. This is a recent video that we took in Arizona. Take a listen.

He also says police will utilize new strategies to keep officers at their assigned posts when incidents happen so that new vulnerabilities are not created when officers are moved around. Apple will appeal a trade commission ruling blocking imports of its newest Apple Watch in the U.S. after the Biden administration declined to intervene. The ban affecting the Series 9 and Ultra II watches, among other newer models, because they allegedly infringe on patents registered to another company. Apple says while it appeals, it will also submit a redesign for U.S. customs approval. The company also says customers who purchase the affected models before the ban will not see any service disruptions. U.S. home prices hit another record high in October, rising for the ninth straight month. That's despite mortgage rates lingering above 7 percent in October.

There's multiple layers of failure from multiple different people. Whether it's on a local level officer or some supervisor in a prosecutor's office that saw a red flag but still ignored it and sent the case forward. These are things that could prevent wrongful convictions. Just having that awareness that something could be going wrong here and having the ability, the stomach to say, I'm not going to do this is huge.
