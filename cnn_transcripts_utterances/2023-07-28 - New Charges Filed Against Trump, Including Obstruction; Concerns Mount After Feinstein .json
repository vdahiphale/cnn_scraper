So if a witness, for example -- why is it we're seeing now a superseding indictment? Let's take it back a step. They just had a scheduling conference with the judge. The judge ought to be upset if the judge wasn't given any warning there'd by a superseding indictment. Is this really new evidence or did they turn the screws to Mr. De Oliveria -- the person who said, apparently, that Mr. De Oliveria said this, but said Nauta said this, who said Trump said this. Why is this happening now? There are a number of things I would say about this indictment. Why do we see in counts 32 and 38 allegedly false statements that the lawyer supposedly made attributed to Trump and Nauta and the lawyers aren't charged in the case?

There's a very interesting article in The Hill that suggests that his evaluation of evidence, both its strength and its reliability, is questionable. There's a real agenda here, I believe, and that's why we see an indictment for public consumption like this. This is an unusual indictment. Look, if there's an advantage to defense lawyers to how all of these details -- you know how to prepare cross-examination now.
