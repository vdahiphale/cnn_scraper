We'll ask the Red Cross about rescue efforts on the ground. Then, the U.S. House Speaker says he is calling for impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden, despite a lack of direct evidence. We'll have all the details for you from Capitol Hill. Plus, a landmark hearing in Israel. Will the country's Supreme Court rule to limit its own powers? But first, this evening, we start with catastrophe in Libya where flooding has devastated a country torn apart by civil war. And a warning some of what you are about to see is graphic. At least, 2,000 people are dead in the wake of Storm Daniel, another 10,000 are reported missing. The storm triggered the collapse of two dams which overwhelmed parts of Derna, you're looking at there. Officials say hospitals in the city of --  are flying -- in morgues are at full capacity. Gruesome images show the bodies of victims lying on the ground. Families are looking for their loved ones and praying they're not among the dead. Meanwhile, groups like the Red Crescent are putting their lives on the line to save others. They say they're low on resources and they've lost three volunteers. Our Eleni Giokos has more now from Dubai. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELENI GIOKOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Chaos as volunteers from the Libyan Red Crescent scramble to save residents. Put him in the car, one of the rescuers says, bring him here. A tireless effort, but limited by the sheer scale of floods that swept eastern Libya. The full scale of the disaster visible in the daylight. The earth ripped apart, houses destroyed or completely washed away, and thousands dead and missing. Apocalyptic scenes stretching farther than the eye can see. The culprit, Storm Daniel, the same that ravaged Greece and Bulgaria last week, it made its way back into the Mediterranean, picking up strength before crashing down on Libya. The downpour, several times higher than the rain Libya usually sees in the entire month of September. Too much for the war-torn country's infrastructure to handle. In Derna, one of the hardest hit cities, two dams reportedly collapsed wiping out a quarter of the city. Rescuers have been faced with a catastrophic scene.",

But you can't ignore the politics here, because over this six-week recess, Kevin McCarthy has been facing mounting pressure from both is right-wing and former President Donald Trump to move forward with an impeachment inquiry. In fact, some of those hard-line members were even threatening McCarthy's speakership if he did not move quick enough. So, that does explain some of the thinking as Kevin McCarthy returned to Washington this week. But at the same time, he is still facing resistance from other members of his party including some moderates, some members who were up for re-election and are vulnerable, and even some conservatives who say they just have not seen enough evidence yet. And so, that is why Kevin McCarthy is not going to have a formal floor vote on this impeachment inquiry. He doesn't have the votes, and he wants to protect some of those members. So, instead, he has instructed his committees to move forward with this process. He has not put a timeline on how this process will play out, but Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of his allies said there is no rush, and they should take as long as they need to develop this investigation.",

That was passed in July by Benjamin Netanyahu's government and some say it puts Israel on a path to dictatorship. Hadas Gold has been following this story all along. The court has started hearing arguments on the reform this morning; 12 hours later, it's still going. Give us a sense of what you have been hearing so far today, the arguments for and against.",

As we are seeing now, there are 15supreme court justices sitting around in the courtroom. That has never happened before in Israeli history, where all the 15 judges, when there are 15, are sitting to hear the case. It's still going. What they are considering is the law passed in July, that takes way the supreme court's ability to nullify government actions that they deem unreasonable. Now the question put before them is whether this law can stand. Something that the supreme court president said, she is the woman smack dab in the middle of those 15 justices, there must be a mortal blow to democracy to strike down the law. That is what they are considering right now. The plaintiffs, who are the ones that brought the petitions, say the law should be struck down, they say it harms Israel's democracy. What the lawyers argue is the supreme court has no authority to review the basic laws. They say that authority rests with the people themselves and their democratically elected representatives. What is interesting is that the government's lawyer is not the attorney general. She is a nonpolitical appointee but on the opposite end of the spectrum. She has been arguing that this law should be struck down. Now arguments are still continuing. It's difficult to take the judge's words and try to figure out which way they will rule. But some key lines that have stood out to me from what the judges have said today, one of the judges asked, fine, if all of this power should rest with the democratically elected people, what's if the government decides not to hold elections? How will the people have their voice? The supreme court is essentially the only check on power for the parliament and for the executive. Another key quote, this might be one of the major key quotes of the hearing, one of the justices said, \"Democracy dies in a series of small steps.\" It doesn't happen all at once but in a series of small steps. Even if this hearing wraps up today, it's very, very unlikely we will get a decision. The 15 judges have to write the decision. At this time it has to come by January, anytime before then. But that sets up potentially another crisis. The Netanyahu government has so far not said that it will abide by a supreme court ruling that would potentially strike down this law. That is setting up a constitutional and judicial clash.",

Today they talked about the fact that Israel's declaration for independence, used as the basic foundation law, is not even a real or important document. The people that signed the declaration of independence were not elected by the public. It was something that they had, a series of excuses that just show that they had no understanding of what democracy is. As you said, democracy doesn't fall in one day. It's a very long and slow process. Israel has been experiencing it for a long time. In the last year, since the government was reelected, they exposed their real intentions.

Israel's government structure is very different from America's structure. We don't have two elected houses. We don't have a constitution. We don't have districts or constituencies. The only check to government's power is the supreme court. And what they are trying to do now is to remove that check. They want ultimate power with no balance, with no checks, with nobody to stop them. In this government today, the most racist and extremist government we have ever had, it's a collaboration of the most racist extremist politicians together with Netanyahu. He has one goal in mind, to escape his trial. And they are not representative of Zionism, of the Israeli idea and hopes and dreams of most Israelis. Even their own voters didn't know that this was the government, the judicial reform. They had no idea this was the plan when they voted for them.

And what this government is doing, because of their own interests and regardless of the interests of our society, they are just breaking this solidarity apart. They spread fake news and lies. Netanyahu doesn't take any interviews to Israeli media, any interviews in Hebrew. He only takes interviews for American and foreign media because he expects the people outside of Israel will not understand what he is doing here. He doesn't talk to the voters. And the Israelis are very much afraid of what is happening here because we see how our country is breaking apart. But I have to tell you, I'm actually incredibly optimistic now. For the past eight months, week over week, we have been protesting in the streets in hundreds of thousands of people, who are holding flags and go outside and dedicate so much of their time, effort and sacrifice for this country.

So this is all speculation as to where exactly the two will meet. But they are expected to meet. One thing, it will have a military focus, a military flavor to this meeting. We have been told by Kremlin spokesperson through Russian state media Dmitry Peskov that it will be a full-blown visit with talks between two delegations and touch upon, quote, \"sensitive issues.\" The key is who is involved in these discussions. We heard from the Kremlin that the Russian defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, will be in the talks with Kim and with Putin. We know from footage as well that, within the Kim Jong- un delegation, there is a key military figure, Ri Pyong Chol. He is considered the leader of the missile program in North Korea. He is sanctioned by the U.N. and U.S. and he is also involved in these discussions. Even though we don't know the location and the timing, we can guess at the topic and it is what U.S. officials are saying, that there could be potentially an arms deal between North Korea and Russia at the end of this meeting -- Paula Hancocks, CNN, Seoul.
