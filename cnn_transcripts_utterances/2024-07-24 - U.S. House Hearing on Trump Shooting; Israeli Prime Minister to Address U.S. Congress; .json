And look, we've seen in previous hearings, just in the last few days, especially the hearing that involved testimony from U.S. Secret Service director or former U.S. Secret Service director, Kimberly Cheatle, that lawmakers were frustrated when Cheatle did not directly answer their questions. Even some basic questions about the timeline and the security lapses that led up to and allowed the assassination attempt of Donald Trump to happen. Wray is going to have to provide some answers and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are going to push him hard on that. And one issue that the FBI has been working on specifically since it took the lead in this investigation, is trying to build a profile of the shooter himself. That's been all in an attempt to try to establish some sort of a motive. Why did this 20-year-old do what he did? Why did he open fire on former president Donald Trump? Wray specifically told lawmakers during that briefing a few days ago, the FBI not established any sort of motive or political ideology or political reason why he would have done that. Lawmakers are going to want an update on that specific topic as well. As we know, we now know what investigators found on the shooter's phone and on his search history, including details about his search history that revealed he looked up the specifics about Donald Trump's rally in Pennsylvania and Donald Trump himself. But also other political figures, including Democrats and Republicans and others in between. So they're going to want Christopher Wray to explain where the FBI is in terms of establishing a motive. That'll be a key priority for lawmakers today.",

We have additional leads out there.

Last August, an armed Utah man threatened to kill President Biden and was killed as FBI agents attempted to serve a warrant on him hours before President Biden landed in his state. Some on the Right claimed that the man was simply, quote, \"a Second Amendment enthusiast.\" In recent weeks and months, those on the Right have repeatedly called for a, quote, \"civil war.\" It was an Ohio state senator saying that Republicans would lose the election, quote, \"It's going to take a civil war to save the country and it will be saved.\" The president of the Heritage Foundation likewise said that, quote, \"We are in the process of the second American revolution, which will remain bloodless if the Left allows it to be,\" close quote.

The average age is around 31, which means they are bringing a wealth of personal and professional experience when they arrive.

Those are clearly going to come from the Secret Service because they were in charge of the security perimeter and of course, in protecting Donald Trump. So part of this is just to get that those questions are still unanswered out. Wray handled it well. He said basically, we are -- we are in communication with the Secret Service. We are trying to figure out that that -- what one congressman said, that five minutes, right, when there's an identification. And Donald Trump is not pulled from the stage, what the -- what Wray wants the committee to focus on, which they won't, is clearly the motive issue, is what was he able to do and what why did he do what he did and what capacity did he have? That's the discussion about the explosives and the drones and other things. I will say, I mean, my overall picture so far, which I've been pondering since the assassination attempt and I think is the fundamental contradiction of what happened that day, is that the -- a very unsophisticated person with very unsophisticated technology -- the drone was described as unsophisticated. The triggers were described as unsophisticated -- the access to a weapon, which is relatively easy in the United States; no clear agenda or motive -- was able to almost kill the former President of the United States.

My next guest is in Washington, D.C, where he and his organization are among those who've been speaking out against the war in Gaza and protesting against Israeli prime minister Netanyahu's speech to Congress.

And we need a ceasefire because we need to release our hostages because we need to enter  humanitarian aid inside, because we need to renew support of UNRWA inside Gaza.
