Those documents, which Flynn had a role in helping put together, specifically name-checked Eric Coomer, the Dominion executive who Flynn's being asked about in this deposition. Now, look, this hasn't stopped Michael Flynn from continuing to claim that 2020 election was rigged over the last three-plus years. And, in fact, just one month after this deposition was taped, Michael Flynn went and did an interview. And he once again broadly claimed that the 2020 election was full of fraud and warned that 2024 would be the same. Take a listen to what he told Chris Cuomo just one month after his deposition.

      "sentences": "So, we heard something similar from Flynn prior to this deposition video being brought up in court and obtained by CNN.Look, Flynn has not proved to show any evidence to support any of his broader fraud claims. But, again, he's been one of those vocal amplifiers of these baseless claims that the 2020 and now the 2024 election will be ridden. And he's also used that to sort of to raise money, and lots of it, over the last four years. He's gone on a nationwide speaking tour, where he's been paid fees to espouse similar on theories about the 2020 election. Election denialism is really the core of what's turned into a cottage industry, and Flynn has been the forefront of that.",

They ask, who will be in a Trump Cabinet or in a Trump administration?And the next question is, will Michael Flynn be a part of that? Trump aides have tried to distance the former president from Michael Flynn whenever I have asked directly about that question. But, listen, Donald Trump has said as much from the rally stage during the campaign cycle. So take a listen to one time when he did call out Michael Flynn by name during a rally. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (R) AND CURRENT U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  General Flynn, he's some general. He's some man. He took abuse like nobody could have handled and he came out bigger, better, stronger than ever before. We love him. He's a leader. General, you just have to stay healthy, because we're bringing you back. We're going to bring you back. (CHEERING) (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Butler County isn't the kind of place where they're going to have an army of call-takers, like a major city. So you can tell that the operators in these 13 calls we have reviewed zero in on, are you with a person who was injured? Is anyone around you shot? Where are you located? And then they all basically tell the callers, we're aware of it. The police are taking care of it, because they need to move on to that next call. Unlike so many of those operators where we have heard these calls where they start to ask a long list of questions with the intent of keeping the caller on the line and getting details, it gives you a sense of the urgency that the call takers were using at the 911 center, as well as the fear and panic on the ground. What you don't hear in the calls, Jim, is anybody saying, I saw the shooter, I know where the shots came from.

He's one of seven members who penned this letter. I guess let me jump right into this, Representative. Where does your request for an investigation into all of this currently stand? Because we have been chronicling this on this program. The amount of misinformation out there about these storms has just been unbelievable. REP. WILEY NICKEL (D-NC):  No, it's a real problem. And it's hampering our efforts to respond and provide disaster assistance to folks. My office continues to get inundated with calls about stuff that's totally bogus. Much of it is generated by folks like Donald Trump lying about FEMA money going to immigrants and Marjorie Taylor Greene saying Democrats control the weather. But Russia is behind so much of this. We have seen this playbook over and over, where they continue to sow mistrust in our elections. Any time there's funding for a disaster, whether it's the Key Bridge or now in wildfires, they say, oh, they're giving money to Ukraine, rather than whatever the disaster is.
