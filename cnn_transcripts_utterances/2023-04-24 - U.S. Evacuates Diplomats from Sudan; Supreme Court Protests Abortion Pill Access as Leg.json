This is a photo of Secretary of State Antony Blinken, watching this tense operation unfold. The U.S. and other nations have been scrambling to get their citizens out of the country as brutal fighting rages between two rival military factions. Some U.S. citizens were able to get out of the country on French military planes. That is according to France's foreign ministry. We're told, though, still about 16,000 U.S. citizens are in Sudan at this moment. Many of them are dual nationals. So we begin this hour with our senior international correspondent, Sam Kiley.

But even as the president's team is working towards that announcement, which is likely to come tomorrow in a video, the president is facing serious headwinds when it comes to the public perception about whether or not he should run. And chief among those concerns are the president's 80-year-old age. Now, if you take a look at a recent poll that was out from NBC News, the majority of the American public does not believe Biden should seek a second term. And within his own Democratic Party, half of Democrats do not believe the president should run for re-election. Now, if you look at the concern that's these voters have, the -- nearly half of them say that his age is a major issue. President Biden is 80 years old. He would be 86 at the end of a second term, if he were to win. But his advisors believe that they can overcome these concerns about his age. His allies have pointed to his records and say the voters ultimately will side with him when they look at the alternatives. But it's very clear that the questions about his age will present a very steep challenge for the president as he tries to get voters onboard with a second term.",

They're way behind on their decisions for this session. And I think what you're seeing here, Don, is a modest shift that might be more in sync with America. But I want to caution that, on that word \"modest,\" this is still a 6-3 conservative court. They're still moving to the right.

He has note announced that he is running for president, but he is meeting with international leaders, an unusual step for a governor.That is Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida, who was in Japan this morning, meeting earlier with the Japanese prime minister, as you see there. His first lady of Florida, Casey DeSantis, also greeting the prime minister. The prime minister says that he hopes the visit is going to lead to further strengthening of Japan-U.S. and the Japan-Florida relationship. This comes as DeSantis is expected to visit South Korea, Israel and the United Kingdom in a trip clearly meant to burnish his foreign policy credentials. Joining us now is CNN political commentator, a political anchor for Spectrum News, Errol Louis. Errol, great to have you with us this morning. You know, obviously, he is here trying to rebuff the criticism that he got when he made his comments about Ukraine. People saying he doesn't deal with foreign policy day to day. But he's still being asked about Trump and those polls. He was asked about it while he was there. And he kind of made this face and said, Well, I'm not a candidate yet, so we'll see if that changes.",

He's got real problems in Florida, and he's chosen to go overseas.Clearly, he's got his eyes set on the White House. Clearly, he's going to do what governors in his position have to do, which is show that they are not going to make a fool of themselves on the international stage. And so, there's a lot to lose. Not a whole lot to gain. Because does he have a fully flushed-out foreign poll? Of course he doesn't. Does he have anything to say that's going to be meaningful and move the needle, even for businesses in his state? No, that's not really what governors do. So he's in a sort of very fraught position. And I think that sort of encapsulates it. He's like, Hey, I'm not a candidate. But of course, nobody would be talking with him in Tokyo or anywhere else if he weren't likely to be a candidate.",

Because Biden, the -- excuse me, President Biden is supposedly going to announce tomorrow with a video. But there are some in these new polls. There's an NBC poll that shows how Americans are feeling about Biden and Trump's re-election. Seventy percent say Biden shouldn't run again. Sixty percent say Trump shouldn't run.

That they'd like something else to happen.You know, because actually, if you look at the president's approval numbers, they almost exactly, in that same poll, track with approval, disapproval on the economy. People are worried. You know, things are -- we're in a period of transition, right? Hundreds of thousands of businesses went under during the pandemic. Some of them are roaring back. We've got low unemployment in state after state after state. A lot of the regional and secretarial rejuvenation is really being felt. On the other hand, you've got this inflation, which needs to be tamed. And the way that you tame it is the Federal Reserve raises interest rates. Now you can't buy a house, and now things are a lot more expensive. And now, all of a sudden, your spending power is going down. So I think people are in a very sort of unsettled mood. And, you know, given that, they'd like to have -- just have something different. What I'm reminded of is -- is one of these favorite lines from President Biden, where he says, Don't compare me to the almighty. Compare me to the alternative.

I want something else.I want to -- I want to go in a different direction. I want to break out of the old politics. And you know, this is really what lies behind. I think this question about the president's age, which is not just him personally. Well, those are very serious concerns, but I think this is a larger question about when do we get this older generation off the stage and let some of the younger people who make up, you know, a plurality of the country at this point, when do -- when do our people start to sort of emerge?
