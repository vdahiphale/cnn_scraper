      "sentences": "Hello, everybody, welcome to Inside Politics. I'm John King in Washington. Thank you for sharing your day with us. Fire, smoke in a new Middle East flashpoint. The United States retaliates with airstrikes that after a suspected Iranian kamikaze drone kills an American contractor inside Syria.Plus, a Trump lawyer testifying in front of a federal grand jury in the classified documents case. But the former president's attention is on New York. He calls the Manhattan prosecutor a degenerate and he recklessly warns of death and destruction if he is charged with a crime. And right now, President Biden meeting with his counterpart to the north, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The visit happening if the United States and Canada strike a new deal to slow a growing migrant surge. Now, though, we begin with a commander in chief moment for the president of the United States. President Biden signing off on retaliatory airstrikes in eastern Syria. Social media video, you see it here capturing the smolder and fire, fury of American missiles fired from F-15 fighter jets. The president hitting back at Iran after a kamikaze drone flew directly into a coalition base, killing a contractor and wounding five other U.S. service members. CNN obtaining video of ambulances racing to the scene of that attack. The back and forth stretches already strained relations between Washington and Tehran. The United States keeps about 900 troops in Syria, alongside American contractors. Stepped up Iranian backed targeting of Americans is now a top concern inside the Pentagon. And this morning, the National Security Council underlining the danger and the president's readiness, they say to respond. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, we are learning at this hour that those five U.S. service members as well as an additional U.S. contractor are currently in stable condition after being wounded by that suspected Iranian drone attack on Thursday morning eastern time.But we are also told that this Iranian drone, suspected Iranian drone, I should say, it was a one-way attack drone. And it attacked infrastructure, essentially the U.S. military base there in northeastern Syria, and it exploded on impact, right, it was targeting very specifically that base. And we're also told that the U.S. deliberately targeted facilities in Syria that it believed were being used by Iranian proxy groups to store munitions and also for intelligence gathering reasons. But look, this is not the first time that the U.S. has conducted this kind of airstrike targeting Iranian proxy groups in the region. In fact, the U.S. has about 900 troops in Syria as you mentioned, and they have really undergone multiple attacks from these Iranian proxy groups over the last two years, as many as 78 attacks according to the commander of Central Command, General Erik Kurilla. Kurilla also in testifying to lawmakers last week, he did say that the U.S. is changing its defensive posture in Syria to better protect U.S. personnel. But he also after this U.S. strike left open the possibility that if the Iranian proxy groups do not stop their attacks on U.S. personnel in the country, then the U.S. of course, reserves the right to take proportional action in the future. And importantly, the National Security Council spokesperson there, John Kirby, he emphasized this morning that the U.S. is not seeking war or conflict with Iran itself, but that they will take action, of course, to protect U.S. service members in the country.

Appreciate it to both of you. We end the week now referring to a story we've talked about throughout the week.But today, important and secret testimony right here in Washington. We ended of course, also waiting on Manhattan prosecutors to pick a pathway forward. And we ended watching Donald Trump do - sadly what Donald Trump does, calling his opponents names and pushing his fans, his supporters toward violence. Today a big event in the Mar-a-Lago documents case. Evan Corcoran and the Trump attorney is under oath. special counsel prosecutors want to find out if the former president directed Corcoran to lie or to aid and abet a crime. Corcoran's testimony is a big victory for the special counsel. And it follows to significant court wins. But in New York, another case we've been watching, the Manhattan D.A has gone dark. The grand jury hearing evidence on the hush money case there, does not meet again until Monday. And it is right now simply unclear whether prosecutors plan to present another witness or if Alvin Bragg will ask those grand jurors to return an indictment. The quiet is not so calm though due in no small part to Donald Trump being Donald Trump. He is writing profane rants on truth social. In one, posted after midnight, he smears the Manhattan D.A. as a quote psychopath. And it is hard, hard, very hard to dismiss these words, especially because we all know the history. Donald Trump's words is anything but incitement, quote, potential death and destruction. In such a false charge could be catastrophic for our country. More on those reckless words by the former president in a moment. But first, one of the reasons, he is so on edge. Let's get straight to CNN's Katelyn Polantz. She's outside the federal courthouse here in Washington. Katelyn, a big victory, the special counsel and big testimony before the grand jury.",

Now, let's get some important legal perspective. Our CNN senior legal analyst Laura Coates is here. So, put your former prosecutor hat on. It is extraordinary as Katelyn notes to be able to get at court and then an appeals court to say, Mr. Trump's lawyer.Privilege aside, you have to go tell that the special counsel is presented at least threshold evidence that you might have been involved in helping him further a crime. What do you get? What are you trying to get from Evan Corcoran that you can't get from anybody else? LAURA COATES, CNN ANCHOR &amp; SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: First of all, it is unbelievably extraordinary to pierce this very important protection. We want people to be able to be truthful with their attorneys to have the protection that wherever they talk to them about in the furtherance of legal advice and service will be truthful and clear. Here, the crime fraud exception says, if you're trying to use an attorney as a conduit of a crime or trying to use that protected communication to actually do the wrong thing, we're not going to honor it. Here you have an attorney, testifying on essentially. What did you know about the certification, and everything had been handed in? What were you told? Who gave a code read? And what was that code rea here? Did you know that it wasn't in fact complete? What kinds of documents were you told, or perhaps thought were handed over and were not? The idea of getting it right from the horse's mouth, so to speak, specifically, what was said, and why perhaps there may have been a reason or that have not to hand over everything is going to be so important here.",

Is that this is key to the obstruction, the idea that Donald Trump was losing (Ph) his lawyers to lie to the government about saying, I returned it not so much about how they got there in the first place, or how they might have been handled or why it took them. But this part is, you know, they certified, or we've returned them, or we have a few lefts, but they had way more than that.

We've all been wondering all this time. I've never seen Donald Trump carry a box, carry documents with him, right?So, how did they get from point A to point B? How did they remain there? And we don't know still. What was the nature of the document. As I'm sure it's very, very interesting to Jack Smith and company about what actually is contained because it might answer the question as to why there was an agenda to actually retain these documents. So, from the moment they left the site of the White House where they were supposed to be, or whatever, you know, skiff related jurisdictional place to where they are now, and don't forget, Trump has fought the return of these documents.

That involves the Stormy Daniels hush money case in New York. He has the investigations to federal grand juries here headed by the special counsel. He has the Georgia investigation.The New York Times has a piece today, which they quote, a former top Justice Department official saying, it wouldn't be any surprise that people out there were kind of confused and the Justice Department prosecutors sometimes worry about that, everything gets merged together. So, people sometimes lose the nuance in the separate investigations conducted by different entities. Does that matter? I mean, in the public consumption now, there's probably a great deal of confusion. But does it matter to the individual prosecutors trying to build their cases?",

If you're talking about a jury pool, you know, you want a jury to feel like this is the very specific case, you're asking them to look at and be able to clearly delineate from the different cases. And if they're known to sort of conflate other things, they might be in the court of public opinion, judging one particular case by what is given in another once. You have that concern.But these are all independent sovereign entities. They don't need to coordinate with one another. They don't need to ask Alvin Bragg or Fani Willis or even Merrick Garland and Jack Smith, what they're doing to proceed. But remember, we only have this timeline from Tuesday on because Donald Trump presented it. We didn't get that from the D.A.'s office, from the Justice Department. They don't owe that to anyone. And so, in many respects, this timeline about judging where they are, has been a part of a bit of a publicity stunt, I would say from Donald Trump, without more. But going forward, obviously, on the hierarchy of cases you might think about, an insurrection, the idea of not wanting to hand over the office, the Oval Office, somebody else very, very important to our democracy. The idea of a hush money payment might rank lower, but it does not mean that it's not a law - lawful case in pursuit for this particular D.A.",
