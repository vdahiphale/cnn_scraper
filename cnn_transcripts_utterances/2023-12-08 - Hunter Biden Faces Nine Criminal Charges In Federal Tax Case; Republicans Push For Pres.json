      "sentences": "Good morning. Thanks for being up early with us. I'm Kasie Hunt. It's just before 5Hunter Biden, the president's son, under indictment this morning in a second criminal case. Among the nine counts filed yesterday, failure to file and pay taxes, evasion of assessment, and filing a false return. Special counsel David Weiss alleges Hunter Biden quote, \"Engaged in a four-year scheme\" to avoid paying at least $1.4 million in taxes from 2016 to 2019. Instead, Weiss says he spent millions on an extravagant lifestyle, including drugs, escorts and girlfriends, luxury hotels and rental properties, exotic cars, clothing, and other personal items. Hunter Biden faces up to 17 years in prison if convicted. Let's bring in CNN legal analyst and criminal defense attorney Joey Jackson. Joey, good morning. It's always good to have you here. Hunter Biden's attorney, Abbe Lowell -- he released a statement that said quote, \"If Hunter's last name was anything other than Biden, the charges in Delaware\" -- which is his first indictment -- \"and now California would not have been brought.\" What do you think of this strategy? JOEY JACKSON, CNN LEGAL ANALYST, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah. So, Kasie, good morning to you. You know, I think the strategy is one that he's trying to really suggest that this is a politically motivated prosecution. We've heard that before, right? It comes from all angles. And so, the issue is, is there justice in filing a multi-county indictment -- nine counts -- with respect to taxes that aren't paid in 2016, '17, '18, '19? Is there a better way? Should this be criminal or should it be assessed, really, in -- with respect to a civil type of proceeding? And so, I think that if it were not for the whistleblowers -- and obviously, we also know, Kasie, that the Republicans released a statement with respect to their committee saying that just the opposite of this, right? That because of the whistleblowers we're here. That he received favorable treatment from the special counsel Weiss and they should have run harder with him. But at the end of the day, it's about justice. And we know -- you harkened back to Delaware -- that all of this was supposed to be resolved with a misdemeanor, far different from a felony -- so why are we here? And so, I think the strategy is to suggest -- look, enough is enough. The system has to be just to everyone, not just a person because you're the president's son -- treating them differently.",

And that exposure should have been limited months ago and we shouldn't be here because now he's exposed to, as you noted, 17 years. Not that he'll get anywhere near that presuming that this case will resolve itself much more favorably than that.But we're in a climate now where it's so politicized, right? Cases should be about truth and justice and the American way. It should be about right or wrong. It should be about treating everyone similarly. But if you treat his son differently, what about the Trump family? What about what you're doing with him? And so, ultimately, I think the defense should have gotten out of this and ahead of this and resolved this along with, as you know, Kasie, the gun case. So I think there are multiple regrets. And when you have a hand, play it, right -- play it well and get out. And I think the fact that we're here now is problematic and it's troubling for them.",

Did you know that you had an obligation to pay? Did you willfully not pay? Did you willfully file false statements or anything else? And so, paper cases are very difficult to overcome. I think the best play of the defense is really to try to get this resolved much more favorably to indicate that other cases similarly were resolved, really, from a civil perspective and not really from a criminal perspective. And see if you can go back, get a misdemeanor plea, and get this out from under you. I don't see any basis to go forward. And it's an embarrassing indictment, quite frankly. You read the 56 pages and, yeah -- you know, it's just a lot about him and his entertainment, and his prior habits and experiences. People have, sometimes, difficulties in life.

Margaret, good morning. It's -- I'm very grateful to have you here.I mean, let's talk about Trump. Let's do big-picture Trump legal woes here because this is obviously a civil case. He cares a lot about it because it's about his businesses. But I want to show everyone what the calendar looks like starting in January of 2024 which, is, of course, an election year. You can see the orange are political events. The red are legal events. And it is all tied up together. In February, we have jury selection in his election subversion case. I believe that's just before the expected New Hampshire primary. They seem to be viewing this as a political opportunity -- these cases. How does the Trump campaign look at this entanglement? How should they be looking at these entanglements? And what are the risks here? MARGARET TALEV, SENIOR CONTRIBUTOR, AXIOS, DIRECTOR, SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY DEMOCRACY, JOURNALISM, AND CITIZENSHIP INSTITUTE (via Webex by Cisco):  I mean, Kasie, I think if you look at Donald Trump's performance during his presidency and before then, his strategy tends to be tactical. It's like a series of five-yard plays rather than trying to make, like, a 30-yard pass. And so, he's taking these as they come. And in this particular case, he's absolutely tried to use the opportunities when he didn't need to be in court but chose to be in court to use the courtroom as a -- as a campaign podium -- a campaign stage. And in this most recent case, they paid an expert half a million dollars or so to talk about patterns and practices and what's acceptable when you're evaluating your properties and stuff, and saying this is allowed within the law. That will be up to the judge to determine how seriously to take that. But if you're taking that case to the voting public you are giving an expert's explanation, which then becomes sort of a permission structure to ignore this case and continue to support your candidate. And that's pretty good value compared to the price of a 30-second ad on a TV buy. So -- but I think once we enter 2024 the calendar does complicate the president's ability to sort of be able to fully concentrate. To be on the road when he wants to be. And it occupies kind of both headspace and time on the calendar. So -- and there could be either verdicts or at least pivot points in all of these cases that in theory could impact the way the voting public perceives him. It may be more of a general election argument though in terms of the primary schedule. He's going to be pretty deep into crucial primaries before the reds and oranges on your calendar start to collide.",

      "sentences": "Well, I do think it sort of sets up this sort of false imagery where you've got Trump saying the system is rigged against me, this is a witch hunt -- and you've got Hunter Biden, who is not running for reelection or president and doesn't speak for his father, saying the system is rigged against me. This is a witch hunt. And you don't have President Biden saying that.But it does, again, sort of politically or maybe to the American public create an impression that you've just got sort of both sides saying the system is rigged against me. It's a witch hunt. And I think that is complicated for President Biden. What we're going to see is House Republicans are pushing a resolution -- a full House vote expected by next week -- that would authorize formally an impeachment inquiry against President Biden. I'm not sure exactly for what, but it's something to do with all of this. And this will give sort of fuel -- ammunition to that political argument. It's interesting, though, Kasie. You've got Donald Trump, who has very much been leading an effort to try to gut funding for the IRS and saying the IRS is coming after you. But you've got a case here where Hunter Biden is being asked to be held accountable for his nonpayment of taxes during what appears to be just like a sort of grotesque drug-fueled binge -- women, entertainment as the attorney said. Kind of everything but paying his taxes. And so, you kind of see those two things colliding. Like, really? Is the IRS going after you, the common person sitting at home, or are they trying to collect taxes from people who have not paid their taxes? So I think that's an opportunity for President Biden to make an argument if he wants to make it, but I don't think that Republicans will sort of acknowledge that. I think they're going to try to use this latest, very serious charges against Hunter Biden to try to make the case that President Biden had something to do with any of this.",

Led by House Oversight Chairman James Comer, Republicans are hoping to find proof -- hoping to find proof that the president was directly involved and benefited from his family's business dealings. They have not yet found it to date. The White House responding by calling the effort a quote \"stupid stunt.\" Let's bring in Tia Mitchell, Washington correspondent for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Tia, good morning. The reality here is it's not clear yet that they have the votes to do this. There's a reason why Kevin McCarthy avoided this -- you know, sending this to the floor and formally opening it. But there are reasons why they want to open a formal inquiry. What are those reasons, and do you think they can actually do it? TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, THE ATLANTA JOURNAL- CONSTITUTION (via Webex by Cisco):  So, the reasons are that a formal inquiry will allow them a little bit more investigative power. Put a lot more kind of substance and teeth behind this investigation that's already underway. So, quite frankly, those Republicans who want to continue digging into President Joe Biden and his family's dealings and their finances need this authorization that the impeachment inquiry would provide. Now, why it's likely to happen is Republicans have found their messaging in a way that will help those in swing districts or the more moderate Republicans stay aboard, which is their -- what they're saying is we're not saying we're ready to impeach. We're saying we're ready to authorize the formal investigation that is an impeachment inquiry. So they're making that clear this is about the inquiry. What's wrong with more fact-finding? What's wrong with asking questions? If the president has nothing to hide then he has nothing to worry about. That's why the inquiry is likely to be approved next week.",
