You know, there have been 10 rate hikes and a very aggressive rate hike campaign has been underway but the Fed pausing here, noting that recent indicators suggest economic activity is expanding at a modest pace, job gains have been robust, and the unemployment rate has remained low but inflation remains elevated.That's key. Because the last couple of inflation numbers we've received have been showing some cooling on the inflation front.

What does this say to you?CATHERINE RAMPELL, CNN ECONOMICS &amp; POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, yes. This means that at this particular meeting, they are not raising interest rates further after those previous 10 consecutive rate hikes. That does not necessarily mean that we are done with raising interest rates for this cycle. In fact, if inflation numbers continue to come in hotter than the Federal Reserve has been comfortable with, we could see further interest rate hikes later this year. And the projections have actually just come out. I'm looking at the numbers. It looks like they are actually projecting that the federal funds rate will be a little bit higher through the end of this year. The federal funds rate is the main interest rate that we're talking about that they had projected a few months ago. So, that suggests that they do think that they have more work to do even if for the time being they're letting things be. But again, it really depends on how the data come in. It depends on whether we see continued elevated price growth and if we see the labor market holding up.",

When you look inside these numbers, you can see that the Fed and some members are saying that they'd like to see four or more rate hikes so -- when you look within what Fed members are saying. So, you've got a fed that is likely to have more rate hiking in the months ahead.Now remember, you know, the Fed has been hiking that rates for 15 months, right except for today. And in that time, more than four million jobs have been created, the unemployment rate has fallen to three and a half percent backed off that a little bit more recently, the housing market is starting to pick up a little bit and shown some resilience, and in the stock market is near a one-year high.

That's really not going to come into play in the courtroom, right?I think in terms of strategy in the courtroom, I think what you're going to see from the Trump team is a plan to try to get evidence suppressed that supports the indictment. They're going to look at the affidavit of probable cause that went into the -- that supported the raid on the -- on -- in the warrant for the raid on Mar-a-Lago. And they're going to try to attack that affidavit of probable cause. They're going to look at the testimony of Trump's lawyers. And they're going to you know look at that carefully and try to poke holes in the idea that this -- the crime-fraud exception applied to the attorney- client privilege. Because obviously, if he had privileged with his lawyers, they're going to try to say that, look, the court went too far and allowing that testimony. And they're going to end the written documentation that came in. That's going to be the attempt at the motion level, very high bars to clear here and clearly an uphill battle. But I think that's the motion practice you're going to see. Also, the Confidential Information Procedures Act is something that's going to come into play because there's obviously confidential documents and -- Classified Documents Procedures Act, there's classified documents that are going to come into play here. And those are they're going to have to be redacted or declassified for purposes of presentation.
