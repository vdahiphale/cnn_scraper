Mr. Biden delivered a prime-time address from the Oval Office. He's expected to ask Congress to approve more than $100 billion. which would also include money for security at the U.S. southern border. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: In Israel, we must make sure that they have what they need to protect their people today and always. The security package I'm sending to Congress and asking Congress to do is an unprecedented commitment to Israel's security that will sharpen Israel's qualitative military edge, which we've committed to. The qualitative military edge. We're going to make sure Iron Dome continues to guard the skies over Israel. We're going to make sure other hostile actors in the region know that Israel is stronger than ever and prevent this conflict from spreading. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It all comes ahead of the White House asking Congress for roughly $100 billion in new aid to fund these crises. About $60 billion of that would help Ukraine continue defending itself as Russia's unprovoked invasion nears the two-year mark.And Israel, as the war with Hamas enters the two-week mark, would see about $10 billion from that package. But there remains to be seen what the path is for that package in Congress, where there's a leadership vacuum in the House of Representatives and very clear consternation among both fiscal hawks and progressive Democrats about writing blank checks to many of these countries. The White House is confident that there remains bipartisan support and that there is rough agreement among many lawmakers that the U.S. will end up on the right side of history.

Just first of all, it's interesting, isn't it, the way Biden has tied the Israel budget to the Ukraine budget. What chances do you think he has of getting them through together?LESLIE VINJAMURI, DIRECTOR, U.S. AND AMERICAS PROGRAM, CHATHAM HOUSE: Well, you know, that's right. It is very interesting. The case for support for Israel is strong in Congress we know that case for supportive aid to Ukraine has come under attack from various parts of the Congress. [03:09:58] So I'd tying them together is, you know, it's a risky political move but that was a powerful speech at a time when again American support if you look at the polling is actually quite strong still for supporting Ukraine so that the pushback is coming really more from Congress. But that support for Israel is very strong. And the president was really taking that risk of making a case for democracy, for America's internationalist agenda at a time when we know that's a much harder case to make. But the president has linked this to the 9/11 attacks, to America's memory of trying to respond to terrorism. And of course we have the domestic politics of what's going on in the House right now. So it's a very complicated picture, but those attacks on Israel were so extraordinarily terrible. And I think that there is a resonance with the American people. So I expect that there will be support passed at a high level for Israel.",

This is a president who has really been trying his entire presidency to speak to that importance of unity.And we know from the numbers that the American public is simply not unified, hasn't become more unified under this president. But again, when you start to talk about terrorism, the Hamas attacks of the scale and of the brutality and the nature that we've witnessed, I think that appeal is very strong. Of course, the other very real concern is that there are divisions. People are obviously across the United States, especially across America's college campuses, very concerned about the humanitarian situation in Gaza for the Palestinian people. And this president is trying also to ensure that those divisions and that violence don't spill across America's streets. nd we've seen some of that already. So that ability of the president to really talk about terrorism when he's when he's talking about these attacks on Israel is critical and again to link it to Ukraine at a time when that war has been going on for a long time or Americans are sensing that there isn't an end game but still supporting and again you're right he's using that vehicle try to mobilize American public opinion at the sentiment the emotion of it all which is extraordinary we all feel it.

Because a lot of sympathy for what the Israelis went through, a lot of, you know, historically, a lot of sympathy for what Israel has gone through in the United States. But going forward, as there's this ground invasion, there'll also be a huge amount of sympathy as you just referenced amongst young people for Palestinians about what they're going through.

Arab leaders too have been vocal in their condemnation of Israel's airstrikes on Gaza and the rapidly rising civilian death toll. But there is also mounting concern that this war could create a deeper rift between the Arab world and the West. AYMAN SAFADI, JORDANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: The growing perception on the street, as they see this unequivocal ironclad support for Israel in this war, it is a growing perception that this is a Western Arab Muslim world. That's a place we don't want to get to. BASHIR (voice-over): But it's not just the Arab world. The outrage and frustration felt in the Middle East is also mirrored in protests taking place further afield. From London to Washington D.C. as millions across the globe, just like Mohamed and his family, demand an end to Israel's airstrikes, an end to the siege of Gaza and an end to the suffering of the Palestinian people. Nada Bashir, CNN, in Amman, Jordan. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

There's a huge concern, isn't there, internationally about an escalation in this conflict. And, you know, are we starting to see that in the protests, the demonstrations in countries like Lebanon and Jordan, which have these huge Palestinian populations?BADER AL-SAIF, PROFESSOR OF HISTORY, KUWAIT UNIVERSITY: Let me tell you, the protests are not only in Palestinian-sizeable populations, places where Palestinians exist. They are from the Atlantic Ocean to the Gulf. We see them in Rabat. We see them in Manama. We see them in Doha. We see them in Kuwait. We see them across the region. And they are united in one demand, ending the Israeli bombardment of Gaza and ending the Israeli occupation. This is a no-brainer. These are people under occupation and they deserve a dignified life like anyone else in the world. I have not seen such a scale of protests in the region since the Arab Spring. And the interesting thing is people from all walks of life are united, liberals, conservatives, old ones, young ones, towards this common goal. If Israel wants to live in peace in this region, they need to adapt to these messages. And a two-state solution should be front and center in their position. Continuing to dehumanize, deposes, and displace Palestinians is not the answer.",

People are talking about this potentially being a second Arab Spring and uprisings in countries, for example, like Jordan, where there's a huge amount of concern for Palestinians and they're concerned that their government perhaps isn't showing the same sort of support. It's a very delicate matter, isn't it, for many of these leaders showing support for Palestinians, but also when they have strong relations with Israel.AL-SAIF: It is a delicate matter indeed. And let me tell you, the governments around the region are picking up on the voices of the people. They're escalating in their rhetoric. And the more that Israel continues in this assault, supported, unfortunately, by the U.S., the more it will be gaining a lot of traction to ensure that its discourse and its policies also change towards Israel. This is not something that you can continue doing. It's not about only the Palestinian people in Gaza. It's a humanitarian issue. It's beyond Arabs, really. And this is something that has been a rallying call across the world. And this is something that other countries in the West need to listen to. The Global South cannot remain sidelined anymore.",

Is it losing some of the alliances it might have with some of those Arab countries which are more firmly sided with the Palestinians here?AL-SAIF: The U.S. is depleting whatever good standing it has in the region. President Biden came a few hours ago and said we need to remember who we are. And I think there needs to be a very cautious approach to identifying who they are, because the America that we know in the region is one that cares about others. It's one that talks about a melting pot in its own country. It's one that cares about freedoms and dignity. That's not being translated on the ground when it comes to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Being a one-sided party is not going to help advance even the cause of the Israeli national security, if that's the limited lens that they're looking through. U.S. national security as well.",
