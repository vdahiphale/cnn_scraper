Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, beefed up the troop presence on the island ahead of the war. He actually flew in by helicopter twice to visit the island, knowing how strategically crucial it is. But the reason why it's so important, so, it sits about 35 or 40 kilometers off the coast of Ukraine. But yet, because Ukraine, you know, claims it as their own territory, they get control of the waters that extend 12 nautical miles beyond the coastline of Snake Island. Then, of course, Ukraine's own territorial waters also extend 12 miles. So basically, they control that entire channel that leads right here to the port city of Odessa. This is where Ukrainian grain goes out to feed, you know, hungry people in Africa and many other places around the world. This is where the majority of Ukraine's imports, particularly from China, come in. So if Russia were to control that island, they could essentially block off Ukraine from being able to help feed much of the world's hungry populations that they do and also block any important supplies from coming in. So it was crucial for Ukraine to take back Snake Island. They did it through classic asymmetric warfare. This is a step-by-step, coordinated campaign to make life on Snake Island so intolerable for the Russians, so dangerous for the Russians, through drones strikes and missile strikes, they actually put their weapons on pontoon boats and fired from them. It was really an extraordinary effort. In the end, Ukraine now has control once again of Snake Island. The Russians pulled out after just a few months, Lynda.",
