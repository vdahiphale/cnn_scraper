That failed because Republicans and Democrats both didn't care for it.But you're absolutely right, in this case, and in this case alone, President Trump told the Republicans in Congress do not allow this to get through. We need an issue. And he was very open about saying that.",

Let's organize people and that's how they're going to vote.Well, Hispanics are not a monolithic voting group. Cubans are not the same as Guatemalans. Guatemalans are not the same as Mexicans. It is just people are different. So what we are seeing, though, is that Trump is trying to make inroads to them. He certainly did it in his first administration when he was in there. He tried to reach out to small businesses and what have you. And also understand that folks who are supporting Donald Trump are here legally. They could have been here for generations. Maybe they've only come in the last decade or so. But they came here legally. And they don't want to see other folks coming here illegally and being able to bask in the fruits that the United States has. It is interesting. It's a weird situation to look at. But Donald Trump certainly is making ground with them. He's also making some ground with African-Americans.",

      "sentences": "United has had a bad couple of weeks in headlines. And now its CEO is sending this message to all of the airline's customers, insisting that the airline is safe. But also laying out new changes that the airline is making.There's been at least six in-flight incidents involving United Airplanes this month. And in this new message, United CEO Scott Kirby says, \"While all of these incidents are unrelated, I want you to know that these incidents have our attention and have sharpened our focus.\" The latest incident was on Friday. United Boeing triple - 737-800 landed in Medford, Oregon, with a belly panel missing. This was first discovered by somebody on the ground when the plane pulled up to the gate. United says this did not affect the flying characteristics of the plane. So this wasn't known by the pilots and they did not declare an emergency. United says all of the incidents this month are now under review. Let's look at the timeline. March 15th, a 737-800 lands without a belly panel in Medford, Oregon. On March 11th, a 777 trailing hydraulic fluid in Sydney. On March 8th, an Airbus A320 diverted due to a hydraulic issue. Also on the 8th, a 737 Max-8 slid off the runway in Houston. On March 7th, a 777 lost a wheel on takeoff from San Francisco. And then on the 4th of march, there was an engine fire on a 737 leaving Houston. Here is what the airline is doing. It's adding an extra day of pilot training. It's also starting to redesign training for new-hire mechanics. United says it will also put out more resources into managing its parts supplier network. A lot of questions that investigators will have is whether or not these incidents were caused by maintenance- induced issues. Kirby says these are all reminders of the importance of safety. No doubt, customers have taken note here, Boris. The big thing to note here is that none of these incidents resulted in anybody getting hurt. So really important to underscore that aviation in the U.S. is safe, even though all of these things are making headlines all the time.",

The statistics show marriages had been declining over the past two decades.And then -- check that out -- you see this jump from 5.1 per 1,000 people in 2026, to 6.2 by 2022. That's a total of more than two million marriages that year, marking the first time the U.S. hit the two million mark since 2019. And take a look at the divorce rate. It was already on the decline. And in 2022, the rate was just 2.4 per 1,000 people. And it continues going down. So what's behind these trends? Let's talk about this now with a psychotherapist. Dr. Robi Ludwig joining us again here. OK, let's talk first about this increase in the number of marriages because the Covid pandemic halted most weddings. So you know, is that maybe why marriage rates saw that bounce? DR. ROBI LUDWIG, PSYCHOTHERAPIST: Its certainly could be. But also, post-pandemic, I think what we saw was a change in value system. And we really looked at the people in our lives and what we wanted for ourselves. For those who are living with companions during Covid, in some cases, it deepen their relationship and they wanted to show commitment of marriage as a result of that deepened connection. And I think also there were people who were lonely and really valued what intimacy and emotional intimacy feels like and wanted to create that for their lives.",

LUDWIG: Well, over the last few decades, too, there's been an increase in mental health and mental well-being. And people -- it really gave people an opportunity to look at themselves and what they wanted in their lives and what they wanted from marriage. So as a result of having that opportunity to look at what kind of partner they want, what kind of character they're looking for in a partnership. And the flexibility of roles and being able to communicate with another person about what you want and what's important to you also allowed an increase in marriage and the desire for marriage. We do live in a coupled-catered world. So our culture certainly celebrates marriage and happy couples. And it's nice to have that feeling of being seen and that you matter to someone. And I think with a result of all these apps and just we realize more is not necessarily more. And when people find a valuable person or partnership, they want to make that commitment and enjoy life together.",

They want to work through some of their issues and come out the other side.I think there's an appreciation of commitment and that, with a lifetime commitment, there will be issues that come up, but it doesn't have to be a deal breaker. And I don't think anyone wants to be alone or have that sense of loneliness.
