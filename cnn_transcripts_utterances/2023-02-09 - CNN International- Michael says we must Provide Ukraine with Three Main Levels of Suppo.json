Secondly, the package will include additional exports ban worth more than 10 billion euros. This will further starve Russia`s military machine and continue to shake the foundation of its economy. And the international community is also working hard to ensure that justice is served. Three steps are important. The first one is that we collect and store evidence of the crimes being committed. We have already started. The second step is to have prosecutors work together. For that we are setting up the center in The Hague. And the next step is to set up a tribunal. Here the discussions are ongoing about the exact structure. But I assure you Volodymyr, we have the political will to hold the perpetrator accountable, including for the crime of aggression. And there is the political will so we must find a way finally, on our common future. Ukraine`s youth is fighting for their sovereign country, too many of paying the ultimate price. But their dreams lives on, dreams of a new Ukraine, not only free, democratic and European, but also fair and green and prosperous we are already laying the groundwork. We have built the reconstruction platform which has gone live now. Our partners start seconding experts to the Secretariat, which we are hosting in Brussels and in Kyiv. The response to our call is amazing. Our cities are joining to 36 European cities from Vilnius to Venice will work with 10 cities in Ukraine like Kharkiv and Kyiv. This is the living proof of the enormous support you have all over the European Union. And as you said, every single person counts. You said it very powerfully in the European Parliament. It`s as the politicians yes, but every single person in the European Union counts to contribute to support Ukraine. Ukraine has advancing on its European path in an impressive manner. Accession is a merit-based process. And your track record shows that you`re able to deliver fast and have high quality even as you fight an aggressor, even as you are at war. I hear Ukrainian people so often speak about their hopes. They want their children to grow up in the European Union. And this hope gives them the strength to cope with this horrible war. The Volodymyr between now and this bright future that may be a hard road to tread but rest assured that we will be with you along every step of the way. Let`s turn Ukrainians dreams into reality into the European way of life. And since the beginning of my mandate, I have concluded every single speech with the words long live Europe.

And through and across a number of areas that outreach earlier on when he was speaking to the Parliament about talking about connecting with the people of Europe, thanking the people of Europe, saying that Ukrainians share European values, the Russians don`t share European values. Ukraine wants to come home to Europe.And that was reflected there from what we heard from Sean Michel, the European Council President and also Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission President both speaking, flanking the Ukrainian president, side by side in the press conference there. And a couple of things really jumped out at me. There`s this huge strong affirmation of support both political, both military, both diplomatic. But this real sense of urgency, the number of leaders that have spoken today that there is this real sense that things need to happen now and fast that the coming just weeks and months are absolutely critical have been big points today. A point from Ursula von der Leyen, about justice, the importance that that justice can be seen to be done supporting Ukraine`s 10 point peace plan but saying that those responsible will be held accountable, that part of that is working to find and recover and store the evidence. And that is happening. Part of that is working with Ukrainian prosecutors as well. But part of it is to build a platform to allow this to happen. And that`s happening in the Hague; she said that the platform for these prosecutions is happening. So that`s a very big affirmation for something that Ukraine wants, which is accountability, but not just accountability for those responsible for the atrocities, but also accountability, through sanctions. And we heard that from Shen Michel, the Council President talking about the moves that are underway to find ways to take the money that`s been confiscated from the Russian state, from Russian oligarchs, and to use that money to help pay for the repairs and reconstruction that are necessary in Ukraine and again, Ursula von der Leyen saying that that process was underway. And I thought there was one other point there that Shen Michel also made that was quite sort of significant in all of this. And that was what that was in reference to the Ukraine`s request to become a member of the European Union. And I just quote Shen Michel here saying he was impressed by the progress towards becoming a European Union member. Remember, there are standards that Ukraine has to achieve to do that. He said, despite the fact Ukraine is at war, very impressed with the progress being made. And I think all these statements, the things I`ve just mentioned here are exactly what the Ukrainian president wants to hear. This is support that is good for him is good for the people of Ukraine. It`s emotional. It`s support towards peace. But obviously, as you say the big things are the fight now. And that`s that urgency, and that is the sense that the tool for fighting now, absolutely urgent, fighter jets and longer- range rocket systems.",

All this prompting NATO to acknowledge there`s been an increase in Chinese surveillance activities, globally. Meanwhile, China is accusing the U.S. of carrying out information and public opinion warfare and is challenging the U.S. assessment that the spy balloon shot down off the U.S. was part of a Chinese fleet spanning five continents. CNN White House reporter, Natasha Bertrand, joins us live from Washington D.C.

And what we are learning, as well, is that the day before this particular balloon that was shot down on Saturday entered American airspace, the defense intelligence agency here, which is the intelligence arm of the Pentagon, did a flag that a foreign object was headed towards U.S. airspace and likely was going to enter over Alaska.Now this report was disseminated across government channels through classified channels, and essentially anyone who had access to it was able to read it. But it was not briefed up to the highest levels of the U.S. government, including the president, for example, because at the time it was not deemed as particularly urgent. This object was not deemed to be a threat. It was not deemed to be a military or physical threat to anyone on the ground because, of course, the U.S. had already understood and known that these balloons were part of this program and they had seen them before, and they had not post any physical risk So the decision was made to kind of just wait and see what this balloon would do, and potentially gather intelligence on it. And the commander of NORAD, which is responsible for monitoring, you know, the U.S. airspace, essentially, told reporters earlier this week that because they did not view this balloon as a physical threat, or something that posed a national security risk to the United States at the time, there was really no immediate action that he could take against it. So this kind of shifts the timeline back a bit, about when U.S. military and intelligence officials knew that this balloon was headed towards U.S. airspace. But it doesn`t change the fundamental premise here that the administration just did not see this as a big deal essentially until it turned very sharply south from Canada and entered over Montana where there are sensitive military sites that they believe the balloon was trying to monitor, Max.",

But there is absolutely a sense of anger and grief that`s setting in on the ground now that you`re entering the fourth day of this crisis and that hope, as you saw in that piece there, the hope that people are still alive under the rubble is fading.There`s a couple of reasons for this anger, for this frustration that you`re seeing from, not just this area, not just the affected area, but really across Turkey against the government of President Erdogan. And the first of course, is the response.  How quick was it? Was it quick enough? Remember, this is a country that sits on a major fault line, and Turkey has suffered major earthquakes in the past. There was an expectation that authorities were prepared, but we saw in these areas, these are heartbreaking tales of people hearing their loved ones under the rubble but unable to pull them out. Being on the streets with no shelter, no food, no water in these freezing cold temperatures. But, again, the scope and scale of this is so great. But the one that might be dogging President`s Erdogan the most is the question about building codes, rather; the stability of structures. In 1999,Turkey had a major earthquake. After that earthquake, rules were put into place to bring up building codes. They were supposed to meet certain guidelines so that they could be earthquake resistant. But if you look at that area, Max, some of those buildings that have collapsed, they`re modern buildings. They should not have collapsed according to the residents in those areas. So they are asking questions, and questions are being raised also by the opposition party and across the country. How did this happen? Just one more point here, also after that `99 earthquake, it was ordered that everyone pay a tax into this earthquake fund to prepare for the possibility. So yet again, that`s adding to the frustration. Why weren`t we prepared? Why didn`t help come soon enough? And perhaps an indication of that frustration, and the government`s response to it is what we saw happening on social media yesterday, which is that while President Erdogan was visiting on the ground, there seems to be, according to reports, some limited access to sites like Twitter. People were complaining that they couldn`t get online. Reports that the authorities were essentially blocking people, maybe trying to limit that frustration from being shared on social media. So, yes, right now very much is about rescue, recovery. It is about the operations on the ground. It is about the immediate need which is enormous. But the questions that are being raised here, the concerns and the anger from the families, that`s not going to go away, Max.",
