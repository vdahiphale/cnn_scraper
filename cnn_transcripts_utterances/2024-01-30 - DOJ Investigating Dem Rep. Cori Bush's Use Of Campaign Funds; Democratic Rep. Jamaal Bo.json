The House actually greenlit the subpoena to go forward. That's how this first came to light.Now, she denied in a statement today that she has made any misused taxpayer dollars. But she did acknowledge there's an investigation into her campaign fund, how she has used some of those campaign funds, and as you mentioned, the questions about her security services and retaining her husband, who she says has security expertise to deal with security that she needed to be dealt with. She said she had done nothing wrong. The Ethics Committee in the House has already investigated this, but still clearly facing this federal probe. The question is, where does it go next? She spoke to reporters after she put out a statement, reading for it word for word and saying she did nothing wrong. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. CORI BUSH (D-MO): As a rank and file member of Congress, I am not entitled to personal protection by the House and instead have used campaign funds as permissible to retain security services. I have not used any federal tax dollars for personal security services. In accordance with all applicable rules, I retained my husband as part of my security team to provide security services because he has had extensive experience in this area. (END VIDEO CLIP) RAJU: Now, Jake, she said that she was acknowledging this investigation in the interest of transparency, though she did not answer questions from me and other reporters about exactly what is happening in this investigation, the scope of it, whether she's actually spoken to federal prosecutors, whether she is actually being interviewed by the grand jury in any way. She did say she would cooperate fully with this investigation, and she claimed that she would be exonerated, Jake.",

In fact, she had less than $20,000 in cash on hand, which would make her vulnerable to any serious challenger. We have not seen her end of the year, the last quarter of last year.

That's before President Joe Biden said he'd made a decision.Still, a strike in Iran itself is expected to be unlikely as the administration tries to avoid an open regional conflict with Iran that could spread and escalate very quickly. Finally, it is possible that we see a tiered approach with multiple actions here, not only one strike, but a series of strikes across multiple targets. Of course, those targets could be weapons and facilities or the U.S. could try to escalate that a level and go after the leadership of some of these groups. It is worth noting that earlier today, Kataib Hezbollah, one of the most powerful Iran backed groups in the region said they were stopping or ceasing their attacks on U.S. forces so as not to embarrass the government of Iraq.

And it's interesting, because I want to ask these MAGA folks, these conspiracy theorists, are they OK? Because literally, if they're going after Taylor Swift versus looking at the policy positions of the Republican Party, instead, they could actually kind of see why young people, women, LGBTQIA folks, people who support Taylor Swift, would actually support her and understand why she's making this decision.One thing I do want to point out is that when she tweeted on or posted on Instagram, I'm getting my social media channels mixed up, but she posted on national voter registrationdayvote.org, that organization received 35,000 plus registrations in one day. She understands her power that's why she endorsed President Biden in 2020.
