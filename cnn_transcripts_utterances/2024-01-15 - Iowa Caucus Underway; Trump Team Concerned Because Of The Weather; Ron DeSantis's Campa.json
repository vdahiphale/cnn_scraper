They have someone registered and signed up to speak at nearly every caucus, people, including lawmakers from back in Florida, longtime friends, people who have worked for him for years. They'll be speaking at caucuses trying to convince Republicans that it's time to vote for them. He is also offering rides to people to get to the caucus sites. I've been told from one campaign official, quote, \"if it means shoveling a driveway, we will do it.\" And they may have to do it in parts of the state like Cedar Rapids. It is cold here. It is negative 15 degrees outside. The roads are very icy. Parts of Des Moines that we have visited, the streets are plowed. Around here, there are still roads that are very slick. We've talked to people who have had trouble getting their cars started, tires blown out. So that is gonna be an obstacle for his campaign, but they believe that they have the infrastructure to do it.

Rural America becomes Trump country. That matters in Wisconsin. That matters in Michigan. That matters in Pennsylvania. That matters in Georgia. And so rural America becomes Trump country. That's 2016. It happens again in 2020, right? Rural America is Trump country. And so yes, Iowa is a red state.

Ron DeSantis' entire argument for running after the 2022 midterms was that Trump was gonna be a weak candidate and couldn't win. And that looked like a plausible argument for a very long time.

But it could drop even lower if enough people have trouble getting to the polls. Nonetheless, let's talk about the procedure involved here. Typically what happens with the caucus is they happen in all 99 counties, numerous sites in many counties, they start at 7Typically, there are speeches given on representatives from the various candidates who say vote for this person, vote for that person, then people vote in secret on paper ballots, the GOP rules say you have to be a Republican, a registered Republican to take part in this, even though you can register at the site, if you want to tonight. But this is very much a party activity, not a state activity. Now, what happens afterward? Usually somebody gets a majority, that person has declared more or less the winner in the state. But this is not a winner take all proposition. It is proportional. So when you look at the 40 Iowa delegates are competing for tonight. This many total delegates are at stake. This many are needed to win the nomination nationally. So if you get a proportion of this, you're just getting a tiny start on what you need to win the nomination. Nonetheless, it is considered an important measure of where you stand, although we should note that when you look in the past, look at the winners of recent Iowa caucuses, none of whom became the candidate, none of whom became the president. So it's indicative but it is hardly a concrete predictor of what's going to happen next. The real question in all of this, though, is who does show up? The weather in this state is going to be absolutely brutal this evening. There's a big worry about that as our Jeff Zeleny reported. Another issue, they've changed the locations of some caucuses. So some people may be driving further than they normally would to reach the caucus, that may also have a dampening effect. You know, Iowans are used to this weather, they're used to this political system, they normally find a way to battle through it. But this is a very unique challenge, Erin.

I think that's one of the things that's actually hurt him that he had a Florida Legislature that was a rubber stamp.
