We begin on the border with Gaza where the clock is ticking down to Israeli ground offensive, while negotiations continue to try and free more than 200 hostages being held by Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza.Sources say those negotiations appear to reach an impasse over Hamas for months for fuel. Israel says that is a non-starter. At the same time, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seems to reassure troops who've been on standby for more than two weeks. The ground offensive is still on track, with just one goal to smash Hamas and retaliation for the militant groups attack October 7, which killed more than 1,400 civilians. Even before any ground incursion, unrelenting Israeli airstrikes have had a devastating impact on Gaza, and more than 2 million Palestinians who live there and now facing a dire humanitarian crisis. On Tuesday, only eight of unexpected 28 aid trucks cross over from Egypt. And as the civilian death toll in Gaza climbs higher, the U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres is calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, bringing an angry backlash from Israeli diplomats. Guterres said the appalling acts of Hamas do not justify what is collective punishment of the Palestinian people. And that aid delivered so far to Gaza does not match the enormous need. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONIO GUTERRES, U.N. SECRETARY-GENERAL: Some humanitarian relief is finally getting into Gaza, but it is a drop of aid in the notion of needs. In addition, our U.N. fuel supplies in Gaza will run out in a matter of days, and that will be another disaster. Without fuel, aid cannot be delivered. Hospitals will not have power and drinking water cannot be purified or even pumped. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "John, just because things have got worse, it doesn't mean they can't get even worse than they are right now especially if and when this expected ground invasion takes place. We understand that at least six hospitals have closed already. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees says that it will have to cease operations by this evening on Wednesday evening if it does not get fuel supplies a fuel is not allowed in.From Israel's perspective as we've heard them say repeatedly fuel will not be allowed into the Gaza Strip because it believes that Hamas and other militant groups will simply take it and use it to continue to fire rockets at Israeli communities and support their own war machine. But of course, the calls for a ceasefire as the humanitarian situation gets worse as the death toll rises in the Gaza Strip is reaching deafening levels. We heard the U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres yesterday calling on Israel to engage -- to impose a ceasefire, humanitarian ceasefire. And this really sparked a furious with Israelis not simply for the call for the ceasefire, but because of some of his other comments, saying that Hamas is terrorist attacks of October the seventh didn't happen in a vacuum, and that they happened after 56 years of what he said was suffocating occupation by the Israelis. That sparked a response from Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Gilad Erdan calling on Mr. Guterres to resign immediately saying he's not fit to lead the United Nations and accusing him of tolerating terrorism. And it seems from Israel's perspective right now, as we wait for this ground invasion to happen as we've been waiting for more than two weeks for it to happen, that such is the diplomatic pressure for Israel to not go in, to not make the situation worse on a humanitarian level. Israel's problem is that it doesn't feel that it's achieved any of its objectives. Its objectives were to smash Hamas in the words of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to prevent it from ever being able to carry out an attack on the scale that it did on October the seventh to free the more than 200 hostages are the -- that are being held by Hamas and other militant groups. And of course to stop rocket fire happening yet we're still seeing rocket fire, the hostages are still being held. And even just yesterday, there was an infiltration the IDF says from a set of divers by Hamas, getting out of the Gaza Strip via a tunnel into the sea north of the Gaza Strip, which the IDF says that it took out. So there are still infiltrations, there are still rocket fire hostages still being held. Israel hasn't achieved its objectives. And against that backdrop, despite the deteriorating humanitarian situation, it's hard to see how Israel is going to sell some kind of humanitarian ceasefire to the Israeli public when it hasn't achieved any of its objectives.

Hamas is being very calculated about everything they're doing. The release of the hostages to this point has been calculated. It was a minute ability of step releasing Americans first, to sow some discord, and build a little friction between the United States and Israel. Now releasing two elderly Israeli citizens, also creating some doubt within Israel, for the hostage families asking things to be delayed. So there's other opportunities. But the negotiations have to continue. But for Israel, it's an opportunity to get some small victories, but also gather information and intelligence about where the other hostages are also identifying all of them.

So how much more complicated does all of this make these negotiations?O'LEARY: It makes them quite a bit more complicated. And first of all, Palestinian Islamic Jihad is more Islamist and more radical than Hamas is, although Hamas, you know, probably changed that, that calculus a little bit with October seventh in their activities. But Palestinian Islamic Jihad is an extension and was born out of Egyptian Islamic Jihad, which, you know, if you peel that back a little bit, you know, some of the founders of al-Qaeda came from EIJ. And they are, you know, very militant, very Islamist. And, you know, traditionally, Hamas has been a little more nationalistic. And, you know, what is the most leadings although, you know, that has been turned on its head in recent weeks. But trying to negotiate with Hamas, who does not have control of all the hostages, makes it a much more challenging negotiation to try to get all the hostages out at some point.",

A spokesperson said the divers used an undersea tunnel off the coast of northern Gaza to infiltrate the south of the city of Ashkelon. The military wing of Hamas claims it was able to reach beaches inZikim. The IDF says it eliminated the Hamas forces, and Israeli war planes struck the military compound in Gaza where the Hamas fighters came from. The October 7th Hamas attack on Israel left the country not just grieving its dead, but shaken and uncertain about how all the planning went unnoticed by Israeli intelligence. Now, new details have emerged about how Hamas was able to do just that. It involves old school counterintelligence measures, underground tunnels and even above ground training.

Only a very small group knew about the mission until just before it was carried out.Hamas ground unit commanders and fighters who are in training for many months and kept in a state of general preparedness but only found out about the specific plan just a few days before the terrorist attack. And one of the sources said some of the training above ground was observed but did not ring major alarm bells. The thinking was Hamas always trains people like this. It didn't look different. And we also know that Israel had found hard-wired phones and Hamas strongholds in the past. In, fact the Israeli military found a similar kind of communication system when they raided a city in the northern West Bank over the summer -- that's according to an Israeli official. They called it, a Joint Operational Command Center and it had hard- wired communication lines and closed-circuit surveillance cameras to give advance warning of Israeli troop movements.
