There's no doubt the armed insurrectionists who have raced toward Moscow have weakened Vladimir Putin's regime. Now the U.S. as well as its allies and enemies are closely watching a country that barely pulled back from the brink of chaos. There's no word on where Yevgeny Prigozhin is, the head of the ruthless mercenaries in the Wagner Group that abruptly turned around. His troops were just 125 miles of the capital. That's how close they came to pulling off something spectacular. Russia said Prigozhin would not be prosecuted and instead would go into exile. Prigozhin's news service, as they're calling it, tells CNN that he will answer questions when he has, quote, \"proper communication.\" And you might remember these stunning images. Prigozhin's fighters were greeted as heroes in some towns for confronting a government they feel has abandoned them. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DMITRY, RESIDENT OF ROSTOV REGION (through translator): There are very serious problems in the country and they need to be solved. People who can no longer tolerate it, they resort to such radical methods as Prigozhin. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now one of those phone calls today was to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The White House says that the men talked about not only the United States' continued support for Ukraine but also the situation in Russia as allies have been trying to get a handle on what exactly happened with this short-lived rebellion waged by the mercenary group Wagner against Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces.Now in addition to that call with Zelenskyy, the president also today spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and yesterday he held a call with European allies including the leaders of France, Germany and the United Kingdom. Now the White House has very deliberately maintained this cautious strategy as these events have unfolded. They have not wanted to give any fodder to Russian President Vladimir Putin to have him use any of the West's comments against him, trying to weaponize against him. And that is why the White House has been fairly quiet. We haven't heard from President Biden yet. But earlier today, we did hear the first administration response from Secretary of State Antony Blinken. He described the situation as a moving picture and said that it's not one that is yet completely resolved. And he also noted that there are cracks emerging as is evidenced in this episode about Russian President Vladimir Putin's hold on power. Now one big question going forward for U.S. officials is they're going to try to ascertain the larger ramifications that this could have, not just for Putin within Russia, but also on the war in Ukraine. And that is why the White House has said the president has wanted to stay close with allies and partners over the weekend as they continue to assess what exactly happened and what impacts it will have moving forward.",

And so he is going to have to reassert himself in a way that demonstrates to the world and demonstrates to his country that he is fully in power. The U.S. is going to have to navigate this carefully. And we're already starting to see that. Now Arlette touched on the fact that the U.S. has had a very hands-off approach, making clear -- trying to make clear to the world that they really didn't have any role in this. That they certainly are not supporting Prigozhin on his march to Moscow. But, Jim, at the same time, obviously watching this very carefully and we are told that the intelligence community did see this coming, that in the past few days and weeks, they've really seen planning for this. They've seen Wagner troops getting into position, equipment and weaponry on the move. There was a briefing we're told midweek by intelligence officials to the Gang of Eight in Congress which includes the heads of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees essentially telling them that this was imminent. Let's take a listen to Mike Rogers, the head of the House Intelligence Committee. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE TURNER (R-OH): The intelligence community was very much aware of it. The conflict between Prigozhin and Putin was inevitable. This is not a weekend trip he's taking. Taking his convoy and his military convoy up to Moscow. There's a number of accomplices included as we saw some of the Russian people on the border with Ukraine who clearly support the Wagner Group, in contrast to their support for the Russian government.

Now this is the second army in Russia after Wagner, apparently. And over the last two days, he showed that his grip on power in Russia is almost nonexistent.

They are making gains in Bakhmut, and the best thing I think we can do, as the US government is to first have unity among both parties, and to juice the counteroffensive in any way that we have not already done. You know, Putin right now, he's going to have to rob resources from the battlefront in Ukraine and bring them back to Moscow to protect himself. And so he has taken on essentially, a two-front war now. You know, one within his border and one outside, and that lies an opportunity for Ukraine. ACOSTA: And President Biden has resisted the urge to seize on these developments in Russia over the weekend to avoid, you know, feeding into any kind of narrative in Moscow that the US was sort of sort of behind some of what was going on with Prigozhin's march on Moscow and so on.

So you know, we have done that. That's a part of the effort, but Republicans have walked away from this. They're either rooting for Russia, now, that's the Marjorie Taylor Greene-like folks, or they're actually helping Russia in their inaction.

Of course, track any movements of loose nukes, but Prigozhin is a murderous thug.You know, he did interfere in our elections. You know, he, just like Putin has not shown anything but an anti-Ukraine sentiment, and that runs rampant inside Russia, so I don't think we should believe that we'd get a better outcome with Ukraine. And also, Jim, if you start talking about regime change, what you do is you put Putin in an impossible position where this guy who thinks Russia is Putin, and Putin is Russia, you know, that's where he could cross the red line, and start using his nuclear capabilities. And so I think, Biden has been perfect in this in making it all about stitching the alliance together to push Russia out of Ukraine.",

And so that's why I think, this is about the territorial integrity of Ukraine. Go all in right now. Push Russia out and let the Russians see how weak Putin is and it is up to the Russian people if that's the kind of leader, a weak leader who could be toppled by Prigozhin so quickly or threatened by Prigozhin so quickly, is that who they want is their leader?",

There is one sergeant with 14 years' experience who was involved in this and then two other officers, one who was five years with the department, the second officer has two years.But the really, the center of this case, Jim, is the woman, the victim here, a mother, 46 -year-old, Melissa Perez, and she is cutting the wires of her apartment's fire alarm system early Friday morning, just after midnight. So people go up to her and they say hey, what are you doing? And she tells those people in addition to firefighters, she is cutting those wires because she thinks that the FBI is listening to her. So it is clear that she is having a mental health episode. Officers show up and they determine that they're going to charge her with defacing property, a felony criminal mischief, and she is quite afraid of that. She goes into her apartment building, locks the doors and she grabs a hammer. She looks towards the officers from her back patio, not once, but twice with the hammer and officers opened fire in both of those instances. So what we're going to show you, it is unsettling video. There is that first a confrontation, an exchange of words between the victim here and an officer. And then there are two volleys of gunfire. So again it is unsettling, it is video that's disturbing, but it is at the center of what happens here. It is about 20 seconds long. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And then more research is needed on screening in adults 65 or older. The taskforce also continues to recommend screening for depression in all adults, including those 65 and older, and it calls for more research into screening for suicide risks. Surprisingly, there is not much data on how and when to screen for suicide risks in people who have not already been diagnosed with a mental health disorder or are not already showing signs or symptoms. But in the meantime, there are resources available for anyone experiencing a mental health crisis. You can call or text 988 to get connected to a mental health counselor for help. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
