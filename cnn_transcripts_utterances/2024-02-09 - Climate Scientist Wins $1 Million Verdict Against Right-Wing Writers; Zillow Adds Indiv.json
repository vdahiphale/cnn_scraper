      "sentences": "A major victory for a prominent climate scientist, Michael Mann. He won his long-fought legal battle against two conservative writers.In 2012, the man falsely claimed that Mann had manipulated data in his research that showed a dramatically warming planet. And they compared him to convicted child molester Jerry Sandusky, saying that instead of molesting children, Mann was molesting data. Juries in D.C. found that the pair made their statements with maliciousness, spite, ill will, vengeance, or deliberate intent to harm. And they awarded him more than $1 million in damages. And here he is now with us, Michael Mann, presidential distinguished professor, director of the Center for Science, Sustainability, and the Media at UPenn. Also the author of the book, \"Our Fragile Moment.\" Michael, 12 years is a long time to have to fight here. How do you feel today?",

It isn't just about me in defending my science from scurrilous attacks and defamatory claims. It's really about the defense of science.You know, it's appropriate to debate science, to challenge other people's scientific findings. That's part of what Carl Sagan described as the self-correcting machinery of science. But that doesn't mean that you can lie about scientists. It doesn't mean that you can defame them and make false claims about them. And in today's world, you know, we see so much disinformation. We see attacks on science and attacks on scientists. And I think it was an important message at this moment in time that it's not OK to make false claims about scientists and to make defamatory accusations against scientists, that there is a limit to what is protected speech.",

It was after you became famous for your so-called hockey stick graph that was published in the journal Nature. That was back in 1998. It showed the rapidly warming planet really raised the alarm on the situation. Here we are, you know, 26 years later. What is your message now to people, so many of whom have really woken up to this since then?",

They look at that, and, you know, that chills the discourse. That potentially leads them to sort of withdraw into their laboratories. They don't want to get involved, get into the fray, and to be part of the effort to communicate their scientific findings to the public, out of fear that they will be attacked, that they will be viciously attacked. Again, by those who have a vested interest in discrediting science that's inconvenient to their economic interests or their political viewpoints.And so, this is a message to my fellow scientists that, you know, that it is not OK for people to attack you, to make false allegations against you, to defame you. And hopefully that will create some space where scientists feel a little bit more, you know, that they're more comfortable in leaving the laboratory and communicating their findings to the public. Because we rely upon, you know, the best available science, as you said, both when it comes to our own health and the health of this planet. What could be more important than the health of our, you know, of us and our fellow human beings and the planet that we live on? Those are really the stakes here.",

Some people who think that this is to help President Biden's 2024 campaign. And here to break it all down is Audie Cornish. She is the host of the CNN podcast \"THE ASSIGNMENT\". And Audie, this week on the podcast, I know you're taking a very serious topic. It is, but it kind of is because it plays into a bigger issue that we're seeing here. Right. These conspiracy theories. And there are some professional choices that these two have made that, you know, right or wrong, whatever. They're just going about their lives. It is embroiled them in these culture wars.",

That happened last fall when she did an Instagram post and something like 30,000 people, you know, increased their -- registered to vote. So she has demonstrable power there. And the White House is reportedly pursuing her endorsement.Meanwhile, Travis Kelsey has cut commercials, I think, for Bud Light, also for State Farm, also for Pfizer. So if you think about it, these are all companies that have been ensnared and people who are concerned with anti-woke politics. And if you think about it, vaccines and that issue is also very vulnerable to kind of conspiracy thinking. So it's the kind of thing where, you know, people who are into this, you can pull a lot of twigs and all kinds of stuff to feather your cuckoo's nest of conspiracy theories.

This is kind of a good moment for them. So they're really leaning in and cutting to her every few minutes and dropping the lyrics and people are shaking it off. And the idea is like, look at us. This is good news. But because of these little sand traps, kind of cultural sand traps, you can still face a backlash. And one of the things both of these people are on the verge of is overexposure.
