Pete Hegseth's nomination for defense secretary appeared to be in jeopardy just a week ago amid mounting allegations of sexual assault, alcohol abuse, and financial mismanagement of veteran's groups, but Republican senators are signaling that there is growing support for his bid. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC):  The accusations about mismanaging money and about nonconsensual behavior -- if they come forward, I will listen to those accusations, but they have to be credible and they have to be presented in a fashion that Pete can rebut. So he's much better off this week than he was last week. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

JOHN BRESNAHAN, CO-FOUNDER, PUNCHBOWL NEWS (via Webex by Cisco):  For the moment, I mean, he's not -- he's not out of trouble. I mean, and he's not necessarily going to be confirmed. I think he will be but he's going to have a public hearing and more could come out. Now, remember, Hegseth -- the allegation of sexual assault -- Hegseth paid a settlement in this case in 2023 to resolve this case. There -- that could -- there could still be more information on this issue. So I would say Hegseth has definitely stopped the deterioration. I mean, last week it looked like he was done. I mean, we were chasing rumors that Trump was going to pull him. There were reports that Trump was maybe possibly going to offer Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis the nomination. There were other names being floated. This week, definitely, after some intense pressure from Trump allies on the these senators it looks like things have stabilized for Hegseth. He is not going to be pulled -- he's not going to be pulled now. But that doesn't mean his confirmation is a lock yet.",

'How do I make this go away?' a flabbergasted Ernst said to an intermediary, according to a top Donald Trump adviser who received the message.

Basically, like trying to read into every single thing he's doing and saying on Truth Social to try to figure out what he wants them to do. But there's a couple of potential flashpoints here, one of which is the NDAA -- the must-pass defense bill. It includes a massive raise for junior enlisted troops and a whole bunch of other things. But it also includes a pretty controversial piece about transgender children who are covered by military health insurance. And this is what you guys write this morning in Punchbowl. \"The two parties and the two chambers have clashed over topline defense spending and culture war provisions, complicating the final talks. A last-minute intervention by Speaker Mike Johnson barring gender- affirming care for the children of military families has upset Democrats as well as some Republicans.

And it authorizes an enormous sum of money. We're talking about $895 billion. So just a fantastic amount of money, far more than any other country spends on defense. This issue on the transgender -- the gender-affirming care for military dependents -- for children of military service families -- it was -- Johnson insisted that it be included in the NDAA. And even the House Armed Services Committee chairman -- the Republican Mike Rogers -- wasn't consulted on it. He wasn't told about it. We quote him in this story. He says I wasn't told. I wasn't asked. Rogers actually is -- supports Johnson's view. He doesn't like this policy at all. But he wanted Trump to take care of this when Trump was sworn in on January 20, arguing that the NDAA, like, we try to keep it bipartisan. We try to swat away the things on the left and the right and try to play it straight. That both sides can support it, and we get big bipartisan votes for the defense --",
