Russia though insists all targets were hit and a U.S.-made Patriot air defense system was destroyed. No comment on that from the Ukrainian military but a U.S. official tells CNN a Patriot system was damaged during the airstrikes. And while assessments are ongoing, it was not destroyed and remains operational. For the first time in 18 years, Europe's oldest political organization the Council of Europe has gathered for a summit with leaders from 46 nations meeting in Iceland to declare support for Ukraine as a top priority. Secondary talks will begin in a few hours. The British and Dutch Prime ministers met on the sidelines of the summit and agreed on building an international coalition to arrive Ukraine with combat air capabilities and that includes helping procure F-16 fighter jets. Welcome news for Ukraine as president Zelenskyy stresses the need for more weapons and equipment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But in this particular case, I think that what we're seeing is something that the Kinzhal was less than meets the eye.

And Microsoft claims, from the language to coding to medicine to law, everything it does. In all of these tasks, GPT-4's performance is strikingly close to human level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models, such as ChatGPT.Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4's capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early it's still incomplete version of an artificial general intelligence system. You know, if it isn't AGI then chances are, you know, it's still just a few years away. If that -- if it's even that long before it comes onto the scene. Can you regulate and control something which has the ability to learn and adapt? OREMUS: Yes, and that's a good question. And a lot of the hearing did focus on those sort of -- those sort of farther off concerns about A.I. learning to do things on its own. I think that the thing about the A.I. systems we have today, they're very impressive, they can actually be dazzling with the right use case. But what they're fundamentally doing is that is they're manipulating language. You know, you give it a prompt, and it will respond in the way that it has been trained to respond by reading tons and tons of websites and tons and tons of human written language. It's combining languages, manipulating language, it can manipulate images, but that's still only a small slice of what humans can do. So, it's a pretty far cry from these machines being as broadly capable as humans or having you know, the kinds of things like intentions or plans or an ability to really reason. But you know, there is reasonable believe that they are progressing quickly. It's just that a lot of these harms remain speculative for now.",

The party Pheu Thai, which had the second most votes has already indicated that they would join a coalition with Move Forward. And that is key, because they need as many seats as possible. There are 750 seats or MPs who would vote for a prime minister, but 250 of those have been elected or appointed into the Senate by the military. So in the past they have always backed a military candidate. So we did ask him about this. He said that he didn't believe that the senators were in the same situation, had the same unity towards the military as they had four years ago, and he doesn't believe it will be a problem.

Some of the stolen items, worth around $130 million, still have not been recovered and may never be found.CNN's Fred Pleitgen has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): It's one of the most brazen heists in modern history. Robbers shattering glass cases with hammers and making off with tens of millions' worth of museum artifacts in Dresden, Germany, in 2019. \"I don't to tell you how shocked we are, also, about the brutality of this break-in,\" the museum's director said at the time. \"This is of invaluable art historic and cultural historic value.\" PLEITGEN (voice-over): The gangsters first started a fire, causing a power outage in the Green Vault Museum. Then they broke in and stole 21 pieces of historic jewelry, some of the most valuable in the world studded with more than 4,300 diamonds. The total insurance value of the loot, around $130 million. Five of the six suspects, all members of an infamous Berlin mobster clan, have now been convicted by a German court. One defendant was acquitted. The sentences range from four years and four months, to a little over six years. However, some are walking free after a plea bargain with the prosecution, causing angry reaction throughout the country. \"Three of the main offenders among the adults have been released, today,\" the presiding judge said. But where are the jewels? While the robbers did tell investigators where some of the stolen artifacts were located, helping divers to retrieve them from a canal in Berlin, the most valuable pieces are still missing without a trace. The now convicts claim not to know where they are. \"This means that the state of Saxony can and must claim its damages within the framework of civil lawsuits,\" the presiding judge said. State authorities are offering a reward of up to half a million euros for clues helping to find the missing historic jewelry, but they acknowledge some of the pieces might never be found, because they've been broken into pieces. All this as those now convicted of stealing the artifacts walked out of a courtroom and drove off, allowed to serve their sentences at a later time. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Berlin. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
