Gantz was reportedly taken aback after he was told repeatedly that Israel must alleviate the humanitarian suffering by both Vice President Kamala Harris and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan.

OZ-SALZBERGER: Yes. So, yes, we have started -- we have not started actually, we've been at it for quite a while now. It was absolutely clear that a war in Gaza will have a terrible toll, a terrible cost in human suffering in Gaza. And I think many of us knew this from the very beginning. And still we felt and I still feel, as we talk now, that defeating Hamas is wholly necessary, it is morally right.

And as yousay, the overwhelming majority of Israelis also do not believe in the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, your current prime minister. OZ-SALZBERGER: Well, first of all, let me say, and this is a caveat that I have to make absolutely clear, that unlike the rest of the world who is watching us on the screens and moralizing from the armchair, we are a battered nation right now. We are not only heartbroken, so heartbroken that sometimes it's difficult to be heartbroken for the civilians on the enemy side. We are also mind-boggled, shocked, humiliated. Very few Israelis will admit that, but we might as well say that we also feel humiliated, terribly saddened, and terribly scared with a sense of an ongoing crisis, the worst in our history for sure, and an ongoing sense of tragic loss. I'm saying that this is not only in order -- not in order to play the victim's card. I don't believe in playing a victim's card, but I do believe that many of us have been truly victimized on the 7th of October, and of course, the hostages are still suffering a horrible, horrible fate. I am wearing, like so many Israelis do now, the bring them home token. And our heart, as it says, is captive in Gaza, we are not being totally rational now. I don't think that we are sitting here, most of us, apart perhaps from a few very strong women and men, most of us are not weighing the moral options and necessities in a totally rational way because we are deeply, deeply involved, hurt, injured, surprised in a negative way beyond the capacity of many people to take up complications, nuances, to understand or to try to imagine the other side. And having said that, I think that many Israelis believe that we should have had a humanitarian ceasefire and hostage exchange, another ceasefire and hostage exchange months ago. So, alongside the fear and the sadness and the shock, there is also a mounting sense of anger among the Israeli population against our own leadership, our coalition government and especially our prime minister.",

I would not be a loyal daughter if I didn't sometimes disagree with him, but he believed that peace is possible in our day and age, and he also believed in the two- state solution. I unfortunately cannot use the word peace very easily after the 7th of October. I will not have peace with the brutes of Gaza, and I'm not talking about all Gazans, of course, but about Hamas and its supporters, not in this generation, perhaps not in the next. But I do strongly believe that the two-state solution is alive. It is the one-state solution, the idea that we will all live happily ever after as fellow citizens in one, as people demand, a liberal secular state that I think is a fantasy for this day and age, but I believe strongly, as my father did, that the two-state solution in reasonable neighborhood, perhaps not love, perhaps not full peace, perhaps not friendship, but reasonable neighborhood across a solid fence this time should work and is, in fact, the only viable solution for the future of both Israel and Palestine.",

I do believe that Israel should have a strong army. I'm proud that I also served as a soldier and an officer in the Israeli army many years ago.

SOPHIA SCOTT, DIRECTOR, \"TOMORROW'S FREEDOM\": My sister and I were in Lebanon. And obviously, there's a lot of Palestinian people there a lot of murals of Marwan Barghouti we started to see. And we were interested. His face was charismatic. When we Googled his name, an interview came up with Lindsay Hilsum just a few years after he was arrested. And he spoke passionately. And we were intrigued by this person that some of the Palestinians in Lebanon were telling us could be our Nelson Mandela, and we hadn't heard of him before.

He's a political leader, he says. And you talk to Yossi Beilin, who's the former Israeli justice minister and a participant in the Oslo negotiations.

And that was the first time we really spoke politically about Marwan. And it was through Yossi Beilin that we felt we could make a film. That wasn't just a very pro-Palestinian film about a Palestinian leader in jail, but about someone that actually the Israelis were interested in. Back during Oslo, you know, Marwan used to work with Yossi. They traveled together. He was liked. And it was always Marwan who was going and saying, come on, we need to maintain this, this model for peace for it to last. So, he gave us the confidence that Marwan was interesting for Israel.

After October the 7th, he has been moved to solitary confinement. He has transferred to four different prisons in the last three months. We know about very harsh conditions, like inhumane conditions that he's going through. He's put in a cell that is a very -- you know, that doesn't have electricity, doesn't have hygiene, clothes, any human -- that any humans would need. And this pains me so much, because he does not belong there. He belongs between -- amongst the Palestinian people. He is a figure that is -- a unifying figure for the Palestinian people. And he's also someone who struggled his whole life for peace. And for peace not only for Palestinian, but also for the region. But I think that maybe the Israeli government is not interested in a that figure is working for a true two-state solution or just peace, not any kind of peace.

Nikki Haley is suspending her presidential campaign after losing to Donald Trump in yesterday's Republican Super Tuesday primaries. So, where will she choose to send her delegates and her voters? A key issue dividing the party is reproductive rights where Haley has a much more nuanced view than Trump or hardline Republicans like the Alabama Supreme Court justices, which caused such a nationwide uproar with its ruling, jeopardizing the possibility of IVF for families who are trying to conceive. Now, in her recent piece, \"IVF and the GOP,\" Mona Charen, policy editor at \"The Bulwalk\" news site, details the conflict between legislation and fertility treatments. And she's joining Michel Martin to discuss how conservatives can maintain voter support. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And it seemed to me that the most moral position would be one that took life very seriously, treated it as sacred. And of course, there's always an understanding that pregnancy is unlike anything else in human experience, and there are competing rights. But I found myself very much on the side of trying to do everything possible to prevent abortion whenever possible.

There would be a lot more social support, financial support, the whole nine yards, so that we could welcome more children into the world.
