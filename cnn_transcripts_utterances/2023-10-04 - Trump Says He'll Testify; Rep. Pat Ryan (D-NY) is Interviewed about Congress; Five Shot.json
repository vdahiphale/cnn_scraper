We were hearing originally that it was just going to be a Monday/Tuesday thing. But he is in court. He is very engaged with his attorneys, listening to the testimony as, you know, the court reporters noted inside, it's very different when you have the former president sitting there as you're testifying. So, there may be some sort of truth to why he wants to physically be there. But we certainly do expect him to take the stand at some point in this three month trial.",

But, look, this was, as you heard in that sound, a frantic scene last night around 9:30 as this all unfolded. Police on patrol in the area hearing those gunshots, racing in to five those five injured people. And that's when the school went into lockdown. A shelter in place order was issued to students as a SWAT team combed building to building trying to find whoever did this. As you mentioned, unsuccessful at this point. They're still trying to find that shooter. Classes, though, canceled today. And, look, Poppy, this was supposed to be a time for celebration It is homecoming week here at Morgan State. Students were actually between events when this all unfolded. And this is the third straight year that homecoming has been marred by violence by a shooting here on this campus. Take a listen to Baltimore's mayor speaking about this shooting last night.
