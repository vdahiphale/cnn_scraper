I'll be back tonight at 10 o'clock Eastern on CNN. But our coverage from Israel continues now with Anderson. ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST, \"ANDERSON COOPER: 360\": It is 3:00 am now in Tel Aviv. For hours, we have been seeing and hearing signs that Israel's campaign against Hamas in Gaza is in a new phase. Strikes, people is telling us -- people in Gaza, I should point out, telling CNN that strikes like this one now are the most intense that they have seen so far. In addition to this, air and artillery bombardment that appears to be growing in tempo, Israeli troops today launched what they are calling an expanded operation into Gaza. An IDF spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari saying that the military is, quote, \"expanding their ground operations.\" He also dismissed reports earlier today of a possible deal to free more hostages and said that Gaza's largest hospital, Al Shifa, was also the site of a major Hamas command-and-control center now. He offered as evidence his cell phone intercept reporting to be between two Gazans discussing the site. Instead, there was more evidence that he could not yet make public. Admiral Hagari also had a warning, quote, \"When medical facilities are used for terror purposes,\" he said, \"they are liable to lose their protection from attack in accordance with international law.\" Meantime, at another hospital, Al Aqsa, witnesses tell CNN they see and hear what they described as intensifying bombardment around them. Here in Israel, senior officials appear to be signaling that whatever comes next, the answer to what Hamas did on October 7th should be decisive. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And this area close to the northern part of the Gaza Strip is close to where there was a limited incursion two nights ago. There were other incursions last night. And it did appear -- does appear that this was a continuation of that, but also, from Hamas and perhaps Palestinian Islamic Jihad, those groups firing rockets out of Gaza to Tel Aviv towards where you are, and also here to Sderot.

You might be getting the heavy machine gunfire coming from the top of some of these armored personnel carriers. Some of them we've seen quite literally the crew can batten down inside and the weapon on top of the vehicle, heavy machine gun can be fired from within the vehicle. So this really can be the troops at the sharp end of the fight. But are they just laying down covering fire so that other troops can maneuver in or are they actually engaging directly with Hamas?

There was a very respected Israeli correspondent tonight who said that there was actually an Egyptian offer for the release of 100 hostages in exchange for a four-day ceasefire, and Israel rejected it. I haven't gotten confirmation from that. But in talking to one of the intelligence people in Israel, I asked, how do we get Netanyahu to agree to this offer, 100 hostages for a four-day ceasefire.

He didn't see sunlight for five years and four months. And in his last month of captivity, because of acute Vitamin D deficiency, he wasn't digesting food. Another month in captivity, he would have died. And he was living in a house -- in the basement of a house. There was a family above him. So I'm sure that the conditions in the tunnels are much worse. It's damp there. There isn't fresh air. There are pumps pumping in air, but they are running out of fuel apparently as well. They said that the hostages who were released said they ate one meal a day, which consisted of pita bread, some cheese, and a cucumber. There's hardly nutrition. They probably don't have healthy drinking water because, in all of Gaza, there's no healthy drinking water. You have to buy filtered water, desalinated water in Gaza.

Small trap doors in the desert let militants evade advancing troops, even sneak up behind them. And the danger down here, not just to the troops above, but to Israeli civilians too. Long range rockets stored on wall brackets can be rushed forward to be fired towards Tel Aviv and other cities, from hidden gun pits connected directly to the tunnels, making the launch sites even harder for the IDF to strike back at. Only after an incursion can Israel expect to fully destroy the terror tunnels. Absent that, the so-called Gaza Metro will outfox and endanger. Israeli soldiers and civilians alike.
