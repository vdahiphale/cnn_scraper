But we begin this hour with an exclusive CNN report on Afghanistan. As the Taliban's rapid takeover of the country in 2021 was in its final days and U.S. forces were scrambling to get out, a bomb ripped through crowds of Afghans seeking evacuation at Kabul's airport. 170 Afghans and 13 U.S. service members perished. The Pentagon has insisted that everyone was killed by the blast, but new video and eyewitness evidence obtained by CNN question that account.

What to do about aid to Ukraine because of divisions within the ranks, because of the outspoken voices on the far right of the Republican conference, and because of the fact that the former president, Donald Trump, has been skeptical about more aid to Ukraine. This has changed how a lot of Republicans view whether or not the United States should have a more robust presence in the world or whether they should pull back from its support of foreign wars.This debate between the so-called national security hawks and the isolationist wings of the Republican Party had played out for months and months and months. It had really stymied action on all of this. Now, one person who has been in the forefront on pushing this aid has been Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell. He, of course, shepherded it through a $95 billion aid package along with Democratic leaders a couple months ago, two months ago. In fact, that plan included aid to Ukraine, Taiwan, and to Israel. Then it essentially went nowhere in the Republican-led House for more than two months until Speaker Mike Johnson decided to make a move and tried to move on a similar plan with some modifications, with some changes and send that back to the Senate on Saturday. Ultimately leading to the Senate's final action early this week. Now, McConnell, as he was discussing all of this, pinned the blame on the former Fox News host Tucker Carlson for stoking that anti-Ukraine sentiment within the GOP. SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): I think gamification of Ukraine began with Tucker Carlson. And in my opinion ended up where he should have been all along, which was interviewing Vladimir Putin. And so, he had an enormous audience which convinced a lot of rank and file Republicans that maybe this is a mistake.",

But there's a belief that Johnson being able to survive such a vote if it were to actually come to a head on the House floor, because potentially Democrats could come to his defense and also the former president himself, Donald Trump, defending the actions of Mike Johnson in an interview earlier in the week. So a lot of questions about Johnson's future, but at the moment there is a belief and there's a relief among supporters of Ukraine aid on Capitol Hill that after months of battling, finally this chapter is done for now.
