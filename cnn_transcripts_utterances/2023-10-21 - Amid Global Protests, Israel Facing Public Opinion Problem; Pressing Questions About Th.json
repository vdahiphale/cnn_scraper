That's the title of an unusual advisory released by the U.S. State Department this week warning the following, due to increased tensions in various locations around the world, the potential for terrorist attacks, demonstrations or violent actions against U.S. citizens and interests, the Department of State advises us citizens overseas to exercise increased caution. The U.S. finds itself in the crosshairs of an international backlash against Israel's retaliation against Hamas, despite the fact that Hamas attacked Israel and slaughtered more than 1,400 people.This morning in London, 1000s are participating in this pro- Palestinian demonstration urged on by Hamas leaders. This follows similar demonstrations Friday in which angry anti-Israel protesters took to the streets around the world, burning Israeli flags and portraits of President Biden even an effigy of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. They assembled outside many U.S. embassies including those in Indonesia and Malaysia, also on the streets of Amman, Cairo, Paris and Islamabad, everywhere from South Korea to South Africa. Meanwhile, the Rafah crossing into Egypt was briefly opened this morning to allow the first convoy of aid trucks to enter the besieged Gaza Strip. For the latest, I'm joined by CNN's Clarissa Ward in Cairo. Clarissa, when all was said and done, what was actually on those trucks and what is needed but was not provided?",

      "sentences": "So Michael, on those 20 trucks, you basically had food, water, medicine, all those things desperately needed. But one thing that wasn't on those trucks was fuel. The Israelis have had serious reservations about allowing fuel to go in. They're worried it could be diverted by Hamas. But the U.N. is really concerned that fuel supplies are now down to maybe two or three days.And that fuel is so desperately needed to power generators, which are the only things that are allowing these hospitals to continue to function to the extent that they are still able to function. Also important to note, 20 trucks is nothing in the grand scheme of things. Before this latest spasm of violence, you would have 455 trucks a day according to the U.N. of aid going into Gaza. Now you've had two weeks relentless bombardment, no aid, mass displacement, humanitarian catastrophe. So 20 trucks, the WFP is saying could maybe meet the needs of 30,000 people in terms of food, and they need to reach about 900,000. That's why you're hearing full throated calls from the U.N., other humanitarian organizations saying this needs to be a sustained, continuous humanitarian corridor and not a one off, Michael.",

And the Egyptians have said, they also don't want to have a massive outpouring of potentially hundreds of 1000s of Palestinians into the Sinai Peninsula, which is where that border crossing is. Egypt has been fighting an insurgency in the Sinai Peninsula for many years now. Egypt already has huge social problems, poverty.And so you've heard Egypt's president say, listen, the answer to this is not us taking a million refugees that we simply can't care for. The answer to this is agreeing upon a sustained continuous humanitarian corridor, establishing humanitarian zones inside of southern Gaza. We heard Secretary of State Antony Blinken talk about that, too. But the issue is getting all sides to come together and agree on the conditions that would allow for that. And in the meantime, Michael, of course, it sounds like a cliche, but it could not be more true. Every day, every hour is so crucial for the people inside of Gaza, who are not only facing relentless bombardment, but what the U.N. is calling an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe that is unfolding.",

When we speak to protesters on the ground, the vast majority of them tell us this is not about Hamas. This is not about expressing any indifference to the attacks against Israeli civilians on October 7, in fact, for the vast majority of the people that we've been speaking to here in Jordan, and indeed, people that we've been speaking to across the region, this is about a conflict and issue, a crisis, which began long before October 7. These are pro- Palestinian protesters, they are demonstrating against Israel's airstrikes on the Gaza Strip, which as we know, have had a devastating humanitarian toll, a devastating human toll, that death toll rising as Clarissa mentioned, by the day, by the hour. And of course, for many here, this is a call for an end to the siege on Gaza and end the blockade.As I said, for many, this began long before October 7. This is about more than just what we're seeing happening now in Gaza. This is about the violence that we're seeing in the West Bank. This is about the expansion of settlements, which are considered by many in the international community to be illegal under international law. This is a crisis and issue a cause, which is central to many here in Jordan where more than half of the population are either Palestinian or of Palestinian descent, and that is felt and reflected across the Middle East. Now, look, you mentioned King Abdullah of Jordan there condemning the violence that we are seeing. And I think that something that he said today, at the Cairo peace that really characterizes and captures what many people on the streets of Amman and across the Middle East are feeling. Let me just read you a bit of what he had to say. He said, \"The relentless bombing campaign underway in Gaza as we speak is true and unconscionable on every level. It is collective punishment of a besieged and helpless people. It is a flagrant violation of international humanitarian law. It is a war crime. Anywhere else attacking civilian infrastructure and deliberately starving an entire population of food, water, electricity and basic necessities would be condemned.\" This is the message from King Abdullah of Jordan. This is the message that we have been hearing across the Middle East. This is the rallying cry that we have been hearing from protesters here in Amman. And as you well know, this is the message that we have been hearing from international rights groups, aid groups, NGOs on the ground who are trying to alleviate what Clarissa just mentioned, is an unfolding humanitarian catastrophe in the Gaza Strip.",

The focus of these protests is on the unfolding humanitarian catastrophe that is happening in Gaza. The focus, when you hear the chant, when you speak to people on the ground here in Amman and across the Middle East, is about what we are seeing happening in Gaza. And as you know, Gaza has been under a blockade since 2007.People cannot leave. We heard that evacuation order from the IDF telling people to move from the north to southern Gaza, where airstrikes have continued. And of course, as we've heard from many on the ground, including many medical staff that we've heard, we've spoken to on the ground, they aren't able to evacuate most of the majority of those living in the north, or rather, at least some of those living in the north. We're talking about the elderly, children, some in hospital who simply cannot leave, doctors from Doctors Without Borders have told us that they refuse to evacuate because they cannot evacuate hundreds of patients and they will remain in place in northern Gaza to provide care for them. This is a humanitarian catastrophe. And as we know, this is a densely populated area. It's about just over twice the size of Washington, D.C., hugely crowded with civilians. And when we see these airstrikes happening, we know the IDF says it is targeting Hamas positions, Hamas targets. But these civilian death toll we are seeing that is rising is in some ways, according to rights group, inevitable because of how densely populated this area is. And we've seen that --",

He said this, \"If people cannot talk openly and honestly about a misfired rocket, imagine what will happen when the first major Israeli invasion of Gaza begins in our wired world, linked by social networks, and polluted with misinformation amplified by artificial intelligence.By the way, to be fair to Tom Friedman, he is advocating that an incursion in Gaza be paired with a sort of an allegiance a pledge made by Israel to a two state solution.

We understand the challenge. Don't forget, and around 2015, ISIS were producing incredibly slick videos on social media online. They were, you know, advertising the caliphate. What a wonderful thing it was to come to the caliphate in Iraq and Syria. They were convincing, you know, young women in Britain and in the west, to go be ISIS brides through their slick propaganda. So this is not something that is new. This is something that, you know, we have dealt with. I mean, basically, if you go back to the Arab Spring, if you go back to Egypt and Tunisia, most of the Arab Spring started via Twitter. So, you know, we've got a good 12 years here, 12, 13 years of having dealt with the Arab Spring than dealing with ISIS propaganda and what you're seeing today from Hamas.",

He said yes. Then the White House said that he misheard the question. Do you -- do you associate the lack of ground incursion thus far into Gaza with the hostage issue? WOOD: There have been many thoughts about why the invasion hasn't taken place. I think most Israelis thought it would have happened starting maybe a week ago. And no one is really sure. I think there is some doubt about whether the invasion might be accompanied by the opening of a northern front by Hezbollah, which would massively complicate the difficulty of Israel's security. And I also think that there has been discussion, as we have seen with the release of the first two hostages, about those remaining hostages. Still 200 of them. And I don't think any of Israel's plans -- pre-existing plans that existed before the 7th of October envisioned 200 hostages in Gazan territory. So, it was not -- it would not be surprising if they decided they needed to take a big breath and make sure that they had every eventuality planned for. And that would mean taking a little more time.",

So far, despite it being a time of war against an ally, America has not been rallying around its president.As \"Politico Playbook\" put it, \"Since the shocking 10/7 attacks by Hamas, there have been four national polls in the U.S. that show Biden stuck where he's been for a while now, with an approval rating averaging about 40 percent.\" \"Politico\" adds that this has held despite -- quote -- one, \"A Republican Party arguably showcasing itself at its worst in the House.\" And two, \"Biden arguably showing himself at his best in his response to the war between Israel and Hamas.\" Now, polls always lag a little and voters have generally been approving of the president's handling of both Israel and Ukraine. And this week's prime time speech and his trip to Israel, they might change his standing. But for all of Biden's experience and noble democratic intentions abroad, Americans aren't feeling directly threatened and the economy is still the overriding issue for many. The other X factor in all of this is that for American voters, the issue of Israel, which traditionally has been more associated with Democrats has become a cause for Republicans. A big part of that shift has been evangelicals who feel a biblical link to Israel, many of them believe the current conflict part of an end of time scenario. A CNN poll this month found Republicans are far more likely than independents or Democrats to say the Israeli response is fully justified, 68 percent compared with 45 percent of the Is and 38 percent of the Ds. And since the Hamas attack on Israel, GOP presidential candidates have been battling to prove who supports Israel the most. At a rally two days after the Hamas strike, President Trump -- former President Trump said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Assess that.BEN-AMI: Well, I think that what you're seeing on the Democratic side is a recognition that the traditional way that pollsters and politicians have looked at the Israel and Palestine issue, which is that you have to choose one side or the other, doesn't reflect their point of view. There's recognition among a large swath of Democrats that one can support the right of the Jewish people to a state and for that state to defend itself and get support and security help from the United States. And at the same time, believe that the Palestinian people have an equal set of rights and that they too have a right to freedom and self-determination. And when forced into a situation where the United States seems to be standing only with one side, which is the case under let's say a Donald Trump or in the Bush years, the Democrats said to themselves, we need an approach that actually is more balanced, more moderate, more rational. And I think that's the fissure that you're seeing within the Democratic Party.",

So, I've got to bring up this Tom Friedman column where Friedman is saying under the headline, \"Israel Is About to Make a Terrible Mistake,\" that he thinks that any military action on the part of Israel has got to be paired with a commitment to a two- state solution.I assume you agree with that. Tell me if I'm wrong. How realistic is that idea? BEN-AMI: Well, the only thing that is not realistic is to imagine that there will ever be peace for these millions of people who live in this land if the Palestinian people don't have an independent and free state of their own. That's the only unrealistic position. There are some on the far right who think there could be one state from river to the sea and expel the Palestinians and the Jews will have complete control. And there are folks on the left and there's Hamas that think that the Jews are going to be expelled and it will be a fully Palestinian territory from the river to the sea. And there's other who think that somehow these two people that are killing each other non-stop will just lay down their arms, take down the walls, and live together forever in a peaceful one-state democracy. Those are the people that live under massive illusion. The only way that the fighting will ever stop is if both the Israeli people, the Jewish people, and the Palestinian people have states -- independent states of their own with freedom and security living in peace and with an opportunity for a better life, something to live for rather than to die for. So, it is the most realistic way out of this. And I completely agree with Tom Friedman, the part of the American policy has to be to say to Israel, we have your back in a moment like this. But you have got to shift your force -- your course going forward.",

But how realistic that Bibi Netanyahu, particularly now surrounded by those who surround him, those with whom he made a deal to return to power, how realistic that at this moment in time he would embrace that idea publicly?BEN-AMI: None. No chance of Bibi Netanyahu, but we're talking about laying the path for a future. The president and other world leaders need to set a vision. The Palestinian people and Jewish people, Israelis and Palestinians, and the Arab world broadly, that vision can be bought into. It is a vision of Israel normalized within its region. It's an Israel at peace with its neighbor. But one of those has to be a state of Palestine. And there's no way to normalize with Arab neighbors without having a resolution of the fundamental underlying conflict that we have just seen blow up.",
