And this image captured by the Peregrine Moon lander just moments before its fiery end in the South Pacific. Why some say it wasn't a complete failure. For the fifth time in a week, the U.S. has struck Houthi targets inside Yemen in hopes of stopping their attacks on vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. U.S. Central Command says its forces destroyed two Houthi anti-ship missiles aimed at the critical waterway that were prepared to launch. The White House National Security Council spokesperson says the ongoing strikes are, quote, \"taking away capability from the Iran- backed militants.\" The Houthis spokesperson said the group won't stop going after vessels they believe are linked to Israel and called the attacks by the U.S. and U.K. a persistent act of aggression. The U.S. president admitted Thursday that the Houthis remain undeterred. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They are holding onto 136 of our people. Of course, we're going to search for them potentially in cemeteries. This is part of the hunt for the citizens who were taken from their beds on that day of October 7th and brought to tunnels and to dark places in Gaza. What Netanyahu is saying is that Hamas has to be removed from power for there to be security and safety, but I agree with you, is that Israel does need to articulate some sort of day after plan, a political resolution, and that Israel has yet to do.

He did say that Netanyahu is responsible. And the reason he pointed that out is because the prime minister has until now refused to take responsibility. He's refused to say that maybe I made mistakes, maybe I had a hand in the blindness, the strategic blindness that Israel suffered from on the eve of October 7th that allowed Hamas to penetrate our border, to go into our communities, to massacre over 1200 people on that horrific day. And Netanyahu refuses to accept that responsibility even though he is the prime minister, the head of this government. But I think that we have to come up with what we want to see happen afterwards in Gaza. And the problem is, Kim, there aren't a lot of potential candidates to take over the Gaza Strip. I don't see people lining up and saying, hey, we want to be the ones to come in. So, it's either going to be Israel or we're going to have to find a way to work with the Palestinian Authority and that is something that we have to prepare the ground for to get them to reform to be less corrupt, less supportive of terror, for that to even be possible.",

But nevertheless, we will fly again on the next Astrobotic mission, which is coming later this year with the same landing system. So, at the moment, it's still not 100 percent clear what went wrong on the Peregrine mission. Although the engineers seem to think that it was a valve that leaked and cause an over pressurization of the tanks, which ultimately led to the mission and having to be changed in some way, let's say, I mean, they weren't able to land on the moon, but I understand that a number of their scientific instruments on board were able to collect data.
