      "sentences": "Hello, everyone. I'm Anna Coren, live in Hong Kong. We begin with breaking news.Police in Chesapeake, Virginia are reporting multiple fatalities and injuries from a shooting at a Walmart. Officers responded to the store a little less than three hours ago, just after 10:00 pm local time. The spokesperson says he cannot confirm the number of dead, but believes it is less than 10. The statement from the city of Chesapeake confirms the gunman is deceased. Well, let's bring in CNN National Security Analyst Juliette Kayyem. We also have Neill Franklin joining us, a former Maryland state police officer. Juliette and Neill, we now have the lay of the land. That the gunman walked into that store a bit before 10:12 pm local time, that he opened fire, that there are multiple fatalities, multiple injuries. Police responded shortly after. We heard from the police spokesperson who said that the officers walked straight in. We don't know what sort of confrontation there was with the gunman, but the gunman is now dead. But that was an active scene for half an hour. Neill let's start with you. Talk us through what would have happened.",

      "sentences": "So again, once the officers would have arrived, and again, a half an hour active scene is a very, very long time. Again, most of these shootings don't take that much time, it's just a matter of minutes. So, if we had - I think you said earlier less than 10 hopefully have deceased, I think we are pretty fortunate. But once the police officers arrive, they'd form a team, and theywould enter the building. They would systematically go through the building trying to find the shooter to neutralize the shooter, listening for gunshots, talking to people, trying to get a direction, trying to get a description so that they can identify the shooter so that they can neutralize the shooter. Again, we don't know what happened. We don't if the shooter took his own life. We don't know if it was done by a police officer or someone else. But as you said, it is confirmed that the shooter is deceased. And there's one other thing that I had failed to mention earlier that's going to be a significant part of building this case and the evidence and getting the information. Retailers such as Walmart, these huge retail outlets, have a plethora of cameras. They have cameras everywhere. And so, one of the things that the police are currently doing is collecting that video and it's going to take a long time to go through each one of those - the footage for each one of those cameras to try to learn exactly what happened, where did he enter from, you know, what was carrying, where did he go first, you know, how we went about the process of shooting people in the store.",

It could be a disgruntled customer, you know, who, again, is dealing with issues.Again, when you - when you hear about the background of the other shooter, I believe his name is Aldrich, you know, there - in his history there was some bullying that took place and we see this a lot, especially in a number of our school shootings that we have, you know, whether it's online or whether they bullying took place, you know, somewhere else. So, there are many possibilities, many things that can send someone over the edge to strike out and just either target people or random people. But, usually, when it's in a situation like this, where you've got this large retail outlet and it just appears to be random, you know, this doesn't appear to be a targeted shooting where he was going in, you know, and just looking for a particular person. Again, most of it - most of the time that we see shootings like this, it is someone who just went over the edge and random shooting, but multiple reasons for it.

I've learned about a lot of it through the news just like most other people and I can just tell you, I - it's just absolutely horrible. And the thing that makes this so sad is that this gun control, this gun violence is out of control, and unfortunately, we have the power to do something about it, that just is not the will (ph) or part (ph) of many of our legislative members to do it. But all I can say to you is that this is a sad night for us in Virginia. It's a sad night in Chesapeake. And it's going to be a really, really sad time tomorrow morning when people wake up and hear this sad news. But we can do something about gun control. There's too much easy access to firearms. And we have got to do something to bring it under control. Many of us have been fighting in the legislature for decades to try to get gun violence - gun control amendments passed. But, unfortunately, there's always pushback, pushback, pushback. But, we've got to bring it under control.

I mean, there's just so much more that can be done. And we can do it. But there's always that pushback.

And I think we need to do that at all costs. Well, look at what happened in Virginia Beach, the CEs (ph) from allover volunteered to come to Virginia Beach to help with the counseling regarding the grief. We need to do that right now. We need to have boots on the ground helping these people to deal with the trauma. And I'm just horrified.

That was before the strikes.The strikes themselves were interesting because we thought that when Ukraine lost power it would be because of cyber strikes that the Russians conducted. After all, they turned off the power in parts of the country in 2015. And 2016. But it turns out that while cyber is a very good (INAUDIBLE) war weapon, if you're in the middle of a war the most efficient way to turn off the power is the way the Russians have done it which is to put missiles right through substations, the generators, do as much havoc as they could. And they've been quite systematic about it, so systematic that we're now hearing the Ukrainians asked many of the people, millions of them to leave the country for the winter. Take up residence in Poland or Romania or any place that might take them in or where they have relatives so that they are not an additional drain on already limping along grid.",

There's a major bus stop there. And police believe that some sort of bag was placed on the ground before it exploded. We know that at least 11 people were injured in that blast. Then a second blast took place in a different part of the city but also at a bus station. Not clear exactly whether this was another bag on the ground, or something else. But least three people are injured in that. So in total, 14 people have been injured and at least two of them are considered to be in serious, or critical condition. Now, we've been talking about for months about how the situation here is so tense. And how there were fears of a third intifada and these types of explosions. Really helped sort of define the first and second intifada. So there is a major here right now that we are now at the cusp. If this is the opening, to another intifada. Because explosions bombs like this -- bombs especially placed at bus stations. They have not happened in Jerusalem or in Israel proper in years. And in recent years if there were some attacks they tended to be stabbings, shootings, or ramming attacks. These sort of explosives, these bombs, this is something we have not seen in quite a long time. Now there is a rise of these new militant groups in the West Bank and there were reports in the last few days of a potential car bomb that may have gone off in the West Bank, sort of a failed car bomb. So already, tensions were high. But this is, I think very surprising for a lot of people. Still despite the fact we've been talking about how tense the situation here is just because there have not been bombs like these in so long. People are now immediately thinking back to the second intifada, to the suicide bombings on buses especially. I mean back in those days many Israelis would just completely avoid riding buses, will completely avoid bus stops. There were regular searches at entrances to any sort of public place and there are concerns that now, Israel will be going back into that situation. There are also concerns that there will be more explosions. There are some reports, security personnel trying to dismantle something else. We don't have that confirmed. But right now, the situation here is very tenuous. There are concerns that there will further explosions, either in Jerusalem, or elsewhere. And concerned officials only opened up into something much larger potentially a third intifada, Anna.",
