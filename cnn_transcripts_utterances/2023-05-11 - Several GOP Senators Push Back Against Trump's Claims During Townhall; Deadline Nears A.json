      "sentences": "Good evening.Before we begin with tonight's broadcast, I want to say something about what we witnessed at last night's townhall. Many of you have expressed deep anger and disappointment. Many of you are upset that someone who attempted to destroy our democracy was invited to sit on the stage in front of a crowd of Republican voters to answer questions, and predictably continued to spew lie after lie after lie. And I get it, it was disturbing. It was disturbing to see and hear that person refer to a Black law enforcement officers as a thug, an adjective he used many times to describe Black men and called Kaitlan Collins, the moderator, nasty, which is what he calls any woman who stands up to him. It was disturbing to hear him speak so highly of QAnon conspirators and insurrectionists who assaulted police officers and our democracy on January 6, and it was awful to hear him spread ridiculous lies about the election. And it was certainly disturbing to hear that audience, young and old, our fellow citizens, people who love their kids and go to church, laugh and applaud his lies and his continued defamation of a woman who according to a jury of his peers, he sexually abused and defamed. As good a job as Kaitlan Collins did trying to factcheck him, it is impossible to factcheck fully because he lies so shamelessly. Now, many of you think CNN shouldn't have given him any platform to speak, and I understand the anger about that, giving him the audience, the time, I get that. But this is what I also get. The man you were so disturbed to see and hear from last night. That man is the frontrunner for the Republican nomination for president. And according to polling, no other Republican is even close. That man you were so upset to hear from last night, he may be president of the United States in less than two years, and that audience that upset you, that's a sampling of about half the country. They are your family members, your neighbors, and they are voting, and many said they're voting for him. Now, maybe you haven't been paying attention to him since he left office, maybe you've been enjoying not hearing from him thinking it can't happen again. Some investigation is going to stop him. Well, it hasn't so far. So if last night showed anything, it showed it can happen again. It is happening again. He hasn't changed and he is running hard. You have every right to be outraged and angry, never watch this network again. But do you think staying in your silo and only listening to people you agree with is going to make that person go away? If we all only listen to those we agree with, it may actually do the opposite. If lies are allowed to go unchecked, as imperfect as our ability to check them is on a stage in real time, those lies continue and those lies spread. If you're angry or upset, I understand, but you have the power to do something about it. You can actually get involved, you can make a difference, whatever side of the aisle you're on. After last night, none of us can say I didn't know what's out there. I didn't know what's coming. We asked Republican senators for their thoughts about last night, some preferred not to say anything, others did. Here's a sampling of what we heard. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO): You're asking me, do I think he should pardon people who engaged in like rioting behavior? Well, I don't. SEN. THOM TILLIS (R-NC): Anybody who crossed into the Capitol under the circumstances that I witnessed firsthand, it's hard for me to have a positive predisposition towards him. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We heard from Hakeem Jeffries, who leads the House Democrats and he said that this was Exhibit A of the trauma that America would see if we have another four years with President Trump. And then we also heard from Richard Blumenthal, the Senator from Connecticut who said that if he were to pardon those January 6th rioters that that would be grounds for yet another impeachment in his eyes. So again, a lot from the Democrats that you would expect, really trying to stick their positions and make it very clear that they are quite different than the Democrats who offer a very, very, very different view than Donald Trump and attaching him to that far right wing of the party. Also interesting, Anderson just to go back to the Senate Republicans for one second, we did talk to the Senate Majority Whip, John Thune who said it looks like a lot of Democratic campaign ads were written last night.",

I think that would be a snowball rolling in a direction that he actually couldn't stop.And so, they are still fearing him because he is a big bully, and their political consultants are telling them, don't say anything about them or don't make a comment. But if they start to stand up to him the way Mitt Romney did, you saw a glimmer of that with Senator Hawley, you will blunt him, you will slow him down. And remember, when the witch in \"The Wizard of Oz,\" the water accidentally spilled on the witch and she started melting, the soldiers turned to Dorothy and said, hey, jeez, I'm sorry that we did this and I think we're getting to that point right now where the water has to hit Trump and he has to start melting, and they have to show some bravery and courage.",

So I think you're right, Anthony, this is the moment where Republicans and elder statesmen and women of the Republican Party have to self- police. We haven't done it for six years and we have to start now and it is going to be behind closed doors, and it's going to be open and public. But it has to be Republican on Republican, because the problem with Donald Trump's inertia right now is that he is seen as a victim by the media, the Democrats, the other people, and that's emboldening him. But if this is a Republican on Republican affront to Donald Trump, then you've got a chance at building a wedge and actually building momentum for someone else.",

And he's sitting there in a seat that you did not expect. He could be the sitting president again. He will damage the democracy, he will abrogate elements of our rule of law. And he will do things that are non-traditional to the United States, and forget about the things that he could potentially do to our allies, and our adversaries in that role, okay and he is a very angry guy. And we all know at this table that he is intellectually incurious and he will have a staff of misfits running around for him because nobody like General Kelly, or, you know, you pick the team that was in there first time, not even his children want to go. He knows that, which is why he propped up the First Lady this week, because he knows that he doesn't have the connectivity. And this is not 2016 anymore, Anderson, and the country has changed a lot.

But Anthony makes a great point. You never know what's going to happen. One thing I would note, though, is, you know, there's been a lot of talk about the apathy on the Democratic side for the current president, for President Biden, the lack of energy, enthusiasm. This is what brings that out. And when you talk to advisers who are looking at the polls, you know, this Washington Post poll that got a lot of attention last week, I believe, that showed the former president beating President Biden and their coalition was where their numbers dropped off dramatically. It's why they question a lot of the methodology of the poll. That coalition comes home in the view of Biden advisors when they see stuff like this, that is what energizes them. That's what got Joe Biden to the White House in 2020. Him being on center stage for all of the pain that he seems to have caused some people, for Democrats, that is a serious motivating factor and for the current president, that is his path, no question about it.",

The charge will be manslaughter in the second degree. Jordan Neely was a Michael Jackson impersonator. The confrontation between the two occurred last week on a subway train. A witness has told CNN that Neely was being loud and aggressive, shouting that he was hungry, had little to live for. The witness also said Neely didn't attack anyone. The witness took a video of the confrontation. And we warn you somewhat you see is disturbing. Penny came up behind Neely and put him in a chokehold. CNN doesn't know exactly what led up to the confrontation or how long Neely was in the chokehold. And while one person in the video says Neely might have a weapon, the witness tells CNN he did not see one. Neely later lost consciousness and was pronounced dead in a nearby hospital. There have been protests and calls for Penny's arrest since Neely's death became public.

All three men were charged by Aruban prosecutors in 2007 for involvement in manslaughter, but a judge ordered their release, citing lack of direct evidence. Van der Sloot is accused of extorting thousands from Holloway's mother, Beth, in exchange for details on the location of her daughter's remains. According to legal documents, in March 2010, van der Sloot offered to take the cooperating witness to the location of Natalee Holloway's body, advise as to the circumstances of her death, and identify those in her death and disappearance in return for a payment of $250,000. A total of $25,000 was given to van der Sloot as a down payment and Holloway's attorney flew to Aruba. Van der Sloot took the attorney to a house, saying the body was buried within the foundation. Days later, he emailed the Holloways saying he had lied about the location of Natalee Holloway's remains. Extortion charges were filed a short time later, but van der Sloot was nowhere to be found. He had fled to Peru. Surveillance video shows him gambling with what was believed to be that $25,000. He met the daughter of a prominent Peruvian businessman, Stephany Flores. Video shows them leaving the casino, going to her apartment. Hours later, she was dead. [20:55:00] CNN went to Peru when van der Sloot was arrested and charged with Flores's murder. We obtained exclusive access to Castro Castro, one of the most violent prisons in Peru where van der Sloot was housed at the time. As he was let out, we were allowed to enter his private cell. Van der Sloot was convicted of murdering Flores in Peru in 2012. Peruvian authorities said from the beginning they would extradite him to the U.S. eventually to face federal charges in the U.S. Natalee's mother reacting to the news in a statement Wednesday. \"She would be 36 years old now. It has been a very long and painful journey. But the persistence of many is going to pay off. Together, we are finally getting justice for Natalee.\" (END VIDEOTAPE)",
