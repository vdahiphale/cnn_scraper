This hotel in Zaporizhzhia was used -- frequented by NGOs, humanitarian groups, United Nations itself.

We now understand, according to Ukrainian officials, two people killed in that attack and several others wounded. Among them, several children including a three-year-old girl who was still in hospital, being treated for her injuries. As you can imagine, this is yet another illustration to the U.N. and to Ukrainians that civilians are not off limits to Russia's assaults. It comes as Ukraine makes marginal gains in the south of Zaporizhzhia, that is a key frontline for Ukraine. But, Ukraine's military says that Russia is working on a distraction. They are trying to pull Kyiv's troops towards the north, towards Kharkiv region by sending reinforcements there, including for their tank decisions, for they're airborne decisions. In fact, officials there say that in some areas, strikes are occurring 50 to 80 times a day. Airstrikes from Russia, of course, using its air support superiority yet again to push back Ukraine on that counteroffensive. And that is, again, the problem that we are seeing all along those front lines. It is hundreds of miles of active fighting, forcing Ukraine's forces have to stretch thin all along it and, of course, a stretch of the resources thin.

In 2016, Trump signed the pledge and later said that he would no longer honor it and, this is something that Chris Christie has pointed out, that even if somebody signed the pledge, the RNC cannot force them to eventually support them as the nominee.But this is part of Trump's narrative that he is untouchable. He knows that he has a sizable lead over his opponents, and all indications right now is that he will skip. But one thing that I want to focus in on is DeSantis committing to this debate is significant because there was a time where his team avoided saying at all whether he would join the debate. And in fact, his super PAC implied that, if Trump did not join the debate, that he may not either. So this is just one side again taking a 360 with his campaign strategy and no longer following Trump's blueprint, which was not talking to mainstream media, not committing to the base, not focusing on kitchen table issues.
