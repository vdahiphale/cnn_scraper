      "sentences": "I think the President will try to connect. When you talk to his advisors connect what they view as critical accomplishments of the last two years to what they know they still need to accomplish in the year or two ahead. And it's critical because they recognize that there is some - to some degree - a disconnect between what they've accomplished and how the American public views the President's accomplishments.You can look at poll after poll after poll over the course of the last several weeks, where there's not a sense of resonance in those accomplishments, although from a legislative perspective, especially, there's a very clear record that they can point to. That will be one component. The President expected to say the State of the Union is strong. However, there is still more to be done. Progress, but a job not finished yet and finishing the job is something you hear repeatedly from aides the President will stress as of the utmost importance when he lays out his agenda for what's next. Now, you guys make a critical point here. The President, despite the fact that this is definitely a new era of partisan warfare with the House Republican majority, is not expected to make any political attacks. He will make clear where there are differences of opinion particularly on issues like the debt limit going forward. However, that olive branch that he plans to lay out there is not just one that is coming with no basis. He has two years of bipartisan accomplishments on things like infrastructure on the chips and science act that he will point to and a slate of agenda items that he believes Republicans support, at least to some degree and he will seek to highlight those. But guys, you make a really critical point here, for a president that in the weeks ahead is expected to launch a reelection campaign, this is a primetime moment in front of 10s of millions of Americans where they want to lay out what the White House has done, what this administration has accomplished and what they believe they can do going forward. Those are not differentiating issues. They connect with one another. And part of the President's job tonight is to tell the story that connects both at home on the domestic side, on the economic side and abroad on the foreign policy side how they believe the accomplishments of the first two years connect to the years ahead and connect to a likely reelection campaign.",

So be careful about those conversations, he told his members. He said also be careful about what you're watching on your phone. Photographers will be zooming in on members of Congress who were sitting on the House floor, all of which is very clear. Kevin McCarthy understands the optics here and he wants to show Republicans as the reasonable opposition party, not a caricature, like he believes the White House will try to portray them as. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)    REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA):   We will listen. There are times hopefully we can agree, there's times we will probably going to disagree. But we're members of Congress. We have a code of ethics of how we should portray ourselves, but also do our jobs and that's exactly what we'll do. But we're not going to be childish games tearing up a speech.

And we know now that the emergency programs offered by the administration surrounding the pandemic will end on May 11. There have been a lot of pressure from Republicans to end these programs sooner is now the time to do that.ABDUL EL-SAYED, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:   Well, I think unfortunately, this speaks to the reality that Democratic administration doesn't really have much of a choice. They're being forced into this. The question really at hand right now is how do you make permanent some of the provisions that it required a state of emergency to offer, whether it's keeping people on Medicaid roles who need it, making sure that SNAP benefits are truly whole and can support a family, making sure that people can afford their vaccines as we continue to tell them to protect themselves from future waves of this virus and making sure that people aren't put out by having to pay for testing, so that really is the focus here. And you're right, unfortunately, people do want the President to move on, even though the pandemic continues to take nearly 400 lives a day here. And yet, I think there is an opportunity to pivot off of everything that government was able to do for people during the pandemic to make those things permanent.",

Still uncertain whether or not she will talk about what Donald Trump did in office or whether she will steer clear from Donald Trump and instead have a more forward looking message.

As you said, it's a race against the clock and we're still within the first 48 hours of one of the largest earthquakes that has hit the region this century. For the time being, numbers have exceeded thousands, more than 5,000 deaths and 23,000 injuries in both countries, Syria and Turkey. On the ground, we've witnessed how roads have been damaged through - because of this earthquake and even the aftershocks. Our staff on the ground have been unable to go back to their Houses, if they've had their Houses still standing. Some of them are working in cars. Some of them have lost Internet connection. We've been experiencing outages with mobile phones, with electricity and even with gas supplies. So even for those families who have luckily didn't lose their homes, they can't go back home or if they do go back home, they will have to endure freezing temperatures, since there's no gas. This is - there's so many challenges and within Syria, in specific, it is a crisis within a crisis when we talk about over 4 million people in Northwest Syria, who have endured 12 years of conflict but also devastated economy, a cholera outbreak, COVID-19 and so many crises with inflation, so it's been really bad for these populations.",

It's extremely hard when you have all the - you see all the devastation around and you want to run and help all the different ways, but as a team that trains, if you have a number of teams already there, and others coming in that are training for this, we train in a certain way to get as much done as we can and as much good as we can in an organized approach.
