      "sentences": "All right, breaking this morning, new reporting that Donald Trump had multiple, secret conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin after he left office. This all comes from an excerpt from the upcoming book \"War\" by Bob Woodward. Jamie Gangel and her team looked at it and got these excerpts. One of them says, quote, \"according to Trump's aide, there have been multiple phone calls between Trump and Putin, as many as seven in the period since Trump left the White House in 2021.\" Again, the timeline here is Trump speaking to Putin allegedly after he was president.With me now is Congressman Jason Crow, a Democrat from Colorado who is on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Congressman, thanks so much for being with us. If this is true in Donald Trump's been having multiple conversations with Vladimir Putin, what's your takeaway? REP. JASON CROW (D-CO): Well, John, I've been watching Donald Trump closely for about eight years now, which I know is crazy to think about. But this shouldn't surprise anybody. This is somebody who for years has cozied up to dictators, to autocrats, who has said he's, you know, close to Kim Jong-un in North Korea, who repeatedly says he has a great relationship with Vladimir Putin, who has stored top secret documents in his bathroom, who, let's remember, invited Foreign Minister Lavrov, which is the Russian foreign minister, into the Oval Office and conveyed some of our secrets to him. I mean this is somebody who is cavalier with our national security, who disparages our troops. He in no way should come close to the White House, which is why it's important that in less than a month Americans are going to have a really important choice between Vice President Harris, who has proven time and time again that she can be a commander in chief that we need right now, versus Donald Trump.",

      "sentences": "And again, I should note that the Trump spokesperson, Jason Miller, says he has no knowledge of these conversations.But again, if true, would it cross some line? I mean presidential candidates and ex-presidents often do talk to -- to foreign leaders, but Putin invaded Ukraine at this point. Is that different? CROW: Of course, it's different because we are supporting Ukraine right now, right? We are here sending aid, military aid, to maintain peace and prosperity in Europe, to bolster the security for our NATO allies. This is one of the most consequential battles and conflicts of our life right now. And if somebody is going to be having closed door, you know, secret conversations with Vladimir Putin that nobody knows about, an ex-president, and maintaining some kind of shadow foreign policy, or making promises, and we're not sure what happened in this conversation if it indeed occurred, that -- that's very troubling stuff. But again, this is -- this is a pattern, right? This should not surprise anybody. This is Donald Trump's pattern to do secret, behind the door deals, to do things that American people don't know about, to do things that are self-serving. Let's not forget, the first impeachment trial was because Donald Trump withheld foreign aid that the American people and Congress authorized to Ukraine. He withheld that for personal political gain. And he has done that time and time again. This is not new. This is Donald Trump's modus operandi. This is the way he does business.",

      "sentences": "That's right. And I think the thing that's really dangerous about a lot of this information about the political nature of -- the politicization, I should say, of the federal response to both Hurricane Helene, but also the upcoming storm, Hurricane Milton, is that, you know, at best this is a distraction for people on the ground, but at worst, this could really be preventing them from knowing what their resources are that are available to them from getting the help that they need. And that's really the problem here. And that's why you hear so many people, not just politicians now, but in the past saying you cannot politicize what is happening in such an emergency situation as this one.Now, I do want to break down where this is coming from because we have seen Donald Trump and his campaign, for several days now, share false claims about the hurricane -- the federal response to the hurricane. They have argued without, you know, evidence that the Democratic leaders in some of these states, as well as the Biden administration, are being biased toward Republicans needing help. They've also argued, Donald Trump did this as recently as yesterday, that FEMA is only giving those who need help $750. Again, something we know is not true. That is something that they get kind of without question at first, but they have far more money and resources available to them. Now, the other part of this is Governor Ron DeSantis. He has been kind of thrust into this, of course, because of what is happening in Florida. Now, a White House official had told CNN that Harris had reached out to DeSantis multiple times to discuss the upcoming hurricane, as well as relief efforts for the past hurricane, and that he never took that call. He responded to that this morning on Fox News. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): Why all of a sudden is she trying to parachute in and inject herself when she's never shown any interest in the past? We know it's because of politics. We know it's because of her campaign. I have zero time to entertain these political games (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But it is really ironic that the vice president is now injecting herself into this, accusing the governor of Florida of being selfish on this when he's just trying to deal with it. It's obvious what she's trying to do. It's a total political ploy. So, for, again, for both sides, neither should be politicizing this thing.",

It's unfortunate that Governor DeSantis seems to be taking a playbook from his president, and Lance's president, Donald Trump, who, it was reported this week, was going to withhold wildfire relief funding for my home state of California until he was shown by members of his own staff that there are, in fact, Republicans in California.So, this is something that at a time of crisis, we need our leaders to put politics aside.

It's among likely voters. It's a national poll. Harris holds a narrow lead, 47-44, over Trump when third party candidates are included, 49-46 in that poll without other candidates named.
