There are no more closed door witness interviews scheduled and there's no clear consensus on how or even when to end the probe.As Republicans try to chart a path forward, the White House says, it's time to shut this down. In a letter this week to House Speaker Mike Johnson, White House Counsel Ed Siskel wrote, quote, \"It is obviously time to move on, Mr. Speaker. This impeachment is over. There is too much important work to be done for the American people to continue wasting this time -- wasting time on this charade.\" CNN's Annie Grayer has been reporting the story for us and has some great new details. You can see her story that it's on CNN.com on the screen, and luckily she is here with us. Annie?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Dana, this is not how Republicans thought their 15-month investigation would be going. They -- when they got the majority back in January, investigating the president and his family was a huge focus.But after 15 months, poring through over 100,000 bank records, interviewing around 40 people, including the president's son, Hunter, and brother, James, their business associates, Department of Justice officials, Iris (ph) whistleblowers, Republicans haven't found any evidence of wrongdoing by the president, and they don't have the votes to impeach. So the question is, how do you land this plane? House Oversight Chair James Comer wants to do criminal referrals to the Department of Justice, but the other stakeholders in this decision making process, namely Speaker Mike Johnson and Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan say more conversations need to be had about that. Comer also wants to bring Hunter back in for a public hearing, but Republicans -- some Republicans say Hunter came in for his deposition last month. He sat for six plus hours, answered every question that Republicans had, and were surprised at how prepared he was, and don't really know what more they can get from him in a public hearing. And just looking -- taking a big step back here about how much this has an impact and plays into the 2024 presidential election. Some Republicans say, look, we tried, we investigated, we've did as much as we could, let's wrap this up and focus on delivering for Republican voters in November. Then you have other Republican lawmakers and sources who I talked to and say -- who say, lets drag this out as long as possible. There's no incentive to end this. And let's hurt -- try and hurt President Joe Biden politically and help Donald Trump as much as possible. So that's where we are six months in and not where Republicans expected to be.",

So it's interesting to see the arc here of her now leaving this roundtable. I have reported on the administration's sort of approach to drug reform. President Biden, even during the campaign, really put an emphasis on nonviolent drug crimes. They have issued pardons when it comes to this. But, remember, mostly for federal crimes, which they only have leeway over, that only impacts a sliver of those who have actually committed prior offenses for this.
