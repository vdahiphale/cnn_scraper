The U.S. Coast Guard tweeted an update just a short time ago, searches in the area where the banging was pleased to be coming from have yielded negative results so far. While the searches continued time is running out, with the Titan estimated to have less than 30 hours of oxygen.

Ships and planes from the United States, Canada and France have been searching for the sub, which may have descended just filled with 20 that I have described as looking for a needle in a haystack. Here's CNN Jason Carroll. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CAPT. JAMIE FREDERICK, U.S. COAST GUARD: Right now all of our efforts are focused on finding the sub. JASON CARROLL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): With each passing hour. It is becoming increasingly clear if the five people onboard the missing submersible are to be rescued, it will have to be sued. Search and rescue teams from the United States and Canada have been working around the clock in the North Atlantic and have scanned an area about the size of Connecticut. Remotely operated vehicles equipped with cameras are now searching the area where the 22 foot long vessel was last seen Sunday. Sonar buoys deployed to try to detect any sound from the submersible. Deep sea rescue equipment is on its way.",

It's an important conference for all those countries and their governments because it intends to share the burden of rebuilding Ukraine across private businesses and enterprises. Last year at the same conference last year, it was estimated them by Ukrainian official shows that it would cost $100 billion to rebuild Ukraine's infrastructure, its businesses. Of course, there's been another year of war. So that figure has only gone up.
