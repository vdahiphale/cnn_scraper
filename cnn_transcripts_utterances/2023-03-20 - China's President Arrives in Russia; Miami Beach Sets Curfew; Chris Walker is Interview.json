This is such a significant meeting. And it comes just on the heels of President Putin going to Mariupol right after he visited Crimea and Rostov-on-Don. There is so much at stake here.

This time last, the Russian military had encircled that city and was bombing it from land, sea and air, destroying much of it. And I was interviewing residents who were fleeing, who describe spending weeks under bombardment, terrified, hiding in basements, burying neighbors who got killed by Russian artillery in the front yards of their apartment buildings. And I spoke to one of the women I met a year ago who escaped. She's living - she's a refugee overseas.

As you mentioned, the city leaders, they are expected to meet later today to decide whether or not to bring back that curfew that went into effect last night at midnight and was lifted at 6:00 in the morning. The city is going to decide whether or not to bring that back through the end of the week, as well as the weekend here. Now, there were two shootings here on Miami Beach. There was one on Friday night, and the other happened in the early morning hours on Sunday. Both of those shootings ended with one person dead. Now, in the shooting from Sunday, Miami Beach Police say that a 24- year-old man from Ft. Lauderdale was arrested and charged with first- degree murder. That is something that we have seen take place in years past. That is to say that a number of the folks that are causing all of this trouble are really people that live in south Florida. They're from Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach. And so a lot of this disorder is not being caused by folks that are coming in for spring break. Now, we heard from a few folks that were out here enjoying some of the time off, as well as a business owner, and here's what they told us. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It is the longest run that the Tigers have had since 1965. Another Cinderella team from New Jersey, Fairleigh Dickinson, wasn't supposed to be in the tournament at all, but they got in on a technicality. They took full advantage. The sixteenth seeded Knights pulled what is being called the greatest upset in tournament history, upsetting number one seed Purdue before a tight second round loss to Florida Atlantic last night. South Carolina's Furman University hit a game winning three-pointer with less than three seconds on the clock, leading the number 13 seed to upset Virginia, which was a number four seed, in just the first round. The Paladins fell to San Diego State also over the weekend.
