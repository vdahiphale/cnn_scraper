He is probably the only parent of a grad who will then hop a plane to Minnesota to headline a Republican dinner.There is a new development in what appears to be the over-jockeying to be his running mate. One lawmaker has now directly asked him to pick someone not believed to by anywhere near Trump's short list, and her name rhymes with schmicky schmaley. CNN's Steve Contorno has the latest on this. So this is like an unlikely pitch coming in the perhaps final weeks of Trump's selection process.",

Now, Norman was the only member of Congress to endorse Nikki Haley.And he said -- when it was his turn to talk to Trump, he said, \"I did tell him he ought to put Nikki on the ballot. That would unite the party more than anything. As Nikki told me, she said, you know, 'People can hate me. They can't hate my voters.'\" And this is coming as Nikki Haley continues to get a sizeable share of the electorate in these primaries long after she has dropped out of the race. But look, there has been little indication that Trump is considering Haley. The two can't even agree how to have a kumbaya. One side thinks that the other should come to the table first. The other side disagrees. Nikki Haley, herself, has yet to even endorse Trump, and that is quite different than the overt overtures that we have seen coming from some of these other Republican contenders for the job. Take a listen, for example, what J.D. Vance, the senator from Ohio, told Donald Trump Jr. last night on his podcast. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH):  I want to help your dad however I can. And so, certainly, if he asked me, I want to help him. My assumption is like this is a little bit of speculation and maybe it's a little bit real, but he'll make his decision. I'm sure that whoever he picks will be a good vice president. And I'll cross that bridge if I have to. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And he bided his time and he let it out at the precise moment it would do the most effective damage. You know, not only does make the prosecution look unprepared -- because as Joey said, they should have gotten this out first to avoid the shock value -- there's just a seedy nature to the other reason for the call. He's fighting with a 14-year-old child. What's 14? Seventh grade, eighth grade? I mean, has this guy never heard of call block? It's going to taint him to the jury. He wants to take a 14-year-old kid and report him or her to the Secret Service. Blanche has caught Mr. Cohen in lie upon lie upon lie. Now, it's kind of like fishing in a pond that stocked. You're guaranteed to get something. With Cohen, you're going to get lies. But this has really been a strong cross-examination and a strong couple of days for the defense.

Roughly one in three people who have maxed out are now behind on their bills. Now, part of this is high inflation, right? It's very -- life is very expensive right now. Housing, food, daycare, it adds up. And unfortunately, some people are turning to credit cards. Now, the Fed's solution is interest rates, but we also have a situation where credit card interest rates have almost never been higher -- 20.6 percent. Now, experts say there are some solutions -- some things you can do. One thing is if you have a lot of credit card debt you can apply for a zero percent balance transfer. That gives you time -- perhaps 21 months -- to pay down your principal without getting hit with high interest. You could also have a personal loan with lower interest rates. Another thing that would be ideal to do is to obviously make more money and lower your expenses. That, of course, is easier said than done, Kate.

He said that Scottie Scheffler was trying to pull into the entrance at Valhalla and, according to him, didn't realize that a police officer was trying to stop him, so he continued to advance with his car another 10 to 20 feet. According to Darlington, Scheffler said he didn't realize that it was a police officer that was trying to get his attention. And then, this escalated where Scheffler was brought out of the car, essentially put in handcuffs, and ultimately detained by police. Jeff Darlington said that he heard the officer say there's nothing you can do about it. He's detained. He's going to jail. It seems, at this point, like it was something of a misunderstanding. ESPN is also reporting that Scottie Scheffler wasn't combative, didn't raise his voice. It seemed like he just didn't realize what essentially was going on -- what he was being asked to do. But this is separate from a different report that's coming out now. The PGA Tour only saying that the start of the second round has been delayed because of a serious accident that occurred near the golf course. And we're starting to learn a little bit more about what that might be. There are reports that was a fatality that occurred near Valhalla that police are still sorting through.

And this was at Samuel Alito's house just days after that. Now, Alito put out a statement where he said, \"I had no involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag.\" This was a statement he emailed to the Times. He says, \"It was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor's use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.\" We did reach out to the Supreme Court, I should note, and did get no response from the Supreme Court on this overnight.

And civilians in the region are still trying desperately to flee as the fighting gets closer and closer to their homes. But our Nick Paton Walsh and his team saw firsthand just how dangerous finding safety has become there. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WALSH (voice-over):  When nightmares recur, they're often the same. Here they get worse. The border town of Vovchansk bearing the blunt horror of Moscow's race to take as much as they can in the weeks before Ukraine starts feeling American military help again. Every street, a flame. Russians deeper inside the town. Policeman Maxim (PH) is answering one of 35 calls from locals on Thursday to evacuate. The day before, three colleagues were injured.

They're joined by Maria, their mother, who can't hear the shelling or anything too well. Thousands evacuated since Russia invaded again around here five days ago. Why everyone has to leave is clear again as we drive out. As it is with almost every part of Ukraine Russia covets, just utter destruction. We head back in with another police unit who soon learn two of the houses they must rescue from are impossible to reach. As we wait, they hear a buzzing noise.",
