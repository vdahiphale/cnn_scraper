And you're looking out at the warm Gulf of water, Gulf of Mexico waters.And stepping into this and just feeling it to the touch. This is way, way beyond that bathtub feel we talked about when we describe a pleasant beach scene; it's more like a hot tub. It is above average. And that's literally fuel for hurricanes to strengthen and to form as well. Let me show you why this coastline is so susceptible. And I want to take you to the skies because we've got our drone here. And talented group of people behind these camera lens to by the way, just so much going on with this coastline. But I want you to see just how flat it actually is. I can actually walk out several 100 feet from where I'm standing and have water only up to my knees. It goes on for several 100 feet from here. So that shallow nature of the water makes this so susceptible to a storm surge of four to seven feet. That's the official forecast for this particular area. Clearwater Beach is just over my shoulder there. And if the drone goes higher in elevation, you'll see that the beach stretches for miles. And other graphics here, this is also very interesting to note. So four to seven feet for Tampa Bay, the Pinellas County region, but look at the rents, eight to 12 feet around the Cedar Key region. That is where we're concerned about all of that shallow water from the eastern Gulf of Mexico that you see behind me, that warm water is going to push up and pile up into that almost catcher's mitt type topography feature that we referenced to. So what you're looking at is storm surge potential. And this is also very important because you can see those shades of orange around the Tampa Bay that's four to seven feet, perhaps locally higher. And then along the intercostal, waterways, the barrier islands you can see yellows and oranges there as well. That's four to seven feet of inundation literally above, normally dry lands, including the Clearwater Beach area where we are currently located; this storm has got a trajectory towards the Big Bend. But again, we talk about the wobbles with the strengthening storms. Any deviation to the west, or any deviation to the east has major implications for such large population densities, including Tampa Bay, do not let your guard down, Boris.",

Question number one, when will Trump's Georgia trial be held the day that DA Fani Willis wanted, March 4?Well, that is now officially the start of the Federal Election trial. It's also one day before Super Tuesday, with primary scattered throughout and March 25. Taken, the timing is getting trickier. Number two, will Meadows get his federal court move? A judge has yet to issue his ruling after Trump's former chief of staff took the stand. And number three, will the former president be in Georgia next week? Arraignment is set for September 6. And last night one co-defendant entered in early not guilty plea. CNN's Evan Perez joins us now, Evan, a lot of moving parts here. Where do we start?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Rahel, that's a very crowded calendar. And as you pointed out, the judge in Washington, Judge Tanya Chutkan already chose March 4 as the day that her trial, the trial here in Washington is going to get started. And that's a day before Super Tuesday.And what we're looking at is given the prospect that the prosecution has said that their case is going to take you know, four to six weeks to present. That means that the former president is going to be sitting in a courtroom here in Washington, not on the campaign trail during those key periods there when other states are up for grabs. Other delegates are up for grabbing the Republican nomination. That's a huge imposition, obviously, on a political campaign. And the judge really addressed all of that saying that the public interest to have this matter resolved as soon as possible is really the thing that is driving her. She said from the bench that sending a child aid does not depend and should not depend on the defendants personal or professional obligations. And of course, you know, for the Trump team, they're also trying to figure out whether Mark Meadows succeeds in his effort to move his case out of state court in Georgia, to the federal courts. Because that decision, which the judge said could come at any point at any time, and will really have an impact not only on other defendants, there's four of them who have asked for their cases to be moved to federal court as well. But the Former President who hasn't made that request, we fully expect will do so, we saw his trial team in the courtroom yesterday in Atlanta. So they were closely watching and they watched as Mark Meadows stood on the stand for three hours really taking a risk answering questions, both from the prosecution and from his own team, answering questions that really I think every prosecutor is going to be paying attention to his words, given the fact that he was testifying before the Georgia officials have even been able to present their case against him, Rahel.",
