But this year, Vice President Harris is RSVPing? No, to the date with former President Trump on October 17th, and said -- she says she'll be campaigning in a battleground state. But Trump says he will show up, with or without Harris.Now, the dinner, it happens every year. It takes some special significance in presidential elections as a campaign stop where the candidates can show off some personality with jokes either at their opponent's expense or, of course, their own. It's a tradition that dates back to 1960, when then-nominees Richard Nixon and JFK attended. Kennedy went on to be the first Catholic elected as president. But nominees have skipped the dinner before, like Walter Mondale in 1984, saying that he needed to prepare for the upcoming debate, and history told us, of course, how that turned out. With me now is someone who has attended this dinner multiple times, former mayor of New York, Bill de Blasio. Mayor, thank you for joining us. I wonder, from your perspective, if it's a good idea, strategy wise, for Harris to skip this dinner, considering that some voters are still saying they don't know enough about her yet?",

I mean, this is a campaign that is firing all cylinders.I think it's a great opportunity to Al Smith Dinner to show the contrast in personalities and temperament and also for folks all across the country to get to know Kamala Harris a little bit better. It's also very important, I think, in the world of American Catholics, you know, 60 to 70 million Catholics in America. And I would say it's a community of the Democratic Party.

I think that contrast would really be powerful just a few weeks before the election and would say a lot to Americans about who Kamala Harris is and who Donald Trump is not.
