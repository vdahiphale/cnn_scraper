The Al-Kuwaiti hospital in the western part of the city reports at least four people were killed, more than two dozen wounded on Wednesday. The U.N. estimates nearly 79,000 people have fled Rafah since Monday. Meanwhile, the largest hospital in eastern Rafah has relocated to a makeshift facility in the central part of the city. Doctors say they have far less equipment, water, electricity and other vital supplies. And most of the doctors have left the city. Palestinian medical teams say they've discovered a third mass grave at the Al-Shifa hospital complex in Gaza City. In total, they report finding 520 bodies in seven mass graves at three different Gaza hospitals. Israel denies any involvement in the burials at Al-Shifa and says claims to the country are baseless and unfounded. The IDF says Hamas turned Al-Shifa into a terrorist stronghold, using civilians as human shields.

Turkey is obviously not an Arab state, so presumably not part of this group working directly with the Americans. But Turkey has pushed an idea that is very similar to the one, it seems, that President Biden is pushing as well. A sort of guarantor system is what Turkey has proposed, which would involve essentially once the dust settles, once there is some kind of an agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians, that effectively you would have Western countries serving as the guarantor of the Israelis to keep them in check, to make sure there are consequences for any violations of the agreement. And similarly, you would have Turkey and other Middle Eastern countries doing the same with the Palestinians to keep them in check and to make sure that promises are kept. At the moment, though, obviously, the Israeli plan, the last we heard from them about it in January, looks very, very different and looks a lot like the status quo of full Israeli control, at least over the Gaza Strip, Max.",

President Putin's own family affected by the siege of Leningrad. His two-year-old brother died in that siege.This is something that he talks about a lot. So the immense suffering of the Russian people is something that is not in historical dispute. And it is a huge part of the culture. This is not some kind of false fostering of patriotism that you see here. This matters a huge amount to the Russian people to hold these celebrations. But of course, for Putin, it is something that he has ramped up during his time as president. It's a critical part of his desire to project power, to project a sort of global relevance. Because, of course, when Russia played such a critical role in the Soviet Union as it was back then in defeating Nazi Germany and pushing out German forces all the way back to Berlin, it was seen as, you know, taking its place among the allies, among the victors in this war. And he is at this point with his attempts to conquer Ukraine again, trying to assume that same kind of global prominence. So we see another parallel there.

No one, as I say, disputes the role that the Soviet Union played in World War II. But I think there's another part of this this year, which is that Russia has suffered enormous casualties in Ukraine, by some estimates more than all of its post-war military campaigns combined. And this is why we see, for example, they are not holding a traditional march called the Immortal Regiment, where people would process holding photographs of relatives killed in World War Two, perhaps because of the unfavorable comparison with what's happening in Ukraine. Of course, security concerns is the official reason.

Don't forget, Russia continually claims that it is, quote, denazifying Ukraine without evidence. We did expect that anti-Western rhetoric. We then got into thinly veiled, I would say, nuclear threats, which fits with a recent pattern from Russia.

The fate of our motherland depends on every one of us. And on Victory Day, we realize this even more so. I think an effort to sort of build the sense of nobility, of the sacred fight that exists in Russia around World War II and that victory and conflate that with what's happening in Ukraine. And of course, we know the Russian people do need a lot of resilience because we are seeing Russia suffer significant losses on the battlefield in Ukraine, which is why this year, Victory Day is again slimmed down.
