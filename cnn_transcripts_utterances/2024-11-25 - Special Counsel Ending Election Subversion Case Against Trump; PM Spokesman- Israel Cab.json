      "sentences": "-- she will try to weaponize the Justice Department.And that's a big question, because that's something Trump made clear on the campaign trail, he wants to do that. He wants to go back after his political rivals and use the Justice Department to target people that he is unhappy with. That is, of course, not the way the Justice Department is supposed to work. But there are concerns that Pam Bondi, who comes to the office potentially with decades of law enforcement experience, there are questions about whether she can be impartial. Because she helps to amplify false claims about the election in 2020. So she's going to face some pretty tough questions about this idea of weaponizing the Justice Department at her confirmation hearing. And, of course, the number-two official at the Justice Department is one of Trump's top defense attorneys, Todd Blanche. He's also put some of his other attorneys in top positions at the Justice Department. So while today the Trump team is saying that they want to end the weaponization of the Justice Department, that is going to be a question that will linger over the Trump Justice Department, whether they really will put an end to that or whether they will try to weaponize that massive law enforcement agency. I also want to talk about something the representative touched on, and that is an anticipated report from the special counsel, Jack Smith. He is required to submit a report to the attorney general. I am told that the attorney general is expected to make that public, as he has with other special counsels reports. But I'm also told that because he has, of course, filed this indictment, the court has unsealed some other evidence in this case. We shouldn't expect a lot of new evidence in that report. So we do have much of the evidence in the case that's in the public record. The one place where we could potentially get some new information from Jack Smith is if he is called to the Hill to testify as the special counsel's before him, have all done.",

He is expected to release this report, as he has done with other special counsel reports, from John Durham and Special Counsel Rob Her, who investigated President Biden. But again, I've been cautioned that there may not be a lot of new information here because, of course, there's already been an indictment that's been filed. And then, of course, the judge in this case revealed -- allowed to be revealed some additional evidence in this case. So I'm told there won't be a lot of new in that report, but it is still expected. It is required of a special counsel to submit that report.",

It's a 60-day ceasefire.What Israel wants is the right to respond and strike back at Hezbollah if they break the terms of that deal. The fact that the atmosphere, the military atmosphere is really heating up, the home front command here may put in even more restrictions close to the border because they expect an uptick in rocket fire, and is absolutely symptomatic of a deal coming into land. We know that the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing cabinet member, Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national security minister, he said today that his advice to the prime minister was: \"Don't sign the ceasefire deal now. You've got Hezbollah on the run. Continue to smash them, continue, continue, continue.\" His words. But we also understand that Netanyahu will be meeting with his party, his coalition party groups, individually. That will include Ben-Gvir's group. And that's where he would hope to persuade them of his opinion. I think the expectation is, when that vote comes tomorrow afternoon, it is going to go through.",

You don't have hostages included. Biden is pushing it very hard on his end. This is the one win that the Biden administration could get before the end of his term. And as -- and in general, Israel has already decimated Hezbollah significantly, not to the point of eradication. But we don't want to underestimate the extent to which they've killed off those leaders and how much that weakens them. So in order for them to be able to focus on Gaza, I do think there's interest on both sides to make this deal happen. And I think that there's real hope there.",

The E.U. has said that they will respect the ICC's jurisdiction, which means that if Gallant or Netanyahu were to travel to Europe, they would be arrested. Some members have -- have rejected that. Like, for example, Viktor Orban of Hungary, the prime minister there, has said, no, he wouldn't. The U.S. has made a statement that -- that these -- that not only do the ICC arrests bear no jurisdiction in the United States because the U.S. is not a member of the ICC, but they reject it altogether. And there are many reasons for that. And that has -- by the way, that's something that's transcended among both administrations. A lot of the ICC and their jurisdiction because they have typically targeted Israel, in particular, and the United States as well. Otherwise, by the way, you would see arrest warrants for -- for the Sudanese leaders dealing -- leading the humanitarian crisis and war there. And so I don't expect those warrants, on one hand, to be carried out unless the -- unless Gallant and Netanyahu travel to Europe. But on the other hand, it undermines the credibility of the ICC. It's -- it's not totally symbolic. It is important. But I also don't expect the arrest to be carried out.",

      "sentences": "That's exactly right. They are asking to dismiss the federal classified documents case against President-Elect Trump.But they are going to continue the case, which is currently being appealed against his two co-defendants. Because, as you may remember, Judge Aileen Cannon, the Trump-appointed federal judge who is overseeing this case, tossed the classified documents case, siding with defense attorneys who said that special counsel, Jack Smith, was improperly appointed. So this was a pending appeal before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. Jack Smith is saying they are going to stop the case against Trump, but they will continue with this appeal as it pertains to his two co-defendants. So the case lives. But the Trump part is being removed because, as president-elect, the special counsel's office believes he is entitled to the same protections from indictment from prosecution as a sitting president. But this is going to be an interesting question for the incoming Justice Department. Because if they decide to either pardon the two co-defendants or toss the case, you will have this decision, this precedent sitting out there from Judge Aileen Cannon saying that the special counsel was improperly appointed, something that really shocked most legal experts and even most federal attorneys that I spoke with. And it is expected that Trump's Justice Department may want to avail themselves of appointing special counsels to look into certain matters. So it's going to be really interesting to see how they handle what remains of this case. And this is part of the complexity, the Jack Smith was facing after Trump was reelected. As we reported a few weeks ago, the special counsel's office and the Justice Department, they needed to -- to get together and really discuss the mechanics of what to do. Because, of course, these cases don't just involve the president elect. You also, in the Mar-a-Lago case, you have these two co- defendants. So after these conversations between top leaders of the Justice Department and the special counsel, you can see they've decided to completely toss the D.C. case, the election subversion case, against Trump, dismissed Trump's part of the classified documents case. But they say they're going to continue with those two co-defendants. And it'll be interesting to see how that progresses and what the Trump Justice Department decides to do in that case. Because either they continue to prosecute two Trump associates or they kind of undermine the legitimacy of special counsels that they may want to appoint.",

Trump faced four criminal cases, two at the state level, one in New York, one in Georgia, and these two federal cases from Jack Smith.The federal cases are being dismissed here. Jack Smith wants them to be dismissed because he knows, one, internal justice formal guidance says he can't really proceed with them now that Trump is president- elect. Even if he did proceed, he knows, once Trump gets into office, he can either pardon himself or have his attorney general dismiss Jack Smith and cases. The state cases are different. While Trump is protected from some proceedings at the state level, it doesn't mean that the cases go away. They're sort of in limbo. So in New York right now, we're waiting for the judge to weigh in on the state of that case. But Trump, even as president, he has no power to make those cases go away. Instead, right now, he's asking his lawyers to kind of litigate and make them go away. Unclear what will happen in New York. And the Georgia case is sort of the same. There's this outstanding question of whether the D.A. down there, Fani Willis, has to be removed from the case because of her involvement with the top prosecutor on that case, Nathan Wade. That's an open question. So I would describe both of those cases against him as being in limbo. They can't proceed while he's president-elect, but he also can't make them go away like he can with federal cases.",
