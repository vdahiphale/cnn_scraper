Officials say the clerk thought she was correcting duplicate bookings and removed two holds on Mason's file. Two employees have been fired for allowing him to go free. Now, the sheriff admits chronic understaffing is part of the problem, saying, quote, they're underpaid. That's not an excuse, but it's a fact. Now they're scrambling to locate Mason.

But this year, Kevin McCarthy did not invite Zelenskyy to address the House. He will meet with McCarthy, though, I should note, behind closed doors.Here's what the House speaker said in March of last year versus just this week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA) (March 10, 2022): This is an unwarranted war that they did not ask for, but they're willing to defend the right of freedom. We should stand with anyone who's willing to defend freedom. I think that room's divided to defend and help Ukraine get the weaponry they need to defend themselves. MCCARTHY (September 19, 2023): Is Zelenskyy elected to Congress? Is he our president? I don't think I have to commit anything. I have questions for him.

But this is not the way to do it.Supporting Ukraine is essential to freedom in the rest of the world. If Russia is not stopped in Ukraine, Russia moves into Europe -- Putin's already said that -- and threatens other parts of the world, too, which is why it's so important the NATO is - the NATO alliance is growing stronger and is even talking about expanding in some ways to Asia and why it's so important that the Biden administration is shoring up other parts of the world. So, let's start there. The funding is the right thing to do. And the hypocrisy of all these people who supported it five minutes ago and now don't is just rich. In this case, what I hope happens is, there are small meetings, no need for a big clown show in the House, sadly. I served there for nine terms, but it is a different place. No need for that. Small meetings, I know, because I've talked to them, that Republican chairs of major committees in the House support increased funding, as does the Senate, starting with Mitch McConnell. So, I hope that there is a compromise, something like aid for Ukraine, maybe more border aid, maybe a CR or a budget, I imagine a CR, and the establishment of a fiscal commission, much like Simpson-Bowles, in anyone remembers that from days' past --",

I think his Tony Blinken and he and Jake Sullivan all have explained why U.S. engagement matters. And he's walking the walk. I mean he has helped to revive NATO. I mean Ukraine was - was the impetus for that.But NATO is now a strong and modern defense alliance and we are a key part of it. We pay about 50 percent of the funding for NATO's operations in Ukraine. And I hope the other countries will step up more. I agree with Donald Trump about that. Might be one of the few things I agree with him about, but - but, hey. But I think Biden's selling it well.

Let's understand that we were the first country in 1948 to recognize the existence of a pluralist democracy and homeland for the Jews in the Middle East. And I think all of us appreciate that. And there's been strong bipartisan support for Israel forever.Certain moves of his administration are troubling, certainly to me, personally. I think maintaining the pluralist democracy is central to Israel's future. And the good news there, if there is some, is that there are protesters every weekend. Hundreds of thousands of protesters protesting peacefully in the country. That is some evidence of a democracy. But, at any rate, I think that the future here is to keep the relationship, quietly coax Bibi to perhaps change a few directions. But also, if this deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel ever happens, there will be some requirements. Certainly I think there will be. On both sides, but on the Saudi side and on the Arab side, Israel will have to find a way to take active steps to promote a Palestinian state. I'm not applauding the leadership of the Palestinian Authority. I think it is corrupt and needs - I would hope they would change to something more modern and democratic. But over time the two-state solution is the best protection for Israel. And I think Bibi's far- right government is not open to that. So maybe, just maybe, that coalition will change in Israel, coalition will change in the Palestinian Authority, and some more steps will be taken by the Arab neighbors and there will be a more peaceful region. And I think that's Biden's vision. Our policy is to support a two-state solution. It still is. And I think that's the right policy.",
