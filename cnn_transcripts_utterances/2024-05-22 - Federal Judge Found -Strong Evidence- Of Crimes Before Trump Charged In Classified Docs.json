And they're part of a pile of requests that the defense teams, Donald Trump and his co- defendants, Walt Nauta, Carlos De Oliveira, have made to Judge Aileen Cannon. She's working through them. There's a backlog of them.   But one of them that is going to end up being a major issue that shehas to figure out before trial is whether the testimony from Donald Trump's former lawyer, Evan Corcoran, can be part of this case. He basically said Trump misled him and didn't give him all the - didn't give him access to all the classified documents when they had to turn everything over to the federal government. Thus, that's the obstruction case primarily against Donald Trump. Judge Beryl Howell had looked at this issue a while ago with Evan Corcoran and said, yes, actually, it looks like there could be evidence of a crime here. One of the things that was part of her analysis, she looked at a bunch of evidence. This is before Donald Trump was charged. And she noted that even after the FBI scoured Mar-a-Lago for classified records, finding hundreds of marked documents, ultimately charging about 21 from that collection, the team for Donald Trump found four additional classified records at Mar-a-Lago, as well as an empty folder and a, quote, \"mostly empty folder marked classified evening summary\" found in Donald Trump's bedroom. Judge Howell wrote at the time, months ago, notably no excuse is provided as to how the former president could miss the classified marked documents found in his own bedroom at Mar-a-Lago. Thus, he gave prosecutors access to his former attorney. That's all going to be revisited quite a bit in this case coming forward.",

And so he was given that opportunity, it looks like, to cooperate in lieu of being prosecuted. But I don't see any evidence, nor am I familiar with any tactic to vindictively prosecute someone because they don't cooperate.

She essentially used that as justification to allow the prosecution to extract evidence from Evan Corcoran, a former attorney for Donald Trump that the prosecution argues he used as a front man, essentially, even blocking some of the information that was held at Mar-a-Lago from his own attorney, according to the prosecution.

And my sense is neither side really wants a ceasefire at this point. Bibi wants to continue the Rafah attack and otherwise prosecute the war to its conclusion in his view. And I think Hamas thinks that Netanyahu is stepping into a trap in Rafah, and they're seeing all this isolation that Israel is experiencing and thinking that the war is going in their favor.
