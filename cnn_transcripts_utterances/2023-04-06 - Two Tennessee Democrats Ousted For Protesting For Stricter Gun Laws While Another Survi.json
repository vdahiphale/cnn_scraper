The people back here are the reason, they're standing here. It is because the legislators are coming out of the door now of the legislative chamber and they are responding to what they saw, any possibility of bias, but so far everything has been peaceful. I don't know if you can see, there are people playing dead lined down right here. With signs like, \"The people are watching you.\" And \"Fighting fascism is a moral obligation.\" These people are very angry. And all day long, there have been hundreds of people outside and inside the Legislature Building at the capital. There are like 250 people inside who are now leaving. They are coming out here. Basically in a nutshell, there is one of the legislators coming out right now. But that in a nutshell, this is a political story and here is the man who was just expelled. This is Justin Pearson, I don't know if you can see him. But Justin Pearson is now walking out to talk to the people. Let me see if I can word from him. Representative Pearson, how do you feel what -- sir, how do you feel right now, sir? He is not talking right now. Let's see if we can get a word. Mr. Representative, how do you feel right now? How do you feel right now, sir? It's pretty chaotic as you can see. I'm going to get back towards our camera. It's a chaotic scene. But to put this on a non-political nutshell, these people have been expelled from the House of Representatives because they talked out of turn last week, seven days ago. They've walked out of turn. They are not allowed to walk into the well of the House of Representatives without permission from the Speaker of the House. They did that to protest this, and they also talked out of turn, and one week later, they're expelled. Listen to what people are saying. \"No justice. No peace.\" Take a look.

But, according to -- talking about Tennessee law, if he decides to run again, and he wins again, he can't be charged on the same counts again. That's what's interesting. It's double jeopardy. If the constituency decides to elect you again, you can't be expelled again on this charge, however, they could find other charges to expel him. That doesn't mean he wouldn't be expelled again, he just can't be expelled of this charge of disorderly behavior. That's what the Republicans are saying. He could have disorderly behavior. These people just said they wanted to get their words across about the gun issue, and they weren't being allowed to talk, and that's why they walked into the well. That's why they talked in order to get their words out that the constituents wanted them to say, that's what they say, and they weren't being permitted to do so. What's remarkable about this, Anderson, it was only one week ago, when other people here were expelled from this legislature. We know of only three cases since 1866 and we think because of crimes or issues of bad morality. There has never been an issue where it is breaking a rule. Now, I've come to a lot of State Legislatures in my career, 40 years, people break rules all the time, that don't get them expelled. This is very unusual. The Republicans we talked to said it is necessary, because it disrupted the House of Representatives here, but that being said, it is most unusual.",

You know, you talked before about the generational transition. In many of these States, the generational transition and the racial transition are completely overlapping. They are essentially the same thing. I mean, if you talk about places like Florida, or Georgia, or Texas or Tennessee, or Arizona before they elected a Governor, places where the preemption has been most powerful, generally speaking, you have a Republican coalition that is rooted in the older generations that are predominantly White in those states, and a Democratic coalition that is rooted in the increasingly diverse younger generations in those States. And what we see not only on preemption, but on issues like LGBTQ rights, and voting and abortion bans and book bans and classroom censorship, you see these Republican coalitions moving to impose on their States the values of their older, White, predominantly Christian coalition, before this demographic change, possibly alters the balance of political power in their States.

And what we have seen since 2020, with the support of the majority on the Supreme Court is States moving across a whole series of fronts, like I said, LGBTQ rights, free speech rights in the classroom, voting rights, abortion rights, to roll that back and set their own rules on civil rights and civil liberties. And this, I think, is just a powerful symbol of the way in which the Red States are departing from what had been kind of a centralized notion that there was a baseline of rights available to all Americans.

When we were listening to it today, there is a possibility they could have stayed if they did that. But it's clear that these three representatives were not planning to be contrite. They were asked several times during the hearing, do you think you did wrong? Do you think you did wrong? And they said, yes. Stepping into the well is against the rules.

And that investigation is premised on the huge volumes of fact about the insurrection, about Trump's role inseditiously, trying to stop the peaceful transfer of power to the next President of the United States. That case itself, there is a record like the Senate Watergate Committee developed a record that led to the impeachment and the likely conviction in the Senate and eventual resignation of Richard Nixon.
