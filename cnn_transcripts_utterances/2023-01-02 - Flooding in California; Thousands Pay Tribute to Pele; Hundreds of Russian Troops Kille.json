I don't know if you can hear it, but there is a very low, light samba that the Santos football club put on to accompany the moment. But it's - it's remarkable to see this going on inside a stadium which, of course, we think of a soccer stadium as a cheerful atmosphere, as people chanting and singing. Well, now, nobody is really screaming, nobody - nobody is even talking loud. Everybody is very silent and is - the multitude are walking by the casket. They are just paying their respect as silently and most solemnly as possible. We're really witnessing history here (INAUDIBLE) because, you know, we talk about soccer being just a game, but, well, perhaps nobody more than Pele showed the outreach that this game has all over the world. He was truly an ambassador for this country, for Brazil. He was truly an ambassador for the game. And he had a stance in the 20th and 21st century than really transcended world soccer. I think we're really seeing an icon leaving us. Jim. Erica.",

Ukraine's military claims some 400 Russian soldiers were killed, another 300 injured. CNN cannot independently confirm those numbers. The Russians put the death toll at 63.[09:45:01] Here with me now, CNN military analyst, retired Major General James \"Spider\" Marks. General, Happy New Year to you.

I'm not certain where the ammo supply point was specifically, but what Ukraine has been able to do quite effectively is engage Russian forces one-on-one in tactical fights. What has been increasing in their capability is their ability to conduct long-range fighters and then to synchronize that with activities on the ground. That's, you know, creating this bubble of synchronization, this air/land battle space and be able to achieve effects on the ground.
