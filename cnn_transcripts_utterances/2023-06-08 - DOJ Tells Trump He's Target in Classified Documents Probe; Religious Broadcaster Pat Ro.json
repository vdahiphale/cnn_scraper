We are waiting to see if there is any movement from two federal grand juries. Why? The Justice Department has officially notified Trump's legal team that he is a target in an ongoing federal investigation.It is the clearest sign that we have seen yet that former President Trump could be indicted accused of failing to turn over classified documents. The former president Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in the probe. He says he declassified the documents while he was still in office. In an interview with \"New York Times\" Wednesday, Trump said he was not told he'd be indicted. But the decision to tell the former president that he is a targeted in the investigation does show Special Counsel Jack Smith is focused on the former president's actions and not just the actions of the people around him. CNN's senior crime and justice reporter Katelynn Polantz is here with us as well as CNN senior justice correspondent Evan Perez. We're going to start with you, evan. This new information that is sent to Donald Trump's lawyers, does that mean that an indictment is imminent or not?",

We've never been in a position where a former president could be facing an indictment, could be facing criminal charges. And it really just, you know, the word unprecedented and the word momentous, I think, you know, gets overused but this is definitely one of those times where it's appropriate to use that word. The former president is looking down at a number of possible charges. Of course the Justice Department laid out some of those possible charges in the documents when they -- when they released those documents about the search at Mar-a-Lago last August. That includes the mishandling, the illegal retention of national security -- national defense information, obstruction of justice. Those are among the possible charges that we're looking at. And the fact is that for the Justice Department to provide that notification, which prosecutors can do, they don't necessarily have to do it, but they do it out of an abundance of caution in case there's something that a defendant wants to present.",

It is a notification from the Justice Department that your client is -- that the Justice Department has substantial evidence linking your client to a crime. That they are the primary focus of an investigation. That's far beyond well, you know, you got pulled into an investigation we were working on and we might have some evidence linking you.It's quite significant and it's very pointed. And so it's also a sign that the Justice Department is at least thinking about charges, and look, wink-wink, odds are that charges are coming.

So even if there's a vote for an indictment, that has to be affirmed by the DOJ itself.So essentially once the indictment is unsealed, we will know specifically the charges, whether it relates to the actual classified information itself or more of the obstruction piece of things, or both. And really I think the most interesting part might be whether there's any sort of conspiracy allegations as well. So ultimately when we get that information we'll know where they're bringing the case, the venue, and the nature of the charges maybe not all the specific evidence underlying that but that's dependent on how they decide to issue that indictment.",

Number two, with respect to documents, Mark Meadows was one of the president's or the White House's representatives to the National Archives. Every conversation in which the National Archives conveyed that as of the moment the next president is sworn in, those documents are no longer yours, they belong to the American people, that would speak to possibly the president's intent with respect to possessing the documents or maybe even an obstruction of justice charge. In general if you're being investigated and people around you are talking to law enforcement, you've got a problem.

There are no standing meetings or calls, a common feature of large defense teams handling complex matters on behalf of a single client, to provide updates or compare notes among the groups.\"I think we've become accustomed to chaos within Trump world but when it's within your legal team and you might be facing federal indictment, how much of a problem is that?",

Now setting aside the question of whether the president has an incentive in pleading guilty to a crime, it's an important question for anyone facing potentially law enforcement exposure to face.You know, do you plead to a misdemeanor, do you agree to never run for office again. All of those questions are entirely fair ones for a legal team to sort out. And if they're fighting about questions like that, they're really going to have big problems down the road.

You're getting some of the low-level ozone that's also coming off of the ground in addition to all that particulate. So that's probably the worst time of day. Masks can be helpful. They've got to be good high-quality masks. They have to be fitting properly on your face. But, you know, when you look at N-95s, they came really -- their design came from the environmental world so, you know, they can be very effective if they're worn properly here. Think about the air quality inside as well. This is going to sound familiar. But, you know, I mean, one thing the pandemic has taught us is that we have to improve the filtration of our air inside. More air exchanges that can be really helpful. I will say, if you have asthma, this is one of those times people typically have rescue inhalers to rescue them if they're having an attack. This might be one of those times to take it before you go outside if they have to go outside. Talk to your doctor but about 15 minutes ahead of time could be really helpful.",
