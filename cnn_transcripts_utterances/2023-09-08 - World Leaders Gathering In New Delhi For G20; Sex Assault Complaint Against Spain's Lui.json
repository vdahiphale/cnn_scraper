      "sentences": "I'm Becky Anderson live from Abu Dhabi. This is CONNECT THE WORLD, 06Coming up this hour, a new sexual assault complaint against Spain's Luis Rubiales. World leaders gather in New Delhi for the annual G20 meeting. Tough operation to rescue an American trapped in a Turkish cave could begin on Saturday. And Hurricane Lee strengthens to a powerful Category 5 storm. Well, the suspended president of Spain's Football Federation is now facing a federal case for alleged sexual assault and coercion. Spain's national prosecutor has filed a complaint against Luis Rubiales over that unwanted kiss after Spain won the women's World Cup final. Rubiales has refused to resign over the controversy. More on that a little later this hour. Well, leaders from the world's richest and most powerful countries are starting to gather in New Delhi for the annual G20 summit this weekend. U.S. President Joe Biden meeting ahead of the event with the Prime Minister Narendra Modi for one-on-one talks that's happening this hour. Notably absent from this year's summit is Russian President Vladimir Putin. He is sending his foreign minister instead. Mr. Putin has an international arrest warrant hanging over him, and leaving Russia is risky. Chinese President Xi Jinping, who commands the world's second largest economy, also deciding not to go. That did come as a surprise considering Mr. Xi has never missed a summit since taking power in 2012. No official explanation for his absence was given. For more on this, let's bring in CNN's Jeremy Diamond and Ivan Watson, who is on the sidelines of the summit. Jeremy, let's start with you and the U.S. President who has arrived in New Delhi. What is Biden bringing to G20 this year?",

      "sentences": "Well, this year at the G20, President Biden is really looking to focus on what the U.S. can do fordeveloping countries. And it's a message that he is coming to not only with words, but also with actions proposing a series of reforms to these multilateral development banks such as the World Bank. And also coming with promises of more funding injecting -- plans to inject $3 billion of funding for the World Bank if Congress authorizes that, which would provide the World Bank with $25 billion in total new lending capacity. The President also hoping to bring that to $100 billion of new lending capacity if, as the President expects, other countries come on board with the United States. And this is a message that U.S. officials privately tell me that they believe will be amplified and will be even more potent as President Biden delivers it here at the G20, while Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, is absent from this summit. And that's because China, of course, has been presenting itself as a handout for the developing world with its One Road One Belt Initiative. And the U.S. is saying here is a no strings attached option, with additional funding from the World Bank, with a focus on low as well as middle income countries here. But there's no question that even though Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin are not attending this summit in person, the fractures within the G20, the divisions in particular over the war in Ukraine, will continue. And they will continue in the form of whether or not these G20 leaders are indeed able to come up with a joint communique. Last year at the G20 in Bali, they were unable to do so instead settling for a leader's statement which made very clear that there are divisions within the G20 over the war in Ukraine, not only because Russia is a member. China, which has refused to condemn Russia's invasion, but also India, another country that has yet to actually formally condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine and which has also refused to sign onto a series of Western led sanctions. So how this all ends will be interesting to see. But we do know that U.S. diplomats have been working with their counterparts over the course of the last week to try and craft language that would be appealing and that would be suitable to all of those G20 members.",

There have been smaller meetings going on all across the country, all throughout the year that India has held the rotating presidency of the G20. And Narendra Modi has been using this as chance to kind of promote India on the global stage, but also here at home to promote himself. Everywhere you go in New Delhi right now, you will see a picture, a portrait of the Indian prime minister with a quote next to it. I mean, it's pretty striking how many images of this leader there are in this city. When it comes to the issue of the Global South, developing countries, poorer countries, Modi and his government, they say they want to champion their causes and their voices at this meeting of global heads of state.

Of course, Xi Jinping is not here. He pulled out at the last minute. The Chinese government never provided an explanation, really, for why. Xi Jinping has been saying he wants to recreate the world order that has been U.S.-led since the end of World War II. He did attend the BRICS summit in South Africa, but he has not been here, leading to all sorts of speculation why? Could it be because of tensions between China and the U.S.? Could it be because of tensions between China and India? Recall that they fought deadly border skirmishes in the Himalayas in 2020, and that relationship is rocky, to say the least? Or could it be because of problems at home within China? We simply do not know because of the opaque nature of the Chinese government. So these are all issues here. Throughout the course of the previous meetings that India has hosted throughout this G20 year, there have also not been joint communiques put forward. And that's why there are questions. Can these leaders reach consensus here? One final point I do want to raise is that as European leaders have come in here, Becky, to the Indian capital, one by one, they've been saying that they want Ukraine to be the war and Russia's invasion of Ukraine to be front and center at this meeting. And that, of course, is something that has kept Russia's leader Vladimir Putin away from attending now for the second year in a row, a G20. And it may have been a contributing factor to China's leader not attending either.",

And in this clip, you see the impact of the black rain from the perspective of a resident rain water seeping into the stairway of an apartment building after the street is flooded outside. And in this final video, a dramatic rescue. A person had to be taken out of a partially submerged vehicle by Hong Kong firefighters. Heavy rain also reported in southern China, including the megacity of Shenzhen. We have learned that authority is there, planted discharge excess water from its reservoir on Friday, and that could potentially worsen the flooding situation in northern Hong Kong, including the northern New Territories.

That launch in April ended in an explosion or what SpaceX called a rapid unscheduled disassembly blamed on engine failures. And a base on the moon may be looking a bit more like pie in the sky unless NASA can get control of its wallet. U.S. government's watchdog says the space agency's massive rocket designed to take its Artemis program to the moon is just plain unaffordable. A newly released report admits that even senior NASA officials say the cost of the rocket isn't sustainable. They've spent $12 billion developing it so far. It's just space news. We like a bit of space news here on CONNECT THE WORLD. In sport and in Spain, the new season of top tier women's football is supposed to start this weekend. But instead players are going on a strike, a two-week strike over pay. Of course, this comes at a volatile time. The president of the Spanish Football Federation was suspended after kissing player Jenni Hermoso on the mouth at the World Cup, which her team won. Amanda Davis joins me now. I mean, the Spanish football leaders will just feel like they can't catch a break, but Luis Rubiales back in the news today. Just get us up to speed on where we are at with that.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Becky. This is meant to be the weekend that we were celebrating and Spanish football fans had theopportunity to celebrate their historic first ever women's World Cup winning side, with the players returning to domestic action for the first time. But once again, they are being overshadowed by the fight for equality and all these headlines of unfair treatment. We've got the strike because the players are not getting the money they feel they deserve. Their unions, the players unions have said that all they want is fair and just treatment of their superstars. To put it into context, the minimum salary for a women's player in the Spanish professional leagues is $17,000. That is not a week, that is a year, $17,000. The minimum pay for a man playing professional football in Spain is $197,000. They just want a couple of thousand extra. They're aiming for $24,600 -- million, 24.6, it should be million. And a lot of them would be going for the millions, but they want $24,600 minimum a year. And the negotiations have fallen apart. So, the players aren't taking to the pitch. And this is coming on the same day that, as you rightly say, that the Spanish prosecutors have said that. They are going to investigate those criminal charges against Luis Rubiales. So, once again, it's not the football, it's not the players that we're talking about for the right reason.",
