The rebel leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, was the Kremlin stopped Caterer before he threw kitchen apron. He now wears military fatigues as the head of the shadowy Wagner Group, which has provided mercenaries for conflicts in Africa and the Middle East, and most recently has been a key player in Russia's war against Ukraine.According to statements from the Russian government, the criminal case against Prigozhin was dropped yesterday after he agreed to leave Russia and go to Belarus. For more, let me bring in CNN's Nic Robertson in London. Nic, Lukashenko, the ruler of Belarus's role here is quite extraordinary. The very junior partner negotiating for Russia to save Putin from a possible assault on Moscow. What do you know about whether Prigozhin is -- has he actually gotten to Belarus?",

Lukashenko has a 20-year history of knowing Prigozhin, and it's part based on that knowledge of each other that he stepped in to help here. But I think the best analysis has to be that Lukashenko, who is, as you say, a weaker partner to Putin, Putin stepped in and helped him out in those elections in 2020, which were widely regarded as fraudulent, where there were big crowds on the streets to overthrow Lukashenko, he asked Putin for help. Putin stepped in.Lukashenko in Belarus have become a base for Putin's war in Ukraine to the south. So he is very much the junior partner. He is unlikely to have gone out on a limb and helped Prigozhin here. Equally, when you look at Prigozhin leaving Rostov-on-Don last night to the cheers of crowds and with all that heavy modern military equipment, getting to walk away with it, not just saving his own skin earlier in the day, the president has said what he was doing was treasonous. Putin dislikes people who aren't loyal to him, and this was the ultimate tact of disloyalty. Yet Prigozhin seems to have had -- seems to have had leverage in this deal because he was able to walk away, save his life, ostensibly go to Belarus, and take much of his military hardware with him. And I think it really doesn't pass the sniff test so far, inasmuch as we don't know the details and Prigozhin has utterly disappeared. What kind of deal is this? And has he got some of what he wanted out of it, which is replacing Russia's defense minister. Even that isn't clear at the moment.",

In 2000 and years in power he has not based this kind of challenge to his monopoly on political action and his monopoly on violence. So it can be underestimated. Granted, it is a coup that failed, and most coups fail. And another important thing is that Prigozhin never said that he was going up against the president. His march was to the president.He very much sort of maintains this narrative that if the president is doing something that he doesn't support, that the people don't like, the people that he claims to represent, then it's because the president doesn't have the right information.

One was that the Defense Minister, Shoigu, wanted to become a marshal. You know, he wanted to raise his rank.And the other reason was that lots of Russian elites had made money from the occupation of eastern Ukraine from Donbas since 2014, and now they wanted to make more money. In other words, he was saying, this is purely self-interest, this is purely greed. There was no reason to fight this war. And he accompanied that by saying, you know, how badly Russian soldiers had been treated, how many had died unnecessarily. I mean, this was really undermining the entire narrative of the war and really the entire narrative of the invasion of Ukraine going back to 2014. I think it put him in tune with the Russian army in a way that maybe the Russian military leadership is not. And, that, you know, he wasn't talking about imperialism or Peter the Great or some kind of idea about, you know, Russia's special role or Christianity. You know, he was talking about, you aren't giving us enough weapons, you aren't letting us fight. And he, you know, he -- I think this was the reason why so many soldiers seemed at least initially, prepared to support him. I mean, to me, the extraordinary moment yesterday after that comment was when he was sitting in the courtyard in Rostov with the leaders of the Southern Military District kind of chatting away, and they seemed very happy that he was there and nobody was trying to arrest him or take him away. So he had some kind of rapport, and he had some kind of -- you know, he had some kind of ability to impress the army. I mean, the question now is whether any of that will be retained.",

The only -- the only guess I can have is he was -- you know, this is a mercenary. He wanted his money, you know, his contract was over July the first, and they offered to pay him off. That's one possibility. The other possibility is that maybe he expected more inside support than he got.Maybe he had some expectation of somebody being there in Moscow to welcome him. That didn't, you know, that didn't materialize. But I really don't think we're going to fully understand yesterday's events for some days or maybe even weeks.",

He was in the streets of Rostov.I wouldn't put too much stock into his undermining. The rationale for the war narrative. There are many rationales for the war. Totalitarian propaganda actually works. By creating a cacophony. I don't think he's pierced the propaganda bubble, but what he has done is he's tapped into a deep well of resentment, especially within the military, which feels like it's been mistreated, misused, like bosses are corrupt, which is a fact. And so -- you know, that deep Russian sense of we're being screwed over by our bosses and everybody is corrupt, that's what he's talking to. And that's, I think, why we saw him sort of chatting in a friendly manner with the Deputy Minister of Defense in that Rostov courtyard. And why also, he got not, you know, there weren't thousands in the streets in Rostov, but the people who came out came out to say thank you or to applaud Prigozhin's troops. I also want to say that, you know, every coup is a game of chicken. And I think that he tried to march to Moscow. At a certain point, it was probably becoming clear to him that he wasn't going to get to Moscow alive. And that's when he turned around. I don't think there's a whole lot of sort of untangle there.

He called this an armed rebellion. He called this an act of betrayal. He compared it to the Bolshevik Revolution. And then he negotiated with the guy. And gave in and gave him seemingly has given him asylum him in Belarus. So to me, it seemed to suggest that when faced with a real threat, you know, Putin climbed down that -- that one should, you know, one shouldn't worry too much about Putin being willing to climb down in Ukraine and find himself a face-saving excuse, because when confronted with force, he found a way to back down.",

There have been a number of moments in the last several years, and also even in the last year and a half, when faced with something stronger, Putin steps back. He retracts, and then he just changes the story and makes up a new one. You know, as you said in the morning, Prigozhin is a traitor. He's starting a civil war. In the afternoon, we forgive him, and he's moving to Minsk, maybe.We've seen this in a number of other moments. I mean, there was an interesting moment in 2014 when the Russian Army tried to using kind of saboteurs and provocateurs, tried to take more cities in Ukraine. Wherever they were met with force, they stepped down and moved back. And so, you know, we may well have overrated his -- his toughness. We may have overrated, you know, his ability to push things through to the bitter end.

In this most recent invasion, it's because the army wasn't fighting hard enough. And so he gets the Chechens and then he gets the Wagner Group.
