Volunteers listened to audio clips while having their brains scanned by an fMRI machine. Over time, AI algorithms, the very same tech that`s behind ChatGPT, were able to figure out what the volunteers were listening to just by watching their brains. (On camera): It is just crazy. You can watch how blood flows through the brain. And using AI and GPT and everything else translated into words?",

So onthe left side is the actual words that I heard. When she had finished her meal and was about to go back to the road of yellow brick, she was startled to hear a deep groan nearby. And the decoded version of this is on the right. I was about to head back to school and I hear this strange voice calling out to me. So it gets some things right. So this like, was about to go back, was about to head back. It completely misses some things like the road of yellow brick versus school, but then it gets this nice kind of example. So she hears something and then instead of a deep groan nearby, it said a strange voice calling out to me. That means something related, even if it`s not exactly the right words. O`SULLIVAN:  Still pretty incredible to think that was about to head back as something that. Just by scanning your brain.",

GPT basically made our predictions a lot better. O`SULLIVAN:  But it doesn`t just work listening to audio. Professor Huth showed us what happened when he watched a movie with no sound while his brain was scanned. Watch as the technology is able to decode what his eyes are seeing.",
