I point this out because it's a long persecuted community in Iraq, here in Qaraqosh. This was a tragedy that compounded upon tragedy. They had returned to their homes after being liberated from ISIS, their town being liberated from ISIS in 2016. They started to rebuild, if you will. Now there is a question mark over what materials are being used to rebuild this town. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ABDELAZIZ (voice-over): Celebration turned nightmare at an event hall in northern Iraq. More than 1,000 people were gathered here to attend the wedding of a young couple. Social media video shows the moment the ceiling apparently caught fire, the sparklers setting the decor ablaze. This eyewitness described how the horror unfolded. \"During the slow dance, one of the fireworks hit the roof and it caught fire all at once,\" he says. \"It spread everywhere because it was made of panels, vinyl fabric, everything was burning. It started falling on people's heads. No one could get out.\" Highly flammable and illegal building materials made the venue a tinderbox, according to Iraq's civil defense. Ecobond panels, which violate the country's civil code, fed the flames. Within minutes, portions of the building collapsed, leaving families trapped in the inferno, officials said. Burns and asphyxiation led to the deaths and injuries of dozens, according to Iraq's health ministry. The full extent of the tragedy made clear as daylight broke, while rescue workers sifted through charred concrete and twisted rebar. Loved ones discovered the fate of their relatives. \"These are my mom's, my mom's,\" this man screams, \"my mom's clothes,\" as he holds up all that remains of his mother, her dress. This is already one of the most devastated areas in hardhit Iraq. A predominately Christian town, Qaraqosh, was captured by ISIS in 2014 and nearly all of its 60,000 residents forced to flee the terror group's wrath. Liberated more than two years later by U.S.-backed forces, life was slowly coming back. A visit from Pope Francis in 2021 marked the persecuted community's brave return. In this Christian wedding celebration, it should've been another chance for residents to rejoice. Instead, victims are asking how so much avoidable death was allowed to happen and if corruption may be to blame. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It's frankly a relatively quick and perhaps even surprising ending to this saga. We have seen in the past how the North Koreans have used Americans is their custody as bargaining chips, as negotiating tools and that they have kept them in custody, typically for far longer than just a couple of months. But beyond that, we have very few details at this point about exactly the circumstances of Travis King's exit from that country, his expulsion and how exactly he came to be in U.S. custody, what the process of the negotiations was. Also, Becky, the question is now, what happens to Travis King going forward? You know, when he crossed into North Korea on July 18th, that was after he was already headed back to the United States, escorted by U.S. military officers to the airport. He was set to be separated from the military upon his return after he had served about 50 days in a South Korean detention facility over assault charges in that country. Now the question is, will he face additional charges here in the United States, stemming from his decision to cross into North Korea, to go AWOL effectively and what exactly happens now?
