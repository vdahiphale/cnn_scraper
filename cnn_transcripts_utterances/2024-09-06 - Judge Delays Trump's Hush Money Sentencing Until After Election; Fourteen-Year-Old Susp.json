      "sentences": "Well, Judge Merchan lays out his rationale in this four-page decision, and he notes off the back how this is a unique place in the nation's history, and he says that the timeline we're on, we're at September and we're just several weeks away from the election, makes this fraught with complexities.Ultimately, the judge deciding that he was going to postpone Trump's sentencing until after the election, saying he didn't want to give the appearance of any sort of influence on the election, that he didn't want to look like he was going to be affecting either political party in this case. Also saying that he didn't want to give an advantage or a disadvantage to either side by making this big decision of whether and how to sentence former President Donald Trump on his conviction of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. Now, the judge also saying that he was not going to make an - to issue a decision on whether to throw out this conviction or throw out the indictment. That's something that Trump also asked for, citing the Supreme Court's decision on presidential immunity. So Judge Merchan saying he's not going to weigh in on that either, because that is also fraught with potential political implications. So now that big decision is now - all of that is off the table until after the November elections. So what will stand now is Trump's conviction, but there will be no other decisions in this case that - of whether the conviction stands. And if it does, how much time Donald Trump could potentially serve in prison. One thing that the judge also pointed to was the prosecution. He said that they didn't oppose delaying the sentencing and so he leaned on that in part of his reasoning of why he would delay the sentencing in this case. He also said that this jury of 12 New Yorkers had sat through the trial, listened to the evidence and come up with this unanimous verdict. And he said he thought that that deserved its own consideration outside the specter of politics, and that Donald Trump, as a defendant in this case, deserve the same when he is facing a potential sentence. So the judge now taking the politics out of this and taking the conviction of these felony charges out of the presidential race, at least as far as something that could potentially be decided ahead of that election.

A sentencing for Trump seven weeks before the election, really as early voting was just getting underway, may have galvanized support for him. I mean, just think what it's done so far.The one thing that unified this Republican Party, or one thing more than others around Donald Trump, were these legal cases in New York, in Georgia and beyond. So it could have helped him, there's no doubt. We never know if it would have rattled him. I mean, how it actually would have affected him personally, say he would have been given a prison sentence, that's a very different thing than just theoretically railing against the criminal justice system. But sure, there's an argument that it could have helped him right before. So I think this judge saying, I'm going to take politics out of it, take the election out of it. Now, you know, we'll never know, I guess, before voters go. But add this to the list of things that voters have a question about, in terms of these legal cases against the former president. I mean, virtually every single legal case now will be decided after the election.",

There are sentencing guidelines, and then there's what Judge Juan Merchan will have to do on November 26th, if Donald Trump at that point is president-elect. What do you foresee happening?MISTY MARRIS, DEFENSE &amp; TRIAL ATTORNEY: Yes. Well, we're in an uncharted territory, if that is the case. But first of all, there's the threshold issue of whether or not the verdict stands and whether Judge Merchan actually vacates the verdict and says this trial has to take place. Again, remember, the argument is based on the Supreme Court's immunity determination, which doesn't necessarily directly reply to state law. However, what the Supreme Court found is that any evidence that would have been qualified as an official act could not come into the courtroom. So that's something Judge Merchan is going to have to make a decision on before that sentencing hearing. That's scheduled a little earlier in November. But then, if this case is in fact, and the verdict is upheld, and this goes forward as we - it proceeds, we're going to see a sentencing hearing. And if President Trump actually becomes the president of the United States, well, we'll immediately see an appeal to the Supreme Court to say that he cannot be in jail during his presidency. There's a lot of constitutional issues that would be first time. You know, a case of first impression if that, in fact, does happen.",

And the scheduling order, as even proposed, the trial cannot take place before the election. However, the discovery schedule that is proposed would make public some evidence that we may not have seen before from the public. So that may become into the public sphere.But the actual results of that case and results of that trial, we're not going to see that prior to the election. It's just impracticable. Truly, that Supreme Court decision relating to presidential immunity gave a basis for all of these cases to be pushed back. And that's not just because the judges in these cases have to go through everything and make a determination about what falls under that umbrella of official acts and what is outside of it, but also what evidence can potentially come into the courtroom. So that's very different than the acts themselves. It's also evidence that might, may or may not be excluded in these cases. So it really did complicate all of the legal cases moving forward and certainly is pushing them out past the election from a scheduling perspective.",

First of all, and this is significant, the judge made it clear earlier today that the teenage suspect won't face the death penalty because he's not eligible due to his age.We have learned since Wednesday night that 14-year-old, Colt Gray, would be charged as an adult for allegedly shooting to death two fellow students and two teachers at Apalachee High School here in Winder. We have also learned that the gun used in the shooting by the teenager was a Christmas gift from his father last December. Another important takeaway is that it is very likely that Colt Gray will face, as you mentioned at the beginning, additional charges. That's what Barrow County District Attorney Brad Smith said earlier today here outside the courthouse. Let's take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We've already heard through reporting and investigation that, you know, the suspect had violent ideations. He, you know, focused on, you know, other types of mass shootings.

So, those are going to be multiple charges. You may have charges stemming from - that center around endangerment or you may have additional weapons charges that could be brought forward.

Giving them a pathway to access weapons is, you know, basically negligence. You're a negligent parent when you're giving your children access to these weapons, knowing that there is a threat. You as an adult, as the parent and legal guardian, you need to be held accountable for it.So I think that these are appropriate charges for, you know, these horrific acts that have occurred. The common denominator here is, you know, the recklessness around access to weapons by the wrong person. This isn't about gun ownership. This is about responsible gun ownership and responsible care around firearms. And we see in this case that the father of the suspect basically disregarded all of that.",
