I am Julia Chatterley in New York, and I want to get straight to our breaking news this hour. The FBI says a US Army veteran is behind todays deadly truck attack in New Orleans, and authorities don't believe the suspect acted alone. We are learning new details about the driver who plowed into a crowd celebrating the New Year, killing at least ten people and injuring dozens more. The FBI says he was a 42-year-old US citizen from Texas. They say he had an ISIS Flag in the truck, as well as weapons and potential explosive devices. The rampage is being investigated as terrorism. It happened on world famous Bourbon Street in the French Quarter a few hours after midnight. Police say the driver was, \"hell bent on creating carnage.\" They say he shot and injured two officers after ramming the crowd. Police fired back, killing him at the scene.

After hitting the crowd, he exited the vehicle and fired upon local law enforcement. Law enforcement returned fire, and the subject was pronounced deceased at the scene. Two law enforcement officers were injured and transported to local hospitals. The subject has been identified as 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a US born citizen from Texas. He was driving a Ford pickup truck, which appears to be rented, and we are working to confirm how the subject became in possession of this vehicle. An ISIS flag was located on the trailer hitch of the vehicle, and the FBI is working to determine the subject's potential associations and affiliations with terrorist organizations. Weapons and potential improvised explosive devices, IEDs, were located in the subject's vehicle. Other potential IEDs were also located in the French Quarter. As of now, two IEDs have been found and rendered safe. The FBI special agent bomb technicians, as well as our local law enforcement partners, have been working to determine if any of these devices are viable, and they will work to render those devices safe. The FBI, we are working with our partners to investigate this as an act of terrorism. We are aggressively running down all of the leads to identify the possible subject's associates. We are working to ensure that there is no further threat. We do not believe that Jabbar was solely responsible. We are aggressively running down every lead, including those of his known associates. That is why we need the public's help. We are asking if anybody has any interactions with Shamsud-Din Jabbar in the last 72 hours that you contact us. The FBI is asking the public's help. We are asking anyone who has information, video or pictures to provide it to the FBI. We have set up a digital tip line, as well as our 1-800 number, 1-800-CALL-FBI.

That is going to be important.But if it turns out that they had backing from ISIS, this is going to be really amazing, because first of all, we thought that ISIS was kind of on the decline right now. So there is so much going on that could actually reach out to foreign relations and things like that. So this is going to be a big find when the Bureau determines what is going on.

This was a disastrous press conference, frankly, in my opinion, it was just chest beating and being caught in basically some incompetence. So they -- like, at the recent parade for the World Series winners in LA, I was there. They had dump trucks, they had earth movers full of stuff that could not be moved by anything smaller than a tank blocking the cross street, so nobody could get on there with a vehicle and, and kill pedestrians.

We will speak to you soon. Now joining us on the phone is a New Orleans resident, Eric Styles. Eric, thank you so much for your time, and can you just explain first and foremost where you are, because I believe your home is just two blocks from Bourbon Street and you were unable to get back home earlier today due to obviously this now being a restricted area. ERIC STYLES, NEW ORLEANS RESIDENT (via phone): That's correct, even though I didn't witness the event, I did hear a lot of sirens last night, but that's not uncommon for the French Quarter, particularly on a holiday weekend like this. As soon as I stepped out of my apartment this morning, I was ushered to the corner by a State Trooper who informed me that my block was closed and I couldn't even return back to my apartment. So I've been essentially wandering around the French Quarter. I was lucky enough to stop by Turtle Bay, and they're letting me stay here on Decatur Street for now. But several, several blocks of Bourbon Street is shut down and from my understanding, it is the bomb squad searching for suspicious packages. About 9:15 this morning, I did hear a muffled explosion. From what I've been able to gather, they have been removing suspicious packages, and I think detonating them on the spot. It is going to be quite a task for them, considering last night was New Year's Eve and Bourbon Street is notorious for its litter. Right now, the nightly litter is about knee deep, running the length of Bourbon Street. So it is going to be quite an effort for the bomb squad to search for any suspicious package and clear the area.",

But as far as the terrorist aspect, yes, yes, I think we are all kind of resigned to that fact. I know everybody that experiences something like this in their city. They always imagine it, you know, it wouldn't happen here. I heard one of the city officials say they weren't anticipating this. If you just look at the news going back to just a few weeks ago, there was a lot of these sort of attacks in Germany, during Christmas parades, so it is not unheard of on a global scale. A lot of these sort of situations occur in China. They call it again, revenge against society type of event. And I am just dumbfounded our officials were unable to even anticipate this, not to mention the bollard situation. Since they've installed those bollards, they haven't functioned properly. They are supposed to be able to slide back and forth on a track across Bourbon Street, let some vehicles in, and then close it off. But those tracks are often filled with litter. They don't operate properly and quite often the officials get lazy, they leave them open so their vehicles can pass through easily. I think, a lot of people dropped the ball last night.",

JAFFERknow about him thus far is he's apparently a U.S. citizen from Texas. He was in the U.S. Military, as we understand it. It appears that he had an honorable discharge. There's also been some discussion, we've seen some reporting, suggesting that he had financial difficulties. There were some court filings that we're aware of that indicated he had some financial trouble, some debts and the like. So one might wonder whether those things came together. He also did get out of his car after driving to this crowd of individuals. He got out of his car and exchanged fire with police. And so we'll find out more about his military training as well as we go forward. But the concern, of course, is how does an American citizen, you know, here who served in the military, ostensibly honorably turn into a killer, turn into a terrorist, turn into somebody who's affiliated, ostensibly with ISIS, with this flag on his car and killing people, civilians, you know, just sort of enjoying themselves in revelry after New Year's Eve? That's obviously the big concern is, how does that happen? How do we prevent it from happening? How do we ensure there aren't others who have been radicalized like him? As we know, ISIS has been trying for years to radicalize Americans in the United States to conduct attacks here, as well as in our allied countries in Europe.",

So law enforcement and the military, National Guard and the like, Secret Service, have been planning around those events now for months already.They'll be now at a heightened level of alert. They'll be putting more and more officers on the streets to identify whether there are potential concerns. And then looking at the intelligence once again, to see if there are any threats to those events. And then you'll see an additional focus on events that are taking place that might not have been as high priority. The swearing in of Congress just this week. On Friday, the election of the speaker of the House, the counting of ballots. As we know, January 6th last time was a flash point here in the United States. We may see questions around that as well. And so these national security special events will be already focused on, but now they'll be looking at other events as well that might be potential targets, and seeing if there's any intelligence suggesting there's a threat.

      "sentences": "Well, I think part of the problem here, Julia, is that this wasn't unthinkable. This is something that New Orleans, like every city in this country and every city in Europe, has been aware of, particularly since around 2015, 2016, something like that at that time, when terrorists started using vehicles much more as weapons because they're easy to get, you can do a lot of damage fast with them.New Orleans had been advised of this being a danger. They were in the process of replacing these bollards, meant to stop traffic from going up and down that street because they admit there was a problem with them. And yet in the moment they had a police car blocking access to the road. But clearly it was inadequate because their explanation over and over again today when people said, well, how did they get around? They kept sort of shrugging and saying, well, he drove on the sidewalk as if they hadn't considered that even though many attacks like this, of course, involve driving on the sidewalk. So I think there's some very, very hard questions ahead for them, precisely because of what you just said. They're delaying this event by 24 hours, the Sugar Bowl, big, big college football game here in an arena, the Superdome here, that can seat 75,000 people, something like that, for indoors for a football game. The question some people are saying is how is it going to be safer 24 hours from now if you haven't caught the people involved? What difference does that make except for optics? And what do you do when Mardi Gras starts? Mardi Gras season actually starts next Monday and goes on for a couple of months. That will bring a million people into town. How do you deal with the Super Bowl coming up in a little bit more than a month? That'll bring a huge crowd to town. And then we've got Jazz Fest, which will bring a half million people into town at least, maybe more. So this is a town that sees enormous crowds, but as much, Julia, as you know, terrorist attacks can be very hard to stop. And maybe you can't stop every one of them. There seem to be some very difficult questions that have to be asked here about what more could have and should have been done because, being a New Orleanian myself, I know I've been down there when they've used big dump trucks to block the entire road so nobody could get around. Why wasn't that happening this time? There hasn't been an answer yet.",

They're making grand statements about we're going to catch them and we're going to do this, but the minute somebody says, why do you think there are more, what are you going to do, how are you going to do this, in this press conference today, they grew extremely defensive about the mere fact that anybody was asking, how will you deliver on your promises?And in the world that most Americans live in, that's a very fair question. If you made the promise, we can ask, how are you going to do it? You don't have to give away the secrets of your investigation, but you need to offer something because that is where public confidence comes from. And don't forget, Julia, this is a town that was badly, badly, badly shaken in not long ago memory by the official response to Hurricane Katrina. So there are a lot of people in this town for a long time -- these are my friends, people who I know who are sort of like, I don't feel wildly confident in my public leaders. I want to.

Let me read part of it to you. He said, \"I am grateful for the brave and swift response of local law enforcement in preventing even greater death and injury.\" He goes on to say that there is no justification for violence of any kind. I will not tolerate, and we will not tolerate any attack on any of our nation's communities. Now, again, the president is hunkered down in Camp David where he is getting these briefings from his senior officials. We also anticipate that he is going to speak at some point.
