Tyson slapping Paul across the face with that open-hander at yesterday's weigh-in. The two were separated by security.

The president- elect moving fast to get his administration in place, and with that, making some not surprising yet still highly controversial picks for his cabinet. Donald Trump tapped RFK Jr. for secretary of Health and Human Services, that's just one, following through on his promise after Kennedy dropped his own bid for president and gave his support to Donald Trump.Trump also announced a much less controversial choice for secretary of the interior, Doug Burgum, and then tapped his own defense lawyer, Todd Blanche, to be deputy attorney general. With these announcements, CNN has learned that many of Trumps nominees are not being subject to a standard FBI background check. CNN's David Chalian is here with me now for one big thing to start your day. D. Chal, start me off. So Donald Trump essentially, and we're talking about RFK, he essentially promised this was coming when it comes to giving RFK some sort of big job, go wild on public health, and he followed through.

But then you're also going to have confirmation hearings. And you know they can play a critical role here in sort of swaying the minds of senators as well as the public, too.But Kate, the Republicans are likely to have 53 Republican senators, right? So that means that Democrats would have to remain totally unified in opposition to a Trump nomination and peel off four Republicans. So where are those Republicans going to come from? You would first maybe look to people like Susan Collins or Lisa Murkowski, two Republicans who are known to sort of buck Trump at times, but not always. And Susan Collins just indicated that she is likely to run for reelection in 2026. There are going to be cross-currents, especially inside potential Republican primaries, to pressure all Republican senators to give Donald Trump the cabinet he seeks.",

BERMAN:  With us now is Democratic Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger, who serves on the intelligence committee and is a former CIA case member. Congresswoman, thank you so much for being with us. You have written about your concerns of the announcement of the nomination of Tulsi Gabbard, former member of Congress, former Democratic member of Congress, to be Director of National Intelligence. You have said that you are concerned what it means for national security. Why? REP. ABIGAIL SPANBERGER, (D-VA):  Well, this is not about party, this is not about partisan politics, this is not about President-elect Trump. This is about our national security. And the reality is that anyone who would traffic in conspiracy theories, who would align themselves with Bashar al-Assad after he used chemical weapons against his civilian population or align herself with Vladimir Putin should not have the role of Director of National Intelligence. It is an essential role that, frankly, most people have never heard of because every single day, the DNI works to ensure that our intelligence community is cooperating, is sharing information, and ultimately is focused on the singular mission of protecting the United States of America and the American people. And Tulsi Gabbard is a dangerous pick for this role.",

And the fact that they would avoid a traditional background check process, to me, means that they know they can't pass it. And what it means is that information that would be available to the FBI just won't even be considered. The idea that there would be a total step away from the guardrails that are meant to keep the American people safe is a dangerous possibility.",

But I -- the American people, and certainly the people I represent, are good people, are people who are focused on their families, are focused on their concerns in and around our communities. They want their kids to be safe in school. They want to be able to afford their prescriptions at the pharmacy counter. They worry about retirement. They worry about being able to afford a home.And so there is so much conversation about what Americans did or didn't vote for. And certainly, I supported Vice President Harris in her candidacy and recognized that President Trump would again be a danger to our country. But I think that we for so long have taken for granted the reality that when a president comes in, they appoint people who are experienced, right? The DNI is a relatively new position. It was created after 9/11. The individuals who have filled that role have been serious, right? We look at Negroponte, we look at Clapper. Clapper served for 40 years in public office under Republicans, under Democrats, under Republicans, under Democrats. That is the type of background. Avril Haines, our current DNI, she has served in roles that prepared her to take the helm of the ODNI. And so I think that we have a traditional understanding that when someone comes in as president, they do the responsible thing of appointing responsible people. I worried, I suspected that that's not what an irresponsible president like President-elect Trump would do. But the reality is that this is where we are now. And so it's important that people understand why it is dangerous in this moment. The recrimination, looking backwards, you know, that's for, I think, you know, that doesn't change the fact that there's potentially someone wholly unfit who will be leading the ODNI, the Department of Justice, HHS. That's where we are now, and certainly, that's where we should be looking forward and using our voices and making clear that this is an unacceptable place to be, and we expect more.",

But Ruby Freeman and Shay Moss' lawyers have persisted. They have built a foundation in court, they have locked down bank accounts of his. They keep asking him for more and more information.
