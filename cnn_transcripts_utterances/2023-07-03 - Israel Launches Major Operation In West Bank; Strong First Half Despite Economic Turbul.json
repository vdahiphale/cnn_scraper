A major Israeli incursion underway in the West Bank. Palestinian officials say at least eight people have died so far. Russia and Saudi Arabia cut oil production through the end of August. And meet Lemon8, the new app from the owner of TikTok that is already raising security concerns. Live from New York, it is Monday, July 3rd, I'm Paula Newton, in for Richard Quest and this is still QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. And good evening. Tonight, we are entering the 20th hour of Israel's largest military operation in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin in more than two decades. The Israeli military has used drone strikes and hundreds of soldiers to target the Jenin refugee camp. It says it is disrupting a militant command and control center. Now, the Palestinian Ministry of Health says at least eight people have been killed. It says five of those killed were only teenagers. More than 80 others have been injured as of now. It is the second time in less than two weeks the Israeli forces have raided Jenin. Hadas Gold has been following all the latest developments for us and she joins us now from Jerusalem. And Hadas, what more are you learning about this operation and why represents at this hour such a significant escalation?",

But this has turned into the largest Israeli military operation since 2002, since the days of the Second Intifada. The Israeli military utilizing several drone airstrikes, hundreds upon hundreds of Israeli forces, bulldozers to bulldoze streets that they said had IEDs under them. And we even saw tanks on the outside, outskirts of Jenin. But still, just the sight of tanks in the occupied West Bank, of course brings to mind those images during the Second Intifada when Israeli military tanks were literally within the cities themselves. Now, the Israeli military saying that they were using precise airstrikes to target militants. They say they were targeting command centers. They say they were targeting weapons sites, explosives sites, targeting IEDs to remove them, and the Israeli military is claiming that of the eight killed, they just told us this, they said that as far as they believe that no non- combatants were killed. They are saying that all the eight killed were militants, but we do know at least of 80 other injuries and we do understand that there are civilians amongst those injuries. We have to keep in mind that Jenin and specifically the Jenin refugee camp is an incredibly densely populated area. And of course, when you have bulldozers going through the cities and you have clashes going out there at the cities, civilians will be affected. We are hearing of issues to the electricity supply, to the water supply, and now, we are hearing reports of women and children, especially trying to leave the refugee camp because this has been going on now for 20 hours and the Israeli military saying that it will continue for at least another day or two until they believe they have achieved their objectives. Of course, for the past year-and-a-half, we have been reporting on the increasing levels of violence across the occupied West Bank and in Israel itself. The Israeli military has been conducting these regular raids, they say in response to a wave of Palestinian attacks against Israelis and to combat what they say are rising militant groups across the occupied West Bank. But this cycle is essentially just continuing. The Hamas militant group has called on all of their members to operate against Israel in every way possible. Now, we did just hear from the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu in the last hour or so. He was actually speaking at a US Embassy event here in Jerusalem, and he was also saying that this operation will continue. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We heard Israeli military drones buzzing above us, but today, the residents aresaying that they have really never seen anything like this, especially for those who weren't around for the Second Intifada. The question, of course, will be, what will the night bring? Will we see even a bigger incursion into Jenin? Will those casualty numbers mount? And then also, will this spill over into something much broader? The Israeli military is adamant saying they do not want any sort of widescale major West Bank operation. They say, they are specifically focused on the Jenin refugee camp and on what they say are their militant targets there. But this could easily spill over again into something much bigger. We keep bringing to mind the days of the Second Intifada, and you really have to question, we keep talking about is this another Intifada potential? We are just in one already right now -- Paula.",

Now, it was in fact the first day of trading of the second half of the year and a shortened session here in the United States. It appeared most investors, yes, they were already on holiday if you hadn't noticed the Dow steadily climbed, but finishing up about 10 points there, basically flat. The S&amp;P 500 ended just about in the green. The NASDAQ, though continued its winning ways, but certainly not the streak it has been noticing in the last couple of weeks. Now, it is coming off its best first half in 40 years it should be said, gaining 32 percent, powered, of course, by the tech giants. They are dubbed The Magnificent Seven now. Those are the chip makers. NVIDIA shares, which have also sold 190 percent in the first six months of the year as it rode that AI boom. The question is, you know, can markets maintain all of this momentum or will economic headwinds bite in the second half? Now, central bankers have been furiously raising rates and most are signaling that there is still more work to be done in order to drag inflation down to the two percent target. Consumer prices now are rising at four percent a year in the US. The EU and the UK have a bigger job ahead of them if they want to get inflation back to their two percent targets. Adam Tooze is a professor of history and director of the European Institute at Columbia University, and he joins me now from New York. I'm going to need your quick take here first on the table. I want to dig a little deeper later on, but right now on the quick take, getting to two percent inflation, do you feel that that's too much of a financial risk at this point in time for global economies? Do you think central bankers should stick to it? And if not why?",

It is how high do you go in Europe and the UK, where they are not yet, I think at the peak of the interest rate raising cycle. Notably, in the UK, there was a big move in the last week or two, the EU, the ECB, I think, also the hawks on the board there also think there's a lot of headroom. That is the one question. The other one is how high and how long do they keep the rates at that kind of level? What I'm hoping for in a sense is the sort of strategy the Fed is pursuing, which is to raise and then pause and to see what actually is going on in the economy, because if you ask the economists and the economists are honest with us, their models do not accurately predict how large the impact of these kinds of interest rate hikes are. We simply don't know. The econometric modeling is quite ambiguous on this point. And so given that this is a historic hike, especially in its global extent, there's a good reason I think, for proceeding cautiously.",

      "sentences": "There are two different levels to this. One is that the socioeconomic impact of a very severe interest rate shock should not beunderestimated. If you're asking why populism surged in Europe from 2010 onwards, why Brexit happened in Britain, you have to factor austerity in, and the interest rate hikes at the current moment are austerity by another name. Andy Haldane had a great column in the FT where he said, ex of the Bank of England -- where he said, this is austerity again. It is just monetary austerity. So that's one element. It is the real socioeconomic damage. America right now should be celebrating its hot labor market. The fact that labor market participation of African-Americans and Whites has converged for the first time in history. We should be celebrating that rather than treating it as a problem. And the second level is about the nature of democratic debate. It's about whether or not we consider certain options to be on the table or not. And I don't think we should pre-judge whether or not the two percent inflation target stands, but we shouldn't dogmatically assert that there is simply no option to that, right? That in itself is a foreclosure of the options open or should be option -- the options that should be open in democratic debate. We should be considering other instruments as well. Many European states experimented with various types of fiscal policy to stabilize prices, even price controls, price regulations need to be on the table.",

I want to get to a point that you've laid out quite effectively in the last few months, and this is this concept of a poly crisis, right, the mutually dependent parallel risk environment that we're all going through now.

Does AI in the mediumterm pose a very serious risk to white collar labor markets, routine white collar worker of different types? And if that is the case, and I think there is a reason to think that it does, then the question going forward is how do we maintain that employment? Where do we find those jobs? And the answer there is investment and various types of growth. And this is the other reason, I think, to be worried about a severe interest rate hike and a form of monetary austerity, because that growth that we want, the innovation that we want, that requires investment and interest rates throttle that. It is one of the ways that monetary policy acts. So this will be the way I think in which those two problems are interconnected. AI may be a huge boon. I mean, if it doesn't cure cancer in the next five years, we should be disappointed, right? It's allowed us to unlock the structure of proteins. I mean, it's an incredible -- it's an incredible breakthrough at that level. But what we do have to be concerned about are the bread and butter issues like employment, those depend on investment and investment, in turn is linked to interest rates. So we shouldn't disconnect these options up and get so focused on the inflation target, that all our other priorities, in a sense, disappear from the table.",

Chinese carmaker, BYD sold more than 700,000 hybrid and electric cars between April and June. That's almost double the number BYD sold in the same quarter last year. Now Tesla and Twitter boss, Elon Musk is facing a huge backlash after making some big changes to the Twitter platform. The site is applying temporary read limits -- read limits. Musk says this is to address high levels of data scraping and system manipulation. Since Saturday, he has kept verified Twitter accounts to reading 6,000 posts a day. Now the limit is 600 a day if you have an unverified account. Verification by the way, costs $85.00 a year, and if you don't have a Twitter login at all, you're currently unable to see any tweets, cannot partake in that platform.

PETER VALDES-DAPENA, CNN BUSINESS SENIOR WRITER: Well, it's concerning because right now, Tesla is still in the lead on purely electric vehicles. You know, BYD is in the lead if you include hybrids and plug-in hybrids, but on pure electric vehicles, Tesla for now is in the lead, but that is not expected to continue. BYD operates in the largest EV market in the world, by far, in China, and it has got huge sales there. Right now, its sales are still small outside of China, but it's going to continue to increase and continue to grow in more global markets, and it is expected at some point fairly soon to maybe pass Tesla in terms of just even pure electric vehicle sales. Meanwhile, a lot of people are concerned that Tesla's sales increases are coming at the cost of price cuts. Tesla has been cutting the prices on its most popular models, the Model 3 and the Model Y, and you can't keep that up forever.

In the short term, it's going to mean more competition for Tesla chargers, but it certainly does give Tesla more strength in the market that it has built in, the most popular -- what could be ultimately the most popular charging network standard in the United States.

This evening the spokesman for Ukrainian forces in the East said that the Russians have deployed 180,000 troops along the Eastern Front. Keep in mind, that's more than twice the size of the entire British Army. And that in Bakhmut, in and around Bakhmut alone, they have 50,000 troops. So, the Ukrainians are running into stiff resistance but also having to deal with a Russian army that seems to be throwing everything they have into countering this offensive. Paula?",

It comes two weeks after the successful visit to China by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to reestablish dialogue. Janet Yellen is expected to meet with her Chinese counterpart and other high-ranking officials for what we are hearing will be constructive and frank conversations. But like with Blinken's trip, officials say they are not expecting any significant breakthroughs. She is not expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Yellen has long signaled the Biden administration's desire to improve communications with the Chinese and lower the temperature between the world's two largest economies, which are deeply entwined. Back in April while giving testimony before Congress, she's stressed the importance of maintaining ties with China and said that decoupling would be a big mistake. And last month at the Paris Finance Summit on stage with Chinese Premier Li Qiang, she said, as the world's two largest economies, we also have a responsibility to work together on global issues. It is something the world expects of us. Yellen's trip comes at a time of heightened uncertainty for the global economy. China is struggling to reboot its economy post-COVID following a slew of poor economic data while the U.S. is trying to contain inflation and avoid recession. Global challenges and mutual areas of concern will no doubt be on the agenda but the airing of grievances is also a priority. The U.S. has imposed sweeping restrictions on China's access to advanced technology, specifically semiconductor technology, citing national security threats to the U.S. While the U.S. is concerned about the scope of China's new counter espionage law, and the challenges it could present for foreign companies. We know that Yellen will be meeting with American companies operating in China. There certainly will be a lot to discuss during her three-day visit. But at the end of the day, this $700 billion in trade between the U.S. and China each year, and both countries need each other. Anna Coren, CNN, Hong Kong.",
