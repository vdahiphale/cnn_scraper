New details of the tragic event and new scrutiny of OceanGate itself and the experimental technology used to create the craft.

That is why you saw him have this lavish state dinner, big arrival ceremony and also address Congress. Ultimately, the White House is betting that India could serve as a counterbalance to China. You know, the White House says that this was not a trip about China. But it certainly was the backdrop of much of the discussions and the topics that came up over this state visit. Yesterday in fact, in that press conference that President Biden held, he didn't walk back the fact that he had called the Chinese President, a dictator. He said that he doesn't think that though, that labeling Xi that way is going to impact their efforts to stabilize the relationship, and that he still hopes that he can speak and meet with Xi in the future. But the fact that the President was holding the state visit for India, it also shows how they were weighing the focus on countering China against some of the tough issues that they face regarding India, especially when it comes to Modi's human rights record. He addressed Congress, there were at least six Democrats who decided to boycott that speech due to his human rights record, and the White House ahead of time has said that the President wasn't going to lecture Modi on human rights or democracy, the President did say that he brought up democratic values in their discussions. But it was also notable that Modi stood before the press and took some questions. That is something that Modi very rarely does. And he took a very pointed question about his own crackdown on political dissidents, as well as targeting of religious minorities. Now, Modi stood there and claimed that there is no space for discrimination in his country, and that it's important that a democracy thrives. But there are still questions about his human rights records and this drift towards authoritarianism that we've seen from Modi. But really what the White House has been trying to emphasize here in the course of these past two days, is that they do believe that bolstering this relationship with India will serve as that counterbalance to China. A bit later this morning, Biden and Modi will be meeting with tech leaders from the AI semiconductor and also space industries, as he's trying to show that they're trying to build these relationships, strengthen these economic ties, especially in some of those evolving is industries as well.",

And it's now aiming for 100 percent of cars sold to be zero emission vehicles by 2025. And they're not far away. This year, electric cars account for 90 percent of new cars purchased. Just to put that in context. Around 35 percent of all cars in the greater Oslo area are now fully electric. And it's been a long road. Let's be clear to get to this point, including decades of government driven incentives just to name a few and you can barely see that chart, but it's an important one. In 2001 EVs were sold without sales tax. Later, they were given the right to drive and bustling discounts were offered on traveling on things like ferries and charging facilities were provided in apartment buildings. Remember also though Norway's Western Europe's largest petroleum producer, the majority of its oil and gas is exported, which has certainly helped them shore fund the internal transition to renewables. Joining us now Espen Barth Eide, he is Norway's Minister of Climate and Environment and he's joining us from Oslo. Minister, fantastic to have you on the show clearly much to discuss! With regard to electric vehicles this is an astonishing achievement.

I mean, that's the chart now, it was about efforts to equalize the economics between combustion cars, and electric or hybrid vehicles.

So wehad the benefit in quotation marks that our taxes for cars used to be relatively high. So taking them away, totally meaning all taxes, all VAT, all fees meant quite a significant advantage for the electric car, which would normally in the market 10 to 15 years ago, the more expensive car. So that was normalized. And then people realized that once you have that car, your electricity is generally much less expensive than the alternative fuel, which would be getting, you know petrol or gasoline. And so it was cheaper in use. And then came all the other added benefits. So all of that together, made people really interested, once the cars came along, that actually could take your family decent distance also will be in the conditions because you should remember that Norway is a sparsely populated country with a rather large country, large distances and very cold.

So I make those 23 cars per available charge when you've mandated rest stops positioning apartment buildings, as I mentioned.

And we cannot rely on them only coming from faraway places, maybe under the control of authoritarian States. So we need in Europe and in Norway, to do our own homework to see what we have. And we actually have some of that in our soil and in our mountains. So we are now reopening or starting new mines, trying to do that in the most environmentally friendly way, focusing on nature restoration afterwards, and making sure that we this is moving into a circular economy. But we have to be very honest and you're spot on here. We will need more of this stuff, if you want to decarbonize the world. So as oil goes out, our system which it has to do, because we cannot continue to heat the planet, as we've done, we will need these rare earths and minerals, they are not contributing negatively to climate change, but they have to be environmentally friendly and nature friendly. So we're also seeing this as an opportunity for growing new businesses, which are all those businesses related to electrification and to battery technology. That means for the windmills, for the solar panels for a bit also for the battery components. And we are very eager as all the European States are in what's called the European battery Alliance.

So I was thinking implosion then that's Monday morning, I got on the horn again with some other people track down some Intel that was probably of a military origin, although it could have been researched. Because there are hydrophones all over the Atlantic and got confirmation that there was some kind of loud noise consistent with an implosion event.

Then I watched over the ensuing days, this whole sort of everybody running around with their hair on fire search, knowing full well that it was futile.

At a time when we're seeing peopledisplaced and move across Europe in greater numbers than any time since World War Two. One organization is working to help integrate them into communities and into the workforce. The Tent Partnership for refugees has more than 300 companies in industries ranging from retail and hospitality to technology and also manufacturing. And earlier this week, I spoke to Hamdi Ulukaya, the Chairman and CEO of Chobani and the Founder of the Tent Partnership along with J. Ofori Agboka, the Vice President of People Experience and Technology for Global Operations at Amazon. And we spoke about the importance of training, hiring and investing in Europe's refugees.

And that means, you know, we estimated $2 billion a year, you know, income for refugees across the Europe. So this is the intent was when we started in February, this project here in London, that we would have, you know, companies that already exist in Tent coalition but getting new companies in France and U.K. in an all areas of Europe and mobilize them to get involved this most critical American questions.",

Ofori coming here because I know for you as well, like Hamdi, this is not just about a commitment by the company that you work for. It's also personal your father of his own free will move from Ghana, but started his life fresh in the United States. So, you know what it's like to change everything and to grow up rebuilding your life. What does this mean to be part of, not just for Amazon, but for you personally? J. OFORI AGBOKA, VP OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL OPERATIONS AT AMAZON: Yes, you know, thank you, Julia. And thank you Hamdi again, good to see, I'll tell you, it means so much, you know, first, Amazon, our commitment, to hire 5000 refugees here in Europe over the next three years, which is an addition to the 5000 refugees. We committed to hire last year, the United States over through 2024. In addition to that hiring commitment, we understand the importance of training, we've committed to 10,000 training 10,000 Ukrainians globally free of charge through our IT skills for you program, you know, so that is a global program, again, free of charge. So it's exciting for so many reasons. And as you pointed out, you know, it is personal to me. But before I get to why it's personal to me, I want to tell you why we're doing it as a company. We're doing it number one, because it's the right thing to do. We recognize as a company, that there's a community out there that we have an opportunity to lean in to help. We have an opportunity to lean into our leadership principle of success and scale brings about brought responsibility. And then lastly, we really believe in a strong, diverse workforce, diversity makes it stronger. The innovation, the talent, the creativity that a diverse workforce brings to us into business is so, so important. And as you pointed out, the personal part to me is, as you pointed out, my father did emigrate from Ghana more than 52 years ago. And he came with his own free will in the court. And I'm so proud to work for Amazon where our company recognizes that everyone didn't have the luxury that my father had. People don't come, they have not come. They left our country for various reasons. And we as Amazon are here to make sure that they find meaningful employment and partner with great organizations like Tent and other organizations to make sure that they're successful as they start their new journey.",

So it's not only for the refugees, it's crucial foreveryone jobs are changing, the technologies are changing, the lives are changing. And how we get aligned with this is extremely important. But this is more crucial for refugees. Imagine a sister of mine refugee sister of mine yesterday in the -- talked, you know, Hannah, when she moved from Ukraine to Moldova into Poland. She was, you know, financial investor, and she ended up doing the technology side of it in a technology company, and how she learned all that skills was extremely crucial for her to be able to get a job.

As Hamdi pointed out some of our speakers just at the Tent Summit, Daria is a good example. She migrated, she was a refugee from the Ukraine, she's in Poland, she took part in our program, and she's thriving, she's successful. She's actually a part of it, IT skills for you training programs.

To your point too, the hope is that this will generate what 2 billion euros worth of income for these refugees, and one would hope that's paid out of profits for these businesses too.

This checks all of that, Ofori is extremely passionate about this, because you already seen the results, right? He's very close to people he runs in is an amazing leader for this amazing company across the world. And what you see refugees bring to the businesses.

For people that might be watching that think actually, maybe this does apply to me and I perhaps could come and get that training. I believe it's free as well. What's your message to those people that are perhaps nervous? They don't know whether they should apply but would like to.

This is saying human tragedy in everywhere. And how we respond, I think, into the Ukrainian crisis, Europe actually shines in this moment, like we had the Vice President of European Commission at that event yesterday, he spoke really, really well on this. And I think Europe has to, you know, make a decision on how they respond and how they can be, you know, committed to be there when the tragedy happens. And I think they broke up a new level of response when Ukrainian tragedy happened. And I think that's going to wake up in a lot of people. There is, if you look at from the perspective of, you know, how big this issue is, or how devastating this is, probably will, you will take that there is so many issues from you know, how we respond from based on region to region, or double standards and all kinds of stuff.
