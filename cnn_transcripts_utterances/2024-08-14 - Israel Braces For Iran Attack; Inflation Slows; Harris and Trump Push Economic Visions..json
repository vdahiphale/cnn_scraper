      "sentences": "Hello. I'm Wolf Blitzer. This is a special edition of the CNN NEWSROOM. We are reporting live today from Tel Aviv, Israel.Right now, senior U.S. officials, they're on their way here to the Middle East for Gaza cease-fire and hostage talks. They're set for tomorrow in Doha, Qatar. The effort to end the war comes as Israel is expecting Iran to attack at any time. People here in Tel Aviv remain very, very nervous and tense about what's going on. We will have all the very latest developments on this important story coming up in just a few moments. But, first, today, Donald Trump is back in a key battleground state for the first time in nearly two weeks, stumping this afternoon in North Carolina for the third time this year. This was the scene at the venue in Asheville, North Carolina earlier this morning. Supporters are already gathering outside. The Trump campaign is promising that today's event will focus on the U.S. economy. Ahead of that speech, the Harris campaign is blasting the former president's economic agenda saying this -- and I'm quoting -- \"We already know who Trump's Project 2025 economic agenda is assigned to benefit, Donald Trump and his wealthy friends\" -- close quote. The vice president, meanwhile, will head to North Carolina on Friday to pitch her economic plan. And, this morning, major news about the U.S. economy. We just learned that inflation hit its lowest level since the spring of 2021. Much more on that coming up just ahead as well. I want to bring in CNN reporter Alayna Treene and national politics correspondent Eva McKend. They're both joining us live from Washington. Alayna, to you first. Asheville, North Carolina, it seems to be a pretty blue part of North Carolina. So why is Trump campaigning there today? ALAYNA TREENE, CNN POLITICAL REPORTER:  Well, I actually had the same question, Wolf. And so I asked the Trump campaign about this. I spoke with Brian Hughes. He's a senior Trump campaign adviser. I'm going to just quickly read for you what he told me in response. He said -- quote -- \"Unlike Kamala Harris, we are not afraid to go to any area for events, do debates with unfriendly moderators, or agree to unscripted interviews and press conferences with national news. It's called running for president. And it used to be something the media expected of candidates.\" So, clearly, this was a bit of a dodge. They are really trying to emphasize their point that Donald Trump is showing up. He will be doing press conferences. We just learned that he's actually going to hold another press conference tomorrow at his club in Bedminster, New Jersey. But, to be honest with you, Wolf, I think the real reason they chose Asheville is because it's a city where they can have a large venue and it's also tucked into a very conservative area. And so I think that's most likely why they selected that city for this rally. But, look, there's no question that North Carolina is being viewed by both the Trump campaign and the Harris campaign as a battleground. Even though the state voted for Republicans in the last 10 out of 11 elections, Democrats have consistently run close in the state. And so they have both been spending millions of dollars on reserving airtime as they look ahead to November. But I do, Wolf, just want to quickly point your attention to what I expect Donald Trump's speech to focus on. So I talked to the Trump campaign about this morning. And they said, look, they know that Harris is expected to talk about health care and the economy this week. And so their big focus is to try to have Trump compare and contrast that. Now, as for the economy, you can expect Donald Trump to try to talk about inflation, to say that America was better off, the economy was better off four years ago. He's going to have a specific emphasis on grocery prices. We actually saw the campaign spokesperson put out a statement on grocery prices this morning. As for health care, they're going to try to claim that Harris is running away from Biden's health care agenda and also from her past health care beliefs, which is they're arguing that she once supported Medicare for all. Now she doesn't. That is going to be the goal. But I think my big -- the big thing I'm looking for today, Wolf, is whether or not Donald Trump will actually be able to stay on message. We know he's been receiving a ton of criticism from within his own party, both privately, but recently in the last 48 hours publicly as well, telling him, stop with the personal attacks on Harris and start talking more about policy. That is how you will win. [11:05:09] So we will see if he heeds that advice today.",

      "sentences": "Wolf, this is going to be an economic plan really grounded in aiming to lower costs for middle-class families.She will talk about increasing the federal minimum wage. She will argue that Trump's economic policies would cause another recession. Out on the campaign trail with her, she talks about taking on price gouging, taking on corporate landlords by capping unfair rent increases. And they will have the money over the coming weeks to get this message out there, the Harris campaign announcing that they're launching a $90 million paid media buy throughout key battleground states for the last three weeks of this month aimed at sharpening the contrast with the former president. Now, these campaign ads, they will lean into Harris' personal story, her career as a prosecutor in California, as they really seek to court undecided voters. We have a statement from the campaign on this ad buy. It reads: \"On the heels of our historic launch, we know that the more voters hear during the month of August about the differences between Vice President Harris' longstanding history of delivering commonsense solutions for the American people from her early days as a prosecutor to the present and Donald Trump's dangerous, extreme and out-of-touch Project 2025 agenda, the more they will know that Vice President Harris is the only candidate fit to lead our country over the next four years.\" So we got that from the deputy campaign manager. They believe running an aggressive paid media campaign over the next few weeks to really ensure their message gets out there will help cement certain ideas with voters even before the fall. You have heard the former president talk about how he's really going to get out there and make his case after the DNC Convention. They're essentially arguing today there's no time to waste -- Wolf.",

      "sentences": "It's not really a fair, Wolf.Here's the reality. The vice president's been a part of the president's decision-making over the course of the last three-and-a- half years. So many of those Biden policies were policies that she helped pull together and policies she will talk about. But she also has her own stamp on these policies, things that she's going to talk about that are going to be particular to her and her experience and the people she knows. Keep in mind, the vice president is one of these people who has friends and family members, her stepchildren, her godchildren who are at every age, whether they're in elementary school, like some of her nieces, couple of her nieces, or they're in college or just recent college graduates or newly married. So she knows what people are going through. She knows what parents are going through. She knows what young adults who are trying to get housing and going through the inflation numbers. The macroeconomy under the Biden/Harris administration is doing extraordinarily well. But there's a concentrated pain point for people when they go to the grocery store, they go to the gas pump. And that's the point where I think she understands intrinsically. It's not something she has to read about in the newspaper. She understands that that's the point where people need help.",

Ernesto is expected to unleash up to 10 inches of rain on Puerto Rico alone and could trigger very dangerous flash flooding and mudslides. The storm is expected to move northward into the open Atlantic and could threaten Bermuda by the weekend. This morning, Americans are also getting more news about inflation. Prices last month rose at their lowest level in more than three years. CNN business anchor Julia Chatterley is joining us right now.

      "sentences": "Thanks, Wolf, both good questions.The bottom line here, with inflation in the United States on an annual basis at around 2.9 percent now, I think it seals the deal from the Federal Reserve to be able to cut rates by a quarter-of-a-percentage point in September, barring any surprises. And I will always say that. Food prices did rise again last month, which is uncomfortable, but it's more calibrated. It depends what you're buying. If you're a hot dog fan, prices, unfortunately, have risen around 10 percent over the past year. If you prefer a healthier apple option, for example, then those prices have fallen by 15 percent over the last year. So it really is mixed. Let me show you what else contributed to the price rises that we saw. Shelter is by far the biggest component of the pressure on prices that we're seeing. It's painful, of course, because it takes around a third of Americans' incomes. Affordable housing, let's hear that from the presidential candidates, because that really does stand out in this report. What did come down? Let's give you some good news in this as well. We did see motor -- trucks and car prices coming down, which was one of the big standouts in this as well. Wolf, if there are people listening to this and thinking, why is she telling us this is good news when it still feels so painful, let me just give you a sense of how far prices have risen overall over the past two years. This data hasn't been updated for what we saw today, but it really does give you a sense. Shelter, what I was just talking about, housing up 13 percent. If you have got rent payments of $1,000, you're paying an extra $130 a month. I think this is why voters want to hear solutions, rather than sympathy, from some of these presidential candidates, whether it's Trump today or Kamala Harris on Friday, but good news for now, fingers crossed Fed rate cut in September -- Wolf.",

These three men have been to most of these talks before. So this doesseem to indicate that the prime minister is giving a full team the authority to go. What we don't know is what they're going to talk about. And I think the other part of the dimension of what's happening at the moment, it's also about trying to stave off a Hezbollah attack. Amos Hochstein has been in Beirut today, has talked to the press, has talked about the importance of trying to defuse the situation in Gaza to defuse the tensions between Hezbollah and Israel.

It's exactly what the Israeli military needs to develop going forward.But, of course, this conversation about this military package is something that's been in the works for a long time, which goes exactly to your point. When it's announced on the eve of these talks, there are many in the region that might interpret that as additional pressure on Prime Minister Netanyahu, a carrot for Prime Minister Netanyahu. It was certainly something that was appreciated by the defense minister, Yoav Gallant, who said this shows a very strong support by the United States for Israel for the development of Israel's military going forward. Now, this is still a proposal. It isn't a done deal yet. But I think the fact that this has come back into the foreground shows the way potentially that the United States is trying to say diplomatically to Prime Minister Netanyahu, look, let's keep this relationship as strong as it's always been, better still, stronger. But we also need and expect things from you. And that's a more moderate position in the talks with... (CROSSTALK)",
