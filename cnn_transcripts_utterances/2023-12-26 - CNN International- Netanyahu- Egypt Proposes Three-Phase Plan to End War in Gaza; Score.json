This as the Israeli leader vows a, quote, long fight that is far from ending.On Monday, Netanyahu traveled to Gaza where he met with troops, marking his second visit to the enclave since the Hamas attacks on Israel on October the 7th. And a warning to you that the images you're about to see are disturbing. In central Gaza, drone footage captured these images, dozens of white body bags left outside al-Aqsa hospital as family members mourn. According to the Hamas-controlled health ministry, at least 250 people were killed in the past 24 hours alone, including at least 70 killed by an Israeli airstrike on a refugee camp. CNN can't independently verify any of the numbers released by the ministry in Gaza. And protesters in the U.S. are demanding an end to the war and what they called a genocide. They turned out Monday in front of the homes of two officials, and they were national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. And those protesters, as you can see, were calling for a ceasefire. CNN's Nada Bashir joins me now in London with the very latest on this. Nada, good to see you as always. So, a close confidant of Netanyahu is due to meet with Biden administration officials. How far apart are the U.S. and Israel right now when it comes to expectations of the duration and intensity of this war?",

      "sentences": "Well, look, Bianca, we know that the U.S. officials have been keeping close contact with their counterparts in Israel.This comes just days, of course, after U.S. President Joe Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at their 17th call since the war began. But, of course, we are hearing somewhat mixed messages from either side. We know, of course, that the U.S. has been putting pressure on the Israeli government to move towards what's being described as a lower-intensity phase of the war. They haven't outright called for a ceasefire just yet, abstaining, of course, from that U.N. resolution. But there has been building pressure from the Biden administration. Just last week, the White House told reporters that the Israeli government had assured the Biden administration that they would begin to move towards that lower- intensity phase. There's no clear timeline given as to when we might perhaps see that move towards lower hostilities. But, of course, this isn't the message that we have been hearing from the Israeli government, certainly not over the weekend. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowing a long fight ahead. He said that they are not near the end of the war. And, in fact, over the last few days, we have begun to see the Israeli military now expanding its military operation in Gaza, doubling down on its air campaign, and of course, moving forward and pushing southwards with its ground incursion into the Gaza Strip. And this has certainly raised a huge amount of concern as we continue to hear repeated calls from international allies, in fact, for a humanitarian ceasefire. Of course, as you mentioned, Bianca, we are seeing that soaring death toll amongst Palestinian civilians. [04:05:00] There is mounting concern over renewed calls for civilians to move southwards from the Israeli military, calling on civilians in central Gaza and in southern Gaza to move southwards ahead of what is anticipated to be an intensified ground operation by the Israeli military. Many now questioning, where do Palestinians inside the Gaza Strip turn to? We have already seen some 1.9 Palestinians displaced within the Gaza Strip. And, of course, there is huge concern over the humanitarian situation and the looming hunger crisis. Only a small fraction of the aid needed is actually getting into the Gaza Strip, despite that U.N. resolution. And there is mounting fears around, of course, what is being warned as an imminent risk of famine now in the Gaza Strip. Now, of course, internationally, there has been some discussion around further peace proposals. We are now seeing reports regarding a proposal put forward by the Egyptian government over the weekend. Now, no comment from Egypt just yet on this. And CNN hasn't been able to independently obtain a copy of this reported proposal. But, according to two Israeli sources, that would see a three-phase peace plan put forward by the Egyptian government, which would entail a number of factors throughout these phases, including the exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners, and, crucially, in its final phase, including a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and the implementation of a government in Gaza with international backing without affiliation to Hamas. Now, of course, looking at the situation on the ground, it seems we are a long way away from discussing those postwar outcomes. But there is mounting pressure, at least, for a humanitarian cease-fire to allow aid to get in.",

Thanks for having me.Earlier, an hour ago almost, artillery shelling targets the upper floors of the Palestine Red Crescent headquarters in Khan Younis, which has resulted in a number of injuries among the internally displaced people. We have inside our headquarters and Al-Amal Hospital, which is right next to our headquarters, around 14,000 civilians who are taking shelter inside our facilities. And those people have no place to go to. They thought they will be in a safe place, but unfortunately, it sounds it's not the case. This is not the first targeting. And even two days ago, a 13-year-old boy was also targeted by an Israeli airplane with live ammunition, a drone, which has resulted in the killing of that boy. Unfortunately, as you just highlighted in the report, there is no safe place in Gaza, and people are just desperate, looking for a safe place to go to. The past couple of days was extremely intense shelling in the area of central Gaza, whether in Deir al-Balah or Al-Maghazi refugee camp. The Palestine Red Crescent evacuated dozens of people who were killed and dozens of others who were injured due to the intense shelling. People still don't know where to go. They are still under constant threat of being bombed at their homes. And it's just a continued circle, moving from a place to another while there is no safe place. People also who have evacuated to Rafah, where Israel is forcing people to go to, also have been bombed in Rafah as well.",

Four or five days ago, our ambulance center in Jabalia have been raided, and Israel occupation forces arrested all the male workers from inside the ambulance center, who were released later, while up to this moment, eight of them are still under arrest. And unfortunately, those who were released, they told us horrible stories regarding how they were treated and beaten.It is just hard conditions and dangerous conditions that our teams are working and just trying to save people's lives. Up to this moment, for over a month, our colleague Awni Khattab, who was part of evacuating critically wounded people from Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City to the south, was arrested while the convoy was passing through the checkpoint that separated Gaza from the south. Up to this moment, four colleagues were killed while they were on duty trying to save people's lives. 28 others were injured. Still, every single day, our colleagues, when they leave our EMS center, they even don't sure if they are going to come back or not. Yesterday, one of my colleagues, he's a paramedic, he was targeted while he was in his home with his family.

And Ukrainian forces say they have hit this Russian navy ship Novocherkassk, which was reportedly carrying Iranian Shahied drones.These Iranian Shahed drones have been largely used by Moscow on attacks in the past months here in Ukraine. Only last night, Ukraine reportedly shot down some of those drones, but yet there were still some sites that were hit in Odessa region, and also in Mykolaiv. So, for Ukrainians too have hit this Russian navy ship is actually a big deal. From the Russian side, there's only confirmation of some damage to the ship. So far, Russia has confirmed one dead and two injured, but the crew of the ship is known to be much more than that. So, we'll have to wait to see if new numbers will show up. There's also from the Russian side, reportedly, some houses damaged, mostly shattered windows. Also, some people were evacuated to shelters or family and relatives' houses. As I was saying, for the Ukrainians, striking this Russian navy ship, it is a big deal. They have strike Russian navy ships before, but for the past few months, you know, most of the strikes here in Ukraine have been with these Shahed drones. Just now, the sirens were heard here in the city center of Kyiv. And many times, when we hear these sirens, it's because there is a danger of strikes with these drones. So, for Ukrainians, this might be an achievement at this time of the year to actually be able to strike this Russian navy ship.",
