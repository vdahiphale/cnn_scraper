Let me set the scene for you. The Trump team made a game time decision to call a witness, Robert Costello. He's a former legal advisor to Michael Cohen. Now about 14 minutes into his testimony, Costello vividly demonstrated why he may have caught Trump's attention. But the presiding judge was not amused. Costello rolled his eyes at Judge Merchan. He let out an audible sigh after an objection. And the transcript may be the best way to describe what happened next in that courtroom. The judge, he says, I wanted to discuss proper decorum in my courtroom. Costello, right. Judge, okay, so when there is a witness on the stand, if you don't like my ruling, you don't say, geez, okay? And then you don't say strike it because I'm the only one who can strike testimony in the courtroom. Do you understand that? Costello, I understand. Judge, okay, then if you don't like my ruling, you don't give me the side eye and you don't roll your eyes. Do you understand that? Do you understand that? Costello, I understand that. I understand what you're saying. Judge, okay, thank you. Let's get the jury back. Are you staring me down right now? Costello, No. I'm just wondering how -- Judge, clear the courtroom, please. Clear the courtroom. Bottom line, Judge Merchan, who is normally soft spoken, measured, he was furious today. The judge cleared that courtroom and dressed down the witness, all of which served mostly to distract from what would have otherwise been a pretty strong day for the defense. The prosecution's star witness, Michael Cohen, well, he may have flown a little too close to the sun and scorched the government's case against the former president in the process. Trump's lawyers backed Michael Cohen into a shocking admission, that the fixer is a thief. Now, on the stand, Cohen said that he took $60,000 from payments that he had received from Trump, which included reimbursement for the hush money that he ultimately paid to Stormy Daniels, the very payments that are at the core of this trial. And that is an alleged crime that Cohen never faced charges for. Joining me now is former counsel to President Trump during his first impeachment, Robert Ray, former Federal Prosecutor Gene Rossi, and Washington Correspondent for New York magazine Olivia Nuzzi, and Trial Lawyer Deanna Paul. Robert, this is a pretty shocking decision, actually, on the part of the defense to bring Costello in from our reporting, despite a lot of back and forth internally, to give them what seemed to ultimately be not a whole lot and then in the process antagonize the judge.",

For more on the arrest warrants, let me bring in Mehdi Hassan, author of Win Every Argument, The Art of Debating, and Jonathan Schanzer, former terrorism finance analyst at the U.S. Treasury Department. Mehdi, I want to start with you. And I know that we will spend a lot of time discussing the part that has gotten this really to the front pages, which is the charges against the Israeli leaders. But on the issue of Hamas, is it justified for there to be such a delay in bringing charges against Hamas for actions that happened many, many months ago on October 7th that we've known about? Those atrocities have been clear for a long time, and yet the charges only come now. MEHDI HASAN, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF AND CEO, ZETEO: I'm not sure. Actually, I think that Karim Khan, the ICC chief prosecutor, would say that he was building a very careful case. He's a very careful lawyer. He has been there for, I think, a few years since 2021. And when he became chief prosecutor, he said he would be looking at Israel-Palestine because the ICC said they had jurisdiction over crimes committed on Palestinian territory. He's interviewed survivors. He talks about it very eloquently in his statement today. And I think, look, Hamas should be held to account for what we all saw them do on October the 7th, the killing of civilians, hostage taking, some of us said, on the day. Those are war crimes. So, I'm glad they're being held to account. The problem, of course, is, is that some people, including the President of the United States, say only Hamas should be able to account for crimes committed in that part of the world, even though since October the 7th, tragically, we have seen many more innocent people killed on the other end, killed by the Israeli war machine. And I think it's quite right that, as you said in your introduction, no one is above the law. And this whole nonsense about moral equivalence, I've been hearing it all day, moral equivalence. No one is saying there's any moral equivalence. People are saying that there is one law, international humanitarian law, everyone should be held to it, whether you are a government, whether you are a militant group, whether you are a terrorist, whether you are an individual, whether you are a prime minister, no one is above the law. And Karim Khan is doing the right thing in bringing charges against people in that part of the world, requesting arrest warrants for people who -- we've all seen. Netanyahu and the leaders of Hamas carry out horrific things in front of our eyes.",

I think it's a Hail Mary. There doesn't seem to be -- not only have we not seen any cases brought, but I don't think we've ever seen a successful case brought on this.

Cindy McCain, the head of the World Food Programme, the wife of the most pro Israel American senator of my lifetime, John McCain, says Northern Gaza is in a full blown famine.

They took the criticism that the United States leveled, and they've taken action. And so, now, we have this incredible system where the United States has built a pier.
