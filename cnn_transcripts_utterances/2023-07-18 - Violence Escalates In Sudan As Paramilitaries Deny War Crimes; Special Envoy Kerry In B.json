      "sentences": "Christine, I think there are very real fears that there could be more mass graves like this and there is emerging evidence that is just the case.Now, this is in the western part of the country in Darfur -- the vast region that has had a history of atrocities, in many cases perpetrated by the groups that are fighting now, including the Rapid Support Forces -- the paramilitary group that is fighting the National Army. Now, at least one case of mass graves in western Darfur. There's another case, according to the United Nations, of more people found in a mass grave. I've seen video and evidence of bodies strewn on the streets in some of these towns where there has been fighting and often people have been cut off for many weeks now. This is now entering more than 90 days of fighting in Sudan, emerging as a civil war in that strategically important country. The International Criminal Court prosecutor says that the world needs to pay attention and people need to be brought to book. But many activists we've been speaking to say this is just history repeating itself -- these targeting of civilians. And it does appear that the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary groups with ties to those that have committed atrocities in the past as gaining the upper hand at this stage in parts of the capital and parts of Darfur where the fighting is, unfortunately, expanding. Now, there are efforts by the U.S., the Saudis, the Egyptians, the Ethiopians, and others to try and get some kind of peace efforts or, at the very least, a ceasefire in play. But at this point, there doesn't appear to be a meaningful process to stop the fighting. At least one analyst I've spoken to today said there should be criticism of international actors for not coordinating the efforts to stop the fighting and, rather, trying to be the ones that get the peace. For now, though, the blame squarely has to be put on those generals who started that fighting more than 90 days ago -- Christine.",

And we've heard from John Kerry and he is certainly hoping to accomplish a great deal not just on the issue of climate change.As you say, he met with China's top diplomat Wang Yi this morning and Kerry said that climate talks could provide a fresh start for the world's two largest greenhouse gas emitters on other issues that have caused serious tension, such as Taiwan and trade. Let's take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KERRY, U.S. CLIMATE ENVOY:  Our hope is now that this could be the beginning of a new definition of cooperation and a capacity to resolve the differences between us. We both know there are real differences. But we also know that from experience, if we work at it we can find a path ahead and ways that resolve these challenges. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He said Joe Biden values his relationship with Chinese leader Xi Jinping and is very committed to stability in the U.S.-China relationship and hopes to achieve efforts together and make a significant difference to the world.As you know, Christine, Kerry is not your average U.S. diplomat. He was a presidential Democratic nominee, U.S. Secretary of State under Barack Obama. Wang describes Kerry as my old friend, saying that they'd worked together on a series of issues including the Iran nuclear talks. Wang said today that the world needs a stable China- U.S. relationship and that to cooperate on climate change, it has huge potential for the world. Yesterday, Kerry met with his counterpart Xie Zhenhua for almost 13 hours and afterwards he tweeted -- and let me read some of that to you. \"The climate crisis demands the world's two largest economies worth together to limit the Earth's warming and take urgent action on coal and methane pollution.\" Climate experts have said that if China and the U.S. can agree on these reductions in methane, which as we know is a -- is a greenhouse gas producing 30 percent of global warming, that could really move things forward. And the focus being COP 28 in Dubai, which starts at the end of November, Christine.",

To get garage doors, and tiles, and sinks in on any sort of realistic timeline. You've got demand that's cooling but not falling out altogether. And you've got prices that soared in earlier phases of the pandemic and then dropped in the second half of last year that are now slowing stabilizing. All of these things are giving builders more confidence. They're giving buyers some more options. And it just means that there are more homes on the market at any given time.",
