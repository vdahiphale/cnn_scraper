So, this is obviously unique to Russia. It's directly linked to the war, which we'll go into in a minute.But I think what is more important about this is that it's not just about a gradual rise in overall prices. What we're seeing is that certain supermarket staples, and in particular we're looking at eggs, have gone up dramatically. It's something like 60 percent every year. It was almost 20 percent between November and December. That increases the likelihood that people are A, going to notice it, and B, going to start to make the connection between their grocery baskets and the war. And what we're seeing is that that is a situation that the Kremlin has not been able to ignore. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEBASTIAN (voice-over): When your husband spoils you with expensive presents, reads the caption. Russian social media brimming with egg memes. Making light of a new feature of Russia's upside-down war economy. Sudden and unexpected price rises. Drive an hour outside Moscow, though, and it's no laughing matter for these pensioners. Of course, we notice it. The pension is 13,000 rubles, says Lyubov (ph). That's less than $150 per month. Maybe we buy less meat, says Nadezhda (ph). There's still enough for medicines. Egg prices rose 18 percent in December alone, Russian official data shows. More than 60 percent over the year. Far outstripping overall inflation at 7.4 percent. As images spread of lines forming outside supermarkets, this purportedly from Belgorod in December, Russia's president forced into damage control mode. VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA (through translator): I am sorry about this and want to apologize for this problem. This is a setback in the government's work. Although they say this is not the case, I still think it is. The problem is related to a failure to increase imports enough. SEBASTIAN (voice-over): The government took the not-so-subtle hint. Eggs were exempted from import duties for six months, and shipments started arriving from Turkey, Azerbaijan, and staunch ally Belarus also ramping up supplies. Its president unable to resist a rare dig. ALEXANDER LUKASHENKO, BELARUSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Our own production covers our needs in terms of grain, pork, chicken, milk, vegetable oils, and chicken eggs. PUTIN (through translator): Send some to us. Don't be greedy. SEBASTIAN (voice-over): In Putin's surprisingly resilient war economy, the egg crisis reveals the biggest problem is not decline but overheating. Putin says this is about higher demand because of slightly higher wages. Partly true, economists say, but what Putin doesn't say is why wages are up.",
