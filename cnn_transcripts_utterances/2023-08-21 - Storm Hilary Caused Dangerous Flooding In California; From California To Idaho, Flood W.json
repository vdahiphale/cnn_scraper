Just look at this video of flash floods that we could see early this morning. Water overtaking the streets in Cathedral City, which is east of L.A., gas stations were submerged.And then in downtown San Diego, so much water gushed into the sewer system that it may have turned this manhole into a building-sized geyser. Hilary is now a post-tropical cyclone, but forecasters are warning that this storm will unload heavy rainfall in so many areas that are not prepared for this much water. We have CNN's Stephanie Elam live for us in Cathedral City, which is not too far from Palm Springs where many people are dealing with just this huge amount of mud, Stephanie that was left in Hilary's wake. Tell us what you're seeing. STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It's so much mud, now that we can get out here and see. And I want you to actually see how far this spans out behind us because our Todd Anderson shot some beautiful drone video so you can see this road that I'm standing on, how far down the mud goes. And how there are trucks and cars, there's even a police vehicle down there, that are skewed and turned sideways because of how fast the water was moving overnight as Hilary was making her way through there. In fact, we talked to this one gentleman, Jay Bublitz, who has been out all night helping rescue people because he's got a jeep with a wench and a snorkel so he can make it through lots of the roads that other people couldn't.

The former president, one of 19 defendants who must surrender at the Fulton County Jail by noon on Friday. We're learning that Trump and several of his co-defendants are expected to negotiate bond terms at the D.A.'s office today. For Trump, that surrender could come on Thursday or Friday on charges including conspiracy and racketeering tied to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in the peach state.

But we are already seeing a little bit of activity around here at the courthouse, a separate location where the district attorney works. That District Attorney Fani Willis who brought the case against Donald Trump and 18 other defendants related to their actions after the 2020 election in the state of Georgia when they were indicted last week.What is happening today and what our team on the ground has been able to suss out is that it's likely that some of Trump's lawyers and other lawyers for defendants will be negotiating with the D.A.'s office starting today to set some bond terms, some bail terms. The terms of what happens once those people are arrested, because when they are arrested, they're not going to want to sit over at the jail. They're going to be wanting to have their release conditions set in advance so they can carry their papers in, go into the jail, have all of their processing done, whether that's fingerprints, mugshots, searches. We don't know exactly how they're going to handle each of these defendants yet or what bond terms they're going to give them. But the negotiation for how that's going to play out, that is very likely to take place starting today. And we do expect some of those negotiations to begin with at least three lawyers working for Donald Trump, too, who he has enlisted in the state of Georgia to represent him here. As well as a lawyer who has essentially taken the lead on all of the criminal indictments that Donald Trump is facing now. And so, we're waiting. We're watching for that. We haven't seen any indications yet of exactly what those bond terms are going to be for these 19 defendants, but we are waiting to see if they are going to be treated similarly to other criminal defendants in the state of Georgia.",

Law Professor Laurence Tribe and retired conservative Judge J. Michael Luttig say, it's right there in the 14th Amendment. They write in \"The Atlantic\" that section 3 automatically excludes from future office any person who has taken an oath to support and defend our constitution and thereafter rebels against that sacred charter. They explain this on CNN's \"State of the Union\".(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PROF. LAURENCE TRIBE, HARVARD LAW SCHOOL: The people who wrote the 14th Amendment were not fools. They realized that if those people who try to overturn the country, who try to get rid of our peaceful transitions of power, are, again, put in power, that would be the end of the nation, the end of democracy. J. MICHAEL LUTTIG, RETIRED FEDERAL JUDGE: All officials, federal and state, who have a responsibility to put on the ballot, candidates for the presidency of the United States, for instance, they, himself or herself, are obligated under the constitution to determine whether Donald Trump qualifies to be put on the ballot.

They cite lines like this from Then-President Trump's speech.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, THEN-U.S. PRESIDENT: We fight. We fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore. (END VIDEO CLIP) KEILAR: So, the article draws upon the amendment's creation in the wake of the civil war, noting, \"More people died and many more were injured as a result of the January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol than died or suffered injuries as a result of the attack on Fort Sumter\" which began the civil war. And we should also note, advocacy groups actually brought up the 14th Amendment when they sued to remove Republican's Marjorie Taylor Greene and Madison Cawthorn from the ballot back in 2022 over their vocal support for the Capitol rioters. Judge decide -- a judge has decided that neither could be disqualified. There is, though, a question, Jim, of whether a 14 A lawsuit might be stronger against Donald Trump.",

And that he didn't want to visit sooner because he didn't want to disrupt the effort that was underway. President Biden is someone who is personally acquainted with grief. And he is set to reprise his role as consoler in chief when he visits the island today. And in a statement, the president said ahead of that visit, I know how profoundly loss can impact a family and a community and I know nothing can replace the loss of life. I will do everything in my power to help Maui recover and rebuild from this tragedy. And throughout our efforts, we are focusing on respecting sacred lands, cultures, and traditions. Biden is also tapping Bob Fenton, a senior FEMA official to lead and coordinate the federal response. Fenton is someone that the president has leaned on frequently to serve as the chief of the administration's COVID-19 vaccine distribution in its early days. He also was the lead coordinator of the monkeypox response effort back in 2022. And he will be at the helm of this for the administration going forward. Just a few moments ago, FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell briefed a reporter and said that so far FEMA has distributed north of $8 million to residents on the island. But she reiterated that the disaster relief fund is set to enter the red at the beginning of September unless Congress passes more funding. Jim.

Look at this, Brianna, Donald Trump is 40 points ahead of his closest competitor Ron DeSantis, 57 percent to 17 percent. Followed by Ramaswamy at six and Mike Pence at four percent. And you can see, the other the others are in the low single digits too. When you look at the next slide here, three for Nikki Haley, three for Tim Scott, three for Chris Christie, Asa Hutchinson and Doug Burgum down at one percent.Now, all those folks, not name Trump, are going to be on the stage. And there's an opportunity for them to try and begin the process in this first big introduction to Republican primary voters. Because remember, many voters have not been dialed into this race yet to start building a coalition of the non-Trump wing of the Republican party. Now, the question is, is that even a big enough wing? Well, it suggests it is. Maybe 57 percent doesn't suggest that, but in the early states. There is half the party looking for an alternative. And so, having an opportunity without him on the stage to try and be the person to emerge as the guy that -- or gal that coalesces that support is a critical test for these candidates. KEILAR: And can Trump win without expanding -- 57 percent is a lot, but he needs to expand beyond that as well. And when you look at RNC officials, you look at Fox News executives, they have been begging him to be a part of this. I wonder what you think the relevance of this debate is going to be without him?",
