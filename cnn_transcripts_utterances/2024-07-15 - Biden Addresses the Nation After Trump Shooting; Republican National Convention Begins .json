In today for Max Foster, it is Monday, July 15th, 4 a.m. here in Washington. 3 a.m. in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where former U.S. President Donald Trump is preparing for the start of the Republican National Convention set to begin in the coming hours and less than 48 hours after a brazen attempt on his life.Trump could be seen pumping his fist as he exited his plane in Milwaukee on Sunday just a day after narrowly surviving an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania. While Monday's theme at the convention is expected to focus on the economy, there is no doubt the shocking violence seen on Saturday will loom large for the four-day event and beyond. Trump says one of the bullets struck the upper part of his right ear during the shooting. One man in the crowd was sadly killed, two others wounded. New video into CNN shows the gunman on a nearby roof before the shots rang out. We do want to warn you some viewers may find those images disturbing. There are the images now. You can see just above there is the gunman. The FBI has now identified him as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks and says the motive for the shooting remains unknown. U.S. President Joe Biden is among those condemning the violence. In a rare address to the nation from the Oval Office late Sunday, he said it is time to come together and, quote, cool down the political rhetoric. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Here's more from the reporter who spoke with the former president on Sunday.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALENA ZITO, U.S. NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: He said he was going to focus on bringing the country back together. He thought that it was very, very important that in that moment when that happened to him, he understood this is what he wants to do, what he's supposed to do. And he talked a lot about when he stood up, and there's that sort of iconic moment when he puts his fist up. And he told me that he really wanted to project to people. He said it wasn't about him at that moment. He wanted to project to those people, and he says he loves these people. And they are the backbone, but this is a rust belt area. This is a blue collar, white, working class, mostly crowd. And he wanted to project to the -- he thought it was important to project to the country in that moment that everything was OK, that he was OK and the country was OK. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: The Republican National Convention will formally open here in Milwaukee on Monday. Former President Donald Trump arriving in the city Sunday night with one of the biggest decisions yet to unfold. That, of course, is who he will name as his running mate. That is expected to take place Monday afternoon when Republican delegates from across the country gather in the Pfizer forum here behind me to formally start nominating and voting for the delegates. Now, there is no question this campaign has changed dramatically given the events of the weekend. One question hanging over all of this convention and, indeed, the rest of the campaign is, will there be a sense for more unity from both sides? That was the plea of President Biden delivering an Oval Office address on Sunday night. And former President Donald Trump is conveying through his advisers he would also like to invoke themes of unity. Of course, that remains a very open question, given the tenor and tone of this campaign so far. But there are some indications the program here is changing somewhat. Former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, one of the longest standing rivals of Donald Trump in the primary campaign, she has now been invited to give a speech here on Tuesday night. I'm told she will be invoking themes of unity for Republicans and, indeed, the country as well. There is no question that this is an entirely different moment in this campaign because of the assassination attempt. Former President Donald Trump will be greeted here as a hero by Republican delegates. Yes, it's his third Republican convention, but the one four years ago, of course, happened during a pandemic. And eight years ago, when he first won the nomination, the party was still divided. Now this Republican Party is unified behind him, and they believe he's on a good track to defeating President Joe Biden. Jeff Zeleny, CNN, Milwaukee. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So he has a lot of work to do, excuse me, in changing the rhetoric, in changing the tone, because his supporters are used to him being very defiant.

This building was about 150 yards from where the former president was speaking at the podium. And multiple law enforcement sources that I have spoken with have expressed real concern, real shock that a building that close, 150 yards or so from the podium, was not included in the what they call the hard perimeter. Which means it would have been subjected to an extensive security sweep that it would have required anybody trying to enter that building to go through a magnetometer. So many more questions there. Additionally, the big question, again, centering on this building, is in what way this building did factor into the overall security plan. So another question is whether or not the building was left out of the perimeter, because for whatever reason, the Secret Service decided that it did not present a security risk. For example, did they determine that the building could not be accessed, that the doors were locked, that no one was inside, no one was likely to go inside? These are the questions that the service would have been asking as they assessed the site, as well as continuing to ask themselves in this extremely pivotal moment. The investigation is also shifting to the gunman here. This is 20- year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks. What we know now is that he was not known to the FBI. He was not in any databases. That he used an AR- style 556 rifle that belonged to his father that was purchased legally. And that law enforcement has his cell phone. And what they're trying to do now is get into that cell phone and get some insight into what his motivation was. That is the big question. And at this moment, it is not clear why he did this.

      "sentences": "We have new information now on the shooter's movements just before and during the assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump.CNN's analysis shows that the shooter was roughly 150 meters away from where Trump was standing at the time he started opening fire. That's less than 500 feet away from the former president. We're also told by Butler County Sheriff Michael Slupe that law enforcement officers, local police officers, got word of suspicious activity on the rooftop around there and went and investigated it. At that point, according to the sheriff, one officer hoisted himself up to the ledge of this rooftop here, saw the gunman. The gunman saw the officer, according to the sheriff, and pointed his weapon at him. At that point, the sheriff had to drop down for his own safety because he was clinging to the ledge of the roof and was not able to draw his weapon to engage the shooter, so he had to drop down for his own safety. Also, we're told by a senior law enforcement official that just before the shooting, the shooter was seen acting somewhat suspiciously in the area of magnetometers. They would presumably be in these areas here. Not clear exactly where he was around these magnetometers, but according to a senior law enforcement official, he was acting somewhat suspiciously around the area of the magnetometers. The key question is, what was he doing? Was he probing for a possible shooting position? Was he on a recon mission? That will be brought out in the investigation. Another piece of information that we're getting here is that -- this is according to Ben Macer, who is a witness who told CNN affiliate KDKA of the shooter's movements just before he took that position. According to Ben Macer, he saw the shooter move from roof to roof to roof in the moments before he took that position to take shots at the former president. So these had to have been these roofs here because these buildings are all seemingly attached. If this witness saw the gunman moving from roof to roof to roof, it would have been right about there and these buildings right there. Also, we have some video of the gunman in the moments just after he was neutralized by law enforcement, the body of the gunman lying on the roof of that building where he was. And as we look at the post-shooting scenes here, what I can show you is there are some scenes here of the chairs and the debris. But when we take a look at the grandstand, I'm going to pause the video for just a second here. You take a look at the grandstand. We have new information also from the governor of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, who told us about the deceased victim, Corey Comperatore, a firefighter from Butler County. Corey Comperatore was in these grandstands. He might have been in this one here. We're not sure if he was in that one or possibly this one, but he was hit with gunfire and was killed. But according to the governor, Josh Shapiro, Corey Comperatore committed a very heroic act during the shooting. He dove on top of his own family to protect them from the shooting and, of course, was killed by a gunshot in the process. Again, we're trying to find out which of these grandstands Corey Comperatore was in when he was shot and killed. As we go back to the scene here, we were told that President Biden has ordered an independent review of the shooting. And according to our law enforcement analyst, Andrew McCabe, the most basic elements of securing an outdoor site, especially outdoors, is that you have to eliminate the sight lines to where a protectee is standing or speaking. A key component of this investigation is why was that sight line so close to the former president not eliminated? Brian Todd, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE) SCIUTTO: And just how much freedom the shooter had prior to taking those shots, freedom of movement. U.S. lawmakers have been reacting to this attempted assassination. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said that he's been worried about this type of violence for some time. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): I wish I could say I was surprised, but I've been worried about this for a very, very long time. You know, if he wins, democracy is not going to end. He's not a fascist. He represents a point of view that millions share. The rhetoric is way too hot. But I was just grateful that he made it. I mean, fate stepped in. God, the hand of God, call it whatever you like. But let's don't forget, there's a man who lost his life by attending a political rally. He's dead. His life came to end. Other people are hurt. Who to blame? Let's blame the shooter. But let's all try to do better. SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT): In this traumatic moment, it's time for all of us to take a deep breath. Remember what this country is about and what political campaigns are about. And they're about serious discussions of serious ideas as to how we address these serious problems facing this country. So let's use this moment. If there's any silver lining in this tragedy, it's to figure out how we go forward peacefully, constructively and intelligently. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
