He has put in a request for $24 billion of additional funding for Ukraine, which seems like an uphill battle at this moment. You know, when you think about the last time that Volodymyr Zelenskyy was in Washington, it was nine months ago and it was under very different circumstances. The House was controlled by Democrats, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi invited Zelenskyy to deliver a primetime address to a joint session of Congress. There was pretty strong support for Ukraine. Now, the Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy barely wants to be seen in public with Zelenskyy as members of his Republican caucus are calling into question the need for additional financial support and military aid to Ukraine. And as those polls show that, in particular, Republican voters seem wary of providing Ukraine with additional funding. Now, against that backdrop, President Biden is nonetheless approving $325 million of additional aid using his presidential drawdown authority for Ukraine. This aid is going to include new air defense capabilities, as well as additional cluster munitions, which the president first approved to Ukraine earlier this summer. Despite that though, Zelenskyy is not getting everything that he wants, Richard. He has asked for those ATACMS, those long-range missile systems. He is not getting those at this moment.

Thank you very much for the invitation. I would say that the most crucial aspect right now is, of course, the grain. We do remember what happened in the middle of 2022 and the beginning of this year, when there was an influx of Ukrainian grains to Poland, which did in fact hurt the farmer -- the Polish farmers and the Polish agricultural sector. So there is an argument to be to be made, that the government indeed has to protect the livelihood of Polish farmers and the stability of the Polish agriculture market that did hurt the farmers and what is significant right now, whatever you are hearing from Poland right now, whatever is happening is political and that is connected to the upcoming election. That election will take place on October 15th, so that's two weeks from now. And a majority of the Polish farmers, they vote for Law and Justice. Yet in the past months, years, there has been some friction, some dissatisfaction from the farmers and Law and Justice simply needs to retain those votes and show the farming community we are fighting for you. We are protecting you. Also the government is --",

You've just been hearing the, rightly, the Polish politicalaspects of, but there are also of course elections in the United States in the next year and I guess that as long as the right wing of the Republican Party continue to push McCarthy, it will be more difficult for a long standing aid package to continually over many months into an election -- through the primary season and then into the general election.",

      "sentences": "Yes. I mean, it certainly will be, but the Biden administration is maintaining a pretty strong and perhaps even surprising degree ofoptimism that they can maintain support for Ukraine in Congress, and I think that's in part due to the fact that there are some creative ways to go about getting funding for Ukraine. First of all, you have to keep in mind that in the Senate, even Republicans, the majority of them remain very strongly supportive of providing this funding for Ukraine and within the House, even the Republicans, a majority still do support that funding. It's because House Republicans have such a narrow majority that just the fact that the most right wing of the Republican members of the House, the fact that they oppose that additional funding makes it tricky. But if you lump it in with other additional -- other funding sources, other funding packages, there are creative ways to make sure that this funding still gets done. So I think that there is a likelihood that the support will continue. But I think the question is, as you talk about politics, and the elections, how does this play out in 2024? Can President Biden and President Zelenskyy himself as he makes his appeal directly to the American public, can they make the case to Americans that that there are broader implications for Ukraine? A message that we have heard, of course, from President Biden in the past, but to try and make it real for Americans who are dealing with -- still dealing with high prices, who have a lot of other concerns to make it real for them that this war in Ukraine matters to them as well, especially when you have someone like Donald Trump and other Republican candidates for president arguing that this is not America's war and that the US shouldn't be involved.",

      "sentences": "That is possible. Of course, the question is who will win the election because just as -- if it's okay for me to repeat myself, right nowin Poland, everything is political. Everything is connected to the campaign. For example, a recent survey shows that some two-thirds of the Polish people approve of the way Ukrainians are becoming part of the Polish society in the labor market, and some seventy, eighty percent still say that Poland needs to help Ukraine. But there is an increasing number of people who are saying that maybe the help, well, it should not be so generous, maybe it should be connected to some sort of conditions, some sort of limitations. Simply put, there seems to be a slightly lower level of enthusiasm, but generally speaking, there is support for backing Ukraine. On the other hand, I mentioned the polling, the surveys that are being made in Poland and what is extremely interesting, at least in my opinion, is that between eight and 14 percent of the Polish voters, they are swing voters. We don't know who they will support on October 15th, and this is also interesting, among that group of undecided voters, the lack of support for Ukraine is higher than in the public that already has made up their mind. So we must remember that whatever the Polish politicians are saying, they are aware of the fact that this approach towards Ukraine might prove to be a significant factor in this whole electoral process in the decision making process, or at least way more important than one might think.",
