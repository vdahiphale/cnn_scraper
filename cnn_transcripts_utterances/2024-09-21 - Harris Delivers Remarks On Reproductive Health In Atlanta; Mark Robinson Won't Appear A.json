Springfield's Mayor confirmed that he told a Vance campaign staffer on September 9, those claims were baseless.And Kentucky investigators have confirmed that a body discovered in the woods is the man who shot at people along an interstate a couple of weeks ago. Police say Joseph Couch died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. A manhunt for Couch went on for several days after police say he perched atop a cliff and opened fire on random drivers along I-75. Five people were shot. A Kentucky couple started their own search and found Couch's body deep in the wilderness not far the shooting site.

But the prospects of a deal look very bleak right now. Thesenegotiations are going nowhere, it seems. And a lot of people that I've been speaking to in the region, some officials in Arab countries, they feel that this is not going to happen any time soon. And there's also been the question of, why is the U.S. not doing more? The U.S., many believe, has the leverage, has the power to make a deal happen, and they feel that it is not putting all its power and leverage here and trying to make it happen. And you can see right now, the situation the region in is an extremely dangerous one. You know, we're talking about the developments in Lebanon over the past few days, blow after blow for Hezbollah, obviously, with these unprecedented, shocking attacks, these pager and walkie talkie attacks, but also on Friday, another devastating blow with that strike on that building in southern Beirut suburbs that killed at least 16 members of Hezbollah, including one of their most senior commanders, another top commander and other members and operatives of what is Hezbollah's special operations force. But at the same time, we're also hearing, in the past couple of hours from the Lebanese health ministry saying that, as many have feared, many civilians are among the casualties as well. This is one of Lebanon's most densely populated areas, and they say that at least seven women and three children aged four, six and 10 are among the dead, and that the operation is still continuing. They're digging through the rubble. They are trying to search for more people. There are some who are unaccounted for right now, and this is a very tense and terrifying moment for so many people in Lebanon who have gone through so much over the past few years. And the question right now is, where is this all headed? What is Hezbollah going to do next? Because what you have had since October the eighth is this mid level intensity conflict that has for the most part been contained in the border region with these cross border attacks between Israel and Hezbollah, but this has obviously gone to a very has entered a serious, new, dangerous phase. And the question is, what is Hezbollah going to do, and what is it that Israel is doing right now? Is this Israel warning Hezbollah? Is it trying to use this military pressure to secure its northern region, to secure the return of tens of thousands of displaced Israelis to the north or is this Israel setting the ground work for what many fear could be a new offensive and a major military operation that could be coming?",

I want to talk about just the past couple of days with the killing of Ibrahim Aqil, that's the senior Hezbollah commander, and the pager and walkie- talkie attacks.

JASMINE EL-GAMAL, FOUNDER &amp; CEO, MINDWORK STRATEGIES &amp; FORMER PENTAGON MIDDLE EAST ADVISER:  Thank you so much for having me and good morning. I think that what we're seeing right now actually tells us a lot about where Israel is in its thinking. Benjamin Netanyahu needs a victory, right? He's been in Gaza for the last almost a year now. There has been no end in sight to the war in Gaza, right? He hasn't been able to kind of pull -- you know, put something up to people in Israel and say, we won this war. In the meantime, Israelis in the north have been displaced. They've been out of their homes for almost a year. The pressure has been mounting. You have protests every week for almost a year against Netanyahu and this war, he hasn't been able to bring the hostages back. And so, he needs a victory. And so, what we're seeing in Lebanon now, it actually provides a window into his thinking. He's thinking if I can go into Lebanon, if I can scare Hezbollah into backing down, then maybe I can bring people back to their homes in the north, and then I can declare some kind of victory. I do not believe -- and from everybody that I'm talking to in Israel, I do not believe that Benjamin Netanyahu is seeking war with Hezbollah. I think what we're seeing right now is a sort of mad dash to provide some sort of end to this endless conflict that we've been seeing for the last year.

But is that actually what's going to happen? You know, we talk about the -- you know, unintended consequences. And when we look at the Middle East, you know, in the past decades, when we look at sort of, you know, the last war between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006, nobody really wanted that, but it ended up happening anyway. And so, the real danger here is, is not only miscommunication, but miscalculation. What happens when someone goes just a step too far, and Israel so far has been really pushing the boundaries. I mean, people talk about the pager attack for example, being, you know, this extremely targeted attack, but that's not quite true. I mean, these pagers, according to reports, have been in Lebanon since 2022, the first pager started coming into Lebanon that were compromised in 2022. There was no way for Israel to know who had those pagers, where they were. And so, the plans -- you know, we talk about the best-laid plans, right? But what happens when the best laid plans go awry? What happens when you do something that just goes over the red line that you didn't even know was there and where it was. And so, what you raised is the most important question, which is the risk, the incredible risks of these kinds of operations. You know, Israel is pushing and pushing and pushing. And it may be intending to do this as a means of deterrence. But what action is going to actually flip that situation from deterrence into an aggression and a war by Hezbollah and by Iran?
