Heis pointing the finger squarely at Ukraine, calling the strikes, intimidation and terrorism. While Ukraine denies it was directly involved, all in Washington, complaints coming from both major parties over a debt limit compromise. But lawmakers are under pressure to approve that in the coming days. All face what could be a catastrophic default. We now know at least 30 NATO peacekeepers were injured in clashes in Northern Kosovo, Monday at NATO for saying they were attacked by \"increasingly aggressive crowds\". And Sudan's warring factions extending the humanitarian ceasefire while UNICEF sounds the alarm more than 13 million children there are in need of life saving aid. And China sends fresh crude with Space Station calling the mission a complete success. For Ukraine's capital, it's part of a deadly pattern for Russia's capital. It is unprecedented. Both Kyiv and Moscow targeted by drones earlier today, and it was the third attacking Kyiv in just 24 hours and the 17th this month, Ukraine says it shot down almost all of the 31 drones, one person sadly killed by the debris. Moscow meanwhile, is reporting an attack deep inside the city. Officials say all eight drones were destroyed causing only minor injuries. Russia blames Ukraine which says it wasn't directly involved. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen his inky with more on both of today's strikes. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): It was a pretty tough night here for the citizens of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv for several hours. We had Shahed drones flying overhead, while at the same time, Ukrainian air defenses were frantically trying to shoot them down. I met one of the places that sustained some pretty heavy damage. If we look over here, we can see that there's still a lot of debris lying around in front of this house. And if we pan up, you can see that the top floors of this building have been substantially damaged. And this is also the place where the authorities here in Kyiv say a 33 year old woman was killed while she was inside her apartments. Now, at the same time, the authorities here in Ukraine are saying they believe that their air defenses were actually once again, very effective. They say they managed to shoot down most of the Shahed drones. And also, the hit that happened on this building here was apparently a drone that was shot down. And then fragments, obviously including the warhead hit this very building. At the same time, we do have that situation that unfolded in the early morning hours in the Russian capital of Moscow where the first step for the first time since the war in Ukraine began. They were attacked they say by drones, they blame the Ukrainians. The Ukrainians are saying that it wasn't then, however, the Russian Military saying they managed to take down all of those drones eight in total, they say three by electronic countermeasures, essentially bringing them off course. But they also said that they had to activate their own air defense systems and use missiles to shoot down five of those drones. Fred Pleitgen CNN, Kyiv. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Well,at the time, the British didn't have the means to attack Berlin, but they soon developed it. And so the war was marked by a lot of attacks against civilian population centers. Now, what we've tried to say since then is this is all illegal. It's all against international law. But Russia is doing this, and they can crush the will of the Ukrainian people to resist. So we know that Putin is protecting the Russian population in St. Petersburg and Moscow. We know that they're not being drafted. They're being protected from the cost of war. So whether Ukraine admits it or not, it's sort of a normal thing that they would think about someone would think about bringing their cost of war home to Moscow.",

It was her death that sparked months of massive anti- government protests. Well, Iranian intelligence agents accused the two women journalists of and here colluding with \"hostile powers\" charges that could carry the death penalty. The first trial session for one of the journalists was held on Monday in Tehran behind closed doors the others began on Tuesday, while the protests in Iran have quieted or authorities not giving an inch to anyone showing dissent. Human rights groups say the government has begun executing protesters once again. My colleague Salma Abdelaziz has the details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ABDELAZIZ (voice over): Outside of jail near Tehran, families of prisoners gathered chant do not hang them. There please come as Iran resumes the execution of protesters after a month's long hiatus. The brutal practice restarted this month with the hanging of three young men accused of killing three members of the Security Forces during anti-government protests in November. The news sparked more demonstrations. But activist and human rights groups say the allegations against the Trio are baseless. Majid Kazemi was forced to watch video of interrogators torturing his brother, and he was subjected to at least 15 mock executions according to Amnesty International. And an audio no obtained by the organization he maintained his innocence. CNN cannot independently verify the clip. They kept beating me and ordering me to say this weapon is mine. He says, I told them, I would say whatever they wanted, just please leave my family alone. Before his execution, the family of 36 year old Saleh Mirhashemi, a karate coach from Isfahan tried to draw attention to his plight. This picture of his father spread on social media, my son is innocent, the sign reads. But to no avail. Activists shared this heartbreaking video, they say Mirhashemi's dad hugging his picture as he lay by his son's grave. Iran has not responded to CNN's request for common. The total number of demonstrators known to have been executed since last year now stands at seven according to CNN reporting, and more executions are likely eminent. Over 100 protesters have been sentenced to death or facing charges punishable by death says this human rights activist. MAHMOOD AMIRY-MOGHADDAM, DIRECTOR OF IRAN HUMAN RIGHTS NGO: When authorities fear protests or right after protests number of executions go up. The aim is to create fear in the society to prevent more protests. ABDELAZIZ (on camera): Do you expect that the number of executions is going to rise even more this year? AMIRY-MOGHADDAM: It is rising already unless the international community that takes a wrong move against these executions. We might be facing a very large number of executions in the coming months. ABDELAZIZ (voice over): Rights groups say that Mohammad Ghobadlou, a 22 year old protester with a mental health issue could be one of the next victims of Iran's execution machine.

Well, as I think the Islamic Republic of Iranis a regime that has now for over four decades tested the effect of executions on the general public and is by experience of the belief that, it can effectively use the death penalty executions, as a way to instill fear and as an intimidation technique. It has quickly used it in particular in, in ethnic minority areas of Iran, for example, in the Kurdish areas, or the Baluch areas that have a disproportionate share of the executions every year. And I think at this point, whether we are looking at protests related executions, or non- protest related executions that have also spiked. In my opinion, they are both serving the purpose, same purpose, which is for the regime, hoping that it would be an effective intimidation technique, essentially, to prevent and disperse any further protests and uprisings that would be essentially the continuation that we saw in the past year.",

You see, you know, Iran's violations of human rights, and in particular, the death penalty coming up at the U.N. You see various mechanisms at play in peaceful ways in order to push Iran to be a responsible, more responsible player on an international stage. However, at the same time, I think that this regime is not showing that it is correctable it is re- formable, it's deeply unaccountable. And the culture of essentially, lack of accountability is what continues. So in my opinion, we basically have to the international community has to be a much more robust and, and more much more towards holding the Islamic Republic accountable holding the individuals and the entities involved in basically what is arbitrary deprivation of, of life in this case, I'm gross violations of human rights accountable here.
