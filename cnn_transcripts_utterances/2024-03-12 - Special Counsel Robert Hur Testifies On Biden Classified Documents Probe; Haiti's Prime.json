Tonight, we begin with high drama on Capitol Hill, the HouseJudiciary Committee has been grilling as you've been seeing here on CNN, now former special  counsel Robert Hur on his investigation into President Biden's handling of classified documents. Republicans are demanding to know why her in the end declined to charge the president. Well, Democrats are challenging her decision to deliver what's become what you say a political bombshell, describing Biden in his report as quote, \"a sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory\". The hearing is in recess and will resume shortly, of course, we'll bring that to you as it gets underway.

What he -- defended himself well by saying is, look, I had to look at the totality of the evidence before me, including possible defenses that the defendant would raise. And I believe that I could not obtain a conviction based on it, and that is exactly the DOJ standard. My issue with her was, he wrote in his report if Biden were charged, he would likely defend himself by saying he's an old man with a bad memory. Hur doesn't know how Biden would defend himself, and he should have written -- were he to defend himself this way, I would have a problem. That's my biggest beef with her and his report, he projected how Biden would behave, and I don't think Biden would actually have behaved that way. We saw him as a fiery man in the State of the Union, I think that's how he would defend himself at trial. So, that's my biggest take-away from this.",

Now, they've given them the opportunity to say both sides do it. Biden is just as guilty as Trump. The only reason Trump is on trial is because that Democratic Justice Department is going after him.

And the DOJ's standards on charging say, you must as a prosecutor before being in charge, determine that you can obtain a conviction and sustain it on appeal. He said, I couldn't do that. And that's basic blocking and tackling in this case. And the notion that Gaetz is trying to raise that this is an apples-to-apples comparison, I think also is undermined by her in the report and in the questioning where he says, look, in the Trump case, we're not talking about mere possession and sharing. We're talking about obstruction of justice, acts undertaken by the president after he left office.

If Ronald Reagan gets to think about this as a personal diary and DOJ agrees it's not a classified document, then Biden has the same right to do so. And so, if there's a misunderstanding, if there's some nuanced difference between the Biden letter and the Reagan diary? Well, that's really not the basis for a criminal prosecution. In fact, when I was an independent counsel, we asked George Herbert Walker Bush in his testimony, what about this? He said, once again, let me go check my diaries. He walks out of the room, checks his diaries, comes back and says the answer. He had his diaries too. So, diaries are a separate special case, and I think Lofgren raised that point effectively.",

But for months, his family believed that he was alive, that he was one of the hundreds of kidnapped Israelis who were taken on October 7th, and now after months of trying to fight for his release, they've learned that he was in fact killed according to the Israeli military. He was one of six American citizens, he was dual Israeli-American citizen, he was one of six American citizens believed to be held alive by Hamas inside of Gaza. Now, there are only five believed to be held alive, three other dead Americans, their bodies are also being held by Hamas right now. I have actually spoken with Itay's mother, Hagit, we were on a flight together to The Hague, Netherlands, where she was with a group of about 100 hostage families trying to file a complaint against the leaders of Hamas with the International Criminal Court. And she told me at the time that she was struggling to breathe, that it was difficult for her to go day-by-day continuing this fight. But that, one of the things that kept her going was her dreams that her son would be released, saying that she envisioned him in a Red Cross van in her dreams, waving at her, saying I'm OK, why are you worried so much?

This after a foreign aid package stalled in Congress, as you know, and the White House warned there was no money left. Well officials say, the new funding became available as a result of savings in weapons contracts. The new package includes, as we've been told, much needed artillery ammunition, anti-aircraft missiles, anti-armor systems, and much more. But one official -- this is important to state out here, this is not a long-term sustainable solution. Of course, as House Republicans continue, as you all know, to block and they built in Congress, but I have no doubt, be well received from the Ukrainian side and from President Zelenskyy that the Biden administration announcing another package of military aid to Ukraine worth up to $300 million after warning for months, as you well know, as we've been telling you on the show, there was no money left. So, of course, we will stay across this when more developments, we will bring it to you. Now, the U.S. House Judiciary Committee hearing is actually just getting started after its recess on Capitol Hill. I want to take you there live. Let's have a listen. REP. GLENN IVEY (D-MD): Most notably, after being given multiple chances to return classified documents and avoid prosecution, Mr. Trump allegedly did the opposite. According to the indictment, he not only refused to return the documents for many months, but he also obstructed justice by enlisting others to destroy evidence and then to lie about it. In contrast, Mr. Biden turned in classified documents to the National Archives and the Department of Justice consented to the search of multiple locations, including his homes, sat for a voluntary interview, and in other ways cooperated with his investigation.

In 2010, it came to the attention of the Vice President's staff that classified briefing books had not been returned, even if they were returned, some of the content was missing. The same year, the Executive Secretary raised that nearly 30 of the classified briefing books from the first six months of 2010 were missing. In August of that year, Then-Vice President Biden failed to return top secret, sensitive compartment -- compartmented information contents of a classified briefing book from a trip that he took to the Hamptons.

In fact, he disclosed some of this information to his ghostwriter. And so, I think that there could have been willfulness. And I think, you know, I've got ten seconds left, but look, since 2016, there have been three candidates to run for president. All three have had allegations of issues surrounding the retention and holding of classified documents. But Mr. Hur, only one of them has been charged, and that's President Trump.

But what we did in our report was to try to walk through exhaustively, you know, you know well as a prosecutor you need to assess with a very cold eye the strengths of your case and the weaknesses of your case, and try to anticipate arguments that defense counsel might well present at trial.

So, we walked through a number of different evidentiary gaps that reasonable jurors might focus on, as well as a numberof different defense arguments that the President's defense lawyers could present in -- could present a trial. The first is, a theory or an argument to the jury that the President, yes, he did say to his ghostwriter, I just found all the classified stuff downstairs. But then, soon thereafter, forgot about the documents. And therefore, it would be difficult to convince a jury that actually he willfully, he knew that it was illegal to keep the documents, and he continued to do so. A second argument that we considered is that perhaps these documents never actually were in Virginia, in his private rental home there. Perhaps the documents were there by virtue of staff or himself having those documents at the Delaware home from the time that he was still vice president all the way through the time of their being discovered. And finally, another theory that we walk through in the report is that there were two folders of marked classified documents relating to Afghanistan found in the box in the President's Delaware garage. One of them contained national defense information and the other, it would be a more difficult task to persuade a jury that it did contain national defense information. So, that argument would be premised on perhaps the president was referring to the one folder that didn't contain national defense information but was not. It would be difficult for the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he possessed the one that did contain national defense information. So, I just laid a lot on you there.

And the others believe that Biden did nothing wrong and the decision not to charge him was proper. And the statement that he's an old man with a forgetful memory was gratuitous and political. That -- that's, I think, going to be the bottom line. At the end of this, essentially, it's a wash, politically. And I don't think -- as I say, I don't think any of the Congresspeople are going to change their minds.
