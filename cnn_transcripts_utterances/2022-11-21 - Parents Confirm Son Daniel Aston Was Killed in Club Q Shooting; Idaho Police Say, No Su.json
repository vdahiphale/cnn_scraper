His parents and co-workers say he touched so many lives in a short period of time. Here is what one of them shared with CNN this morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That is how they know some of these details. So, you can only imagine how difficult was for these club owners to witness by reviewing this video what happened. They say that the shooter entered the club with what they describe as tremendous firepower, with a rifle, with multiple magazines, and then that he opened fire. And that, of course, they say, that at that point, and shortly thereafter, some patrons actually subdued the man. So, while this suspect is firing shots, there is a patron there who is running towards the shots, to stop him. And that is what authorities say saved lives in this case.Now, we're also hearing from witnesses that were there, that were inside that can speak to those intense moments, those milliseconds between life and death.

They say the two roommates that were at the house, at the time of the attack, but survived, they are not suspects in this case. Now, remember, these four students, they were out on Saturday night. Xana and Ethan, they went to a party, came back home at around 2:00 in the morning. But a lot of talk around what Kaylee and Maddie were doing that night and the people they interacted with. They went to a sports bar and then they went to a food truck. There was video of that food truck. And they were hanging out with a man. Police now saying that man is not a suspect. Then they got a ride home and a lot of questions about the driver. Now, they're saying this driver is also not a suspect. They then came home and made multiple phone calls to a man. Now, police saying that man is also not a suspect. So, really still a lot of questions to be answered here in terms of who did it. Because, yes, they're ruling people out, but everybody wants to know what happened here eight days ago. And police saying this is very difficult for them as well. Here is the captain overseeing this investigation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CAPT.

Good to have you both on. Molly, beginning you with, how severe are the worries, do you believe, in your work (ph)? First of all, it was only a few weeks ago before the midterms, folks were saying, well, Biden shouldn't run at all, now, like, yes, he could definitely run against Trump but not against someone else, or we'd be a little bit worried.",

I think it is important to separate the way that people feel about Joe Biden running against Trump and meeting that particular moment, right, versus how people feel about Joe Biden being the face of the Democratic Party.If you look at -- it is understandable that Joe Biden felt validated after the midterms, right? The big red wave didn't happen. He made history in terms of not losing as many seats as was predicted. But a lot of those voters were concerned about democracy, in general. They were concerned about attacks on abortion, and so it wasn't, again, necessarily because they were supportive of the Biden administration or could articulate what the Biden administration actually accomplished. So, it is just important to separate those things. People appreciate a lot of things about Joe Biden, the stability, the experience, the calm when you compare him against Trump, but there is a sort of energy that comes from having a different phase. And I think the Republican Party is showing signs that they're ready to move on. So, that energy could come if they actually do move on, and can Biden face that challenge, not really clear.",

The Democratic frontrunner for Democratic House leader to replace Nancy Pelosi, Hakeem Jeffries, told my colleague, Jake Tapper, that he says he is a Democratic leader who would be willing to work with Republicans on some things. He mentioned in particular criminal justice reform, trade agreement reforms.

And at this point, Kevin McCarthy does not yet have the votes to be speaker, right? He got 188 votes in that caucus election the other day. He's going to need 218 votes on the floor.So, it all starts there and it starts with what kind of promises he is going to have to make to members in different wings of the caucus. We know that the hard right members, Freedom Caucus and others are trying to extract concessions and want to do these investigations primarily, which they see as basically just being honest, because they're not going to get any big legislation passed, so why pretend, right? But at same time, there is also going to be pressure from moderates and other wings of the party. They're going to want concessions too. So, it is going to be a real balancing act for Kevin McCarthy. And so before we can even talk about what this majority is going to do, I think we need to find out who is going to be in charge of it, because that is still very much an unsettled question.",
