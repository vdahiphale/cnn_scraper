      "sentences": "Ultimately, that's not just the right thing to do, it's also in Israel's security interest. The Prime Minister and members of the war cabinet agreed with the need for this approach.We discussed the details of Israel's ongoing planning, and I underscored the imperative to the United States that the massive loss of civilian life and displacement of the scale we saw in northern Gaza not be repeated in the south. As I told the Prime Minister, intent matters, but so does the result. At the same time, Hamas has choices, too. Hamas could immediately release all of the hostages it holds. It could stop using civilians as human shields and stop using civilian infrastructure to stage and launch terrorist attacks. Hamas could lay down its arms, surrender the leaders who are responsible for the slaughter, the torture, the rapes of October 7th. Hamas could renounce its stated goal of eliminating Israel, killing Jews, and repeating the atrocities of October 7th again and again and again. Meanwhile, everyone around the world who cares about protecting innocent civilians, innocent lives, should be calling on Hamas - indeed, demanding of Hamas - that it immediately stop its murderous acts of terror and deplorable use of innocent men, women, and children as human shields. In our meetings with Israeli leaders here and in Jerusalem and Palestinian leaders in Ramallah, we discussed our continued focus on preventing the conflict from spreading - whether to the West Bank, to Israel's northern border, or to the broader region. I raised our deep concerns about steps that could escalate tensions in the West Bank, including extremist settler violence and proposals from parts of the Israeli coalition government to further expand settlements. I made clear our expectations about addressing these issues. We also focused on what we can - what we must do now to prepare for the day after the conflict, to create the conditions for a durable and lasting peace, building on the principles that I set out a few weeks ago during the G7 meeting in Tokyo. Breaking out of the cycle of violence, the cycle of conflict, ensuring Israel's enduring security demands improving the lives of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank in immediate, tangible ways, and providing them with a credible path toward their legitimate aspiration for statehood. In our ongoing conversations with Israeli, Palestinian, and Arab leaders, we'll discuss practical steps to make real a just and lasting peace and what each of us is prepared to do to help achieve it. We have no illusions this is going to be easy. We will surely have disagreements along the way. But if we're going to move forward on practical steps toward lasting peace, lasting security, we have to be willing to work through those disagreements, because the alternative - more terrorist attacks, more violence, more innocent suffering - is unacceptable. That is why the United States is here and we're leading toward this goal. With that, happy to take some questions.",

I'm wondering - you talked about what you made clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu and the war cabinet, but what concrete and specific assurances have you gotten from them, if any? Based on what you heard from them today, are you confident Israel will follow the international laws of war in southern Gaza when it resumes its military operations?My second question is you and others in the administration have repeatedly said that United States wants to see a revitalized Palestinian Authority to rule Gaza and the West Bank. Sir, could you tell us what exactly the U.S. vision is for a revitalized PA? And does it include a reshuffle in the leadership? Thank you.",

Is there a time limit from the U.S. point of view on the operation, on the continuation of the operation in Gaza? And another question, there are about 140 hostages still left in Gaza. Many of them are reportedly severely injured, and yet the Red Cross hasn't yet visited them. Can you clarify if this was indeed included in the agreement? And if it was, why isn't it being implemented, and why is Israel pressured to continue to expand the humanitarian assistance to Gaza while the Hamas does not let humanitarian access to our hostages?",

Hamas is believed to have released the vast number of women and children that were in its captivity. So what assurances, if any, do you have that Hamas might be open to releasing male hostages? And on the flip side of that, is Israel prepared to agree to the conditions set out by Hamas on that?Separately, President Biden has signaled that he - that the U.S. is prepared to issue visa bans on what he described as extremist Israeli settlers. What is the status of that? And forgive me - one last one on India. Federal prosecutors on Wednesday charged India - an Indian national in a murder-for-hire scheme targeting a Sikh separatist and activist in New York who's a U.S. citizen. According to the indictment, the assassination plot was organized by an Indian Government official. The U.S. charges come shortly after Canada - Canada's Prime Minister said that an Indian government - the Indian Government participated in extrajudicial killing of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil. Are you concerned that India is turning to tactics that violate international human rights law to silence its critics around the world? Thank you.",

I can tell you that for the United States, for Israel, for other countries who have their citizens being held captive by Hamas, clearly we want to see this process continue, move forward. We want an eighth day and beyond so that people can be returned to their families, and that applies to all hostages, whatever category they may happen to be in.But it's also up to Hamas, and again, I can't speak to their intentions. I can say that I think this process has clearly been beneficial, and the fact that so many have now been reunited with their loved ones and families is something we, I think, take joy in. But a lot of unfinished business, and we're determined to finish it when it comes to bringing the hostages home. With regard to extremist violence, all I can tell you is this: We're looking to the Israeli Government to take some additional steps to really put a stop to this. And at the same time, we're considering our own steps. Finally, with regard to India, first, this is an ongoing legal matter. So you'll understand I can't comment on it in detail.

He said that Israel agreed with U.S. insistence that when hostilities resume - before hostilities resume, there has to be a plan in place to protect civilian life. He was also asked a significant question about access to the hostages by the Red Cross, something that we've brought up in conversation multiple times with officials. We have not gotten a clear answer as to whether the Red Cross being able to access some of the hostages being held in Gaza was part of the deal. If so, why that isn't happening, if it's something that Hamas is blocking, perhaps. The Secretary of State did not get into detail. He didn't confirm whether or not that was part of the deal, though he did say that that would be a good development.And then another bit that the Secretary of State shared with reporters that I thought was newsworthy is the fact that he apparently brought his concerns about corruption within the Palestinian Authority directly to Mahmoud Abbas, saying there has to be reform.",

That's just the clear evidence of how this process has been skewed, how this process is sloppy, and how it is contradictory to the core.
