I'm Christiane Amanpour in Kyiv, where extra security measures are being implemented on the eve of the anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion. There are fears that Putin could launch a fresh wave of attacks. But over this year, people have become hard into this threat, and increasingly, they are optimistic that they will be able to resist. Right now, the situation is worse in cities, towns, and villages, on the eastern front, like in Bakhmut and the town of Vuhledar.

While the fight for Bakhmut is largely symbolic, this is a very strategic fight for both sides. Vuhledar is unique and that it sits at the intersection of the two main active fronts in Ukraine, this southern and the eastern front, that is why Russia wants to try to push through here to launch an offensive into Donbas. It is believed that this is one of their shaping operations, the beginning of a larger offensive to come in the next few weeks. But they are struggling very badly right now. They've lost a huge amount of men and armored vehicles as they try to cross open fields, including mine fields, where the Ukrainians have been able to inflict a huge amount of damage on their troops. At the same time, the Russians are absolutely pummeling this town. You can see all around me, these are Soviet-era apartment blocks. Now, largely empty. The residents have fled and almost every single one destroyed in varying degrees. All of the windows have been blown out, craters here in the ground where children used to play. Ukrainians have the benefit of the higher ground here and these buildings to use in the fighting. But as with so many of the battles here in eastern Ukraine, it is a fight of attrition. Who can hold out the longest? The Ukrainian side saying, they need more ammunition to be able to keep the Russians at bay, to keep them from advancing. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But at the end of the day, China is not really going anywhere. There are a lot of ways in which, you know, we continue to, you know, need to coexist, you know, on some terms or other. And it's going to be hard for us to meet many of our own objectives, you know, whether that's, you know, meeting our climate objectives, without, you know, continuing to do business with Chinese entities, many of whom are, you know, innovating in clean tech. And so, I think it's very unfortunate when you have, you know, people like Virginia Governor Youngkin, you know, suggesting, you know, a Ford battery plant that uses or license as Chinese technology, where they are ahead of the U.S. in that technology, saying, well, we don't -- you know, that would be, you know, like letting the Chinese communist party inside our gates. And that's an own goal. That is not helping us or, you know, Americans, to be kind of this major reactiveness. But it's really, you know, I think part of the broader dynamic that we face here in the United States where, you know, taking shots at one another and kind of targeting the Chinese boogeyman seems, you know, politically beneficial.",

The security threat here is not particularly crystal clear. You might say that there are certain pieces of land near military sites that you might want to be particularly careful with and have kind of a mechanism to scrutinize that. But a blanket ban on foreign ownership of real estate is -- you know, goes against everything that, you know, we stand for. This is a land that was built by immigrants. And frankly, a lot of our competitiveness, you know, in high-tech areas really depends upon, you know, the kind of emigration and assimilation of foreign talents into the United States. And so, even if there is a carve out for, you know, permanent residence, people who have -- are on the pathway to citizenship, that pathway is very long and there are -- you know, first, they come over as graduate students and stay here as post docs and then, you know, go off into industry. And these folks want to contribute, you know, to American scientific and technological leadership. But surveys suggest that 60 percent of Asian American scientists of Chinese origin, you know, say that they feel unwelcome and are thinking about leaving. And so, we want to, here in the United States, continue to lead in innovating on these technologies. We also have to nurture the talent that is going to allow the United States to remain at this frontier.",

And so, I would say, here, we might want to do a lot more on the side of helping those who are already democratic, stay democratic and deepen their democracy and do a little less to exacerbate the insecurities of authoritarian leaders around the world. That's not to say that we love, obviously (INAUDIBLE). I -- you know, I want to see, you know, democracies light continues to shine, but we need to do, first, the work here at home and then, we have to also recognize that we need to prioritize the use of American resources and political capital around the world where it will be most effective and not counterproductive.
