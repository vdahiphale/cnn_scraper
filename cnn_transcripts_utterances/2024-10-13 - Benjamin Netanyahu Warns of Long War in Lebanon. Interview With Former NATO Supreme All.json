Lebanon has the sovereign obligation to make sure its territory is not used by itself or anyone else, in this case Hezbollah, to attack other countries. They're unable to fulfill that sovereign obligation. So to me, Israel had every right to go in.Israel has now realized its initial war aims. You have Hezbollah saying, we are prepared for a ceasefire. They have delinked that from a ceasefire in Gaza. The whole Israeli national security goal is to allow 60,000 to 70,000 Israelis who are moved back after October 7th, to move back to their homes, presumably that can happen. What's happening now, though, Fareed, is really interesting. In the midst of war, Israel is essentially up its war aims, reminds me a little bit of what happened to the United States and Korea after we pushed back the north to the 38th parallel, we said, maybe now we can go further.",

And then in April, they launched those ballistic missiles and drones. And now, you know, in October, they repeated that because they felt that a pre-strike did not restored deterrence.Like the Israelis, I think both of these belligerents, Iran and Israel, are in the process of renegotiating red lines. Those red lines that existed before and regulated the rivalry have been upended. And partly again, I think the decapitation of Hezbollah leadership, which has been the linchpin of Iran's resistance axis. and the primary deterrent for Iran against direct Israel strikes on its territory. I think that has changed that calculus. On the Israeli side, I'm afraid that the prime minister might be seeing and his right-wing ministers this as the unique opportunity to achieve or to go into what many Israelis say it was an inevitable war, the big war, going after the source.

Yet the reason they are there, which is ISIS, seems to be a problem that has not gone away. ISIS has expanded its operations in Syria. There are even some accounts that it has made terror attacks within Iraq. Are you sure that if U.S. troops leave ISIS will not return as it did once in the past?MOHAMMED SHIA AL-SUDANI, IRAQI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): My government has committed itself in front of the parliament to rearrange its relationship with the international alliance to fight ISIS. This alliance was formed because of an invitation by the Iraqi government in 2014. And this alliance achieved, with the help of Iraq and friends outside of the alliance, historical success by defeating ISIS. The end of operation inherent resolve does not mean that Iraq will cut its relationships with the countries in the international alliance especially the United States. Rather, it will move forward with a bilateral security relationship based on the Iraqi constitution and law. ZAKARIA: It's 21 years now since the United States' operation in Iraq. But I think the concern most Americans would have is, we've spent a lot of blood and treasure in Iraq. We ended up with what is maybe somewhat democratic government but it's pro-Iranian. It is corrupt. It does not -- it does not, in any way, seem to embrace America and its interests. Are they right? AL-SUDANI (through translator): This is not correct. The problem is, everybody looks at Iraq through its relationship with Iran. Yes, there is a tense relationship between the United States and Iran, and this is actually a problem on how to manage this relationship. Iran is a neighboring country. We have a lot in common culturally, religiously, and socially. And they supported us and the political process, and supported our efforts against terrorism. Iraq and the United States have had a strategic framework agreement since 2008. And our mission and our role as a government is to activate this agreement, to have a relationship in the fields of economy, education, health, and technology instead of cooperating only in the security and military aspect.",
