We're live in Paris with the latest on the shooting that left three people dead. Then, temperatures across the U.S. dropped to deadly lows as a massive Winter storm hits almost every corner of the lower 48. And later, Santa Claus is coming to town, and Norad is looking out for him. I'll speak with the deputy Commander of the Annual Holiday Mission. A heinous attack on the Kurdish community in the heart of Paris. Those words from French President Emmanuel Macron after a deadly shooting in the French capital left three people dead, and at least four others wounded. The shock, dismay and anger on the streets of Paris right now. Furious demonstrators are clashing with police, setting fires and damaging buildings. The police have pushed back the crowds with tear gas. These protests erupted hours ago after a gunman opened fire at a Kurdish community center. The suspected killers under arrest with Paris prosecutors saying he has a history of racist violence. Well, CNN's Jim Bittermann is standing by for us, live in Paris. Jim, I know you were down on the streets earlier, as those protests broke out. Just bring us up to speed of what the situation is now on the ground, and what more you are learning about the attacker and his motive.",

And the police are never very welcome there. So when the police struck up accord this afternoon, in terms of investigating the murders, the crowds gathered almost immediately. And they began throwing objects at the police. The police responded with tear gas. And then it was this kind of cat-and-mouse game, up and down the streets as the protesters continue their violence towards the police, and even towards firemen. And there were some firemen that were called in to put out street fires that had been set and garbage piles and things, and as a consequence, the police had to intervene to protect the firemen. In any case, this attack is pretty much assured that -- we were assured by officials that it's pretty much racially-motivated. The interior minister who went to the scene almost said as much this afternoon when he was there. Here's what he said.

Iranian authorities have been brutally cracking down on dissent after thousands began protesting the death of a young woman in police custody in September. Those who have been arrested are languishing in jails or suffering torture. Now the families of dozens of detainees fear their loved ones may be facing an even worse fate. Nima Elbagir has this exclusive report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  My son has been sentenced to execution. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator):  Mohammed Gubalu(ph) is only 22. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator):  My son is innocent. For the love of God, help him. NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER (voice-over):  Desperate families in Iran, risking it all with a plea to the world to save their loved ones from execution. Fearing that detainees in Iran are set to face a wave of executions in an accelerated judicial process, while holiday celebrations have the world's attention elsewhere. (on camera):  In collaboration with Iranian activist group 1500Tasvir, we worked to verify court documents which show that dozens of Iranians, including high-profile Iranian athletes face execution. We also work to verify video pleas like this one. From this 81-year-old mother of one of the detainees. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator):  We don't know his whereabouts, no information about him, nor do we even know where he is. ELBAGIR (voice-over):  This document from inside the Isfahan regional court shows that at least ten people have been charged with moharebeh, war against God, spreading corruption on earth, and other charges, all which carry the possibility of the death penalty. (on camera):  Through obtaining and verifying court documents and witness testimony, we have evidence which supports a rush-through judicial process. Defendants having court-appointed counsel forced on them. Many defendants having their right to appeal refused. Some defendants faced with charges which could carry the death sentence been handed down in a single sitting. Terrified Iranian families believe that while the world is busy celebrating the holiday season, busy with their families, that they, in Iran, face imminent execution of their loved ones. (voice-over):  CNN has confirmed that Iranian footballer, Amir Azadani is among those facing execution. Here he is, training ahead of match day. Now, he is on death row waiting. This is social media video from the night of his arrest. CNN made contact with someone close to Nasr-Azadani Iran. We are not disclosing their identity. They told us that in the days after his arrest, they were unable to get word from him or about him, from authorities. Even as the Iranian authorities denied his arrest.

Speaking to a conference in Kyiv after histrip to the U.S., Volodymyr Zelenskyy says his forces won't rest until they defeat Russia. Meanwhile, the Kremlin says it's making progress in the, quote, \"demilitarization of Ukraine\". Even though President Vladimir Putin is meeting with defense industry officials to discuss problems with weapons supplies. Will Ripley brings us the latest now from Kyiv. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  Here in Kyiv, they're certainly listening very carefully to those words out of the Kremlin, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, for the first time, calling what he did call a special military operation, a war. Now, the question is, was that a slip of the tongue or did he do it deliberately? And that's very important to figure out what the reality is. Because if it was an accident, if Putin essentially broke his own ban on uttering the word, \"war\" for the last 10 months, and if he actually does believe that what he is doing to Ukraine is now a war, that would potentially allow him to declare martial law and pour even more resources into his military. Which has certainly been struggling on the front lines. Putin had a military modernization meeting, saying that the mobilization process needs to be upgraded, saying that the military needs to get every single resource it needs, even send his defense minister, supposedly, to the frontlines. In a Russian propaganda video that was released this week, the defense minister telling everybody to keep calm and everything was going to be fine, he said. But of course, Russian troops, according to intercepted telephone calls, don't necessarily think that things are fine. The Ukrainian military occasionally releases these things, and even though we can't verify their authenticity, they seem to indicate a sense of frustration among a lot of Russian troops on the ground, fighting against Ukrainians, who have been able to hold the lines despite relentless bombardment in places like Bakhmut. Of course, there's also been a Russian assault on the liberated southern city of Kherson. You know, in a lot of these frontline cities, people barely have the basics to survive. They barely have electricity or running water. Sometimes the only way they can get Wi-Fi or heat or even a hot cup of coffee is to go to an underground bomb shelter. Here in the capital, Kyiv, the situation is slightly better. But people are still struggling right now. The water service here has been disrupted. And a lot of people say they have power for maybe an hour a day in the capital city. That's why Ukraine says they're so grateful for these Patriot missile defense systems from the United States. But of course, there's a lot of training, months of training that has to happen between now and the time that those systems are actually deployed. Which means it could be a very long and difficult Winter ahead here in Ukraine. Will Ripley, CNN, Kyiv. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So, that will be one legislative victory as a result of this investigation. Now this investigation has been going on for over a year and a half. And I was actually pretty surprised by how much new information there was in this report. We had, of course, these blockbuster hearings with high profile witnesses over the summer. There was a hearing earlier this week and executive summary. So it was interesting to see the new evidence that they laid out in support of this conclusion that January 6 would not have happened without the Former President. This revealed new details about how it was always the plan, it was premeditated to declare victory no matter what the election outcome was. We got new details about over 120 -- excuse me, over 200 attempts to press state officials to overturn election results and new details about what was going on in the White House while the Capitol was attacked. Former aides of the president testifying that he watched this unfold on TV made no calls to get help for those on Capitol Hill, and that they were disgusted and surprised really that he would use his time and energy to tweet attacks on his own vice president while this violence was being carried out. And we do expect the committee will be releasing additional transcripts of interviews that is conducted with witnesses, many people in Trump's orbit, so likely more to come over the next weeks.

They've been asking for a lot of these transcripts. They've wanted this information. CNN has learned that earlier this month, the Special Counsel requested from the committee in a letter, all of the evidence that it has gathered, they're finally getting more of these transcripts.

And this time, during that night, we're on the standby to be able to actually pay visit, but also be able to actually assist in any event that he would require assistance. And so excitement because we launch with the fighter jet very quickly, get on the vector, get airborne, and get above the cloud and meet with Santa. And it's just an amazing sight to actually be able to see the sleighs and the reindeer but also get to wave at Santa by rocking our wings and e-wave at him with this big white glove there, so.",
