This is another historic moment, day two of a historic trial where you've got a criminal trial for a former president of the United States of America, a very important day. Jury selection is under way and we'll continue again today.We're joined now this morning by CNN reporter Kara Scannell along with CNN National Correspondent Kristen Holmes. I'm glad that both of you are here. Let's talk about what's going to happen today. We know it got to a late start yesterday, Kara, with all the pretrial motions happening in court, whether it was about recusal or sanctions for violating the gag order allegedly. Now, we're in the thick of jury selection. What are we going to see today? KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  All right. We finally got down to business around 2:30 yesterday afternoon and they seated about nine jurors in the box so far, meaning that they went through the questioning of that 42-questionnaire and had jurors there. Now, they just started that again today. The goal here is to ultimately see the jury of 12 jurors and 6 alternates. And how we expect this will play out today is that, they will continue to pose questions to the jurors until they have a massive 18 to fill the jury box. And then at that point, the way that the judge described how this would play out yesterday, he said that lawyers would then have 30 minutes to ask questions of these jurors. And at then point they could see if anyone is going to be struck for cause, meaning that they're not fair and impartial, or, you know, a judge feels that there's a reason why they couldn't serve. And the prosecutor and the defense, Trump's team, could then strike a juror. And they will continue this process, because if someone is stricken, they bring someone else new into the box, start the questioning again until they ultimately have the final 18.",

But these people who are in the box right now may not ultimately be the ones to sit there ultimately. You got the peremptory strikes to come right in for cause.Tell me about what it's been like inside this courtroom having Donald Trump there. He now wants to be able to at least sidebar at the table in front of the judge, very limited. I mean, this is a generous amount of space to think about right now if we were in front of a judge to have the president, Secret Service potentially, the lawyers there. What is that going to be like?",

He says because the roving room, which is where this would take place, could only fit 12 people. And he said with Secret service, though, lawyers, their staff, clerks, there's just not enough room.So, he says what he would do instead is he will excuse all of the jurors, have them all leave the courtroom except for the one that has to be questioned one-on-one, and he sets the lawyers. Look, I don't want you to encourage jurors to ask to be question privately. This should only be something if it's particularly sensitive and that they don't want to say in front of this room. You know, it's not a room of about 100 people, 90 or so jurors, a pool of reporters and all the lawyers. So, he's going to excuse the jurors and then have the juror answer the questions there with a microphone. So, it won't be that intimate setting one-on-one this potentially this close to Donald Trump as you're being asked to answer questions. It will be in the courtroom. It will just not have the rest of the jury there. COATES:  I mean this is the court of law that we're in front of, but the court a public opinion, Kristen, will be utilized by this defendant, as it has been, either on the courthouse steps, or, of course, there's other means of communicating.

It could mean it's a fair jury, and they end up following the evidence that shows a conviction. But I think in Trump's world, he believes possibly that a fairness will only equal acquittal. But this jury pool could be impartial, and still the prosecution must prove their burden.But it's still not going to be a cakewalk, is it? I mean, a lot of the information they're going to be hearing, many of these jurors, the jury questionnaire, which is quite lengthy, are going to be familiar with at least some parts or characters in this, whether it's Stormy Daniels or Michael Cohen, or of course, Donald Trump himself.

The judge has steered away from that.But these are specific questions of, you know, have you listened to Michael Cohen's podcast? Have you read his book or any of Donald Trump's books? Have you attended any rallies in support of Donald Trump or any and against Donald Trump? Have you ever volunteered for a campaign? And the judge has been very clear here. He's saying, you know, because one of Trump's lawyers had said at one point, ultimately, he wants to know, do you like Donald Trump or not? And the judge said, that's not what we're doing here. You can have an opinion, but can you be fair and impartial? Can you set it aside?

GREEN, LAWYER FOR JAN. 6 DEFENDANT:  -- the impairment of integrity or availability of information and evidence to be used in a proceeding. In 2002, Congress hedged a little bit and added Section C2 to cover other forms of impairment, the known unknowns, so to speak. It was, after all, that dawn of the information age. Until the January 6th prosecutions, Section 1512(c)(2), The Otherwise provision, had never been used to prosecute anything other than evidence tampering. And that was for good reason. This court has said that otherwise, when used in a criminal statute, statute means to do similar conduct in a different way. The government would have you ignore all that or disregard all that and instead convert C2 from a catch-all provision into a dragnet. One of the things that that drag net would cover is Section C1. Our construction of this statute at least leaves C1 and C2 to do some independent work. The January 6th prosecutions demonstrate that there are a host of felony and misdemeanor crimes that cover the alleged conduct. A Sarbanes-Oxley-based, Enron-driven, evidence-tampering statute is not one of them. I welcome the court's questions. JUSTICE CLARENCE THOMAS, U.S. SUPREME COURT:  Mr. Green, how do we determine what these two provisions have in common? Do we look after the otherwise or before and why?",

If you start yelling, I think no one would question that you can be expected to be kicked out under this policy, even though yelling has nothing to do with photograph or recording. The object that the verb is looking at -- the verbs are looking at is the obstruction. It's not the manner in which you obstruct, it's the fact that you've obstructed. Isn't that the structure of this provision? GREEN:  It is, your Honor. It's in part the structure of the provision.
