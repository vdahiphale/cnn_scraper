Anthony Blinken makes a surprise visit to Kyiv to meet with President Zelenskyy. What a difference a week makes. Greece goes from raging wildfires to epic floods. More details in our weather update. And Spain's football federation sacks the woman's national team coach and names a woman to replace him. Jorge Vilda calls his firing unfair. U.S. Secretary State Anthony Blinken is on the ground in Kyiv at this hour on a surprise visit. America's top diplomat is set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Whilst he's there, Blinken wants to hear from Ukrainians themselves, including the country's new defense minister, on how their counteroffensive is going. It's his third trip to Kyiv since Russia's invasion nearly 19 months ago, and it comes just hours after a series of missiles targeted the Ukrainian capital. Melissa Bell joins us live from Kyiv with the details. Have you had any updates on the discussion so far, Melissa?",

      "sentences": "Well, so far he has yet to see President Zelenskyy himself. What we do -- what we have seen Secretary Blinken do already since he's arrived in Kyiv, Max, is meet with his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, but also Ukraine's prime minister.And those meetings have been all about, first of all, working out what's been happening most recently on the ground for Secretary Blinken. We've been hearing the state department's assessment of how the counteroffensive going. We've been hearing about the impressive gains being made to the south and to the east. But this is very much about Secretary Blinken finding out from his counterparts exactly how that is going. It comes, of course, at a critical time, Max, since it isn't just that the counteroffensive seeks to make progress. It is also at a time when there is waning American support, according to the polls, for continued funding of this war effort. And bear in mind, the Secretary Blinken's visit comes less than a month, Max, after President Biden asked for an extra $24 billion from Congress for that aid. So it's going to be all about hearing what his counterparts have to say, making a show of continued solidarity and American support for this effort, but also taking back to the American people the message that he's hearing from here about what is happening on the front, on the fight against corruption, on Ukraine's ability to function as a democracy going forward. And, in fact, that's very much what he just said to his Ukrainian counterpart as he met him, that this visit is, of course, about figuring out what they need in the immediate, but also ensuring that Ukraine has what it needs to be a thriving democracy going forward. So there was a great deal of warmth between those two men. President Blinken pointing out that they've been working around the clock and around the world together now for a year and a half. But as we get into this 19th month of the war, Max, it is very much about what message they are going to take on with them to the United Nations later this month when the rest of the world gathers together to hear from President Zelenskyy and to consider its ongoing support for what's happening here.",

Secretary General Antonio Guterres said Africa can be a renewable energy powerhouse, and one of the topics has been about green hydrogen.

So essentially, you take renewable energy, you run a current through water, and you separate hydrogen and oxygen. And that hydrogen can form the basis of so many things.It can be used for power generation. It can be used in many industrial applications to form molecules or green fuels for shipping and aviation. So Africa, as you mentioned, we've faced disproportionate impact of climate change. We have the least emissions in Africa, but at the same time, we have the greatest potential. 40 percent of the world's renewable energy sits here. So this is really a chance for us to use that renewable energy to create things like hydrogen and their associated derivatives and get involved in industrialization, in going up the value chain, so we can produce a lot.

There is the ongoing issue of their president, Luis Rubiales suspended by FIFA, but still refusing to resign from his post. This is another step that has been taken. Sacking Jorge Vilda, the coach who has been responsible for, in many people's opinions, breeding this culture, which is not the right way to do things. So, yes, on paper it's a great headline. They have a new female boss of the women's national team for the first time. But a lot of people are saying the silence from the players is perhaps quite deafening. There has not been the great clamor of celebration, hurrah, we have somebody in our corner who is now going to take us forward. Montse Tome is somebody who has only ever been an assistant coach under Jorge Vilda and the systems at this Spanish Federation that a lot of people are so upset about.

However, the judge said Enrique Tarrio had an outsized impact on the events of that day. Now he's heading to jail for 22 years for his role in organizing the plot aimed at stopping the transfer of power from Donald Trump to Joe Biden.Sara Murray has the details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SARA MURRAY, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): More than two decades behind bars for the man U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly called the ultimate leader behind the January 6 attack on the Capitol. In Tuesday's hearing, Kelly said former Proud Boys Chairman Enrique Tarrio was motivated by revolutionary zeal. \"What happened that day did not honor the founders, it was the kind of thing they wrote the Constitution to prevent\", the judge said. Before being sentenced for seditious conspiracy and other charges, Tarrio apologized for the, quote, \"pain and suffering that was caused\". Quote, \"I am not a political zealot. Inflicting harm or changing the outcome of the election was not my goal\". Tarrio also adding, \"I held myself morally above others, and this trial has shown me how wrong I was\". Tarrio was not in D.C. on January 6, having been arrested days before and ordered by a judge to leave the city for burning a D.C. Church's Black Lives Matter banner and bringing high capacity rifle magazines into the district the previous month. But the judge said even though Tarrio wasn't there, the Proud Boys leader, quote, \"had an outsized impact on the events of the day\". During the months long trial, prosecutors showed evidence that Tarrio was readying for a revolution and helped create a command structure within the Proud Boys in the run up to the insurrection. \"Make no mistake\", Tarrio told other Proud Boys on January 6, \"We did this\". During Tuesday's sentencing hearing, the prosecutor called Tarrio, \"the leader of this conspiracy\" that \"targeted our entire system of government\". Tarrio's attorney promising an appeal. NAYIB HASSAN, ENRIQUE TARRIO'S LAWYER: We respectfully disagree, but we respect it. There will be a day and a time where an appeal will come, and we expect appeal to come soon. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

But families of the victims say their cases aren't getting the attention that they deserve.CNN's Hadas Gold takes a closer look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A mother's anguish, her grief still fresh. \"Enough,\" she cries. \"We want to live in peace and quiet. We want to find who is behind all of this. Why, why, why kill these kids?\" Sajida Musala's (ph) son, Ali, was murdered just last week, a year out from a stint in prison. An Arab citizen of Israel, he is one of the latest victims in an alarming crime wave that is rocking the Arab community across the country. At a recent protest in the northern Israeli city of Haifa, thousands turned out to call for equal justice. Arabs make up around 20 percent of Israeli citizens. Many speak fluent Hebrew and also identify as Palestinian. But they say Israeli authorities are not treating their cases the same as Jewish ones. Dashika (ph) says she blames police, government and the law. Her son was set to be married soon. When we ask whether the police had made any progress on the case, she says not yet and stops, overcome by emotion. (on-camera): These coffins represent the more than 160 Arab Israeli citizens of Israel, who have been killed thus far this year. These numbers far eclipsed previous years for the same period. And these coffins, many of them have messages, saying what their victims were doing when they were killed. Some of them say, \"I was out getting a pizza.\" \"I was studying for my university exams.\" And these citizens, they say that this government is not doing enough to protect them. (voice-over): In addition to targeted killings, innocent civilians, including children, have been caught in the crossfire. Badiya Hefasi's (ph) daughter, Johara (ph), was an antiviolence and women's rights activists, killed last year when a bomb exploded under her car. Her mother, who identifies as an Arab Druze Israeli citizen said the police have made no progress. \"I feel like a neglected stranger in a completely neglected, dictatorial country,\" she says. \"I don't have a sense of belonging.\" The reasons behind the violence include gang warfare, loan sharking, an influx of guns and, activists say, a vacuum in the Israeli policing of Arab communities and fear of cooperating with police investigations. Israel police declined our request for an interview. Arab Israeli politicians like Ahmad Tibi say far-right ministers are to blame, especially minister of national security Itamar Ben-Gvir. He himself was convicted of anti-Arab racism.",
