The NASDAQ is showing some pretty strong gains, up nearly one-and-a-half percent. We'll put some meat on those bones as we move through the hour. The events that we're looking at: President Biden is on his way to Maui, more than 800 people are still missing after the deadly wildfires that swept the island. The demand for the hit weight-loss drug, Wegovy is so high -- Wegovy is so high, it is keeping interest rates lower in Denmark, but it's not a good thing. And Russia's first lunar mission in decades ends in failure. Now, India will try to be the first to land on the moon's south pole. We are live in New York. It's Monday. It is August the 21st. Where has August gone? I'm Richard Quest back from Mongolia and back in New York, I mean business. Good evening. President Biden is due to arrive in Maui in the next few hours, on his first visit, since the Hawaiian island was hit by the devastating wildfires. Now according to state officials, around 850 people are remaining on the missing list; 114 people so far confirmed dead, as the president heads to survey the damage. Meanwhile, there's another historic climate emergency unfolding just a few thousand miles away in Southern California. Hilary has weakened after hitting the state as a tropical storm on Sunday, but it is still dumping historic amounts of rainfall and that is taking its own toll. It is turning streets like this one into coursing rivers. Lives and property-owned stake are in danger. It's the strongest tropical storm to hit the America West Coast since 1997. So on both sides, if you will, of the Pacific, or at least of the US Pacific from the West Coast of the United States, Continental United States to Hawaii, the president is flying west. He will land in Maui in the coming hours. CNN's Bill Weir has been reporting for an hour well over a week. Bill, let's first of all deal with the situation in Maui. And the progress that is being made, such as it is, and then we can talk about California. Bring me up to date with Maui.",

Richard, there are those veryenthused to have the federal support, others saying he shouldn't come; feeling still hurt from the fact that he said \"no comment\" when asked about this. The White House said he didn't hear the question, but there was five days of silence from a man who is usually the empathizer-in-chief given the tragedy in his life, he will fly over downtown Lahaina, the burned area here. And then actually, we're told take a tour on the ground with officials, Front Street, before meeting with survivors and first responders in a nearby shelter. It's that missing number, Richard that has so many people stressed here. The mayor said last night that originally, it was more than 2,000 people on the list of the missing. The FBI helped whittle that down to 850. Communications has been up really for a long time now. So the question is, will those people ever be found? Or will this be sort of a sacred site in that way, the fact that the downtown was essentially cremated there. So a lot of psychological pain right now, and a lot of just one foot in front of the other as people try to pick up the pieces, figure out the next step, living in hotels moving to the mainland, jobs gone -- it is complicated on so many levels here. And we'll be talking about that with the development authority in just a second. Turn our attention if we may, Bill, to Southern California and now, this is an interesting one because they've got more rain than they've ever had at this time.

I actually met a couple at our hotel who said they cameover from Oahu to spend some money as a way of supporting people here and you could tell they were really earnestly trying to figure out the most delicate, sensible, and respectful way to do that. Celebrities from Hawaii, a lot of locals, big surfers said initially, don't come, we're grieving, give us time to heal, give us space. But then other leaders had said look, these islands tremendously on those tourism dollars. If that dries up, it's not like COVID where people got a check from the government for months. These immediate sort of $750.00 checks for the folks, that's going to run out, and so, you're hearing more and more support to this place by coming to Hawaii. It is really conflicted messages, but it's really about just respectfulness. Right? I mean, if you are in Wailea, for example, there is no reason to come snorkeling, you know, while they're searching for bodies in Lahaina, which some people did days after the disaster. So in a lot of cases, just a few idiots, frankly, who make it difficult for everybody else.

The Hawaiian actor, Jason Momoa says it's too soon to act like everything is normal with families newly grieving and hundreds still accounted for. And tourism officials, on the other hand want visitors to return and fast, look at the numbers, you'll see why. They say as many as 10,000 jobs have been lost.

How can we, as an economic development organization, work with federal support to try to get low interest loans, try to get subsidies et cetera, to our residents who lost their residences and to our businesses, to help them re-establish, and we are working on that with our partners in the community. We're very pleased that actually the president deployed a large number of federal experts and resource people here to our community.

But even with the equipment that they have 87 percent human error, 53 percent of the time one or the other of the parties involved says, well, I was confused. One-third of the near misses are attributed to air traffic control. So, human error. Two, why is air traffic control making so many mistakes? They're supposed to be the ones who keep us separated, there is a horrible shortage of air traffic controllers. The FAA says yes, we can run our facilities at 85 percent capacity. But 77 percent of all FAA facilities aren't even up to 85 percent of the capacity. The reason for that, reason number three which everybody blames everything on is COVID. During COVID, the FAA stopped hiring and stopped training controllers. Well, almost stopped, you know, not planning for what would happen with the huge buildup on people could travel again. And then finally, you know, it comes down to the big ask. The FAA asked the airlines to voluntarily cut back on flights. They did for a while, some did for a while. But then the summer picked up and they were right back at full tilt. Now, the airline said, well, we use bigger airplanes, so we don't have as many air traffic control events. But that hasn't helped. And, for example, New York trade -- who is swamped.",

Russia tried to land its Luna 25 there yesterday. The craft crashed after losing control as it entered the atmosphere of the moon, which is becoming an engine failure as the country's first machine 47 years. Now it's India's turn on Wednesday. If successful, it will be the first country to land on the moon's south pole ever. Miles O'Brien is with me from Massachusetts. Miles, I suppose we shouldn't have too much schadenfreude at the Russians misfortune in crashing into (INAUDIBLE) others have done things similar on other projects. But they were trying to do something that's not been done before. MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AVIATION ANALYST: Yes. And I think it's tempting to go that route, Richard. But anybody who cares about space exploration truly doesn't like to see new craters being formed on the moon because of an accident like this. You know, this is in emblematic, probably symptomatic of what's going on inside the Russian space program in the wake of the Ukraine invasion. It's actually something that began before that invasion as the International Space enterprise moved in different directions and the money moved to private enterprises. SpaceX being a big example of them. And as a result, what's left in the -- was the great Soviet space program is pretty much a shell of what it once was.",

Now let's -- to be fair, here, they are coming off of their own mishap in 2019. The Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft crash then. They have revamped it, they've made it lighter, they've improved the software, done all they think they can to make this more successful. You know, at the bottom line here, we have to remember space is hard. It's difficult to do these things. But this is kind of a tortoise and hare story here. Russia launched from its Russian spaceport itself. Pet project of Vladimir Putin, because of course, as you know, they've always launched from Kazakhstan. And he wanted to repatriate the missions to Russia. He wanted to get this off as a point of personal pride and dare we say vanity and get there before the Indians which didn't happen. So here you have the Indians with a very lean mission, very fuel efficient, taking longer, and maybe they'll just win the race.",

      "sentences": "Yes. What's the advantage of the southern pole in terms of greater space exploration deeper, further, farther?O'BRIEN: Yeah, it's a -- it's a two-part question. A few years back, we discovered not we, not me but scientists discovered ice in the south pole of the moon, that is H2O. H and O are rocket fuel, hydrogen and oxygen. So, in theory, if you had an outpost there, you could manufacture rocket fuel on the moon and use it as a launching point to who knows where and beyond. The other aspect of this, Richard, is if you look at the Indian space program and for that matter, the Chinese space program, they are following the U.S. in one way we haven't tracked as closely, which is they are embracing the free enterprise side of things. And there is huge ecosystems that are being nourished in both countries right now for private small space startups. They are copying the U.S. approach to move things into the private sector. And that in and of itself creates a more robust program as we've seen here in the United States. So, I think what's happening now is a very different kind of space race which ultimately leads to a lot of technological advances on the ground. And after all, as we always say, it's not like you bundle up $100 bills and ship them into space. The money gets spent here.",

It allows -- it has allowed SpaceX in the -- with appropriate investment and SpaceX has put it at the forefront, other -- Blue Origin and others are doing good things.
