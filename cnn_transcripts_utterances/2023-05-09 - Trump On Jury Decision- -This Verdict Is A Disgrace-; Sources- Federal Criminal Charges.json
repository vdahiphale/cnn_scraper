The first former President to be criminally indicted is now also the first former President, and current presidential candidate, to be found liable, for sexual abuse, and defamation, in a civil trial. Also tonight, freshman congressman, George Santos, the Republican, from New York, infamous for his cascade of lies, was charged by the Justice Department, in a federal probe. That news broke right here, on CNN, today, by my colleagues, Evan Perez and Mark Morales. And we also have new details, on what may have been the most important meeting, in the world, today, one, to prevent a global financial meltdown, and economic doom, here at home, as America stares down the possibility, of its first ever debt default. Was any progress made? President Biden addressed Americans, tonight. And the key congressional players, who met with him, are talking. But first, the verdict in Manhattan. A federal jury, finding Donald Trump liable, for sexually abusing E. Jean Carroll, in a Manhattan department store dressing room, in the mid-90s. He owes Carroll, $5 million, for battery and defamation. Carroll reacted in a statement, saying, quote, \"Today, the world finally knows the truth.\" Trump's response, quote, \"I have absolutely no idea who this woman is. This verdict is a disgrace -- a continuation of the greatest witch hunt of all time!\" Today's development follows the ex-President's criminal indictment, on 34 felony counts, in a hush money case. He could potentially face more charges, soon, in Georgia, an election interference probe, there, and still remains in great legal jeopardy, with the Special Counsel's ongoing January 6 and classified documents investigations. We're joined now by Trump attorney, Alina Habba. Thank you so much for joining me. If Donald Trump didn't sexually assault E. Jean Carroll, why did he not testify and tell the jury that himself?",

He also made clear that he said that it would be a burden if he came to the court.We made a decision that his testimony, as it stood, was fine. And you have to remember, when you don't do anything wrong, the testimony is going to be very limited. We don't know the day. We don't know the year. So, I didn't have much to ask him, frankly. And I think that was very clear. We did not know what to say. If somebody says, \"You stole scissors, from me, but I can't tell you what day what year,\" we're going to say, \"OK, did you rape her?\" \"No.\" And you know what?

Only in the State of New York, could you be found not guilty of rape, but then you defame someone, when you said you didn't rape them. That in itself just doesn't make sense, right? So, we have a law that was put in place that has a one-year opening, for anybody and everybody, and probably E. Jean Carroll, specifically, to bring a claim, against Donald Trump. So, we're going to appeal a lot of things, the constitutionality, the jury that failed to find a rape verdict, but then somehow said he said he was defaming her, when he said he didn't do it, and \"She's not my type.\" All of a sudden, that is a crime, in this country.

Number one, on the question that I think I'm most interested in, now, not the politics, but the legal case, on the appeal. Given what you know about the case, do you believe that there are grounds for appeal? LAURA COATES, CNN CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: I want to just first say, you have been consistent, in your inquiries, based on your journalistic integrity, as to why you're asking the question now. So, I will answer that. And I'll tell you, when you're talking about the appeals process, one of the most fundamental things, to look at is about what the jury actually received. It's not about what's in the court of public opinion. There is a plethora of information there. But a jury can only hear, and decide upon, what comes in into evidence. The most fundamental aspect of a potential appeal would be testimony given, about what's called prior bad acts, a collection of testimony that suggests look, this is not about these specific allegations of E. Jean Carroll, or trying to buttress because you're an eyewitness, but because you're saying \"Listen, here's my experience with this person.\" It's part of an overall M.O., someone's modus operandi. \"This is this person's doing.\" What they do is, and the allegations in their testimony was that he engages in behavior, in these semi-public places, and then will later defame, by calling you a liar. That was the actual impetus behind getting more testimony in. But it's also the really ripe area, where appeals can be actually viable, to suggest that \"Hold on.\" You have to always engage in this balancing test, between what's probative, meaning it'll help illuminate an issue, and what's unduly prejudicial. That's the part of this, I think, will be the most consequential in appeal.",

If they were just simply rabid anti-Trump people, why wouldn't they just throw in the rape charge in there?

And he did not counter it, in a live testimony, for the jury, to actually hear, number one.But number two, perhaps even more importantly, and when you think about how all this goes down, they keep talking about he was cleared of rape. Well, if you actually read the complaint, there were two charges, battery, which is an umbrella term, for an offensive touching, which included, and they actually outlined, it included charges of rape in different degrees. It included sexual abuse and a lesser crime as well of misconduct. And he had a defamation suit against him as well. And so, the idea that he was solely charged with rape, is actually just a misinterpretation, and a misstatement, of what happened. And to say that?

We said, \"We're going to do what we've never really done.\" The vast majority has not voted to raise the debt ceiling. Our constituents didn't send us to Washington, to raise the debt ceiling. We sent over cuts that are in this year, mostly in Washington, they usually put cuts, in the out years, and it saves $5 trillion, over 10 years, a $1 trillion in year one. And sure, you can debate some of them. But it's something that would put us on a path to fiscal responsibility. And to say that it shouldn't be a part of a debt ceiling fight conflicts with everything the President has ever stood for. He said it, as a Senator, in 1984. He said it, as a Senator, in 1994. In 2011, he negotiated a deal, as the Vice President of the United States. So, he's done it in the past.
