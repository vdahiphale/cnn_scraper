If you're just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top stories this hour.Millions of Americans are starting the July -- the 4th of July holiday weekend under heat alerts. A heat wave in the South is peaking on Friday with temperatures near 100 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius. In parts of California and Nevada temperatures could soar up 110 degrees Fahrenheit, 43 degrees Celsius. Plus, the U.S. Supreme Court is wrapping up its term with rulings expected on a number of highly contentious issues. Those include a prominent LBGTQ case in Colorado. And President Biden's ambitious student loan forgiveness program. Now a year after overturning Roe versus Wade, they conservative majority of the U.S. Supreme Court has delivered another stunning reversal to decades of legal precedent. This time soundly rejecting the policy including race in college applications. Thursday's 6-3 decision had been widely expected, but the fallout would be significant. It means most colleges and universities can no longer consider a students race in its acceptance criteria. Data show that admission drops off sharply for Black and Latino students in places where affirmative action have already been banned. The court decision carve out notable exceptions for U.S. military academies, saying race can still be a factor when considering freshman candidates. Now many Asian students supports Thursday's ruling, they claim that affirmative action has been a major obstacle to attending Ivy League universities. CNN's Kyung Lah is in Los Angeles and has our report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KYUNG LAH, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Harvard, Yale, Columbia. Wesley Zhou shows us the rejection letters that ended his Ivy League dream.",

Peterson took cover for more than 45 minutes outside of the building before the shooter was arrested. On the child neglect charges, the state had to prove that Peterson was a caregiver.
