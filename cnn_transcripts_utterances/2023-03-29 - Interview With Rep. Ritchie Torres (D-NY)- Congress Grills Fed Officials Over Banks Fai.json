The second and largest -- rather the 2nd and 3rd largest bank collapses in U.S. history.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. BRAD SHERMAN (D-CA): It's particularly ironic, it's the Fed that's raising the interest rates and then the Fed that's not examining banks to see if they can survive if interest rates go up. The concern we all have is, are there other banks that could go under? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I'm wondering on the legislation though you have the Treasury Department essentially overseeing the potential for a social media bank run. Why not put that responsibility on the banks themselves if they are already monitoring for things like fraud for their own potential weaknesses. Is that a possibility as well?",

I mean, the banks themselves should monitor what is happening on social media, but it's important for the regulators to know whether financial panic, whether a bank run is coming so that we can intervene. Whenever there's a bank run in the making, time is of the essence. The sooner we can intervene. The quicker we can prevent a crisis. So it's all about ensuring that we're proactive and preventing a contagion from spreading to the broader banking system.",

I believe that the Federal Reserve should have put a pause on interest rates. Because these interest rates -- there's just too much happening too fast, and it's destabilizing the banking system.It's also worth noting that the banks are sitting on more than $600 billion in unrealized losses from securities. A powerful case could be made that the Federal Reserve should purchase those securities and remove those losses from bank balance sheets. Because the problem is not the quality of the assets, the problem is that the duration. These are long term assets and their values actually has the ability exactly right. So these are valuable assets and so there would be no harm in purchasing them and stabilizing the banking system.",

But I think what we've seen over the past few months since Prime Minister Netanyahu has formed a government with some extreme right wing elements is that the tensions with the White House have grown.It was just a few months ago that Secretary of State Antony Blinken was here trying to talk to Prime Minister Netanyahu, calm tensions between Israelis and Palestinians. And try to persuade Netanyahu and his government not to expand settlements. But since that conversation, the government here has ignored that advice. So I think what we're seeing from President Biden, who said, look, essentially, I hope that Prime Minister Netanyahu is going to make a compromise over the issue of the judicial reforms. But let's wait and see. So this is sort of the latest phase in that in that tension. And the same Israeli government official who said, look, you know, let's play this down, has also said, well, when it comes to the discussions with the leaders of the opposition, the Prime Minister is saying so far they're going well. But he added, look, the Prime Minister has got red lines on those judicial reforms as well. So I think at the moment, it's a really an open question. Whether or not Netanyahu is going to dial back to sufficiency of the opposition here, to the sufficiency of the protesters and to the sufficiency of the White House. So, I think at the moment we can expect these tensions to continue.",

Right now you -- as we speak, you can get it at drugstores. But you have to ask the pharmacy for it. You don't need a prescription, but you do have to ask the pharmacist. It's behind the counter.So the hope is by moving it on the shelves -- which is expected to happen later this year -- by moving it on the shelves next to the aspirin or the toothpaste or the shampoo that people will be able to buy it more easily. And let's take a look at why this is so important. This is a graph that shows drug deaths from 2020 -- I'm sorry 1999 to 2021. You can see how swiftly they have grown. These are opioid overdose drug deaths. And so what we have now is that in 2021, there were more than 80,000 opioid drug deaths in the United States. And nearly 9,000 children and teens died between 1999 and 2016 from opioids. And so the two questions that are basically left outstanding is, A, why didn't the FDA do this sooner? A lot of people said they should have done this years ago when we're asking for years ago. And then the second one is, how much will Narcan or Naloxone cost when it goes over the counter? If the cost is high -- and we don't know what it's going to be -- if it's high then all of this really might be for not. Because people won't be able to afford to buy it -- Boris, Bianna.",
