New CNN reporting on Tulsi Gabbard's overseas travel.Also, tonight new reporting from \"The Washington Post\" what it's saying about Trump's plans for Special Counsel Jack Smith, his entire team, and how the Justice Department will investigate now the 2020 election. Later, fears of a major escalation in the war after Russia uses an experimental missile to attack Ukraine. Good evening, I'm Jim Sciutto, in tonight for Anderson, and the breaking news tonight, another embattled Cabinet pick for the president-elect. This time, it is Tulsi Gabbard, the one-time Democratic Congresswoman who very publicly switched parties at a Trump rally back in October and whom the president-elect picked as his choice for director of National Intelligence to oversee all of America's sprawling intelligence apparatus, as well as handle some of our country's most sensitive national security secrets. Her choice as DNI had already raised a number of eyebrows and hard questions, in part because of her limited experience in intelligence work, but also and more importantly, she has repeated views on Syria and the war in Ukraine that mirror Russian propaganda, the propaganda of one of the US's chief adversaries. And there is her public support of people such as Julian Assange and Edward Snowden who have leaked US National Security secrets. Tonight, we're learning new information about an incident earlier this year when Gabbard was placed on a government watch list. Our National Security reporter, Zachary Cohen, starts us off. And Zach, what stands out to me is how someone ends up on this list. They get triggered because of overseas travel patterns and foreign connections, and that then triggers an algorithm. Do we know how specifically she triggered that algorithm?",

Now, that's a pattern, a specific pattern, a specific criteria that this algorithm is looking for.And in Gabbard's case, both her overseas travel and things about her foreign connections did match up and did flag and trigger this algorithm. As you mentioned, she did match that pattern that this algorithm is trained to look for. And look, we don't know specifically what it was about this pattern of overseas travel that got Gabbard flagged, nor the specifics of these foreign connections that were enough of a concern that it triggered this algorithm. But look, this is unprecedented and highly unusual for somebody who is nominated to be the leader of the US intelligence community, to even be added to a watch list like this, a watch list that we're told is really a security mechanism and a screening mechanism to ensure somebody is safe to get on an airplane before they board. So that's kind of what we're looking at here.",

You're referring to when Tulsi Gabbard said that she was added to a, \"secret terror watch list.\"This is not a secret terror watch list either this is a list that requires additional screening for individual passengers, and passengers are ultimately cleared through a variety of different ways. It's still unclear how Gabbard ultimately was notified about that, but this is something that in normal times, we are told that she would have to explain through the confirmation process and would ultimately be something that would get looked at as part of an FBI background check. But, Jim, as you know, the Trump transition is bypassing that traditional FBI background check process which is used to give somebody a security clearance, for example. So it'll be interesting to see if Republicans and Democrats in the Senate do raise more questions about this and do ask for an explanation about the underlying foreign travel here that did set off this algorithm.",

What types of places was she going, countries? What types of contacts? Was it foreign leaders? Was it in countries that are of National Security concern? That's what I would take from this, is that a particular place that she was traveling where of National Security concern. So, I do think that this was an algorithm issue where the combination of the places she was going and perhaps the nature of the people that she was meeting with then triggered this particular alert for her, which then just provides a secondary mechanism for TSA and for the Department of Homeland Security to make sure that the people who are getting on planes are doing so safely.",

The terrorism screening database is the nation's watch list of terror subjects or people who are suspected of involvement in terrorism. One of the \"rules\" that this system uses to identify people is to first make sure that the person they're thinking about is actually not watch listed. So, if you were watch listed, you would never be included in the secure flight program. This is designed to find people who are not known by the government, are not thought of as being terrorists, but for whatever reason, the places they traveled, the people they contacted while they were there have raised in some minimal way a level of concern and one that could be addressed by additional screening before you get on the plane. So, you might have to go through the magnetometer twice or speak to the TSA person for some longer period than you normally would. And it is designed to do, Jim, exactly what we've been told since 9/11, which is connect the dots, right? Find those people who were not even aware of and subject them to some level of scrutiny so we can make sure that we've resolved potential threats.",

I think Matt Gaetz was done -- Matt Gaetz's name had come up before that plane ride where Trump made up his mind to do this or leaned to doing it to announcing Gaetz and then he pulled back, he was sticking with him but he was pretty clear with people Gaetz had a high bar. Gabbard has flown under the radar more because of all the attention on Matt Gaetz. She is obviously getting more attention now. Trump is somebody who has also said things that are more in line with how Vladimir Putin looks at the world than US leaders typically do. So, I don't think that's going to be something that would make him back off. He really likes her. She joined him in debate prep. He has grown very fond of her, a lot of people around him have grown very fond of her. I think it would take a lot for him to back off of her frankly.

I don't care about this algorithm because as you said yourself algorithms are just tripwires. That's not any kind of definitive proof of anything. But it does create an opportunity for Tulsi Gabbard to get in front of the American people and explain all this stuff. People don't yet understand why she says stuff she says, why she does the stuff she does and if she would just use this moment, maybe she can clear some of this stuff up. She's going to have one of the most important jobs on Planet Earth, Because US Intelligence is key to western security. Its key to global security. And so I don't care about this algorithm.

However, after that, we really saw this knife fight take place behind- the-scenes. We were told that Howard Lutnick, Donald Trump's co- transition chair, had actually wielded that knife, wanting the role for himself. But this was something that really had took up a lot of Donald Trump's time, especially because remember Donald Trump, throughout his time on the campaign trail has made a ton of promises regarding his economic agenda, particularly what he wants to do with tariffs. And so, this is going to be a huge job for Bessent, but it was also one of the ones that Donald Trump was the most focused on behind the scenes and one of the most contentious fights we saw play out. Now, you mentioned that he is a billionaire hedge funder. You also mentioned his ties to George Soros. That has, of course, come up. I'm told in the conversations behind-the-scenes, but he was really kind of viewed as a Wall Street darling, someone that was a big -- a lot of people in the business world were a big fan of. I'm also told Lindsey Graham personally lobbied on behalf of Bessent given his ties to South Carolina. But he was a name that a lot of people thought would hopefully be easily confirmable. We saw that obviously an issue this week with some of, excuse me, Donald Trump's other picks particularly Matt Gaetz. So, this was a choice that took Donald Trump a long time to come to. It's going to be a huge deal in this next administration, but one that his team is happy with, I'm told and believes will be able to get him through the Senate process.",

This, according to two individuals close to Trump's transition. Trump is also planning to assemble investigative teams within the Justice Department to hunt for evidence in battleground states that fraud tainted the 2020 election, one of the people said.\" According to the report, this is how the Trump team responded: \"President Trump campaigned on firing rogue bureaucrats who have engaged in the illegal weaponization of our American justice system and the American people can expect he will deliver on that promise.\" This is what Trump said when he officially declared his candidacy back in 2022. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R) PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: The gravest threats to our civilization are not from abroad, but from within.

They presented that evidence to a grand jury of 23 of Donald Trump's fellow citizens and those people, after reviewing that evidence, decided there was probable cause to believe that Donald Trump had committed a crime, both in DC regarding the election and in Florida regarding the documents.
