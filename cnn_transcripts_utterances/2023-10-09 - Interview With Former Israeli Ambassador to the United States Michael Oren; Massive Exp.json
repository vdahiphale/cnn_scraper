As we watch these live images of Gaza, Israel saying its helicopters have launched attacks inside Lebanon, all of this retaliation three days after Hamas fighters stormed into Israel from Gaza, slaughtering civilians and assaulting military bases. Again, these photos coming earlier today. You see the explosions. The incursion by Hamas appears to have caught Israel completely off guard. And we should tell you we're going to hear from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in just moments. We will bring you his remarks as they happen.",

We haven't seen that in recent days. We have seen a lot more troops on the move, a lot more heavy military equipment on the move. It's very clear that the tempo here, in terms of military readiness, if there was a ground incursion, the tempo is stepping up at the moment. But it still feels to me as if it's still some way off, and we don't even know if the political decision to call for that has actually happened just yet. So we're just being told that we can step back up here a little bit to let these troops do their job, because their job is to make this place safe. So we moved out there, and they can now point their weapons where we were standing. That's their job, and ours is standing here reporting.

Not hearing fighter jets at the moment, but that doesn't mean anything, because they can come back in seconds. The tempo of this, it's up, it's down. Every soldier will tell you this, that, when you're so close to the conflict like this, there will be moments of calm that can feel like they stretch out and then concentrations of activity, of adrenaline, of movement, of motion, of readiness, of those rockets coming in, these soldiers taking cover, us taking cover.

The current map, though, dates back to 1967, when Israel captured the Gaza Strip from Egypt and began to occupy the region. We should point out what you're looking at in front of you is an area of about two million Palestinians. Gaza's one of the most densely populated places in the world. And that complicates the picture when it comes to avoiding civilian casualties. Now, the militant Islamist group that governs the territory is Hamas. They were formed in 1987. Hamas is an acronym that means Islamic resistance movement. It's backed by Iran. It's listed as a terrorist organization by the United States, by the E.U., as well as obviously Israel. Hamas does consider Israel an illegitimate state, and they have long fought Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank.",

I want to bring in Michael Oren, who is a former Israeli ambassador to the United States. Mr. Ambassador, thank you so much for joining us at such an important moment. We're watching these live pictures from Gaza. We have seen both rockets flying into Israel, presumably fired by militants. We have also seen strikes by the Israeli side into Gaza. I want to ask you what we were just talking about with our correspondent, Nic Robertson. He has been seeing a massing of forces, of equipment, of tanks.

And the hostages, probably over 100 hostages we're talking about, in American terms, thousands of hostages, and probably upwards of 100,000 proportionally casualties for the United States. So, imagine the immensity of the pain and the cost of this egregious attack by Hamas on our civilians, just unspeakable. What we can do about the hostages, Israel will be doing its utmost, together with our allies, with the United States and other democratic allies in the world, to try to locate them from technological means. We have special forces who are specially trained to rescue hostages in very difficult situations. A number of these -- these units have been operating in releasing terrorism -- releasing hostages from the various farms and settlements surrounding Gaza, because Hamas terrorists took a number of hostages in those settlements. And they were successfully released. We're talking about the hostages who were dragged into the Gaza Strip and tortured and beaten there. Israel will do its utmost to try to locate them and to send the forces necessary to liberate them. All right, ambassador Michael Oren, we do have liberate there.",
