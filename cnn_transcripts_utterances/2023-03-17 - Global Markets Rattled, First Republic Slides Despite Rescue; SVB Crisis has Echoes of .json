The markets are now closing down one-and-a-quarter percent. We are off 390 odd points. Just pause for a bit of the bell, a bit of a cheer. There you are. As you can see, the market was down for the whole session. There wasn't even really -- it was miserable throughout. Those are the markets. We'll talk about the main events and they are related as you see, investors continue to selloff bank shares over fears of the industry's health. On this program, the former head of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet is with me. President Biden is calling for tougher penalties for the executives of failed banks. And the International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for President Vladimir Putin. The markets are now closed, live from New York, it is Friday, it's March 17th. I'm Richard Quest, back in New York, and I mean business. Good evening. With the close of business in New York, so a chaotic week for the markets has ended. Investors are not at all convinced the banking turmoil is over. The three major averages are down, the worst being the Dow Jones, which is off one-and-a-fifth. The S&amp;P is also -- and the NASDAQ as you can see, down shy of three-quarters of a percent. The rescue of First Republic by its larger peers didn't soothe its investors. The share price crushed the best part of 33 percent, and the bank has announced that it is suspending its dividend. And yet if you look at the S&amp;P, you can trace the week and the crisis very elegantly. So let's go back to last Friday, where you have SVB's collapse. Then on Sunday, you have Signature Bank being taken over; Wednesday, it's Credit Suisse in trouble, and by time you get to Thursday, there is the 11 banks rescuing First Republic. Rahel Solomon is with me. Rahel, the week has been a series of events, with regulators and private banks moving in to prevent contagion or getting worse. Are we any wiser as to how wide and far this is going to go?",

Investors, the investment community essentially waiting for the next shoe to drop, and the reality is that investors don't feel like even despite all of that intervention that you just laid out there, Richard, that it will be enough, right, that we might still see some weakness, even with a First Republic Bank, even with some of the regional banks and just the huge impact that has been on lending, in terms of the large US economy. I just want to share with you for a moment, Richard, a stat that caught my eye today. These small and medium-sized banks, which we've just been throwing around this week, these are major sources of lending. They account for 45 percent of consumer lending in the US. They account for 60 percent of residential real estate lending. So you have to imagine, in an environment like this where banks know that the heat is really on them, as they pull back on risk, as they pull back on lending, they have to think about the knock-on effects and the spillover that then has on Americans and consumer spending, the economy, recession risks, et cetera, et cetera.",

And the problems facing Credit Suisse are problems we've had now for months, and actually years and it is in the middle of a restructure, but perhaps it's not going fast enough, perhaps it's not doing enough with the restructure because investors have certainly lost patience. Now, a lot of this is its investment bank, which we know is loss making. They are trying to spin that off. But what to do with the more profitable elements like the domestic bank, the wealth management, the asset management? Will those at this stage need to be spun off as well? Perhaps Credit Suisse is actually not worth as much at this stage as the sum of its parts, and perhaps that's going to be the solution.

As the market tanked, it didn't work in the longer run. In the 2008, GFC, Great Financial Crisis, it wasn't so much a bank run, the bottom fell out of the financial system. Policymakers had to act fast to prevent the collapse. And then within that, as it became clear, then, of course, things moved on and it did become a run on banks. With SVB, the collapse happened in real time because of panic spread on social media.

So all of that being said, vigilance is of the essence in this world. No complacency of any kind should be accepted. And that is very important, because it means that all the rules and regulations of Basel III, for instance, for the banks, should be fully respected. We are not fully respected, I have to say, in the case of the regional banks in the United States of America, the net stable funding ratio was not respected, there was some kind of waiver. But that being said, we are living in a world which is fragile, and it calls as I said, for a lot of vigilance. But that being said, I don't trust that the sequence in which we are today will be the equivalent of Lehman Brothers. One of the main reason is that the authority knows that we are in a fragile world. In the case of Lehman Brothers, you might remember that there was the full acceptance of the fact that the authorities would not intervene at the very beginning, and we had the full-fledged bankruptcy with all the consequences that we all know.

Maybe things could have been done better, with some difference made between the insured deposits and the uninsured deposit. We have to reflect on that. And your remark on moral hazard is absolutely clear. It's a very, very important remark. But there are ways in my opinion for the authorities not to embark in moral hazards, I would say a reason, but also to be able to avoid the catastrophe because the catastrophe would be much worse, of course.

There are multiple war crimes to be investigated, and while this specific warrant pertaining to the children is looking at potential war crimes, technically speaking, under the Rome Statute, the sort of founding principle of the ICC, genocide also entails forced or can entail forced deportation of children.

And, you know, we did put this as well to Karim Khan, and he basically says that he hopes this can be a moment in which potentially that could change, and there is more scope potentially for cooperation with the US, for example, which as you rightly point out, has often had a very confrontational relationship with the ICC.

But at the end of the square and just across the river, the other side of the Seine is the National Assembly, and that is where really the spontaneous demonstrations started when the government of Emmanuel Macron's ruling party said that he was going to use presidential fiat to force through legislation that would mean that the pensionable age in this country has been raised from 62 to 64.

And the things that are sort of unique here, which is, I was on a call with regulators and -- one of the regulators made the point that this bank operated in a uniquely incestuous was their word environment. Meaning that the depositors and the investors and many of the people with relationships in his back were in various chat rooms together, you know, sharing their concerns. And this is to your point about the speed of communication. It's worth, of course, us doing some work to figure out whether other banks could be subject to that kind of community challenges.

And this is where the moral hazard comes in. So, we know two things. We can't guarantee every last dollar in the banking system. That just -- that creates an immense amount of moral hazard with respect to how the banks would then use those dollars. So, I think inevitably, we're going to see treasures, and we are seeing treasures, move deposits into other short term, safe places for their cash. The problem with that, of course, that's going to put tremendous pressure on our smaller and medium-sized banks.
