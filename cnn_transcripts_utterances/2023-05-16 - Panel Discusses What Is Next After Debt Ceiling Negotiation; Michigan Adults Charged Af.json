She is now in a sizable lead over her other opponents right there. Still, there are outstanding votes in Philadelphia, but she is someone who the current mayor of Philadelphia voted for. She is someone who knows politics in the city and outside, not necessarily the progressive fire brands like the person in third place right now, Helen Gym. Helen Gym had Bernie Sanders's and OAC in Philadelphia rallying for her on the weekend. And she, though, is not at the top level right now. I should also say that Philadelphia has had 99 mayors in its long history. If one of these results hold, one of those top three, it'll be the first time that a woman will be the mayor of Philadelphia. I should say Democrats, they have a huge voter registration.

He's running against Kelly Craft, who was the former ambassador to the U.N. for President Trump.Now, why is this race particularly interesting, especially when a call is so early? This was, as we've been talking about for a couple of days now, kind of the first proxy fight of the republican presidential nominating process on the republican side because Trump endorsed Cameron and DeSantis endorsed Craft. And there was a lot of, you know, hey, we have two of potentially frontrunners in this republican presidential nomination getting behind two candidates in red state of Kentucky. And now, we saw that the Trump-backed candidate won. Actually, the Trump pack, they put out a statement right away, I think we have it as well, basically gloating specifically over DeSantis right there.

We know that this poses a significant inconvenience for our families. I am more frustrated that a decision like this is necessary, but we must put safety first and that's what this decision is about.

So, that seems to be part of the issue here. But to your point, we have started to see a lot of districts across the country, police jurisdictions, actually crackdown on parents and try to hold someone accountable for what's happening. I mean, look at this list alone. We were just talking about the one in Kent County, which is Grand Rapids. But in Newport News, Virginia, if you remember, the six-year-old student who shot his teacher, the mother of that six- year-old was charged. And then in Oxford, Michigan, this was out of a school shooting in November the 2021, the parents were charged or has been agreed to stand trial on four counts of involuntary manslaughter, partly tied to allegations of negligence around the gun but also ignoring warning signs leading up to this. That case is the one that could actually have a real precedent here because we're not just talking about like in the seven-year-old case and others, oh, you just left your gun lying about and nothing happened. But in this one, there were warning signs that were allegedly ignored. And for parents that are out there, parents of, you know, the worst nightmare of potentially being a parent to a potential mass shooter, it does create this new potential arena of criminal liability, depending on what happens with that case out of Oxford.",

All of these solutions, potential solutions, are thrown out there and this seems to fit into that debate as we've seen that rise in mass shootings. But I should also mention a really important point, is that with all of these mass shootings and in particular, mass killings that we see, the vast majority of mass killings happen in private settings, in the home. Not so much, even though they get the most attention and rightfully so, in public settings. And so, when you talk about handling of weapons around the home, these are all cases that touch that.

Before we throw out a drug for the public to consume, we test it, etcetera. Another thing that they said was maybe we should be funding at trying to create a Constitution for A.I, which creates morals, values, and rules for how we create different levels of algorithms in tech. One of the things that I thought, Sam Altman, who again is the CEO of OpenAI, proposed that was really smart, was to create a regulatory agency to solve this. Again, going back to the FDA example.

So, how do you strike a balance between, all right, we know that this could drive us off a cliff, but we are driving, we could be driving. (CROSSTALK) Yeah. We could be driving. Yeah, you're right.

So, one of the arguments for things like ChatGPT and artificial intelligence is that you're going to be able to displace a lot of very labor, intensive jobs and you're going to give opportunities to people to do much more exciting work.For example, instead of working every day copy-pasting an excel spreadsheet, you're programming the bot to do it, and then you can do a lot more with your life. The challenge, though, and a lot of lawmakers and the professor, Gary Marcus, put this out there today is, how can you guarantee we will actually be able to make up for the number of jobs lost? This is the things I think most Americans are going to be paying attention to. Once we start to see more jobs being eliminated due to artificial intelligence, that is when I think people are going to start to call members of Congress.

So, over this past year, people have been calling for the limiting of these uses.
