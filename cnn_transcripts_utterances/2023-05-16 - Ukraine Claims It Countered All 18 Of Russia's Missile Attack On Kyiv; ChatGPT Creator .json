Tonight, a major attackshakes Kyiv, as Russia claims a major victory against a U.S.-made defense system. We're live on the ground with more. Then, ChatGPT creator Sam Altman testifies before U.S. lawmakers, saying he is concerned A.I. could be used to compromise elections. We'll have more on that hearing. Plus, President Biden gets ready for critical U.S. debt-ceiling talks next hour. As the treasury warns the clock is ticking. The Ukraine's capital Kyiv has just survived a Russian air attack, which the city says was exceptional in its intensity. Ukraine's military says air defense successfully intercepted all 18 Russian missiles launched earlier today, including six hypersonic Kinzhal missiles. Despite that, Russia claims it destroyed a U.S.-made Patriot air defense system in Kyiv. A U.S. official says that system was likely damage but not destroyed. Meanwhile, on the frontlines, Ukraine says it's making more progress around Bakhmut, liberating territory in suburbs north and south of the city. But the boss of the Russian private military company, Wagner, says his mercenaries are advancing in the west of that city. He also posted this video on social media, claiming to have found a U.S. citizen who died fighting for Ukraine in Bakhmut. CNN cannot confirm its authenticity. Our Nic Robertson is covering the developments and joins us now from eastern Ukraine. Good to have you with us Nic. So, 18 missiles launched by Russia, and thankfully all shot down, according to Ukraine, although Russia disputes that. What can you tell us about this onslaught, and how does it compare to previous attacks on the capital?",

      "sentences": "Well, a sophisticated onslaught. And the mayor of Kyiv has said that this was an attempt by theRussians to try to penetrate the air defenses and actually disable the air defenses. Over the past few months, Ukraine has been given more and more complex and sophisticated air defense systems. And it has a very effective shield around Kyiv, and that was what was in effect, and that's why Ukrainian officials say they shot down everything that was incoming. Those hypersonic, ten times the speed of sound, Kinzhal missiles fired from the north, from aircrafts, six different aircrafts firing those nine cruise missiles, fired from the Black Sea to the south as incoming on a different trajectory. And more missiles, initially they had said just three of the Iskander and the S-400 land-based missiles, but now, Ukrainian officials are saying that was ten different missiles. So a very sophisticated attempt, Ukrainian officials say, to disable these air defense systems. But the air defense system, by its nature, has improved and strengthened. Why does Russia want to announce that it has damaged the Patriots system? Because it wants to show that it's scoring a success. Ukrainian officials say that they won't comment on it, and the analysis that's been done in the United States at the moment is, does the damage warrant repair on site or is it something that's going to have to be removed and repaired somewhere else? So, it's not clear how this affects the air defenses going forward for Kyiv, but it did show that the systems are effective around the capital. Less so, because they can't deploy -- didn't have the -- enough air defense systems, they deployed them around the sort of confrontation areas, close to where we are in the east of Ukraine. Obviously, trajectories of missiles are different. But it's the capital that gets the most protection, and this very sophisticated attack held off.",

In fact, this high stakes negotiation thatwill happen at the White House in just a little under an hour is critical to ensuring whether or not Republicans and Democrats, Kevin McCarthy; the House Speaker, and the President of the United States, will be able to reach at least an idea of what they are negotiating on, when it comes to increasing this debt ceiling. Like you noted, the sticking points right now aren't just about whether or not to require additional work requirements on social safety net programs, like welfare, food stamps or Medicaid. But also, how Republicans and Democrats are going to agree on cutting spending for months. The White House has suggested they were not going to negotiate on cutting any spending as part of the debt ceiling negotiations. But that all has started to shift in the wake of Kevin McCarthy being able to corral his Republican members around one debt ceiling plan. Now, the question of course, how do lawmakers and the president, respond following this high stakes meeting? Do they come out more optimistic than they have been? Over the last several weeks -- the house speaker told me this morning at the U.S. Capitol, when I asked him if he thought there'd be an outcome to this meeting, that he wasn't optimistic unless something changed.",

Basically saying that it was clear that the Russians were investigating or were trying to interfere in the 2016 election to hurt Hillary Clinton and to help Trump. And there was evidence of contacts between Trump's campaign and the Russians. So it makes sense from McCabe's point of view that the investigation went ahead. In terms of how Trump is going to use it, you know, nuance means nothing to the former president. He's already saying that this is proof that there was a long-term conspiracy to keep him out of power in 2016. That he has been politically persecuted ever since. And what he will do is try to push this forward, to say that this is evidence of a witch hunt and it's exactly the same thing that's happening to him again. In the two other investigations by another special counsel, Jack Smith, in his role after the 2020 election of a Capitol insurrection and his hoarding of classified documents at his home in Florida. So for the conservative media and for Trump, this is a powerful weapon to argue that he is a victim yet again. That's at the centerpiece of his 2024 campaign. It will help among conservative voters and among Trump's supporters. For everybody else, though, I think it will be largely disregarded.",
