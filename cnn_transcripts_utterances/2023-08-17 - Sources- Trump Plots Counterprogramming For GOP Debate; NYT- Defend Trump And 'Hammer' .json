What they want him to do? Who they want him to hit? And how they want him to copy the man who likely won't even be on stage?Plus, the permanent split screen, Georgia prosecutors propose a timeline that would put another Trump trial side-by-side with the Trump presidential run. And love is blindness. New CNN reporting about how Joe Biden doesn't want to see or hear about his son's legal problems. And the concern inside the campaign and is making the president numb to it very real reelection risk. I'm Phil Mattingly in for Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. Up first today, Donald Trump versus Fox News part, do three or four or five in a different language. Sources tell CNN, the 2024 Republican frontrunner is not planning to participate in Wednesday's debate on the network and is even proposing some counter programming. Now, where have I seen that before? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: You see the House is packed and literally this took place less than 24 hours. We had less than 24 hours to do this because they said, listen, I'm not going to do the debate out of respect for myself. I won't do it because it would just be wrong. But I got to, you know, I love Iowa. I'm here. We got to do something. Isn't that better than this debate that's going on -- sleeping, right? They're all sleeping. They're all sleeping, everybody.

That was Trump boycotting a different Fox News debate during the 2016 GOP primary that won in Iowa, then Trump hosted a fundraiser for veterans in Iowa, just three miles away from his Republican rival. So, will history be repeating itself? It's a very open question right now.But let's go live to CNN's Alayna Treene, who has got a ton of reporting on this and has trumped the last couple of weeks if people try to figure this out. What are you hearing right now from Trump world?",

      "sentences": "Well, Phil. We are hearing that Donald Trump is most likely not going to be on the debate stage next week. But I did hedge in my story, and I'll hedge here as well, that this is Donald Trump we're talking about. I have covered him for many years. And his campaign has even told me that, listen, he could always change his mind at the last minute.But as of now he was not planning to attend. I think we'll probably hear him say something of the sort soon. But he is talking about counter programming. He has been personally throwing out ideas of potential other interviews he can be giving, including a potential interview with Tucker Carlson. He's also talking about potentially calling into other shows during the debate. Now, of course, I have to note. Donald Trump is openly feuding with Fox News right now. He is, you know, criticizing Rupert Murdoch. And we know that Tucker Carlson also has left Fox News. So, there could be some motivations there behind the scenes. But some interesting things I've picked up, Phil, is that one, Donald Trump, his team is trying to set up some surrogates to be there in his place. People like Congressman Byron Donalds and Matt Gaetz, both of Florida, as well as Kari Lake, the former gubernatorial candidate in Arizona, as well as some members of Donald Trump's team. They want them in the spin room to, you know, defend Donald Trump even if he is not there. I'm also told that Donald Trump has been telling people even this week that he does think that Fox News is worried about. He's worried about the ratings for this debate. The news executives from Fox went to Bedminster last month and encouraged Donald Trump to participate and Trump thinks that that was a sign that they're worried about ratings. And one other thing I just want to point out, Phil, is that Donald Trump is also in amid all of this facing that indictment in Georgia. He is expected to surrender next week, I am told. And this could all be setting up a potential collision course with those debates.",

      "sentences": "Yes. I mean, the centerpiece is what you were just reading from, which is this memo, which is the Super PAC strategy, they think that Ron DeSantis should deploy on stage. And frankly, it's interesting that they're writing that out, right. Like the Super PAC is not inside the campaign, they can't legally talk to Ron DeSantis.So, the only way they can tell them what they think he should be doing, is by posting it on the internet somewhere, and usually don't post in a place where other people can find it so easily. And this was on the website of Jeff Rose company. He's the main chief strategist for the Super PAC. But yes, it's not just that memo. It's a series of research documents about his rivals outlining where he -- they think DeSantis should be hitting them and really notable who he's focused on. The Ramaswamy stuff, who is not a candidate on anyone's radar is suddenly rising. And in fact, in the private polling that they also posted on this website, it showed some of the same things we've seen in public polling, which is him reaching 11 percent in New Hampshire, that's a real threat to Ron DeSantis. And so, DeSantis is obviously not wanting to hit Donald Trump. We've seen them on the campaign trail. And this memo makes clear like, well, maybe you should defend him, maybe the way ahead is defending him. And this has been a dubious strategy for Republicans for years, but that's certainly the one they're outlining.",

He's made clear that, A, he wants him on the debate stage, trying to taunt him into debt and onto the debate stage and is ready to go after him.I mean, if that's the case, in your story, that says, \"the debate-prep memo also urges Mr. DeSantis to defend Trump when Chris Christie attacks him with a specific suggestion for the attack line. Trump isn't here, so let's just leave him alone. He's too weak to defend himself here. We're all running against him. I don't think we want to join forces with someone on the stage who's auditioning for a show on MSNBC.\"",

But it shows first of all, the utter absurdity of these laws that have been put in place, where PACs can't talk to the candidate. So, they post detailed memos online for them to find.It also pulls the curtain back on the strategy, and look, the strategy of attacking Chris Christie, that's, you know, not unexpected, but they're thinking about eventualities. The fake Vivek, you know, that someone came up with the rhyme and got to take cash on that one. But I think it also shows how Canvas is. Now we're going to have Ron DeSantis bingo card during the debate, to see if he indeed hits Joe Biden in the media three to five times, to see what all these lines get used. And that's never a good day, because for candidates struggling with authenticity, to now have the game plan released, that's going to make it even more difficult to climb that ladder.",

We've seen it in public polling. Shane makes clear, there's private polling is showing the same thing. It's been kind of a steady climb. Nobody's really gone after him.And I was texting with somebody this morning, a Republican campaign official, not with the DeSantis campaign, saying how long are you guys going to hold off here?

We know from polling, you know, 37 percent of the Republican primary vote in one poll is hardcore with Donald Trump, no matter what, which means that you've got a super majority who's looking for an offering. And so, they're all competing for that. And so, it's not a surprise, they're going to go after Vivek.But look, I mean, DeSantis also is coming at this from a position of weakness. You know, Shane's scoop is not good news for DeSantis land, but it's just the latest bit of bad news for DeSantis land, because they need to create a clear contrast and regain that momentum as the apparent alternative, which they've been losing to a bunch of other candidates who are now getting a second look in places like Iowa and elsewhere.",

      "sentences": "Yes. There's been real strategic disagreements, the DeSantis campaign has gone through three resets in the last month already. And the last one was actually a pretty notable one, the campaign manager was layered. And they brought in a deputy campaign manager who had been overseeing much of the Super PACs' operations in the early states.So, he's really bringing the Super PACs' knowledge directly inside the campaign. And so, I expect a little bit more seamlessness between those two because of that movement. But look, I think that, when you think about the Christie part of this memo, and you think about the Ramaswamy part of this memo, what you're really looking at is the box that DeSantis finds himself in, right? He wants to hit the anti-Trump people to win some plaudits from the pro-Trump people, like hitting Chris Christie is going to be popular with Trump fans, and he needs to win over those Trump fans. And the other side of it is, Ramaswamy has taken those Trump fans from him on that hard right that you're talking about. So, we need to get him to, right? And yet, there's Donald Trump and there's nothing in the memo about hitting Donald Trump, right? The guy in the front of the PAC who may or may not be on that stage, isn't the main focus. And this is of course, a little bit of a repeat of what we saw in 2016.",

Now, I will remind you, of course, Judge Chutkan was just assigned a case that was brought by federal prosecutors.But in this voicemail, she allegedly says, you are in our sights, we want to kill you. She also allegedly made threats against Chutkan's family, and also in a separate instance made threats against Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, and people in the LGBT community. Look, Phil, federal judges, they do receive threats upon occasion. This one we are told was not necessarily operational. But again, when the former president mentions your name on social media, it certainly raises your profile and makes you arguably more vulnerable to these kinds of threats.

And so, you have to imagine that this would kill them.Now, obviously, there are very important distinctions as Elie certainly can tell you as well, regarding what grand juries do. They are not trial jurors. They're jurors to make an assessment as to whether there's probable cause to believe a crime was committed. And the subjects of the proceeding committed it. It's not proof beyond reasonable doubt. And that only needs to be a simple majority. But the people who do that and hear many cases in order to participate now and moving forward need to know that the government protects them. So, I know the laws in Georgia are different as it relates to transparency. Perhaps they should be reconsidered moving forward to have grand jurors not have concerns about their health, their safety and their family.",

We're talking to Michael Moore this morning former prosecutor in Georgia said, the judges get threats, right. It's not a new thing, necessarily. But this is the federal authorities in fast here. ELIE HONIG, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NY: Yes. Nothing will mobilize the federal authorities like a threat against the judge or a prosecutor or any of our official apparatus. They took this seriously. They acted quickly. They made the arrest. This woman is actually behind bars right now, because of this. Look, the feds have to be on the highest alert here. Because we know that nobody has a platform and a microphone like Donald Trump. And it's not speculation, it's proven fact that people act on his words. We've seen it so many times over course, January 6, we've seen other examples of lone wolves. And that's really the fear, by the way at this point is, individual actors who see things on their social media feeds who decide to take action, even in the form of a threat or God forbid, worse than that. So, this is going to be a recurring problem. We've got four different cases happening now. We've got all sorts of people who are vulnerable.
