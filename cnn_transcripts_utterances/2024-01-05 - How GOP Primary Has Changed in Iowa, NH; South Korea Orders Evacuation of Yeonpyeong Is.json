They only make up 17 percent of the electorate.

Now, we don't know what's going to happen with Donald Trump at this particular point, but this is, of course, a good signal for Trump going back through history. Of course, Abby, we pointed out he's not nearly as strong in New Hampshire. Right? Nikki Haley is wondering, Hey, maybe I can break through there. Well, take a look here. National GOP frontrunners who won Iowa, which Donald Trump looks pretty strong at this point, but then went on to lose New Hampshire? Bob Dole in '96, George W. Bush in 2000. What do these two fellows have in common, besides just being pretty good-looking guys? They both won the nomination.

Moving on, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is about to begin his fourth trip to the Middle East, since October 7th Hamas attack on Israel. And his mission seems to be getting more complicated by the day. Among his top priorities, as he visits eight countries across the region, is to keep the war between Israel and Hamas from spreading as fears grow that Iran and its proxies are getting more involved. And now, ISIS has claimed responsibility for a pair of bombings in Southern Iran that has killed more than 80 people. Tensions also flaring between Israel and Lebanon, where a senior Hamas commander was killed on Tuesday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he is committed to, in his words, bringing fundamental change so Israelis can live in peace along that border. In the Red Sea, Houthi rebels backed by Iran have launched another attack on commercial shipping lanes. The U.S. Navy says the unmanned surface drone exploded without causing damage to any ships or injuring any crews. The U.S. is fighting back against pro-Iranian proxies in the region, as well. A militia source says a top commander and his assistant were killed in a strike in Baghdad. CNN's Oren Liebermann with more from the Pentagon. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A U.S. strike in Iraq, second in a little more than a week, killing the commander of a pro-Iran militia, Harakat al-Nujaba, one U.S. official saying the target, known as Abu Taqwa, had U.S. blood on his hands. MAJ. PATRICK RYDER, PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY: Abu Taqwa was actively involved in planning and carrying out attacks against American personnel. LIEBERMANN (voice-over): The attack comes amid fears of an escalation in the Middle East, far beyond the borders of the Gaza Strip, where the war between Israel and Hamas is nearing the three-month mark. The U.S. has tried to separate the war in Gaza from the rest of the region, but the fighting has burst through political borders. An Israeli strike in Beirut killed Saleh al-Arouri, one of Hamas's top leaders. Lebanese officials warning the attack threatens to spark a wider conflict in a region already on edge. U.S. forces have come under attack approximately 118 times in Iraq and Syria since mid-October. Hezbollah in Lebanon has launched repeated missile and drone strikes on Israel, a key U.S. ally in the Middle East. And the Houthis in Yemen have fired on international shipping lanes in the Red Sea, with calls growing for a U.S. response. JOHN KIRBY, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SPOKESPERSON: We don't telegraph our punches one way or another. But we take these attacks very, very seriously, the impact that they're having on international commerce, and -- and free shipping. And we're going to keep doing what we need to do to protect our interests. LIEBERMANN (voice-over): The common thread here is Iran, which backs these groups. With U.S. Navy forces in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, and in the Red Sea to protect international shipping lanes, the U.S. has tried to send a message of deterrence, carrying out strikes in Iraq and Syria. But the attacks across the region have persisted, the Pentagon once again laying out an open-ended threat of force.",

And I think the best evidence that you have that -- that the Nakba continues is not just what's happening in the Gaza Strip, but as well as what's happening in the West Bank where both the constituents of both Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir are using the war as an excuse to take matters into their own hands and commit violence against the Palestinians, in order to push them off their own land.
