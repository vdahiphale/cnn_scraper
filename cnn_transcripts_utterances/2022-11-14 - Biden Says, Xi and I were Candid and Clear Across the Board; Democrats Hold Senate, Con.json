First, President Biden at G20 summit in Bali this morning held a significant three-and- a-half hour meeting with the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, their first face-to-face talks since Biden took office. They come at a crucial time. The U.S. president asked if the U.S. is now facing a new cold war with China as tensions at an all-time high over Taiwan.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  And I absolutely believe there is need not be a new cold war. I have met many times with Xi Jinping and we were candid and clear with one another across the board and I don't think there is any imminent attempt on the part of China to invade to Taiwan.

And if you look at the House, the Republicans only need six more seats to take control. The Democrats would need 14. There are two crucial congressional races in Arizona right now that have yet to be called, down here in the southeastern part of the state, Arizona sixth congressional district, Juan Ciscomani leads by 1,700 votes. But as more votes are counted around here, his lead is actually has grown. He has expanded his lead. I showed you Arizona's first congressional district a short time, Dave Schweikert, the Republican, leads there by 894 votes. But up until Saturday actually, the Democrats were leading in these seats. But more votes have been counted in Maricopa County and now the Republican has taken the lead there by 890 votes. I want to look at the governor's race there because it is little bit of a different story. You have Katie Hobbs, the Democrat, ahead by 26,000 votes. We're getting more votes released from Arizona, different counties every day. I want to give you a sense of what Kari Lake would have to do in order to overtake Katie Hobbs at this point. There are, we believe, at this point, 175,000 votes left, approximately left to count there Arizona. If Kari Lake were too win 58 percent of the remaining votes, 58 percent, and I'll make that a question mark, we don't know she'll get that, but if she were to get that 58 percent, that would net her a total of 27,200 votes. 58 percent would get her this much, which is more than 26,000. So, 58 percent would be enough. Here is the problem, Jim, for her, and I'm going to write the 58 percent up here in Utah. Forgive me, Utah. I'm going to write this up here just so we remember it, 58 percent. In the latest, those batches we've seen from Maricopa County, Kari Lake got 55 percent. And down in Pima County, she got 40 percent. So, you can see, I'll pull out here, she's not getting what she needs. She needs 58 percent. In Maricopa, she was getting 55, in pima she's getting 40. We're expecting tens of thousands of more votes released tonight. But if the numbers are close to these 55 and 40 percent and not this, that means that Katie Hobs could hang on in Arizona, Jim.",

Senator Raphael Warnock, the Democrat, having to go out there and make sure that voters don't essentially rest easy and say, all right, Democrats already have it in the bag. Tell them, explain to voter why this race still remain so crucial for that party.On the other hand, Republicans attempting to still maintain some kind of clout there in the Senate, that is why we've seen so many of these surrogates already here in Georgia with Republican Herschel Walker, Ted Cruz, and Senator Rick Scott is here today in the Augusta area. But one of the big questions, Jim, is whether or not they're going to bring in, well, bigger star power even and the talk of who that might be, specifically coming down to, of course former, president Donald Trump. There are many here in Georgia and around the Republican Party who would like to see the former president stay away from Georgia, as to not potentially turn off, in the words of some suburban voters, women voters, and independents, those voters that they would need in this area. And there is also the educational campaign, of course, on making sure that voters know what goes into this runoff, because so much has changed since last year when they did this because of that controversial new voting law here in Georgia.",

      "sentences": "Yes. This is going to be a week of soul searching, venting and tense meetings behind closed doors mainly on the Republican side, in the House and the Senate, after those disappointing election results. The House Republicans will gather this afternoon for a candidate forum before they elect their next slate of leaders tomorrow.And at that meeting, we expect to hear some back and forth, some pushback, some criticism about the Republican strategy. The person behind that strategy, Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader, who is trying to lockdown enough supports to become the next speaker of the House, even the majority has not yet been called for House Republicans. We expect likely a narrow majority that they will have, which means that when they come time in January for him to get votes of the full House, 218 votes, he can only afford to lose likely a handful of defectors in order to get the majority of the full house. Tomorrow's vote is just a majority of the Republican conference to nominate him for that position. And then on the Senate Republican side, Mitch McConnell is facing some dissension within the ranks among some Republicans who are asking to delay the Wednesday's leadership election even though McConnell is very likely, almost certainly going to be the next Republican leader. He'll be the longest serving party leader in history when he achieves that. In the Democratic side, a lot of questions still about what Nancy Pelosi will do. The House speaker, someone who has dominated her caucus for the better part of the past two decades, there are a lot of questions at whether this will be her last time atop the Democratic caucus. But when she was asked about this yesterday, she made clear that her decision, her announcement will wait. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA):  -- will, again, be rooted in what the wishes of my family and the wishes of my caucus. But none of it will be very much considered until we see what the outcome of all of this is. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And I will tell you, there is a unifying theme that somehow this time is different.I got to tell you, Jim, I'm quite skeptical of that. I'm quite skeptical because what we have seen over and over again is Trump be able to come back from the lowest he's ever fallen and be able to constitute and bring back power, and he does it through chaos and through making cunning decisions in the moment. I think what we're seeing right now is even though there are many Republicans who say it is time to move on, you know what, a lot of people said that after January 6. My concern is you're already seeing there is a letter now that has been written by the Trump faction in the Republican base of the party who are saying delay leadership elections. That is the last thing that Kevin McCarthy wants and this will actually be the very first test of whether Kevin McCarthy will stand up to the Donald Trump faction. That is going to determine whether we're able to move on or not. If he rushes to elections and wins leadership, then maybe he will stand up. If not, Trump gets the kind of chaos he needs to be able to begin to reconstitute his power base in the party.",

But, I don't think it changes, I think, the fundamental issues around the second Biden term.Look, he has got a strong record to look to legislatively in the first term, bipartisan record in some cases, his reputation on foreign policy has rebounded with Ukraine, with the solidification of NATO but he's still turning 80. And I think there is the question of whether he will fulfill his campaign commitment to sort be a candidate who passes the torch to a new generation. In some ways, that is the best way to secure his legacy but it is also means Democrats give away the advantage of incumbency. So, I think you'll see a lot of debates probably too much, but he's going to have to decide in the next few months whether he's going to hope the door to a contest or move forward himself, real risks in that.",

Just to remind you, U.S. officials before this summit said they would see it as a success if they could agree upon some areas of agreement and commonplace, and also if they could open lines of communication going forward so at least on those two fronts you could imagine U.S. officials saying that the summit was a success.

The president, as M.J. noted there, said the U.S. does not believe that China intends, at least imminently, to invade Taiwan. He also says that there need not be a new cold war between the U.S. and China. Does that match with the facts of this relationship as we know them, where there are so many substantive disagreements? SUSAN GLASSER, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST:  Well, that is right. Of course, you're looking in a situation where the United States and the Biden administration has reaffirmed this very recently in its own national security strategy views, China as a long-term competitor and adversary, views of preparing for the possibility of military conflict breaking out over Taiwan to be a very realistic challenge, sees it as a really the generational threat to the United States and its continued dominance, especially given Xi's increasingly not only nationalistic but revisionist efforts to change China's position in the world.

And I wonder where you land on that. Where do you think xi lands on that? GLASSERI thought it was very notable that President Biden said that he did not believe any kind of invasion of Taiwan was, quote, imminent.
