The two are meeting in ashow of solidarity despite criticism from mainland China. This stop is part of a 10-day trip to shore up Taipei's overseas relationship while Miss Tsai -- (CLEARS THROAT) Excuse me, is Taiwan's first president to meet with U.S. house Speaker on U.S. soil. Secretary of State Antony Blinken emphasized the visit is nothing new and China should not take it as an excuse to quote, \"ratchet up\" tensions.

      "sentences": "Yes, Isa, symbolic indeed. And that joint meeting as you mentioned with President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwanand Speaker McCarthy is going on right now, and it's not just Republicans. This is a bipartisan delegation meeting with President Tsai to go over a number of issues. Obviously, we've seen this democratic solidarity between Taiwan and U.S. officials, and the president herself has been on this international tour visiting other democratic allies to include Guatemala and Belize. Now, it's important to note that how this language is being described as we've often seen as officials couch language between U.S. and Taiwanese diplomatic relations is not an official visit. It's being described as a transit as President Tsai returns back to Taiwan. But they have a number of issues to go over. And this, of course, comes amid increased U.S. tension between the U.S. and China on a number of issues, including national security concerns that U.S. officials have over Chinese technology, particularly, the popular app, TikTok, obviously, as well as Chinese territorial claims in the South China sea and as well as the war in Ukraine. We've heard from a number of U.S. officials who have criticized China for being too cozy with Russia as it has invaded its neighbors. So, a lot of issues to discuss, of course, one thing that we will be watching for, Isa, is what the Chinese response will be. We know that back in August of last year when then house Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, that was fire up, followed by increased military exercises with over a 100 Chinese aircraft, nearly a dozen warships moving in and around Taiwan, crossing into Taiwanese territorial waters as they claim they launched a barrage of ballistic missiles as well, some of them entering the Japanese Economic Zone. So a lot of people on edge right now, waiting to see what the response will be. It is worth pointing out as our colleague Will Ripley has said that this visit here by President Tsai to the U.S. actually is occurring simultaneous to a visit to China by the French President Emmanuel Macron. So the question will be, even if China wants to show some type of force, will they do so while that visit itself is underway. Finally, it's worth pointing out that we will see Speaker McCarthy as well as President Tsai here in just about an hour's time behind me as they address the public, but again, very symbolic, a very important visit. It's worth pointing out the White House just came out with a statement a short time ago, saying that they are urging the Chinese not to overreact by this type of engagement, saying that in their view, this is quite common.",

I want to speak to Will Ripley in just a moment, who's focusing, of course, on Macron's visit to Beijing. But let's bring it back to Speaker McCarthy. He has taken, Josh, a pretty hard-line approach to China. In Congress, he, of course, as our viewers will know, he established a special committee on the threat he says Beijing poses. Is there a risk here, Josh, that -- or worry that this could -- meeting could lead to a repeat of what not -- just what you said last Summer, but it could rattle Beijing further, alienate Beijing further.",

Well,let's go to Beijing, really focused on that meeting between French President Emmanuel Macron, who is in China right now on a state visit. He is trying to convince Chinese President Xi Jinping to help end the war in Ukraine and not grow any closer to Moscow. But Washington is skeptical. Mr. Macron hasn't had much success in his efforts to solve conflicts on the global stage. He had come under fire, if you remember, last year, over his many phone calls to Russia's Vladimir Putin, which did not stop the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. I want to bring in CNN's Will Ripley, who now in Taiwan for us. Will, before we talk about Macron's visit to China, first of all, I want to get your reaction or Beijing's reaction from what you heard to that visit by Taiwan's president to the U.S. What are you hearing?",

      "sentences": "Well, certainly, anything major that might happen militarily, we would expect it would be after TsaiIng-wen arrives back in Taiwan. It would be a hugely provocative if they were to try to do something when she's in the air, flying back to the democracy that she was elected by 24 million people to govern, and yet, the communist leaders in Beijing do not see her government as legitimate. That's why these meetings and I think we have a tweet from Speaker McCarthy showing, you know, even though this is, you know, technically an informal visit, it looks certainly very formal there at the Reagan Presidential Library, as they sit there and Tsai Ing-wen gets to tell the third in line to the U.S. presidency, her message about Taiwan, the importance of protecting Taiwan's young, fragile and vibrant democracy from this authoritarian behemoth 110 miles across the Taiwan Strait. Not to mention the fact that it produces more than half of the world's highly advanced semiconductors. The microchips that power everything from smartphones to our automobiles, to our laptops, and if there was some sort of a conflict, the current supply chain would be disrupted, and there could be multi-year backlogs for technology that people rely on in their everyday lives. And so -- and so, this is really a very important moment for Tsai Ing-wen, because she's been trying, she and her party, the DPP have been trying to elevate Taiwan's recognition and legitimacy on a global stage despite decades of diplomatic efforts by China to ice them out completely. They only actually have 13 formal diplomatic allies remaining, very small countries that are those allies. But this relationship, this friendship with the United States, Republican and Democratic lawmakers making regular visits to Taiwan and Taiwan welcoming them to show them around here, and show them why they feel that this system needs to be protected. It's very valuable for China and very infuriating for Beijing. But will they go so far as they did, Isa, last August, firing ballistic missiles over Taiwan? Will they provoke and distract from that very important meeting in Beijing with the French President and the EU Commission President? That is really the open question, and you know, because China is just so -- lack of transparency would be an understatement when it comes to their government and their military. We can guess, but we just have to really wait and see.",

Still in Brazil, though, former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro arrived at a federal police station in Brasilia just minutes ago to answer questions about some very expensive jewelry. Authorities want to know more about three sets of jewelry given to Bolsonaro by Saudi Arabia when he was in office.

I think it's fair to say from what I have seen. The comments has been vigorously opposed by Republicans. Is this whole affair, though, playing into Trump's hands?

He's drawn more support in the Republican primary, in polling, than he previously had. Short term, good news for Donald Trump. But as we saw yesterday, we saw basically Donald Trump in his comfort zone, with the speech last night kind of a recitation of the Donald Trump greatest hits. We've all become used to. And then out of his comfort zone in the courtroom. And that says what the long term problem is for Donald Trump. As Carol (ph) was saying earlier, you know, with this specific case, forget about other indictments, which is not insignificant. We're going to be talking about this at least until September or December. And then potentially further there on as well. And so for Trump, if you become the nominee, you have a problem that this does not help you with any independent voters. Any voters who voted for Donald Trump in 2016 but then didn't vote for him for 2020. This is not helping them come back to Donald Trump. And he has the other challenge of, will there be other indictments as well, which really could serve to spur some Republicans, too, as they have supported him initially in this, to say, even though we think what happened to Donald Trump is unfair, there's too much drama. There's too much chaos surrounding him. We have to move forward.",

We're moving forward on policies. We are doing the right thing here in Florida. We don't -- and I don't know anything about paying off porn stars or all those other things that DeSantis has said. But we also get into -- as all of this is unprecedented. If Donald Trump is at trial during the primaries, it's very hard to predict exactly what happens with Republican voters at that point.

And part of that is we've also seen -- when I started working in the House of Representatives, there was a president who had a sex scandal named Bill Clinton. And his argument was even presidents have private lives. And all of this is sort of around the details around that. Regardless of the bluster and the language and the venom that Donald Trump uses, that's a lot of that same argument. It was persuasive for Bill Clinton. It's why he wasn't convicted by the United States Senate and removed from office. This with this specific indictment may have that same thing, where regurgitating a lot of those things that we already know about Donald Trump, even if they're not positive things themselves.",

But it wasn't easy and again we are very successful in hiding this information like we did with President Biden a few weeks ago. But we don't feel so afraid of Russians anymore and we decided to communicate this two days before, to give Polish people possibility to travel toward when participating two leaders speech. It wasn't easy because Warsaw today was blocked much more than during Biden's, Obama's or Trump visits. But it was worth of it because there was a symbolism. The first official visit of president Zelenskyy after start of the war. And of course, first bilateral visit, which is very important to reopening of the Polish-Ukrainian relationship, which was sometimes very difficult but now is on its eve (ph).
