      "sentences": "Here is today's fast-forward lookahead.Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is going to address his health in a closed-door meeting with GOP senators today. He has frozen up twice while talking to reporters in two months. Opening statements begin today in ex-Trump adviser Peter Navarro's contempt of Congress case. The trial will likely be quick. Prosecutors will call three witnesses and the defense will call just one. A hearing is set in the Georgia election interference case today. Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee will address questions about trial scheduling and possibly splitting up the case. Now, it's set to be a big day in Atlanta and there is a lot to digest with this. So let's bring in an attorney and legal affairs commentator, Areva Martin. Areva, good morning. Thanks for being with us. So, scheduling going to be the focus today, which sounds pretty routine. But it's got a lot of implications in this case, in particular, because you've got certain defendants, like Trump, seeking separate trials. How do you see this playing out? AREVA MARTIN, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY, LEGAL AFFAIRS COMMENTATOR (via Webex by Cisco):  You know, this is a big day, David, in the Fulton County court because you have the judge asking the prosecutor, Fani Willis, to tell the court how many days she expects this trial to last, how many witnesses she expects to call, and if she continues to assert that she wants to try all 19 of these defendants together. We know that five or six of the defendants have asked for their cases to be removed to federal court. Some have asked for their cases to be severed from the rest of the defendants. And some of the defendants have even asked for a speedy trial. So you have these 19 defendants, all of which -- or at least some of them have already indicated a preference to have their cases either removed to federal court, have them tried on a different calendar, or to have them severed from the rest of the defendants. So this is going to be a big day as the judge tries to make sense of how to move forward with the scheduling of this case.",

      "sentences": "Well, we know, David, that this judge -- Judge Chutkan in the D.C. federal court -- has said that she set this trial -- the federal trial involving the case where Trump tried to overcome the 2020 election -- she set it in March because she had concerns about Trump's repeated statements -- attacks on the judiciary, attacks on the prosecutor. Attacks that she believed could have an impact -- a negative impact on the jury and make it very difficult to have an impartial jury for this case.I think that this judge is listening to the prosecutor. She's listening to these repeated comments made by Trump on a daily basis. And I would not be surprised if this judge didn't take some more aggressive and immediate action with respect to Trump's conduct. This judge has made it very clear she will not tolerate the kind of conduct that Trump has engaged in with his daily attacks on both herself, the court, and the prosecutors. And the prosecution -- Jack Smith, in this case -- has made it very clear that he is going to call out -- or his office is going to call out Trump's conduct. So I think this is one case where we should look very carefully and closely at because this might be the case where a judge enters some kind of contempt order against Donald Trump if he continues to engage in the kind of conduct that he has been engaging with respect to attacking the judiciary.",

We're talking about the developments with Alex Murdaugh. So this is the South Carolina man convicted earlier this year of murdering his wife and son. His lawyers filed a motion seeking a new trial. What they're alleging here is that there was jury tampering by a county clerk. So what do you think the chances of a retrial happening are?",

This is a clerk that was elected by the people in this particular county in South Carolina, so this is an elected official.And the allegations are that this elected official engaged in, essentially, jury tampering. That she had inappropriate conversations with the jury foreperson. That she gave instructions to the jury that could have led this jury to come back in just three hours with respect to its deliberations. And that she did this conduct -- that she engaged in this conduct for the sole purpose of writing a book about the trial. So I don't think the state's attorney general that is now considering these motions is going to be able to dismiss the allegations made in the motions by Murdaugh's attorney, primarily because there are two or three affidavits that have been signed by jurors attesting to this conduct by the clerk. So this is a really shocking development in this case and could result not only in a new trial for Alex Murdaugh but also potential criminal charges against this clerk.",

He'd been arrested days earlier and banned from entering Washington, D.C.All right, get you to his breaking news this morning. Secretary of State Antony Blinken seen here. This is new video just coming into CNN. It's on the ground in Kyiv where the secretary has just arrived for an unannounced visit to Ukraine. Kyiv, we should remind you, is an active war zone. Proof of that was overnight as Ukraine says it blocked Russian cruise and ballistic missile attacks on the capitol. And that happened just hours before the secretary arrived. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz -- she's in London. She's following this. Salma, the secretary is there to hear the latest, obviously, on the counteroffensive. What's he likely to be listening in on, and what's he likely to do as he's making this visit? SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Absolutely, and he will be meeting with President Zelenskyy later on to get that battlefield update directly, rather. You have seen and you have heard from Ukrainian officials in recent days this big talking up of some gains, particularly in the south. And that's exactly what the Secretary of State is going to listen to is the major updates that Ukraine has along the Zaporizhzhia access, particularly the win -- the success of getting the small village of Robotyne. But for Ukraine's military, they say this is significant because it has allowed Ukrainian forces to pierce through the first line of defense -- the first line of Russian defensive positions considered to be among the, if not the most heavily fortified. The word I think that he's going to hear over and over again is consolidate, consolidate, consolidate. That's what Ukraine says it is doing on the ground, trying to expand and deepen those gains on the ground as it pushes further south. Remember, the ultimate goal here -- the big prize here is to push further south towards the Black Sea coast and ultimately, disrupt or severe Russian supply lines from the coast and from Crimea. But Ukraine is still very, very far from that goal and that's exactly why he is there on the ground expressing those concerns, essentially, that the counteroffensive is going slowly. You're going to hear from President Zelenskyy who is going to say to him yes, but slow and steady wins the race.",
