So, what does it mean for the prosecution as District Attorney Fani Willis waits to learn if she's thrown off the case?Also this hour, President Biden takes his battleground state tour to crucial Wisconsin just hours after he and Donald Trump both clinched their party's nominations. I'll discuss the state of the race with an influential and independent-minded Democrat, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin. And a bill that could ban the very popular social media app, TikTok, in the United States is heading to the U.S. Senate after overwhelmingly passing in the House. We're tracking the legislation and the impact on 170 million TikTok users in this country. Welcome to our viewers here in United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. First tonight, new questions surrounding the Trump election subversion case in Georgia after the presiding judge threw out a total of six counts, including three that cited the former president specifically. Let's go right to CNN's Nick Valencia. He's outside the courthouse in Atlanta for us. Nick, what does this move by the judge mean?",

The judge is saying that they failed to include the underlying detail as to what crimes these defendants were allegedly soliciting. The charges have to do with the fake electors scheme, that's Trump and his allies' scheme to try to subvert the Electoral College and unlawfully appoint a slate of presidential electors. It also has to do with that infamous phone call, January 2nd, 2021, when the former president and his former chief of staff called the secretary of state here in Georgia and asked him to find more votes.But Judge Scott McAfee is saying in this decision that the Fulton County D.A.'s office didn't include the details for these charges to stand. And this is what he's saying and part of his decision. Quote, these six counts contain all the essential elements of the crimes that failed to allege sufficient detail regarding the underlying felony solicited. They do not give the defendants enough information to prepare the defenses intelligently. It goes on to say, this does not mean the entire indictment is dismissed. Let's pick it up there. This does not mean the entire indictment is dismissed. In fact, the door and the window is open for the D.A.'s office to appeal these charges They can fill in these details and try to get another indictment against Trump and his remaining allies. Wolf?",

      "sentences": "Sure, Wolf. Good evening. Listen, the indictment contained 41 counts. The judge has now dismissed six of them. The RICO count stands. The order is very clear about that. And just to elaborate a little bit on what's been said, all six counts concern the violation of oath of office, the criminal defendant's solicitation of that violation.The problem the judge found was that the oath of office really requires Georgia senators, Georgia representatives, and the secretary of state to promise to defend the United States and Georgia Constitutions. He said that given the language of how it's been indicted, the defendants can't pick out which of the hundreds of clauses in these two Constitutions that have been violated. So, really, the case will move forward. There is an out for the D.A. if they want to appeal. There is an ability to re-indict. It may slow it down a little bit, but it does not dismiss the case. And the D.A., of course, could elect to proceed without these six counts. BLITZER: And the very serious racketeering charge remains in place. Alayna, most of Trump's charges are still intact, so does the Trump team see this as a qualified victory?",

But they also acknowledged that this doesn't really go far in their ultimate goal, which is to have this case dismissed outright.And I do just want to read for you what Steve Sadow, one of Donald Trump's lead defense attorneys in this case, said about this decision. He said, quote, the ruling is a correct application of the law. As the prosecution failed to make specific allegations of any alleged wrongdoing on those counts, the entire prosecution of President Trump is political, constitutes election interference, and should be dismissed. Now, Wolf, this is the type of rhetoric we have heard repeatedly from Donald Trump's team, both his political campaign and his legal team, that these charges are political, it's interfering in the election. And they also -- to Michael's point, they really want to see this trial either dismissed or delayed beyond the election. That's really what they're hoping for.

I'm interested to hear that he's on schedule, that he's trying to make sure that his order comes out by the end of this week. And I think that's good both for the defense to know and for the state to know what we'll have moving forward. But it doesn't tell us much.One thing it tells us, though, is the judge is careful. It's a well- reasoned order that he wrote here and he's looking at the specific counts, he's looking at the constitutional requirements of notice to defendants, and he's balancing those interests.

Today, the president went to the heart of a neighborhood, a street that will be revitalized and reconnecting communities that were segregated and split apart decades ago during segregation. Those streets will be rebuilt. So, we talked about that using it as one example of how his infrastructure law is changing communities, just one slice of something that's happening across the country. But, Wolf, the president also made clear that Wisconsin is so key in terms of an electoral matter. He visited one of his campaign offices and told volunteers and supporters just how close Wisconsin could be. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: The thing about this campaign, and particularly here in Milwaukee specifically, but Wisconsin generally, and several other states, it's going to get down to knocking on doors, the old-fashioned way.

The campaigns will be conducted differently, but also issues are different as well. Abortion rights hangs over this campaign, as does the Israel-Hamas War. And we could hear protesters here in downtown Milwaukee earlier this evening, where the president is going to be having a fundraiser this evening, Wolf. That is another dynamic that is different in this race.
