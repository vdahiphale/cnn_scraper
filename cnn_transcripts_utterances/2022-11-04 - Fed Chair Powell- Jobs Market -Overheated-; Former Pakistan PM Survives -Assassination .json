      "sentences": "A warm welcome to \"First Move\", as always, it may be Friday but we are on the job for you. A key job Friday,of course, in America today's numbers coming, I think particularly tense time for U.S. workers with cutbacks announced just this week from the tech sector that said seemingly no slowdown yet in the jobs market overall, the U.S. economy adding a net 261,000 jobs last month. That was way above expectations of 200,000 jobs added net big upward revisions in September too, today's numbers not. I think what the Fed really wants to see as it attempts to slow down the economy and of course, tame inflation. In fact, Fed Chair Jerome Powell hawkish message this week was that monetary tightening is far from complete, only intensifying fears. I think that the U.S. will fall into recession next year. And of course, one reason why firms operating interest rate sensitive sectors were talking sectors like technology, like housing. And making plans to reduce or at least not increase their headcount for now. Twitter, of course the major breaking corporate news story with layoffs beginning this morning. Some 3000 workers, it's been reported close to half the staff maybe let go other tech firms announcing cutbacks, however, too. Ride hailing app Lyft and payment processing firms stripe cutting around 13 percent of their employees both companies citing recession fears Amazon in the meantime, extending its hiring freeze as well. Capping a horrible week really for the company that began with disappointing earnings and a warning of holiday shopping slowdown now Amazon stock falling another 3 percent in the session Thursday it shares in fact have tumbled more than 46 percent year to date, you can see it there. And talk about fallen fangs and Meta stock in nothing short of a collapse down a further 2 percent Thursday and off almost 74 percent year to date, making it the worst performing firm for the S&amp;P 500, this year. It also slows the pace of hiring. As you would imagine U.S. futures pretty volatile pre market, a higher open scene for stocks at this moment a fascinating and complex picture for stock Investors to navigate with headline jobs growth strong even as those recession warnings continue. Rahel Solomon joins us now with all the details on this jobs report. I think it's a solid jobs report. The only blip there I think particularly politically, for Joe Biden heading into the midterms that next week is a rise in the unemployment rate. Just talk us through what we saw.",

      "sentences": "So the unemployment rate did rise. In fact, Julia from 3.5 percent, which as you know, was a 50-year low to now3.7 percent. That report saying that about 300,000 more unemployed people rather, were added in the month of October 261,000 jobs added that was hotter than expectations. It was however much cooler than the revised number for September, which was 315,000. So perhaps that is what the futures are responding to that, it does appear to be a bit of a slowdown there. When Julia, we look at where we saw the job gains in the U.S. in the last month or so. Well, it was healthcare that added about 53,000 jobs, professional tech services. And manufacturing added 32,000 jobs and leisure and hospitality, which is still sort of clawing its way back from its pandemic losses, also adding about 35,000 jobs. So how does the Fed interpret that? So we saw the unemployment rate rise quite a bit about 3.7 percent, from 3.5 to 3.7 percent. We saw job gains slow a bit, the labor force participation rate, which the Fed watches very closely, essentially, how many people are participating in the labor force that did not change. And we know Powell has talked quite a bit about needing people to come off of the sidelines. And join us working folk to come off the sidelines and actually participate and we did not see that move in the month of October. So is this a Goldilocks report? You know, I mean, I guess there's a little bit of something for everyone here, job growth slowing but perhaps not as much as the Fed or even the White House would really like to see.",

But you're right any other time; this would be a great number, right to see the U.S. economy adding 261,000 jobs that would be great. But we know the concern is that we have overheated and that we need to slow down. And so in a way for the Seinfeld viewers out there, you know if you've watched Seinfeld in that episode of Bizarro World, where what is up is down and what is left is right, that sort of the environment that we feel like we're in good news is bad news.

Elon Musk expected to fire 1000s of employees in the coming hours up to half of the staff could be gone by the end of the day. Paul La Monica joins me now. I feel like Paul, we've been talking about this now for days and days and days. And the speculation has been wild over the proportion of people that might lose their jobs which terrible for these people, of course, right before Christmas. But what are we expecting in terms of numbers and actually how it's going to be carried out? PAUL R. LA MONICA, CNN REPORTER: Yes, as you point out, the numbers are staggering, Julia. There are reports that it could be half of the workers. And this really is just shaping up to be a kind of ghoulish mix combination of The Hunger Games and a reality TV show and Willy Wonka's golden ticket, because according to the reports, if you are a Twitter employee that's going to keep your job, you will get an email at your Twitter email. If you are going to be laid off, you're going to get a notice at your personal email with more instructions. And oh, by the way, Julia, they're shutting the offices temporarily and restricting badge access, because they're worried possibly about what might happen from all of these possibly vengeful Twitter employees that you know, are not going to be thrilled about not having a job anymore in the Elon Musk care?",

And they still continue to grow their nuclear program by leaps and bounds. And do things that are pretty extraordinary for a country of any size, including testing, what they claim are hypersonic weapons, which are ballistic missiles that have the ability to change course midflight, making them almost impossible to shoot down the U.S. still hasn't deployed that technology Russia and China have. But it just goes to show the regime of Kim Jong-Un's determination at this point to go down their checklist and test and enhance their already substantial and growing arsenal and arsenal that despite several years of diplomatic efforts on the part of the Former President of the U.S., Donald Trump. The Former South Korean President Moon Jae-in got us right back to this point where we're at the on the verge, potentially of a seven underground nuclear test, which would be the biggest provocation and half a decade. And could potentially push this region back to the brink of a nuclear crisis and on top of all of that, Russia and China are staying remarkably silent, remarkably neutral if it were at least the publicly they claim to be neutral. But really, you know, analysts say they are in no mood, meaning Xi and Putin in no mood to work with the United States and its allies to work with the West in general, on punishing Pyongyang, because they have this authoritarian Alliance. This alliance that basically with a wink-wink and a nod-nod they're allowing each other to do what they want to do. Whether it be China's refusal to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine, or China's refusal and Russia's refusal too strongly enforce these North Korean sanctions, which allow the country to continue to grow this program. And you know keeps their economy kind of limping along despite the United States in the West's best efforts, Julia. So this latest provocation, you know, after the week, we've had, frankly, you know, warplanes near the border. And you know, South Korea scrambling their own war planes in response, that's a pretty tame way to end the week considering that they tried to fly their most powerful ballistic missile over Japan just yesterday. And even though the missile failed in mid-flight, they learned just as much if not more from a failure than they do from a success, Julia. And, of course, the day before that, to see more than two dozen North Korean missiles launched in a single day this unprecedented Blitz. It is just really striking and concerning. We're watching very closely here, what's going to be happening in the coming hours given that North Korea is incensed by the extension of the Vigilant storm exercises between the U.S. and South Korea, which they are claiming is the whole reason why they're doing all of these provocations in the first place. Although let's be honest, it's an excuse. They say this every time the U.S. and South Korea have military drills, even though North Korean Military drills are continuing as well.",

Vladimir Zelenskyy says Russia's attacks have left 4.5 million people across Ukraine in the dark. The Capital Kyiv, the mayor says nearly half a million households are now without power. The President also says inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency have established that Ukraine is not developing dirty bombs, contrary to what Russian President Vladimir Putin has said. And we're expecting to hear from the Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan from his hospital bed the day after he was shot and injured at a rally. Sophia Saifi is in Islamabad with the latest for us. Sophia good to have you with us once again! There have been accusations directed at the Current Prime Minister by associates of the Former Prime Minister Imran Khan, of course that was injured yesterday.

We know that there are now proteststhe call for prayer his party had called for protests across the country for early general elections. That is why Imran Khan was leading along march towards the Capital. He was at one of the rallies as part of that Long March when he was attacked, yesterday evening in the district of Gujranwala in the province of Punjab. And we're seeing these protests now spread across the country from the south and the largest City of Karachi, as well as right here in Islamabad. There's an interchange called Faizabad, which connects the capital city to the City of Rawalpindi. And what we're seeing over there is tear gas protesters, not as many as expected, but it's happening in the province of Balochistan. It's happening in the province of Punjab. It's happening in the north. And it's something that we had feared; we fear that it could get worse. But we're hoping and Pakistanis themselves are hoping that this situation does not get completely out of control. And there's a situation of anarchy. So we just have to wait and see what Khan says, what he's going to control his followers or whether he will continue with those accusations and give some evidence, because the government has responded to the Interior Minister said this is a grievous statement. And this incident of Khan's attack should not be politicized. And it would be irresponsible to do so. So we're just waiting to see what happens once Khan begins to speak, Julia.",

And larger firms were in the position to give those higher salaries. Well, now as you're seeing some of these large firms that hired aggressively during the pandemic start to pause a bit in their hiring small firms are catching up. And when we survey firms, and we do that every quarter, we find that finding qualified workers is the number one issue for small firms. It's not the economy, it's not supply constrained. It's not even inflation. It's finding people and adding headcount. And so what you might be seeing is larger firms are slowing down.

We're seeing that for people who stayed on the job for more than a year, they're seeing a wage growth of 7.7 percent. That's really high compared to where we even were just a year ago. So the Fed has other channels that can maybe bring some demand down through the housing market, unfortunately, for many Investors through the stock market. But the labor market remains really tight.

That's why productivity is so paramount to economic growth. But that's not what we're seeing, we're actually seeing productivity slide. And wages are going up, not because workers are more productive, but because firms have to compete for those workers. And so that means that it's less output but more man hours, and that, by in itself is inflationary.

We shall bring you that data the moment we get it. In the meantime, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing; the first visit by G7, leading into China in roughly three years, and the first visits by a major political leader since Xi began his third term in office. Meeting Friday morning, both men emphasized the need to work together in a volatile international environment to say the least. Selina Wang joins us now on this. Selina, great to have you with us! It's funny; China holds many of the ACE cards here.

He wants to maintain those economic ties with China at the same time; he's facing this pressure, not just at home within his own government, but also from allies to take a tougher stance on China. Going into this meeting, he faced a lot of criticism that Germany is putting their economic interests over the need to pressure China on human rights and other critical issues that other allies in the West have been pushing Germany to do with China. Now, in this meeting, though, he made it very clear by being in China sending this symbolic message that despite all of these international challenges, this relationship between Germany and the world's second largest economy, well, it is going to continue, and it must continue. This is Germany's most important trading partner. And those trade flows have only been growing with the value of trade last year reaching more than $240 billion. The importance of that relationship really reflected by the fact that he went to China with about a dozen top executives, including leaders of companies like Volkswagen that make a very large portion of their profits of their revenues from China. What's also important here is that there are people inside his coalition government that are increasingly nervous about these deepening ties that we're seeing economically. A really good example of that is a really fierce debate in Germany over a Chinese state shipping company Costco buying a stake in the Hamburg Port Terminal. But the reality is that Germany may not even be able to afford a decoupling even if they want it to. There is a looming deep recession on the horizon in Germany. They've also been hit hard by the war in Ukraine, because they've been forced to ditch their long dependence on Russian energy. So they're not really in a position to play hardball when it comes to China. Another key point here, though, is that the biggest challenge potentially for German businesses and for quite frankly, all foreign businesses is China's continued zero COVID policy, which has devastated the economy at home. And it's made China a much less attractive place for all foreign businesses so a lot of difficult challenges.

As you reminded me I'mcurrently midway through my own 10 day government quarantine all inbound travelers were bussed off to isolation facilities. The doors closed we can only open them for our daily PCR tests to pick up the food that's left outside the door three times a day. Disinfectant gets sprayed in the hallway every few hours with a giant machine so all of this is really extreme for the rest of the world that's learned to live with COVID. But this is still the reality inside China. So it is no surprise that this country has become increasingly isolated as the pandemic has dragged on.",

Despite our best intentions to separateand sought only around 8 percent is recycled, most ends up in landfill incinerated or in our oceans. At the same time construction is expensive there can be supply chain issues and price volatility and traditional construction methods with bricks or blocks rely on water and drying time. A potential way of addressing all of these problems a U.S. company called \"ByFusion\" has monetized unrecyclable plastic by turning waste into construction blocks. Using only steam and compression it zero waste process re-purposes unsorted plastic waste, steel rods hold the structure together, and \"ByFusion\" wants to partner with local governments, municipalities and corporations. And Heidi Kujawa is the CEO and joins us now. Heidi, phenomenal to have you on the show. I think for most people watching this, this is the big question when you sort and when you filter, what will be recycled. And what by fusion is doing is negating the need to worry about that and utilizing it all?",

And the science behind what we do is been able to take something that's not measured, that's not clean, that's not sorted, and converted into something that is consistent in performance, and structural capabilities. And so in this machine that you see behind me, this is not a background, this is a real myth. This is the real one. We literally take the material, throw it in the machine; it is all happens within the machine and out comes a block. There are no additives, no fillers, no glues, mortars, adhesives; it's literally just plastic waste.",

So from a comparative perspective, the structural integrity is really in line with a little bit of lumber and a little bit ofhollow cement blocks that we're accustomed to saying. So we fall within a building code category within lumber that's basically on par with lumber. But from a structural perspective, we act very much like a like a hollow cement block. So right now, we are using cement for everything. That's just what we've done, and lumber for everything. And so this is really intended to maybe reduce the dependency of some of those materials, and use those for what they're most suited for and best intended to be done with. And so it's actually a very strong material. We fall within a general utility, which spans from everything from landscaping terracing, all the way into commercial applications and single family homes and residents applications. I think the sweet spot, and what we're really focused on is enabling communities to take control their plastic waste, so that we can help to build and develop and refurbish the infrastructure crisis that we're seeing around the world, not just in the U.S. So that's really where we're focused on is enabling communities to take control of their plastic put back into their communities.",

You know, it's interesting. It's not a sexy subject, though. I mean, recycling is OK.

So that's I know how to speak to investors around technology. And while this is a very technical machine with a lot of intelligence and automation, this is still waste management. So the challenge that we're seeing is, one of the problems the waste management is - from I should say is that it's not, it's been slow to innovate, there hasn't been a lot of capital funds going into that market, which is why we're in the situation that we're in. So the traditional investment community has been slow to make investments in these industries in this and in construction.
