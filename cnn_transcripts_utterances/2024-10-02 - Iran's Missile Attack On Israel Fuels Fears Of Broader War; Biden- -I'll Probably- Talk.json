As the world waits for Israel's next move, Iran insists it has absolutely no interest in a broader war. The Islamic Republic says its unprecedented ballistic missile attack on Tel Aviv on Tuesday was in response to a raft of assassinations by Israel against Iranian proxies, as well as members of its owned armed forces. With help from its allies, Israel intercepted the vast majority of some 200 ballistic missiles Iran fired. That said, some did get through. This was the moment, right in the middle of that barrage, as we saw from the roof of our hotel here in Tel Aviv. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This morning, eight Israeli soldiers were killed in combat after entering southern Lebanon and clashing with Hezbollah fighters.

So absolutely, Israel has the capability and capacity to launch not only missile and drone strikes, but long long- range F35 fighter jet complex missions into Iranian airspace and into Iranian -- onto Iranian territory.

You remember that was the first unprecedented Iranian strike against Israel with some 300 drones and missiles. And at that time, Iran was responding to an Israeli strike against their forces in Syria. So essentially, the U.S. was saying there was little damage in Israel, walk away, take the win.That is not the message right now. What were being told by the Biden administration, both publicly from the president and behind the scenes from senior administration officials is that they do have the right it to respond. The message, I'm told, is not take the win. They are fully expecting something to happen. And, of course, the U.S. side is going to be hoping that Israel listens to their advice, listens to what they're urging them to do. Now, the big question is, what is this set of targets that Israel is going to go after. And the U.S. president made clear today that he hopes that Israel will not go after Iranian nuclear facilities that would really ratchet things up. And we are told that the U.S. assessment is that for now, us does not believe that Israel is going to target those nuclear facilities. But, of course, that remains very much to be seen. And then in terms of timing, we did not see an immediate response last night. I'm told by one senior official that there taking a beat. They're considering things. Of course, the holiday of Rosh Hashanah is starting today. It's going to last three days. So it's -- there's a possibility that it comes after the holiday, but we have to wait and see what that response is going to be when it's going to come.

They have tens of thousands of rockets, big and small, that can essentially reach every square inch of Israel. But I'm told that by both Israeli and U.S. officials to my colleagues and myself that half of that arsenal has been taken out, that that a major priority for the Israelis and at the same time, we have seen the decapitation with the killing of Nasrallah of Hezbollah, as well as a large number of senior commanders.

Good to have you both on. You know, it's a difficult question to ask because there is no clear answer or may not be an answer. But, Jasmine, perhaps I could begin with you. Is there a response by Israel to this strike that that would be proportional again, a word that can be you know, it's like beauty is in the eye of the beholder, right? Proportional to one side may not be proportional to the other. But a strike that Israel can carry out that would accomplish its goals of reestablishing deterrence but without sparking a broader war. JASMINE EL-GAMAL, FORMER PENTAGON MIDDLE EAST ADVISER:  Good to see you again, Jim. I mean, that's -- that's the question really that everyone is trying to figure out right now, including the Israelis were trying to figure out how best to strike and retaliate against Iran with the Americans in their ear, telling them that they support a retaliatory strike but one that is proportional. They don't want this to blow completely out of proportion as it has been spiraling over the last few months. And so we've heard that President Joe Biden and his team are not in favor of an Israeli strike against Iranian nuclear facilities. That said, even if the Israelis do listen to them, there are a variety of other targets that they can strike -- strike. There are military installations. There are Iranian assets and proxies outside of Iran, for example, in Syria and Iraq. We saw back in April when there was this exchange of fire between Iran and Israel that Israel has proven time and time again, that its intelligence capabilities are extremely advanced and that the message it does, one of the messages that it wants to convey right now is that it can strike Iran and its proxies anywhere. So, that could be an option, although you are hearing some more hawkish voices inside of Israel and even in the United States like Senator Lindsey Graham, calling for that attack on the nuclear facilities.",

You think of the attack killing Nasrallah, the pager attack. Now a ground operation underway inside southern Lebanon, the first time Israel has sent troops in numbers in Lebanon in 18 years.

As we noted, Netanyahu has often not listened to or cooperated with the Biden administration, but let me ask you this, whether he wants to or not, Prime Minister Netanyahu, does he need us military support to carry out a decisive attack or even an attack that does some lasting damage on Iran's nuclear facilities or could Israel do it on its own? EL-GAMAL:  I mean, Jim, the short answer is that the Israelis absolutely need the Americans not just in terms of support, but in terms of defense as well. You have U.S. military assets, as you know, in the regions standing by, in the case they need to defend Israel in case of a larger Iranian attack. I mean, this is not something that the Israelis could do alone and Iran knows that. But -- and Iran knows also that the Americans would come to the defense of Israel, which is why Iran so far been reluctant to get fully engaged in that all-out conflict we've been talking about. Now, that said, you're absolutely right. What we've seen over the last year is that despite that Israeli need for American support, Prime Minister Netanyahu was more often than not ignored Biden's warnings and advice. When we saw the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. today speaking about us support for Israel and the language that she was using when she said that the U.S. has fully, fully, fully in support of Israel, it remind me of that bear hug language that was being used by Biden right after October 7th, that extremely envelope -- enveloping a supportive language that is meant to assure Israel publicly so that the U.S. can guide it privately. We haven't seen that bear hug approach be very successful when it came to Gaza and negotiations over a ceasefire. Whether or not it will be successful in this case, remains to be seen.",

It actually is indeed withstanding with the Iranian people.So, while all attention is on the military issue and will Israel go after the nuclear program, yes or no, and the level of American permissibility for that, I would rewind, I think back by two days and look at Benjamin Netanyahu's comments about standing with the Iranian people and about understanding of a shared historical heritage and history between these two people and how the past 45 years really is an aberration and an insult to that history.

Sure, once in a while, you'll see friction at the political level, but rarely if ever at the military level. And that was crucial to an effort like this.Shortly after the end of the Iranian ballistic missile barrage, the Israeli military came out and said that the Israeli air force worked hand in hand with the U.S. Air Force in the Middle East, absent as part of the effort to track and monitor these missiles. And then it was U.S. destroyers in the Eastern Mediterranean, that video you showed just a moment ago, that was the Navy firing interceptors to shoot down several of those ballistic missiles. For better or for worse, they've also had practice. There was the same level of coordination, the same effort to intercept the barrage back in April, there, there were again destroyers in the Middle East that shot down several of the projectiles, drones, missiles that were incoming to Israel and there may have been land assets as well, so air interceptors fired from the ground. There were other countries involved. Jordan said they would shoot down missiles that were in their airspace or anything in their airspace really. And we saw that happened once again. So, it's beyond just the U.S. and Israel. It shows that at the military level, there is a tremendous amount of cooperation and we very much saw that play out last night, Jim.",

They just added three or four fighter squadrons, including A10s, F-15s, F-22s. Those can obviously be used for offense and defense. And then on top of that, there is another carrier strike group heading east right now in the Atlantic Ocean that could fairly quickly be sent to the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, should it be needed. Now, much of that is a message to Iran and its proxies not to escalate, not to get involved. Obviously, Iran with its ballistic missile attack did escalate. But the U.S. as it has in the past, trying to find some sort of -- some sort of off-ramp here to prevent a wider regional war. That's always been the U.S. goal. And part of that has been the show of force and right now, we very much see that in the region again. There are also troops on prepare to deploy orders. So, they too could be sent here very quickly.

Some of those answers are probably weren't the greatest, but you pointed to that one about foreign policy. He was a very effective communicator of the Trump message in a way that the former president himself absolutely is not. And so in that way, J.D.

You could just feel them clipping that and making that into an ad right after it happened.As far as whether it pushes Trump to have another debate, perhaps he thinks he can best Harris just have a good debate like J.D. Vance and wants to show that? I don't know. I think we've all given up trying to get into Trumps head and what he's going to do.

It's a 165- page document which really is expected to be the fullest accounting that we have seen so far of Jack Smith's case against Donald Trump in the election subversion case. And it really does, at least our initial reading of this, does outline how this case should be prosecuted at a trial -- in a trial scenario given the Supreme Court's immunity ruling and specifically it seems to hone in on the fact that Donald Trump, as Jack Smith argues, there's evidence that Donald Trump knew that there was not widespread voter fraud enough to tip the scales of the election in his favor.And yet he proceeded to claim that there was any way and that he wanted to -- he wanted to use those claims to overturn the legitimate vote -- voting results from the voters in several key swing states, that he relied primarily on the advice of private attorneys. Remember the Supreme Court immunity ruling really did say that Trump was immune for actions under the official acts cause as president, right? And that really removed many of the elements in his dealings with government officials, dealing with White House attorneys. But this reshaped and this reshaped case by Jack Smith seemed to really focus on Trump's interactions with those private attorneys and how they targeted these key swing states through the fake elector scheme and through the pressure campaign against Mike Pence to ultimately overturn the election results on January 6. Now, the purpose of this document, the 165 pages, and essentially to act as what Jack Smith would tell the jury in opening statement, right? It relies on evidence that we have both seen and not seen before. We'll have to get back to you with some specific details that are new in this, but we do expect there to be grand jury details from the interviews with people like Mark Meadows, potentially, potentially Mike Pence, other high profile names as Jack Smith tries to make this case that the Supreme Courts immunity ruling does not mean that this entire case should be thrown out. And Judge Chutkan appearing to agree with that decision. Now, ultimately, Jim, we do know that this case almost certainly is not going to actually go to trial before the 2024 election, which is just you months away.
