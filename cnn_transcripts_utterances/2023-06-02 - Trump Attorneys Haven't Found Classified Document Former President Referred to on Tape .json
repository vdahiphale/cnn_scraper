They of course did this after bringing in one of his closest aides, a communications aide, Margo Martin, who was inside that meeting. She was brought before the grand jury.

What matters is the fact that he is said to have acknowledged, President Trump, on this tape that he possessed classified documents, and that he knew he possessed classified documents.

It has been kind of his theory of the case throughout and the ability to lay that out, and I think in a very detailed and coherent manner, lay out the fact that this has been his message throughout.And he believes based on his legislative accomplishments of the first two years, many of which were bipartisan, like this agreement here, that he has delivered results. And I think the jobs number today underscored that they feel like there's real strength in the economy. I think the big question, which has long been the case, can they connect that reality in their minds to where voters are? The president's approval ratings are no secret. His views of the economy, the direction of the country aren't either. This could be a moment, given the fact this has been hanging over the administration for the better part of six months.

Authorities say that two Ukrainians, including an 11-year-old child, were injured by falling debris.Also today, more attacks inside Russia, according to officials there. They say Ukrainian shelling in the border region of Belgorod killed two people. And an official in western Russia says two drones struck fuel facilities. Now, earlier this week, a drone attack on Moscow left at least two people injured and several buildings damaged. There was a significant turn in a war that until recently had left Russia largely untouched. Today, Vladimir Putin appeared to acknowledge these strikes on his country, calling them attempts to destabilize, and quote, stir up the situation within the Russian Federation.

You hear the engines hover above you and you hear the Ukrainians trying to take them down. But, of course, what's happening now is that the Ukrainians are fighting back. They've launched their own massive drone program.

So that's already happening all the time.

MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, the insertion of these private sector operators is very good, Anderson. You know, these are not that new. Drones have been around for a while. I had back in 2008, when I was in Iraq, all of our units had small, what we called Raven drones, which were literally hand launched, would give infantry units the opportunity to see ahead of them in the battle, to even look inside buildings at times. So, Ukraine has actually taken this to a new level. The drones in the past, the unmanned aerial systems, as we like to call them, are something that is an advancement on the battlefield today. But I got to tell you, what we've seen in terms of using drones in Ukraine beyond reconnaissance, but to actually drop munitions to counter electronic warfare, these are some new opportunities, I think, in warfare, and it's certainly going to change the scene.
