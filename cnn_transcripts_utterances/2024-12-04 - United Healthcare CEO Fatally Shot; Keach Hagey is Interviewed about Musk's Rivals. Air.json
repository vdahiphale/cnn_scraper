We're just hearing that the CEO of United Healthcare, which is the largest healthcare company in the country, was murdered this morning, gunned down on the streets in what police are calling a targeted attack.That's Brian Thompson right there, the CEO of United Healthcare. He was shot and killed while outside the Hilton Hotel. Let's get right to CNN's Brynn Gingras with the latest on this. I know the details are just coming in, Brynn, so what are you learning?",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right, John, of course this is still unfolding. Investigators there on the scene.But as you just described there, they believe, right now, this was a targeted attack. Now, let's back up to just a few hours ago this morning, in midtown Manhattan. And for reference for people who aren't familiar, of course, with New York City, this is really not far from where the tree lighting is expected to occur tonight. In the heart of the theater district in midtown Manhattan. It's - we're told that Thompson was headed to a conference for United Healthcare that was expected to happen in the ballroom of that hotel of the - the Hilton there in midtown when there was a gunman who fired shots about 20 feet away from him as he was approaching that hotel. Again, it appears it was a targeted attack. That gunman then, according to sources telling our John Miller, fled through a back alley near a theater, again in the heart of New York City, in the theater district, hopped on a bicycle and that is how that suspect got away. So, you can imagine right now, investigators are there on the scene. They're combing that area. They're pulling video of a very popular area of New York City. Lots of cameras to pull from to figure out exactly what happened here, where that person fled to. What we understand, though, is that that suspect was actually outside that hotel for quite a bit before Thompson actually approached that hotel. So, that is why, at this point right now in the investigation, investigators believe this was a targeted attack. But again, a lot of questions here. Exactly why Thompson was targeted, who obviously this person is, was there any help. Again, as I said, we're told through sources that he fled on a bicycle through a back alley. So, it doesn't appear like there was anybody else yet involved. But still, so many questions. And we know investigators combing the scene of that area as we speak.",

So, so much activity in and around that area. So, obviously, that is of enormous concern this morning. And then, Brynn, this guy got away. Or the shooter got away, we think on a bike. I have to imagine there is not a small manhunt underway right now across this city.",

We're talking again - I keep reinforcing it - but midtown Manhattan, at the height of Thursday morning, a rush hour time, and a gunman firing multiple shots outside this hotel where, as you just said, this is a big tourist area. And as I also mentioned, you know, this is the tree lighting. So, there's a lot of security in this area, especially today because of that event that's taking place later tonight.So, this is certainly something that is extremely alarming to police, that this could actually happen. And that's going to be probably part of this investigation is, how did it happen. But it does appear it was a targeted attack. And you just said it, John, this is no small manhunt that is going on right now as they search for the suspect who might have fired these shots.",

Just context, United Healthcare is the biggest health care company in the country. We don't know why Thompson was targeted, but authorities believe it was a targeted attack. The gunman, police tell John Miller, waiting for Thompson to arrive at an event at the Hilton Hotel. [09:35:02] And importantly right now, the gunman still on the loose. So, a manhunt underway in jam-packed, holiday-crazed New York City. We're going to have much more on these breaking developments right after a break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",

First of all, we should get a lot more details because we're expecting police to hold a news conference later this morning at about 11What we're also learning, of course, as John Miller was reporting through his sources, is that police are right now pulling camera images from all that area. And as I said before, there are a lot of cameras since we're talking about the heart of Manhattan. So, there are images that police are going to have of this suspect, not only the video of that - him - this person, you know, trying to get away on a bicycle, as we reported, through a back alley behind a theater, but also just images of this actual person. And what we're - I'm learning from sources is that this person was also masked. So, it's possible this is going to hinder a little bit of them trying to identify who this person is. I've also learned from sources just within the last few minutes that that person might have been waiting outside that hotel for about ten minutes or so. As we said, John was reporting that sources were telling him that we believe he was waiting. It's a targeted attack against that United Healthcare CEO, Brian Thompson. That is what a theory - one of the theories that investigators are working with right now. So, it's possible that person was actually waiting outside that hotel for about ten minutes or so. Again, this is all preliminary information. This is what we are learning from sources at this point. And, of course, they need to firm up their information as this investigation continues. [09:40:00] But we will expect some more information certainly when police have that press conference, we're expecting around 11:30 this morning. But those are some new details.",

Steve, so, two things I want to ask you about the Brynn just reported. Number one, this gunman was masked, apparently, and is now on the loose in New York. Talk to us about the manhunt that you imagine is underway. STEVE MOORE, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST (via telephone): Well, it's going to be really difficult, obviously, because within about five minutes your description isn't going to be worth anything. He's going to dump the mask probably, probably switch into clothes or at least take off the dark clothes that were probably over his street clothes. You would probably be setting up some kind of cordon. But, again, you're talking about midtown. So, how much - how much can you actually shut off in a short amount of time? I think, in this case, you're probably looking less at an immediate arrest because you don't know - I mean you have cabs, public transport, Uber personal cars. He could be anywhere by now.",

It wouldn't be hard for anybody to determine where his location would be. The fact that he was waiting right at that point for ten minutes would show that he had some intel on where this person would be at a certain point. So, that is - you know, that does two things to you. It shows that, again, it appears to be a targeted attack. And, number two, it doesn't appear that other people in the area are going to be necessarily in immediate danger.It switches you, though, to the mode of who - who and why.",

We know Brian Thompson - and I do apologize to everyone, we're trying to get more information on this man who was lost, and our condolences are to his family this morning to be sure. But if he was walking into a conference at this point, Steve, do you try to talk to everyone who was there, go through anyone who had been waiting to see him, to find out what you can.

It can give you that kind of information.You're also trying to pick up as quickly as you can any security cameras that would have been in the area of the - of the hotel and the direction in which he seemed to escape. So, you're looking again at the - at the stuff that would be right there. The people in the car, yes, or the people waiting for him would be crucial. You'd also want to know, was there somebody where he got into the car? Was there somebody waiting there if he had just arrived.

It doesn't appear, according to sources, that they're very close to finding who this person is. As I mentioned, sources were telling me that from an image that they were able to - to get from all those cameras in midtown Manhattan, they do have an image of who they believe this suspect is. And that image shows that that person was masked. So, of course, that is going to be difficult to decipher who that person is, especially as the getaway we believe from sources telling John Miller was this person ran from that hotel in midtown Manhattan, down a back alley by a theater, because it's in the heart of the theater district, and got on a bicycle. And that's how this person got away. So, you can imagine now they are pulling video from that possible route of escape and trying to figure out where this person actually went.So, backing up a little bit. More details, again. What we're understanding happened, at about 6:45 or so this morning was that the CEO of United Healthcare, Brian Thompson, was headed to a midtown hotel, the Hilton, there in the heart of the theater district in midtown Manhattan, again, on a day that is very heavily secured because tonight is the tree lighting of the Rockefeller tree. And this person is believed to have been there for about ten minutes or so, waiting for Thompson to arrive at the hotel, who was attending a conference for United Healthcare. And according to sources telling John Miller, that person fired multiple shots at about 20 feet away before getting away and killing Thompson. So, again, this is something police - you saw all the crime scene tape up there in midtown Manhattan. We do expect more updates at the earliest, 11:30 this morning we're expecting a news conference from the NYPD. John.",
