We begin with the tens of thousands oflives already lost and a death toll that keeps rising. 11 days after a catastrophic earthquake hit Turkey and Syria. Nearly 44,000 people have been killed in the disaster in places that were ones homes, schools and businesses and now piles of rubble. Turkey says some 84,000 buildings have been destroyed or damaged in the quake. And it comes as UN aid trucks are making their way across the Turkish border into Northwest Syria. 143 trucks so far. It has of course taken days of diplomatic maneuvering to get relief supplies into Syria's rebel-held territory. Well, CNN has been in the quake zone since the beginning. And I want to go live now to our Jomana Karadsheh who joins us now from Antakya one of the hardest hit cities in Turkey. Good to have you with us Jomana, great to see more aid getting into Syria but also I want to talk about some of those remarkable rescues that continue to happen 11 days after the quake.",

But Lynda these are very rare right now. We have seen a lot of dead bodies being pulled out of different buildings, different sites across the city and across this massive earthquake zone. I just want to set the scene of where we are right now. We are as you mentioned in the City of Antakia, one of the hardest hit here in Hatay Province. And all across the city you see sites like this where you've got these diggers and excavators working around the clock, trying to remove the debris trying to clear these areas of where once people's homes stood. And at the same time, Lynda, there are still very much active search and rescue operations taking place here. Some of those remarkable rescues we mentioned. And then you have families people sitting around these different sites waiting for news of their loved ones. It is unimaginable human suffering that we're seeing right now where people don't know what happened to their loved ones so many of them in the thousands who don't know if they're perhaps still buried alive under the rubble or if they are dead right now? And we saw a lot of this here in the City of Antakya where so many families are going through this unimaginable agonizing weight. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KARADSHEH (voice over): Antakya no more they say this once bustling historic city now in ruins. It is here where hope meets despair on every corner has seen so painful of loss so hard to comprehend. She's waited days for news for her husband, but the wait never prepares her for this. Nothing could have prepared the people of Antakia for these grimmest of days, misery here so palpable in the air.",

You have people who sit around these fires around these sites, just looking at these buildings that once were their homes, and now they are displaced, they have nowhere to go.

There's no alternative to Ukraine becoming part of the European Union and no alternative to Ukraine becoming part of NATO as well.

But that is absolutely not the position now held at all by any significant element within the Ukrainian administration at a time indeed when they are hoping to get on the front foot early in the spring with their own offensive coming also at a time of course, when they are at least enduring what could be called shaping operations by the Russians for what has been anticipated to be a Russian offensive being conducted in the early stages at any rate right now Lynda.",

In fact, the attorney for - has been who's one of these officers charged with second degree murder, went on to say that his client was seen in the video trying to help Tyre Nichols setting him up and that he was never seen punching him.

She is the 45 year old mother of two who went missing January 27th after taking her dog for a walk along the river. Police are facing mounting criticism after revealing personal details about Bulley's health. And a search for her is ongoing and family urging the public to keep its focus on finding her. Well now from CNN's Bianca Nobilo. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BIANCA NOBILO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The mysterious disappearance of 45 year old Nicola Bulley which has gripped the UK is now provoking outrage after the police revealed intimate details about the victim's private life. Nearly three weeks after Bulley vanished the local police claimed that she had previously suffered from significant issues with alcohol, which were brought on by her ongoing struggles with the menopause. Police, diving experts, media and internet sleuths have descended on the quiet village of St. Michael's on Wyre on the northwest coast of England to investigate why Bulley went missing on January the 27th walking her dog alongside the river. The head of a team of underwater experts called in to investigate said that in his roughly 20 year career, he had never seen something so unusual. Nicola left home dropped her two children off at school and was last seen walking her dog. Her phone was found on this bench, still logged in to a work meeting. Her pet dog found wandering out of his harness.",

The former victim's commissioner called the decision to make these details public dreadful and as sexist as it comes. Britain's Home Secretary is now receiving regular updates on the investigation. The family expressed their frustration in a statement. The public focus has become distracted from finding Nikki and more about speculation and rumors into her and Paul's private life.

So let's start first, with Tesla recording more than 360,000 cars. Of course, we have reported over for some time now, problems with a self-driving function. What are they saying about this recall? PAUL R. LA MONICA, CNN REPORTER: Yes, Tesla, you know, doing this recall, obviously, regulatory agencies in the U.S. wanting them to do that. Elon Musk has tweeted though, suggesting that recall might be a bit of an anachronistic term for something that can be handled from what he claims through, you know, off software updates, and that can hopefully solve the problems. But there are still merits of recall of these full self-driving vehicles. Because as you pointed out, there are concerns about driving through intersections. And I think that it probably just behooves most people, most driving experts seem to suggest that full self-driving technologies not so perfect yet that you can really just take your hands off the wheel and nonchalantly, you know, not worry about things like traffic lights.",

So Susan Wojcicki has been there for a very long time. And this is a challenging period for YouTube, because they're not just facing concerns from regulators, but also growing competition. TikTok is increasingly becoming a major force in online and mobile video. And that is a big problem for the company in the field. They also face challenges from Meta platforms, which own Instagram and reels as well as Snapchat. There's just a lot of competition. YouTube is not the only place for digital video anymore.",

Also tell - told us a tale about being in love with its founder, the technology behind being software here, Sam Altman. So there are a lot of really strange things happening. One thing that I personally found very concerning was I asked her to write a short bio about myself. And it provided a lot of information about my career, a little bit about my family, but it was very short on detail. So it fabricated a lot of that information. And for somebody who might not know me that could read it and think that it was true, when in fact it wasn't.

It's sort of the onus is on the user to then decide whether or not whatever information they're providing is true and what you should do with that information.
