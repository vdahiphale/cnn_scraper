These are zip codes that happen to represent predominantly black neighborhoods.The suit also claims that Amazon continued to charge these residents that exclusive membership rate that promises those speedy shipments. CNN's Matt Egan is here to explain all of this further. So, Matt, walk us through these allegations from the D.C. attorney general.",

But they are not denying that they did make a change in how they delivered packages to these zip codes.They're just arguing that they made that change because of concerns about crime. Specifically, they say that they made the deliberate choice to adjust their operations, including delivery routes and times, for the sole reason of protecting the safety of drivers. They say that there were specific and targeted acts against delivery drivers, including carjacking, vehicle theft, armed robbery and assault. And Amazon says that they are willing to work with the A.G. to fight crime. But again, here, Alex, I think the point from the D.C. A.G. is that you can make these sorts of changes to how you operate but you need to be up front with customers about it, right?",

It's a $1.5 million study that would involve veterans at V.A. medical centers in Connecticut and Rhode Island. And joining us now is retired Navy veteran, Brandon Bryan. Brandon, thanks for being with us. We asked you to join us today because you were a Navy veteran who sought psychedelic assisted therapy for PTSD and you welcomed this research. Tell us why.",

And I did -- a friend of mine had mentioned something about microdosing and that's when the research I came on, and we stumbled upon that in 2020, '21. But I was hesitant to fill out an application because I fell into the same cycle of, you know, there's someone better off - there's someone that needs it better off than me and so on and so forth. But then I had a really good, good friend of mine, he killed himself in October. And our stories are so much alike that I knew I was headed down that path. And I finally hit \"submit\" and I went to Mexico. Vets sent me to Mexico in January and August of 2022. And my life has been completely different ever since. Yes.

And it just makes you realize that this can happen to so many people, you know. But, you know, there's controversy around this, these drugs, not just MDMA, but there's psilocybin. They're the focus of so much discussion right now in the veteran community, which has an age-adjusted suicide rate that's 57 percent higher than non-vets, I should mention. And yet, in many cases, we're talking about schedule-one drugs. And that's the controversy. So how do you think -- and you went to Mexico, as you said, not the U.S. How do you think physicians ultimately can use these drugs without opening the door to abuse of them?",

Just, not to feel, and not to deal with the trauma that I had experienced throughout my life. It's not a -- it's not a magic pill. And I don't recommend it for everybody. But I -- where I was at in my life, like it was either that or I was going to kill myself. So I took a chance. I went to Mexico and it changed my life completely.

Under the deal, Boeing would have to pay up to $487 million in fines, just a fraction of the $24.8 billion that families of the victims wanted them to pay. An attorney for those families praised the news, saying, \"Rejection of the plea deal is an important victory of the families in this case and, more broadly, crime victims' interests in the criminal justice process.\" Boeing has not immediately responded to a request for comment.

She will be read her charge of being a stowaway on an aircraft without consent, likely to enter a plea, perhaps issued a bond. We may even hear from her, potentially, so we are certainly monitoring for any potential developments here in a few minutes when she is in court. We're also learning more about this 57-year-old woman who held a Russian passport but is a U.S. green card holder, which is why she was essentially returned back to the United States. We understand she lives in Philadelphia. We also understand that she had recently filed at least two lawsuits in which she claimed, claimed that she was a victim of military grade chemical weapons and of a kidnaping plot. So some fairly unusual claims being made there. So, as you can imagine, federal prosecutors will certainly examine what may have been her state of mind leading up to last week when she snuck onto that Paris-bound Delta flight that originated here at JFK. We also certainly recognize that there are multiple exposures here in terms of all stakeholders that they're trying to address. In fact, we had the former TSA administrator describe this as three points of failure. Delta calling this -- that it was a deviation from standard procedures that likely allowed the woman you're seeing onto their flight and that they have addressed this matter. Back to you.",
