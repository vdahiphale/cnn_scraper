      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome everyone, I'm Isa Soares coming to you from London. I want to get back to our breaking news out ofBuckingham Palace, Britain's King Charles has been diagnosed with cancer and is currently undergoing treatment. It was apparently discovered during the King's recent hospital procedure for benign prostate enlargement. Now the palace did not specify what form of cancer it is or indeed what stage it is in. But they did release a statement saying the 75-year-old King has been advised by doctors to postpone public appearances for now. A royal source says no more detail will be provided at this point. While Max Foster is our royal correspondent and he's outside Buckingham Palace. So Max, give us some - we have some detail from the statement from Buckingham Palace but give us a sense of what you are hearing from the palace at this stage.",

      "sentences": "Well, it was coincidence almost that they noticed this cancer because it came off the back of tests the King receivedin hospital when he was being treated for that benign enlarged prostate. So, the King very much thanking the medical team for finding this and the King has come back from Sandringham to London. My understanding is that he's at home receiving outpatient care and he is - his doctors have advised him not to appear in public. So, we won't be seeing him. It's not prostate cancer, it is an unrelated cancer, they're not going to give us anymore detail about exactly what sort of cancer it is. They're saying he does - he is entitled to some privacy but they're also keenly aware that the public's very concerned and alarmed by what they're hearing.",

The King has taken that away when he went in for that procedure Max. What does this mean though in terms of going forward? Who will pick up most of the duties here?",

And on that point, I mean, in the statement, it says he remains wholly positive about his treatment and looks forward to returningto full public duty as soon as possible, but he did say that he's doing this. He's talking about this to prevent and speculation, Max, which just talk to that, it's just something that we're just not used to, is it?",

      "sentences": "Yes. So the speculation, obviously, in today's digital world is already going wild about exactly what it is because, you know, when you geta vacuum of information, people do fill it with all sorts of nonsense and they're aware of that. But what they're very much asking the media to do is not to speculate and I think they've got a legitimate reason to doing that because it worries the public and it causes concern when it might not necessarily be there. So, they've done all they can to give the detail that they are going to give, but they just have this on, you know, long-running policy of not giving exact medical details because they feel he does have a right to privacy. We still don't, Isa, do we know how The Queen died. We're never going to be given that information. We don't know exactly why the Princess of Wales was in the hospital a couple of weeks ago. So, there's a line that's drawn there and they don't feel it's necessarily worrying people not to go beyond it. They feel that, you know, the public does understand that this is a long-running policy, and they're not going to give the exact detail until they have to. Of course, if things get a lot worse, there's a public duty on their behalf to inform public that the monarchy is feeling vulnerable, but at this point, they don't necessarily sense that.",

Is it something that matters hugely to this monarch?",

So, I think, you know, this incident, being diagnosed with cancer, they had absolutepublic duty to reveal to the public who The King represents. I think, you know, what happened in terms of his prostate, that was a gray area, if you like. They didn't necessarily have to reveal that to the public, but he chose to do so in order to raise awareness of the issue and encourage people, men to go and get checked. So, they're two separate incidents really. We have Princess of Wales, they had to tell about -- to tell us about that because she's the future queen and she was having an operation and something could have gone wrong. It would have been irresponsible not to tell the public about that. So, there is a level at which they have to tell us. And this is at that level. The prostate wasn't necessarily because they told us very early on it was benign.",

How do youthink pausing some of these face-to-face meetings -- he is a bit of a workaholic and he loves being engaged and busy with all these charities, how would you think how important will this -- will this be for him, not being able to be part, be meeting some of these key individuals from these charities?",

I have no doubt he'll be back to full strength in no time and I know the whole country will be wishing him well.\" There are also messages of encouragement men from the leader of the opposition Labor Party and from the first ministers of Wales and Scotland. I would like to bring in Dr. Curtiland Deville, Radiation Oncologist, and the Medical Director, the Johns Hopkins Proton Therapy Center. Doctor, thank you very much for joining us. I'm not sure how much of my conversation you heard with our Royal Correspondent, Max Foster, said, but just your reaction of -- from what you've heard.",

So, that is something that we're often, you know, paying attention to and worrying about the other, you know, most common cancers in men would be lung cancer, colorectal cancer. But again, you know, really, it could be anything at this point. If we think about the types of treatment, outpatient management is very common. And so that's not necessarily telling us too much. Even if patients are getting systemic treatments, which, you know, sounds a little bit like that might be the case. Those may be things like chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, target therapies, those may be things that the patient can get an infusion within the hospital, within an outpatient center, or even at home in some cases. And then, you know, that is sort of a beginning part of their treatment. And so it's still unclear, I would say. You know, other cancers may require things like surgery, radiation, where the obviously the patient is going to be admitted or come into the hospital or have an elected procedure. And so it might be a little bit more obvious. But, you know, so some information, but still not very clear.",

In this statement fromBuckingham Palace, doctor, we heard that he went in for benign prostate enlargement and a separate issue of concern was noted, right? Talking about this form of cancer. When you go in for these procedures, for prostate enlargement procedure, what kind of tests are done? I'm guessing blood, urine, X-rays, just talk to us through it.",

Many people, it is a brutal, cruel diagnosis, the treatment is tough. And it can cut life short. It's really tough. And so it has been a great surprise because we knew that Charles went in. It was for a minor issue. They were very transparent about it, The Palace. It was just a minor issue, prostate enlargement, which is very common among men. And the only hint that we had was he stayed in one extra night. But that could have meant very little at all. And then we now have this really surprising announcement. And we all are wishing The King well. President Biden, the Prime Minister. But certainly at the moment, it does sound as if we can't speculate. But as if the cancer that they have found is early stages because he's going for outpatient treatment. There's no top operation planned.

Any kind of hints there that you think of what may happen in the next few days?

If he was to have an operation, you know, an operation of which one is in need for time -- for some time, we would need a Counselors of State to step in to cover the role of King. But at the moment, all the constitutional duties, talking to the Prime Minister, the stamping laws, the documents, he will be doing all of that. It's the public facing work. And this is where we see the result, really, of the slim-down royal family. Because that's what the movement has been towards. But now we have the Princess of Wales is out of action until at least after Easter, recovering from her serious surgery. William was going to be looking after her. He's come back to work early. We really have all of the public facing royal duties now around the shoulders of William and Queen Camilla. We also have Anne and Edward. But that's a lot of the King's duties to fulfill.
