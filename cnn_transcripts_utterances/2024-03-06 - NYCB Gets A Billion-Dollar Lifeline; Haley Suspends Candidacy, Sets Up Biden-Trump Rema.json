You get what I mean? How's that going to proceed over the next hour? Who can tell, but the markets are what they are and the events, well, these are going to be affecting the markets. Further turmoil in the US banking sector. The shares in the New York Community Bank have halted as it seeks a financial lifeline. Nikki Haley bows out of the 2024 election race. She doesn't endorse Donald Trump. And as Boeing production problems continue to mount, the Ethiopian Airlines chief executive on why he is buying up to 20 new large Boeing jets. Live in New York, Wednesday, March the 6th, I'm Richard Quest and I mean business. A good day to you. We begin tonight with a billion dollar rescue of a New York bank and a warning from the Central Bank that the US sector might be vulnerable. Shares in New York Community Bank are just barely ahead. They had fallen more than 40 percent this morning on the reports that the bank was seeking a cash infusion. Trading was halted for volatility pending the news. Now as you can see, the shares have come back, but that's because the exposure to commercial real estate has been a huge concern for both investors and rating agencies. The shares have come back because of the prospect of either government bailout, or other money coming into New York Community Bank or some form of rescue that will protect savers. At the same time, the Federal Reserve, the Central Bank, has warned that this problem days ago in its semiannual report to Congress. The Fed said \". the quality of commercial real estate loans backed by office retail and multifamily buildings has continued to decline.\" It's \". the result of lower demand for downtown real estate that has shifted towards telework.\" And today, the Fed chair was on Capitol Hill discussing the report in detail, when he said the Fed is trying to help struggling regional lenders with their balance sheets.

Their debt was downgraded to junk. So they needed to do something dramatic, and they did. This is a billion dollar lifeline and it is coming from some notable investors. Right? Steve Mnuchin, the former Treasury secretary, he is leading this investment. He is taking a seat on the board. He says that this equity raise is going to give the bank enough money to kind of weather the storm. We also see that Joe Otting the former Comptroller of the Currency, a top Federal regulator, he is the new CEO.

It is because as you mentioned, there's a lot of empty office buildings, a lot of empty downtowns right now, and that means that yes, some of the landlords are going to go bust and some of the lenders that lend to these projects, they're going to be in trouble, too. But he said that the big banks, they really don't have a lot of exposure here. He said, it's really the smaller banks. He said, regulators are on top of this.

Haley got a little more than two million. The mathematics mean Haley received almost a quarter of the votes. Donald Trump might struggle to get them back in the general election, because 81 percent of Haley supporters, 81 percent in the swing state of North Carolina said they won't back Donald Trump in November. That is the number one problem. He may not have gotten Nikki Haley's endorsement. Now, he has the backing of the Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who endorsed the former president only moments after Haley withdrew.

That is one avenue here. But interestingly, many officials also believe, that we've spoken to, that the Houthis might actually stop if the war in Gaza ends. They note that during previous ceasefires between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, the Houthis did seem to halt their attacks. And so one of the kind of Hail Marys here is to hope that if there is time, some kind of ceasefire that those attacks will cease.

They say that was why they needed to create this for profit arm, and this was something that Elon Musk recognized they say at the time.

I want to read you from one of these other e-mails included in the blog post from Elon Musk to the OpenAI founders in 2018, where he says: \"Tesla is the only path that could even hope to hold a candle to Google.\" Today, of course, OpenAI is in fact a formidable opponent to Google, and OpenAI is saying here that Elon Musk is jealous that he's no longer involved. They want to read you just one other portion from this blog post, which just doesn't mince words, Richard, it says: \"From OpenAI, we're sad that it's come to this with someone whom we've deeply admired, someone who inspired us to aim higher, and then told us we would fail, started a competitor, then sued us when we started making meaningful progress towards OpenAI's mission without him.\" So that seems like it's going to be OpenAI's real argument here is that Elon Musk is just jealous now.",

He raised the company's valuation in just the last few years from essentially worthless to now about $90 billion, which has allowed them to become a leader in this AI arms race.

Ukrainian Navy says at least five people were killed, though. Here's how both leaders reacted after the attack. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): We saw the strike today. You can see who we are dealing with. They don't care where they strike. I know that there are victims today. I don't know all the details yet, but I know that there are dead and wounded. We need to defend ourselves first and foremost. The best way to do that is with an air defense system.

Right now Ukraine is nowhere near losing large chunks of territory or even losing key cities. They certainly are still holding the Russians up, but they certainly have some pretty big issues whether Ukrainians lack the manpower that they would need on the frontlines and certainly lack the ammunition in many places that they would need there as well. The other big defining factors that the Russians have learned to use their air force much more effectively have turned a lot of the regular bombs they have into guided glide bombs that they can drop from a lot further away. And the Ukrainians are having issues dealing with that, which is why they say they need Western warplanes to try and even the playing field there. So right now the initiative definitely on the Russian side but strategically it certainly seems as though this is still very much a stalemate -- Richard.",

And we see as well agriculture is done so that the fields are sold and planted in Kherson region and in Dnipro region. So we have also the steel factories that are operating in Dnipro that is also (INAUDIBLE), very close to frontlines. So in terms of geography, our economy operates everywhere and our sea trade is reopened and this was the video from Odessa that despite shellings the sea is open and it helps to increase the export of agriculture, but also steel products. And we are expecting that container shipment will also resume that will help us to export more value added goods. But in terms of statistics, we lost more around 30 percent of our GDP in 2022 and recover at just 5 percent in 2023. But you know, for state in war to become a 5 percent of GDP is something enormous and incredible.
