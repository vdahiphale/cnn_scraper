This is CNN News Central.This morning, former Trump Aide Taylor Budowich is in a federal courthouse in Miami. Here's why. CNN has learned Special Counsel Jack Smith is using a second grand jury there as he investigates Donald Trump's handling of classified documents. That investigation appears to be nearing its final stages now. CNN has also learned Trump's former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, that he testified before a federal grand jury in both special counsel investigations. CNN's Katelyn Polantz is in Miami for us. She's joining us right now. Katelyn, let's start with this new second grand jury that we're learning about. What are you hearing about this?",

They've been inside the federal courthouse for a couple of hours, apparently in that secret proceeding where the special counsel investigators are asking, we believe, about this possible mishandling of classified records, that particular part of the investigation. That is why Taylor Budowich is in Miami.Now, there are a lot of questions around this still, particularly why this isn't happening in Washington, D.C., where we saw so much grand jury activity. But we do know that Taylor Budowich, someone who is very close to Donald Trump, who's been an aide, is working with a super PAC still for Donald Trump as the former president launches another campaign for the White House. He's a person, too, that was among the group that talked Trump out of saying publicly he had turned over everything to the National Archives at a time when they were demanding he return all of the documents from his White House and where he did not return all of the documents from his White House, even though 15 boxes were sent back to the Archives. So, we don't have yet any sort of indication of exactly what's happening in that grand jury. It is a sealed proceeding, but we're closely watching, at least to see how long he's going to be in there.",

The person pleads guilty to a crime, if they've in fact committed a crime, and in return, they hope that they get a sentencing reduction.The middle ground, which I think is the most likely here, we don't know, but I think, given my experience, the most likely is that Meadows was given immunity, meaning he took the Fifth, saying, my testimony might be used against me. Prosecutors then sort of countermove and say, okay, but we're going to immunize you, meaning we're not going to use your testimony against you, and as a practical matter, we're not going to be able to prosecute you. Now you have to testify. The third scenario, which I think is unlikely, is he just went in there, testified and hoped for the best. No good lawyer would counsel him to do that.",

Prosecutors are going to ask about that. And even remember Trump's infamous phone call to Brad Raffensperger, I just need you to find 11,780 votes. Mark Meadows is on the line for that as well. And as chief of staff, he was involved in the packaging, the packing up and moving out of the White House, and he was a liaison between the White House and Archives.

This is a hospital where popes have gone for many, many decades for their primary care. He had an appointment yesterday that lasted about an hour. He attended his weekly audience in St. Peter's Square this morning, up to a full crowd. And then he came by private car here. He didn't come by ambulance. And this is supposedly a surgery that's going to take care of some pain he was having.It's important to note he has a very busy summer scheduled, and they haven't canceled his plans for August. They have canceled his audiences through the end of June, but not for August. He's going to Portugal for World Youth Day. Then at the end of the month of August, he's going to Mongolia. So, one could say that if this surgery goes well and the Vatican has assured us they believe it will, that he will be in good form for these trips coming up. But, of course, any 86-year-old person in fragile health, which he is, he's confined to a wheelchair most of the time, he's had a lung bronchitis, he was in the hospital, this hospital, in March. Any person this age going under general anesthesia, going under the knife, we've got to worry about. So, until we hear from the Vatican, we're still waiting and hoping, obviously, that everything goes well for the 86-year-old pontiff. Kate?",

This thick smoke may kind of dissipate and then it's expected to come back tomorrow afternoon into the evening. And, of course, this is all from those hundreds of -- more than 100 wildfires that are burning up in Quebec, so hundreds of miles away, but still having a huge impact here.

So, these are charts that you don't want to be topping as a city when it comes to among the worst polluted cities in the world. And this also comes down to health.Now, the mayor says that they haven't seen an uptick in emergency room yet, but officials are warning especially those with respiratory issues, asthma, cardiovascular issues, also other vulnerable people, the very old, the very young, pregnant women are people who should take extra precautions and stay out of this smoke.

You could smell it. You could taste it as you step outside. By the way, today is the Global Running Day, and the organization that runs that says that this is not the day to do that, not to recognize this day. You want to pick another day to go outside and recognize Global Running Day because the air quality is so bad. And heads up, New York City, this kind of milky shade to the cloud cover on our visible satellite loop, if you thought yesterday's air quality was bad, it's about to get worse. We expect the impacts from this to go downhill significantly in the minutes and hours to come as that next round or next wave of smoke from the fires in Quebec starts to settle further and further south into the Hudson Valley. I mean, look at this. We have numerous reds and purples indicating very unhealthy air, and everybody wants to know, when is it going to clear up? Well, unfortunately, we have to get worse before we get better. This is a very stagnant weather pattern all driven by the upper level winds called the jet stream. And it's really not going anywhere. It's called an omega block. It prevents weather patterns from shifting from the usual weather pattern setup west to east across the U.S. It's just not taking place anytime soon.
