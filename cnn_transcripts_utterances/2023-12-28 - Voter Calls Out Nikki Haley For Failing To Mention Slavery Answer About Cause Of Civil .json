Presidentialhopefuls Nikki Haley is in damage control mode today after she made comments ignoring the role that slavery had in causing the Civil War. Plus, the Colorado GOP says it's asked the Supreme Court to overturn a ruling barring Donald Trump from the ballot in their state. We'll talk about Trump's troubles with the 14th Amendment. And the crisis at the southern border with thousands of migrants arriving every day, immigration is among voters' top concerns. We are live at the border. Good day, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt to our viewers watching in the United States and around the world. It is 11 a.m. here in Washington. It is Thursday, December 28. There are just 18 days until the Iowa caucuses, 312 days until Election Day. This is today's State of the Race. Welcome in. Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley is scrambling this morning to repair damage that she did to her own campaign last night.

This was not a trick question. This was a very simple question that had a simple answer. And for her to not acknowledge slavery called Civil War, and to talk about government freedoms and individual liberties, that's a great answer for New Hampshire, the \"Live Free or Die\" state. But, that wasn't the question that she was asked. And the unfortunate thing, when you're 18 days out from the Iowa caucuses, when she has the wind at her sails, the momentum, she has the polls going in her direction, that is the needle going across the record, a big screech moment, because now she is talking about this instead of the momentum that she has going into to Iowa.",

That's unquestioned, always the case. We know the Civil War was about slavery. But, it was also more than that. It was about the freedoms of every individual. It was about the role of government. For 80 years, America had the decision and the moral question of whether slavery was a good thing, and whether government, economically, culturally, any other reasons, had a role to play in that. By the grace of God, we did the right thing, and slavery is no more. But, the lessons of what that bigger issue with the Civil War is that let's not forget what came out of that, which is government's role, individual liberties, freedom for everything single person, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom to do and be anything you want to be without anyone or government getting in your way. That should be the goal of what we always try and take away from that, right, because we never want to return back to that place. But, we always want to remember the lesson of what it means to be a free individual, and that everyone deserves to be a free individual. So, we stand by that. I say that as a Southerner. I say that as a Southern Governor who removed the Confederate flag off the Statehouse grounds. And I say that as a proud American of how far we had come. So now, I'll start. I'm going to tell you a little bit about myself. We're going to talk about the state of the country and we're going to talk about how to save her.

We have been listening to Nikki Haley in North Conway, New Hampshire, where she just spent a significant chunk of time trying to cleanup the remarks that she made last night when a voter asked her point blank, what caused the Civil War, and she did not use the word \"slavery\" in a considerably lengthy answer. She is now saying that, of course, that is the case. But, she has gone on -- she went on to talk about individual freedoms. Then, of course, she mentioned her own history with the statehouse in South Carolina when she was governor. The Confederate flag had been flying on the grounds, and she had it removed in the wake of that shooting at the Mother Emanuel Church in Charleston. Tia Mitchell, I just would like your reflections on what we heard here, because I -- it was one of those kind of -- also, it was remarkably awkward moment for her to have to explain this front of this audience. TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, THE ATLANTA-JOURNAL CONSTITUTION: It's awkward, and I wonder if she is digging herself a deeper hole, because number one, the questioner last night literally said, I'm surprised you didn't mention slavery. So, if she thought at that moment, well, of course, this is about slavery. She could have said it then and she didn't. And now that she is in cleanup mode, she is somewhat saying the right things after it's gone viral. But now, she has to grapple with the fact that people are pointing out you didn't move the Confederate flag until people were slaughtered at a church because you had been asked for months, if not years prior, you don't always support individual liberties on issues like abortion or transgender rights. So, now that you're making these additional comments, there is just opening herself up to more criticism, more scrutiny of current and past statements. So, I think this is going to continue to snowball, and this is what's to be expected. She wants to be the big rival to Donald Trump. Well, now you're being -- your feet are being put to the fire saying, what exactly do you stand for? What have you said in the past? How does it compare to what you're saying now?",

TheColorado High Court deemed Donald Trump ineligible to run under the 14th Amendment's ban on insurrectionists holding public office. The state party is arguing that they showed unprecedented disregard for the First Amendment. Trump is facing similar challenges to get him removed from the ballot, including one in Maine where the decision is in the hands of the Secretary of State, who is an elected Democrat. Trump's lawyers say she should recuse herself from making that decision based on prior social media posts condemning the January 6 insurrection. Our panel is back with me. And CNN National Correspondent Kristen Holmes also joins us. Tia, we are talking the 14th Amendment, obviously, the insurrectionists. That was all about the Civil War and slavery. So, we're going to continue the theme. I'm heading back to the 1800s today. But, no, in seriousness, Kristen, you cover Donald Trump day in and day out? How do they view what the Colorado court did here? I mean, obviously, it's not a state that -- I mean, it would be presumed to be a blue state in any general election. I will say I've talked to some people who think that this was good for Trump that it created -- it was a political -- basically a political win for him played into his the system is rigged argument. But, I'm curious what you hear from them when you talk to them. KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: So, when it comes to Donald Trump's legal issues, this is just not one that really concerns them. And it's not just Colorado. It's all of the ballot cases. They believe that at the end of the day, he is going to be on the ballot in all 50 states. And part of that is because of what we've seen in so many states already. We've seen Secretaries of State time and time again refuse to take this up. We've seen Supreme Courts refuse to take this up. So, while this is -- was a surprise to them, because they actually thought that if anything, they were going to get ruled against in the lower court, not in the Supreme Court, that they'd be fine in the Colorado Supreme Court.",

So, Trump would have an opportunity anyway, and could use this political argument in an appeal. But, clearly, they wanted to get it out there starting early, this was political.",

And today, we're learning a little more about the actual substance of what was done. We're learning from a National Security Council spokesperson that Mexico's President actually took significant law enforcement actions on the border. And Kasie, that's important to note, because what Mexico does acutely impacts the U.S. southern border and what federal law enforcement see on the U.S. side of the border. And the numbers that you were mentioning is a perfect example. So, last week, when this area was getting flooded, there was a very steady flow, on average, maybe about 3,000 migrant encounters a day just in this area. Eagle Pass is Del Rio Sector. That's when we were seeing thousands of migrants that were waiting to be transported out for immigration processing. After law enforcement actions, and we don't have a readout of what those exactly were, but I can tell you from experience that when Mexico ups its enforcement actions, that usually means that there is National Guard members, Mexico's National Guard, on post in several areas of the northern Mexican border that are on post where smugglers notoriously cross large numbers of migrants. That could also mean checkpoints at trains and freight rail stations along Mexico's route, because migrants use those trains to get to the U.S. southern border, and that could also mean deportations. This is the Mexican government deporting migrants from Mexico to other countries. And this means that these migrants are not making it to the U.S. southern border. And so, all of these things impact the number of migrant encounters that federal law enforcement see. Now, the other thing that we learned is that now Mexican officials will be visiting D.C. in January. And from Mexico's President, what we learned is that there is some agreement. And again, we don't know the details of the agreement, Kasie. But, what we do know is that according to the President of Mexico, there was some agreement to reopen ports of entry. Now, these ports of entry were closed by the U.S. federal government to -- as a mitigating measure, as a way to help them shore up their resources to process migrants. Now, that makes sense on so many levels for these two countries to agree on, Kasie, because Mexico is the U.S.'s largest trading partner. And so, it makes sense for these two countries to come together, do something because they're both losing a lot of money if these ports of entry continue to be closed. Kasie.",

It has Cedar Rapids. There is a ton of Democrats who live in Cedar Rapids where your paper is based. What do you hear from them when they talk about the race, and President Biden in particular?

They see the general election polls and see how close they are with the respectivematchups, or in some cases, President Biden trailing in some of those. So, there is concern. I think, like a lot of Democrats across the country, Iowa Democrats are trying to break through and a messaging and portray an image that the economy is in good shape, is what they will say, and that they lean on the infrastructure bill that the President was able to get passed, and try to portray a positive image of what will happen in the next two years knowing that that's somewhat of an uphill climb right now when you look at national polling and the national mood. So, they support President Biden here in Iowa. They like the things he has done largely. But, yeah, definitely some unease when they see those numbers.",
