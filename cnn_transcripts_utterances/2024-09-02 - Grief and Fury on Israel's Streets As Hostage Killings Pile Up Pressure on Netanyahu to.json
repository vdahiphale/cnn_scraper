Francis is as you say, traveling almost 33,000 kilometers across the globe.And a really important part of this visit is going to be inter-faith dialogue, building relationships with the Muslim world and other religions. When Francis is in Jakarta, in Indonesia, he's going to be having an important meeting at a Mosque, which is the largest Mosque in southeast Asia. It's a Mosque that's connected physically by a tunnel to the Catholic Cathedral across the road. A kind of example, embodiment of the vision that Pope Francis wants to see. He of course, in Indonesia, be in the world's most populous Muslim country. And I think the pope will be hoping that his message of dialogue and peace and friendship can resonate across the world at a time when we see growing conflicts and wars. And these problems that France has been trying to address many times. And now, he will be hoping that his visit can have an impact globally. Now, as you mentioned, the pope's age, Francis is 87 years old. Some people are asking, can he actually carry out this trip. Is going to be a long and grueling schedule. But Francis has shown he's determined to do so. One of his advisors said that the pope told him that, look, I didn't become pope to have rest.
