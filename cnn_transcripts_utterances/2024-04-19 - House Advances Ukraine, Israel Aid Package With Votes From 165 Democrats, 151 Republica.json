It was a pretty extraordinary move. More Democrats supported that procedural measure than the Republicans did. Republicans, of course, are in control of the House of Representatives.It was 165 Democrats compared to 151 Republicans, and those Democratic votes were key for Speaker Mike Johnson overcoming opposition from his right flank. That reliance on the other side of the aisle means Johnson's future may be in jeopardy now. A third Republican said just moments ago that he supports ousting the Speaker.

He is on very thin ice, but he knew heading into this day that putting these foreign aid bills on the floor and needing to rely on Democratic support to do so was going to spark an uproar on the right.But it is still a very rare moment here to see Democrats support these procedural votes. Just, historically, they've always been done along party lines, and in this case, more Democrats actually supported this procedural vote than Republicans. I want to read you the vote breakdown, because it's very interesting here. 165 Democrats supported that procedural vote, and just 151 Republicans voted for it. Now, Johnson says he's not worried about his job being at risk here, and he also delivered a very forceful defense of this foreign aid package, which will receive a final vote tomorrow. Just take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): It's not the legislation that we would write. If Republicans were in charge of both the House, the Senate, and the White House, this is the best possible product that we can get under these circumstances to take care of these really important obligations. And so we look forward to the vote tomorrow. We let -- look forward to every member voting their conscience and their desire. And that is exactly how this process is supposed to work and how the House is supposed to operate. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Not all 11 players get to call their own play. And now you could try it that way, but you're going to fail. And so that's the situation we're in right now.

What will be presented, whether it's about him being unfaithful, also about what they really think of him.You have a number of jurors who are saying that they are favorable towards him. And they believe in his policy, that he's been good for the country. One juror saying that she takes more issue with Trump's base than she does with Donald Trump, and has criticized them as well. Another person asking him -- asking the jurors about his rhetoric and whether that led them to be more biased towards him or otherwise. They seem to imply they could actually be very impartial towards him, causing Donald Trump, of course, to lean in intently about how they viewed him. And, of course, the question is about unfaithfulness are a really key part of this, of course, because part of the allegations stem around an accusation that he has been involved in an extramarital affair with Stormy Daniels. Now, that may or may not be crucial. The veracity of that for proving the underlying charges here, which include falsification of business records, certainly the rhetoric of that. Also, there's a moment here where a jury is asked about -- a juror is asked about how they feel about the fact that it's Donald Trump in the courtroom. And the juror said, a male from New York said, \"We don't really get starstruck or really care about anything like that. He's just a normal person. That's the way I see it.\" Another person talked about him as a businessman, that he is a family man as well. So a lot of how they're viewing him is really going to be intriguing for the defense and the prosecution as to who they want to ultimately sit as alternates.
