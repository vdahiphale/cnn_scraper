President Ruto vowing to restore order following anti- tax rise protests that left the parliament building alight and five people dead. Flight to freedom, Julian Assange arriving in Saipan to formalize a plea deal before returning to Australia and ending a 14-year legal battle. A Wegovy win. The weight loss drug approved for use by overweight and obese citizens in China, according to reports. And a battle of the beans. East meets west as we speak to the CEO bringing Vietnamese coffee culture and their climate conquering brew to the world. That conversation and plenty more coming up. But first. Kenya's president is criticizing what he calls \"treasonous events\" after demonstrators stormed parliament and a fire was started both there and at Nairobi's City Hall. Kenyans are protesting government plans to raise taxes during a cost-of-living crisis. CNN journalists witnessing disturbing scenes in the nation's capital with police firing live rounds at protesters. At least five people were shot and killed and more than 30 wounded.

That is a fear among so many in the country that he would not even mention the finance bill, which precipitated these street demonstrations, not just here in Nairobi, in the capital, but also across the country. One of the most extraordinary scenes was the half-sister of Barack Obama, the former U.S. President. Auma Obama was speaking to me live on CNN when we were tear gassed repeatedly. She had to take a breath just to be able to collect herself and be safe before we continued talking. She was out here to support the young people of Kenya.

Auma Obama, a Kenyan British activist who lives in Nairobi, among crowds of protesters on Tuesday. Kenya, in the grip of a \"total shutdown\" in response to a controversial finance bill, which includes proposed tax hikes on basic goods, including sanitary products, amid a cost-of-living crisis. A. OBAMA:  These young people need a future. They have no jobs. Over 50 percent of our population who are under 35 have no jobs. We can't start taxing them when they have no jobs. We're taxing the jobless. MADOWO (voice-over):  The protests are part of the country's \"seven days of rage.\" Tuesday's events turning deadly, with policemen hitting and detaining demonstrators.

The E.U. is accusing Microsoft of abusing its market power by bundling its Teams workplace communication software with its Office 365 software services. In most cases when a business buys Office 365, they're getting that Teams workplace communication software along with it. And the E.U. says that that is an unfair advantage for Microsoft and could harm competition in this space. Now again, if these findings are confirmed, because they're preliminary at this point, Microsoft could be looking at a massive fine, about $21 billion or 10 percent of its global annual revenue. But I want to just take a step back here because this is the second of these actions that we've seen in two days. And I think there's really two interesting elements to look at here. The first is that Microsoft says it's already made changes to come into compliance with the DMA. This is similar to what we heard from Apple yesterday. And I think it'll be interesting to see if the E.U. is willing to buy that, if it's willing to say, OK. these companies have done enough in the month since we began this investigation and let them continue operating or whether it believes there is more work to be done. The other thing I think we may start to see from these kinds of regulatory actions in the E.U. is a fracturing of tech services by country. We're already starting to see some of this with Apple, it's saying it won't roll out its Apple Intelligence A.I. tools in the E.U. because it's worried that it won't comply with the DMA. I think we may start to see more companies doing that, offering different services or bundles in the European Union because it wants -- they want to comply with the DMA than they do in the U.S. or elsewhere, which I think could lead to some frustrated consumers in some areas as well as potentially challenges for businesses that operate across all of these different countries.

And I think people will be familiar, certainly, in the United States, but I think elsewhere as well with the Arabica bean. Robusta is generally around half the price. And I think we can show that. It's -- I also mentioned it goes into instant coffee. What is it that the Vietnamese know about bringing out the flavor and brewing these beans that perhaps others miss, and they're only just learning, right?",

And actually, through our work over the last couple of years together, he's actually purchased a second farm for his family. And now, we talk about the future together.
