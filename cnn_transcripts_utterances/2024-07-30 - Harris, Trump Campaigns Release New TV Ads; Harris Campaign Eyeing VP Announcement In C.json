You don't have to prove that you're right. You don't have to win the argument. You can just cancel them off and thus yours is the more legitimate Jewish position.

I mean, you start going down this line. It's wild. Obviously, President Trump has done a lot of things that Israelis are happy about, recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, which was promised by president after president, but Donald Trump actually did it.

And so they won't have to vote again. You know, he would have to go through his record on all of this is to say nothing, all the other ways in which he's arguably undermining the pluralism and liberalism that keeps American Jews safe here. So I think there's a reason that most Jews don't vote for -- aren't planning on voting for Donald Trump. And there's a reason that Trump himself doesn't want to have these conversations. It's because as you say, being supportive of this, one particular vision and version of Israel is not necessarily the most important thing to most American Jews I also want to say it does not cancel out or excuse any of the other things that I just listed that I would argue are very clearly antisemitic.",

Now, Sanjay, tell us more about this COVID summer surge. Is it unusual? How seriously should we take it? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. No, I don't think it's unusual. I mean, people typically think of these viruses being more in the fall and the winter, but over the last four years, at least, we've seen what has happened in the summer, along with the wind -- fall and the winter. If you take a look at this graph and this is sort of wastewater surveillance, kind of gives you a global look at what's happening there. You can see that big surge in the winter, but then a pretty sudden peak again in the summer comes down again and then you see that sort of happening over the last four years. Couple of things to pay attention to. One is, again, you get to surges throughout the year, not just one, but also the rate of acceleration of the summer peak. It goes up pretty suddenly and I think that there's a clue in there as well, which basically says that's probably when immunity starts to wane for people, whether they've had an infection or they've had the vaccine, that's why you suddenly get that peak again here. This virus seems to be adapted better for summer months, for warmer and wetter months. What we see now in the country, Jake, as a result is about 36 states where you have higher levels infection. We're in that sort of summer surge if you will. And we'll see how long it continues. In the past, it's continued a few weeks, but we'll see what happens this year.",
