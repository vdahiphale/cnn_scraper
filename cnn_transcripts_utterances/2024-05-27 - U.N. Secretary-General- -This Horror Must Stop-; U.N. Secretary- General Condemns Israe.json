Nadal fell to fourth seed Alexander Zverev, just his fourth loss ever at the tournament. The King of Clay has won 14 Grand Slams in Paris, the most any player has won at a single slam. Don Riddell is with me now. Don, poor Rafael Nadal. The problem now is -- and we know he's going to be back, of course, for the Olympics, but what does this really mean about his future?",

So,coming into this tournament, we all thought it was going to be his last ever French Open, and everybody was preparing for the waterworks as a result. But then, on the eve of the tournament, he started hedging his bets. He was like, well, maybe it won't be. We'll see. So, the truth is, we don't know. We don't even know if he really knows. But I think it was always going to be very, very difficult for him today. As you say, he's never lost in the first round of the French Open, a tournament he's absolutely dominated in a way that no other athlete, I think, has dominated any other event in the way he has done here. But because he's been out so much with injury, because his ranking has plummeted in recent times, he was here, unseeded, running into the fourth seed, Alexander Zverev. And that's why this match was so difficult. So, I think we all knew it was a real uphill task for him to win this game. We still saw glimpses of him during this match that reminded us all of the brilliance of the King of Clay in Paris. But yes, this could be it. And afterwards, he certainly addressed what the future might hold. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RAFAEL NADAL, 22-TIME GRAND SLAM WINNER: You know, it's difficult for me to talk. I don't know. It's going to be the last time that I'm going to be here in front of all of you. Honestly, I am not 100 percent sure, but if it's last time, I enjoy it. Now, the crowd have been amazing during the whole week of preparation. And today, yes, the feelings that I have today are difficult to describe in in words. But for me, it's so special to feel the love of the people the way that I felt in the place that I love the most. So, (INAUDIBLE). I mean, maybe in two months, I say it's enough. I can't give Anything else, but it's something that I don't feel yet. I have some goals in front. I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics. That motivates me. That -- yes. The feelings that you made me feel here are just unforgettable. Thank you very much from the bottom of my heart. And I really hope to see you again, but I don't know. Merci beaucoup.
