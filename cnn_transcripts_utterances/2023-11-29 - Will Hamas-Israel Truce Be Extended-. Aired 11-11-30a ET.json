Another four hostages are 18 and 19 years old; 10 others are 75 years old and older. Now, while families wait for word on what tomorrow brings, other families are also waiting for what happens today.

It's typically around this time during you all's show that we start to see the Red Cross getting these hostages from Hamas, then facilitating their transfer through Egypt and then eventually back to Israel. We have not seen that yet tonight. It's about 6we're still waiting to actually see that movement and to see who is on this list. Of course, the families of these loved ones already know who is expected to be coming home. They always have a bit of caution that, until their loved ones are actually back here on Israeli soil, they're just very cautiously optimistic about the list. We look at this, though. We do know it's expected to include women and children, but there are two children that we know are not going to be on this list today, and they are the youngest hostages that are still being held by Hamas. People are very familiar with their faces now. They are two young boys, Kfir and Ariel Bibas. Ariel is 4 years old, Kfir 10 months old. He was 9 months when he was kidnapped. He has now turned 10 months old while he was in captivity. And I heard from their family just a few hours ago, who said they did get word from the Israeli government that their loved ones, those two little boys and their two parents who were also kidnapped, including their mother, Shiri, who is believed to be being held with them, are not on this list. And, obviously, that is heartbreaking news for this family that has just dealt with every single day waiting to hear about these loved ones. And we talked to them about the condition that they're in. They talked about, obviously, a 4-year-old going through a really traumatic situation of being held hostage, but also the 10-month-old. When he was kidnapped, he had not started eating solid foods yet. He was still having formula. He's still in diapers. They have real concerns about what everyday life for these two tiny babies could look like while they're in captivity. I spoke to a cousin of the family, who told me this: (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "We just did just hear from a senior Israeli official, who said Israel is looking at the possibility of extending this truce.I think that's really the first time we have heard from Israel that they are considering that the truce, which has lasted for six days now and is expected to go as of right now until tomorrow morning, could last even longer. We have seen the countries be, I would even say very optimistic that this can be extended by a day or two. Hamas has signaled their willingness to extend the truce, so we're waiting for a final answer here. Israel not likely to confirm an extension until they see the hostage released -- hostages released from Gaza tonight, 10 women and children. It's a bit late right now. We normally see the process beginning by this hour, and yet it's important to note that we have got no indication right now that the process has broken down. Yesterday, we even saw exchanges of fire. The Israeli military says there were three explosive devices planted near them, and they were fired upon and fired back. Hamas, meanwhile, said it was Israel that initiated the skirmish. Regardless, that was the most serious violation of the truce we had seen to this point. And even under those circumstances, the truce, the agreement, the release of hostages, the release of prisoners held together. So, as of right now, we expect it to do so once again, as, on the outside, there are intense diplomatic efforts to make sure it continues, not only for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza and the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, but also for that crucial humanitarian aid that has flowed in, about 240 aid trucks a day or so, according to USAID. They want to see that continue and become a part of this, but that remains a challenge, Kaitlan, especially as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised, essentially, that, when this pause is over and whether that ends tomorrow or at a later date, but, when this pause is over, Israel is very much ready to continue the war and try to achieve its goal of destroying Hamas. That weighs on all of this.",

When the hostages are released, they're taken to hospitals to be checked out not only for medical evaluations, but also reuniting with their families. Right now, we have learned 23 hostages so far have been discharged from Israeli hospitals after being freed by Hamas. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is tracking all of this, this morning.

Kate and Sara, I do want to tell you some breaking news that we have just confirmed here, which is that at least one American is expected to be on the list of hostages who are being released today. Remember, there were three total going into this truce that the U.S. believed could be eligible in the group of women and children to be released. Abigail Edan, obviously, was already one of those. She's the only American who has been released since this truce went into effect. But we are now learning, my colleague Alex Marquardt and I, from two sources that at least one American is expected to be on this list today. That will obviously be welcome news for the White House that has been waiting and asking questions. Whether or not both of the women that we believe are eligible will be on that list remains to be seen. But we are learning at least one American is expected to be on this list of the group of the six hostages who are expected to be released tonight.",

That's great news.Kaitlan, thank you so much for bringing that to us. And Kaitlan was talking about how families are hoping to get any word of how their loved ones are doing, where they are, anything about how they're doing in Gaza in captivity. And it's a huge question hanging over all of this. And over the last five days of the fragile truce between Israel and Hamas, 81 hostages have been released from Hamas captivity, mostly women and children, as was part of the agreement. And now, this morning, Israel says 161 hostages remain kidnapped and held in Gaza. A spokesperson for the Qatari Foreign Ministry on CNN this morning said that they are hopeful to extend the current truce and also then start moving towards discussions to potentially secure the release of civilian men and military personnel. How those more challenging negotiations progress mean everything for the family of 38-year-old Itay Svirsky. Joining us now is Itay's cousin, Ofir Weinberg. Ofir, thank you for being here.",

Let's get straight over to Kaitlan Collins for more on this. Kaitlan, tell us more about what you're hearing, the claim by Hamas and what the IDF is now doing. COLLINS:  Yes, Kate. And, obviously, we take everything that Hamas says with a grain of salt. They have claimed previously that hostages had been killed, including Hanna Katzir, an elderly woman who was one of the first hostages released as a part of this temporary truce. But now they are making a claim that three of the Bibas family members, the mother, Shiri, and her two sons, have been killed. We do not know that. We cannot verify it. But the IDF is now weighing in on this claim made -- being made by Hamas. And for more on that, I want to bring in CNN's Oren Liebermann, who is tracking this. Oren, obviously, this is a very delicate situation. We want to make sure that we're reporting out what's accurate, what we're hearing. What is the IDF saying right now about these claims?",

And the family did seem to be under the impression that they were being held separately, based purely on what so many families -- the last time they saw their loved ones was in videos put out by Hamas members the day of October 7.And there was a video of Shiri and her two young sons, Kfir and Ariel, where she was holding them. And, Oren, I was talking to their cousin yesterday, Eylon Keshet. He was saying seeing that video panicked him because, he had never seen her looked so scared and so desperate as in that video. He said that she's someone who always has a smile on her face. And to see her in that moment, you could see that she was scared not only for her own life, but for that of her children. And so when we heard from the IDF in recent days making clear that they did not believe Hamas itself was holding the Bibas family, the mother and the two young children, I mean, is there any indication of why they put that information out? And the fact that they're saying right now -- just because Hamas is claiming someone else has them, that doesn't mean Hamas doesn't have responsibility for this family. They're still holding Hamas responsible for this.",

Certainly, over the course of the past several years, we have seen friction, sometimes quite a bit of friction between Hamas and the other militant and terrorist organizations inside of Gaza, for example, Palestinian Islamic Jihad. But when it comes to who has the power, the might and the control over Gaza, it is Hamas. And that's why the Israeli military will hold Hamas responsible right now and in the future and certainly in the past, regardless of who it was that was holding the Bibas family at that moment or who Hamas had transferred them to or moved them to. So, Israel will hold Hamas ultimately responsible here, as they try to learn more information and find out what is the ground truth on what happened or didn't happen here, Kaitlan. COLLINS:  Yes. And this just goes to show it would be really helpful if the Red Cross had actually been able to get into Gaza, which is supposed to be part of this agreement that's happening right now to go and check on the other hostages to be able to provide a status update so people could know if Hamas was lying or not about this, instead of having a family that was already anguished enough now get this kind of news, that they don't even know if it's accurate or if Hamas is just lying, like they have about other hostages being killed. And because the Red Cross has not gone in, we have not gotten that update. The Bibas family was telling me earlier they really want the Red Cross to do their job to be able to go in. Hamas has obviously been preventing that. Oren Liebermann, this is a developing story. If you get any updates, please let us know. Sara, obviously, for this heartbroken family that has been besides themselves, this is the last thing they wanted to hear. And just to not even know if it's accurate or not, it only makes it, the cruelty, just that much more amplified.",
