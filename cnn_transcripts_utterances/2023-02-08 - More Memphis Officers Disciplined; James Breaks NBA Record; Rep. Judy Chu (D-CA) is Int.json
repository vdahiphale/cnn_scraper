Good morning, Erica.Twenty-two-year-old Monterrious Harris, who is a U.S. Navy veteran, alleged in a newly filed federal lawsuit that just three days before Tyre Nichols was stopped he was assaulted by members of the Scorpion Unit. In this lawsuit he alleges that the five officers -- former officers who are now charged with second-degree murder in the death of Nichols, were the same officers that assaulted him. And in this lawsuit, Harris says that he was sitting in his car in an apartment complex waiting for his cousin to come out when men approached him wearing ski masks and did not identify themselves as police officers. In fact, he went on to say that he thought he was being car jacked and he tried to get away. He was eventually, he says, punched, dragged across the concrete and beaten. Officers did say after they arrested him that they found a handgun in his car, as well as some marijuana. Harris alleges that the handgun was legally registered to his cousin. He is suing the city of Memphis and the police department for $5 million, alleging as well that they falsified the police report. All of this coming as the city council held its first meeting since the video of Tyre Nichols' beating was released to the public. And during this meeting they passed a series of reforms, public safety reforms, including officially supporting the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. Earlier this morning, Tyre Nichols' parents were on CNN this morning and spoke about their adamant support of that legislation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

[09But when you look at everything LeBron has done over the course of his career, who else would it have been? And the moment came on a Tuesday night. And when that happened, when he hit a fade away off the left elbow, almost nothing but net, he ran to center court, raised his arms in triumph as an entire arena cheered him on, likely many more watching from home. He came to the center court and was greeted by his family, as the crowd chanted MVP. He was emotional, as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the person whose record he now eclipsed, embraced him and greeted him, along with the NBA commissioner. And when you look at LeBron James' legacy, the on the court, of course, will be respected and always remembered. But the reaction and the embraces that he had once he crossed that milestone are emblematic of who he is off the court. And for many, all of those come together in the legacy that the LeBron James. And when you talk about the history milestone that was crossed tonight, it wasn't just a moment in NBA history.

JUDY CHU (D-CA): Well, I was encouraged by the thunderous applause last night for banning assault weapons. You know the 11 shooting victims in Monterey Park were killed by a high-capacity magazine that is now illegal in California. And it allowed this shooter to kill many people at once in a very, very short period of time. It is so clear that it's time to ban assault weapons and also to ban high-capacity magazines. And I think that it's - it's the voices of victims like hers and - and the voices of victims of mass shootings and of shootings all across the country that need to be heard so that everybody in America can rise up and ultimately get this ban.",
