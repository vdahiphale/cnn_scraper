It's not always associated with a big weather system or a front or thunderstorm. We'll get to that in a second.Delta right now says it's helping these passengers after some of them said they simply just came up out of their seats -- this turbulence was so severe. The FAA says this happened on Delta Flight 175. It was descending into Atlanta. Was it 40,000 feet, descend it to 12,000 feet, 40 miles outside of Atlanta when they hit turbulence severe enough to be described as severe. This is the breakdown from the FAA. And you can see in the video here, there is severe turbulence so severe that someone actually hit their head on the overhead bin and cracked it. One crew member seriously injured. Another member of the crew -- three of them with minor injuries, eight passengers with minor injuries. We know that eleven of them were taken to the hospital. But this is a really interesting case. Because this keeps happening over and over again. And even the CEO of United Airlines says we're probably going to see more things like this because it's simply thermodynamics 101. Hot air rises, the climate is getting warmer and we'll see more and more turbulence, incidents, more often. In fact, the NTSB says that this is the top cause of incidents on board commercial airliners with about a third of these incidents resulting in at least one serious injury. Although, kind of the good news here is that nobody was too terribly hurt on this flight and typically doesn't really result in any damage to the airplane. So kind of a testament to the engineering of these things. Although we're seeing pretty often flight crew members who are up and working in the cabin, they're the ones the most at risk.

So the technology is getting better and Delta has its own weather system to try and make it so that they can avoid these things, forecast these things a little bit better, but it's not perfect.
