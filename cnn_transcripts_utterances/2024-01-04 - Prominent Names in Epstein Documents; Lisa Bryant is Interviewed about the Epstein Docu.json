I don't really expect to see them because we've seen snippets of this information come out through the years. But I really think the new revelations are going to illustrate the scale that -- of Epstein's trafficking ring. You know, how the power and influence among all these powerful people has allowed them to really continue to keep this under wraps, keep this information private, evade justice or prosecution. Of course, we know that just because their name might come out in these documents, it doesn't mean any -- you know, necessarily that there's any guilt. But there are some people that are guilty. Let's just face it, there will be. I think for the survivors, and, you know, the attorneys who have been working so hard to bring this to light, I do think it gives them a sense of at least some satisfaction and some justice that we're keeping the conversation going and hopefully those that have, you know, participated or helped facilitate in the sex trafficking might be looked at again.

It was not insurrection and President Trump in no way engaged in insurrection.\" So, how will the Supreme Court respond? The 2024 election and dozens of Donald Trump's criminal and federal charges are all hanging in the balance. CNN's senior Supreme Court analyst Joan Biskupic is leading us off here. Joan, what more are Trump's lawyers arguing here, and in the end isn't it pretty likely that the Supreme Court is going to take up this case because you don't just have Colorado, there are other states that have made rulings on this.",

      "sentences": "Good morning, Sara. You're right, you know, we got the -- Donald Trump's filing last night and he argues, as you say, that he did not engage in insurrection. But as a threshold matter, he says that this provision in dispute of the Constitution, the 14th Amendment, Section 3, that says that anyone who was in - who held office, took an oath to uphold the Constitution, but then engaged in insurrection should never be able to hold future office. And he says even as a threshold matter that does not apply to the presidency and he also says that it doesn't stand on his own. Congress would have had to have passed a law to enforce it. So, there are several steps that the justices will have to consider before they even look at the key insurrection question that you raised.But then we get to the real question here of what are the justices going to do. Right now, Sara, they have three sets of petitions before them, from Donald Trump, from the Colorado Republican Party and from the Colorado voters who started this case, who said that Donald Trump should be disqualified from the ballot because of the insurrection on January 6, 2021. The justices, as I expect, over the next couple days, will likely decide whether they're going to take it and on the timetable. I agree with most of what people have said, that the justices are likely to take this case. I should stress that they have discretion. They have discretion about when, how and exactly what questions they resolve. But I think because of what's happened in Colorado, what has happened in Maine also to keep him off the ballot, these justices are going to have to weigh in. Tomorrow, Sara, they will meet for the first time in the new year, privately in their conference room, to look at several cases that have been pending. I can't imagine that they would not give this a first look together. And we could know by the end of Friday or a few days into next week exactly what questions the justices will take up and a timetable. And I want to just give one other thing about the timetable. The Colorado voters who started all this have asked the Supreme Court to rule by February 11th, because on February 12th, that's when ballots start to be mailed out to Colorado voters who have until Super Tuesday, March 5th, to submit those. So, they want a decision by then. The Colorado Republican Party said, you know, just as long as you decide by March 5th we'll be OK. Donald Trump didn't have any kind of timetable, but he said this should be decided promptly, Sara.",

If they take the case, I absolutely, of course, agree with Joan, very likely, not certain, very likely they'd take this case. Then there's really two ways they can go in terms of how broadly they rule. They can, if they want, rule narrowly as to Colorado. The ruling would read something like, yes, the states do have the ability to administer the 14th Amendment themselves and, yes or no, Colorado did or did not do that in a constitutional way and therefore the Colorado ruling would fall or rise. But that would leave us questions as to all the other states. What happens with Maine? Did they do it correctly or not? Option b is, they can rule more broadly. They can say, for example, the president is not an officer for purposes of the 14th Amendment, or it's up to Congress, not the individual states. If they rule that way, it will answer Colorado. It will also answer all the other states. So, if I had to guess, I would guess towards the latter because I don't think they'd want to invite dozens more of appeals.",

And we are told that that vehicle was really the only target here. It also killed an associate of this commander of this pro-Iran militia.Now, this comes at a moment, of course, when tensions in the region are extremely high. The U.S. has been retaliating against Iran-backed proxy groups who have been launching strikes on U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq and Syria really relentlessly. Over 100 such attacks since October 17th according to a defense official. And in asking -- when we asked the Pentagon about this latest strike on this individual in Baghdad, a defense official told us that the United States is continuing to take action to protect our forces in Iraq and Syria by addressing the threats that they face. Now, it's unclear at this point whether the Iraqi government was notified in advance of this latest U.S. strike because it did take place in Baghdad, which, of course, is the capital of Iraq. And so it would be interesting if the U.S. decided not to notify the Iraqis, who have expressed a lot of anger over the continued U.S. strikes inside Iraq on these pro-Iran militia groups. The Iraqi government saying in a statement last week that these strikes constitute a violation of their sovereignty. But, look, the U.S. has continued to insist that they are going to take action wherever these pro-Iran militia groups have been attacking U.S. forces. And they have conducted as well a number of strikes in Syria where we have seen several of these attacks take place in recent months. Sara.",
