Mr. Biden's executive order bars migrants crossing the border illegally from seeking asylum if that number exceeds a daily average of 2,500. But Greg Abbott says that policy announced less than a week ago isn't aggressive enough.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. GREG ABBOTT (R-TX): All this new Biden policy is going to do is to actually attract and invite even more people to cross the border illegally. And you've seen on videos ever since the Biden order went into place, there's no slowing down of people crossing the border. In fact, it's just accelerating. And so this is gaslighting.

The Tren de Aragua gang is allegedly running a multi-state human trafficking ring, attacking police officers and dealing drugs.

Police in the region say a Venezuelan gang known as Tren de Aragua has victimized thousands through extortion, drug and human trafficking, kidnapping and murder.

He says the stop was a symbolic show of support for partnerships that can prevent future conflicts. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) [04:45:00] JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: And the idea that we're able to avoid being engaged in major battles in Europe is just not realistic. That's why it's so important that we continue to have the alliances we have, continue to beef up those alliances, continue to keep NATO strong, continue to do what we've been able to do for the last, since the end of World War II.

There are only a few reportedly in combat, and it was nearly 600 kilometers from the front lines in the war. The decades-old balloon feud, meanwhile, between North and South Korea picking up speed over the weekend. North Korea sent dozens of trash balloons into South Korean territory, and South Korea responded with loudspeaker broadcast. But one South Korean politician is urging both countries to stop the, quote, childish chicken games. Mike Valerio joins us now from Seoul. We've had another update as well about a response from North Korea, I believe.",

And we were able to confirm through South Korea's joint chiefs of staff that they have seen indications that North Korea appears to be preparing loudspeakers of their own along the border of the DMZ to blare propaganda messages from the northern side to here and the southern side of the DMZ.So again, Max, you know, if you're just following this whole drama, this is all resulting from dueling balloons from South Korea for years, sending slices of life, slices of freedom via balloons to North Korea. And North Korea in recent days responding by calling those deliveries filth and sending trash balloons here to the Seoul metropolitan area and in different parts of South Korea. So yesterday we saw South Korea respond with loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts for the first time in about six years. And Max, you know, it's worth pointing out when we say propaganda broadcasts coming from South Korea, we're not talking about old Cold War stuff. We're talking about a song from BTS that played on these huge military loudspeakers emanating from the roofs of these trucks that you're seeing on the screen right there. Other K-pop songs. So we're talking about soft power blaring from South Korea to North Korea. Also, South Korean news reports detailing human rights abuses perpetrated by Kim Jong-un and his regime in North Korea. North Korea for its part, Kim Yo-jong, the sister of the northern leader, saying that this could be a prelude to a very dangerous situation. Warning of more consequences. But Max, earlier last week we were able to speak to the founder of a South Korean group. He defected from North Korea in 2000 and he justified sending these balloon deliveries north. And what was sent in those deliveries? Here's what he told us. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PARK SANG-HAK, FOUNDER, FIGHTERS FOR A FREE NORTH KOREA (through translator): We send money, medicine, facts, truth and love. But to send filth and trash in return? That's an inhumane and barbaric act. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The main opposition leader here in South Korea, Lee Jae-myung, is saying that this is essentially a game of chicken from his point of view. And it could lead to a localized conflict or very absolute worst case scenario, an all out war.That seems to be mirroring the points of views of many constituents who we've been talking with over the past few days, specifically farmers who live near the DMZ, who have said, you know what, we're just trying to live our lives here and we want this all to stop. But in some, Max, we here at CNN have counted one 1,110 trash balloons from North Korea to South Korea. Everybody living here in Seoul just wants it to stop. They've said that this is getting old really fast, but it's all about the tempo of how this tit for tat increases or hopefully slows down over the next few days -- Max.",
