He is said to be nervous, that he might let Kamala Harris down.CNN's Isaac Dovere has this reporting. He's joining us now with much more on this. So, what more are you learning about how, I don't know, how he's all feeling ahead of tomorrow. EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER: Hey, good morning, Kate. What Tim Walz is going into tomorrow night is something that he hasn't done before, and most people haven't done before, a nationally televised debate. Obviously, high stakes. It could be, likely will be, the last big marquee event of the campaign. And Walz is looking at this saying he wants to make sure he is making the case for Kamala Harris, as strong as he can, even though he obviously didn't know Kamala Harris himself very well before he got picked, but he wants to do that both for the sake of not letting her down, making sure that she feels - continuing to feel that she made the right choice in picking him, and also because he is really committed to the idea that Donald Trump can't be president again and that Kamala Harris should be president. So, it's a lot riding on it. And the reporting that I have on the site gets into all of that, the role that he's been playing in the campaign, both in front of the scenes, making people really feel attached to him and to her, and behind the scenes, lining up some key endorsements for Harris.",

And what the Harris campaign is doing ahead of this debate, very specifically, is trying to highlight that comment that Donald Trump made in the debate that he had with Kamala Harris, where he was asked, does he have a plan to replace Obamacare, the Affordable - or the - and he said that he has concepts of a plan. They - we are 14 years into the Obamacare debate, nine years into Donald Trump running for president. He's supported repealing Obamacare. And he still does not have a plan for it. He made clear for what it would be instead. It's also beating up on J.D. Vance for something that he has been talking about on the trail, which is a way of separating out people in different risk categories and how they'd be covered by insurance, different pools. All of that the Harris campaign is saying is a way that would hurt Americans, and most importantly the thing that they're highlighting is that it would likely scale back things like preexisting condition coverage, which is, overall, one of the most popular places - or popular parts of Obamacare.",

Did a rally in Nevada last night. Was supposed to have more campaign events today. Going back to Washington to focus on the hurricane. How was that decision made, and what are her plans exactly? IAN SAMS, SENIOR SPOKESPERSON, HARRIS-WALZ CAMPAIGN: Well, thanks for having me. And the vice president's been briefed over the weekend consistently by the FEMA director and the team on the White House side about this horrible devastation that we're seeing across the south. I grew up in east Tennessee, right across the mountain from Asheville, North Carolina. Seeing the flooding that's happening there where I'm from is heartbreaking to me. And the vice president and the president are working hard to mobilize federal resources to the area to make sure that there are 3,300 federal personnel on the ground mobilized to help support this effort, to get generators, food, water into the area. She wants to come back to Washington to get a briefing from FEMA today, to be updated on the latest of how that work is going on the ground. She spoke last night with Governor Cooper in North Carolina, and she's reached out to other governors across the south, to sort of see what they need. And she committed last night, as you heard from her at her event in Las Vegas, that none of these communities will be left to rebuild alone. She's going to make sure that the president and she get the resources into these communities as they are needed.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Kamala is mentally impaired. She's incompetent. She's not a smart person. If you think about it, only a mentally disabled person could have allowed this to happen to our country. Joe Biden became mentally impaired. Sad.

It said that they would like to see her doing more unscripted events. They said, quote, \"it's a disservice to the American people and to her own record and leaving the public with a sense that she is being shielded from tough questions, as Mr. Biden has been, could backfire by undermining her core argument that a capable new generation stands ready to take the reins of power.\"Your response.",

She's got an interview coming out, I think in about ten minutes, on a highly, highly listened to podcasts called \"All the Smoke,\" where she talks about her vision for the country and, unscripted, about who she is and where - how she grew up and what her values are.So, she's going to continue talking to the American people in these sort of settings and formats. She's taken questions from reporters on the campaign trail. She's going to continue to do that. You talk about \"The New York Times\" endorsed. I'm more interested in yesterday we saw the endorsement of former very conservative Republican Senator Jeff Flake from Arizona, who said she is the patriotic choice, that - that he's putting character over party, putting country over party to endorse her in this race. And I think that what you're seeing across this country is Republicans, independents, Democrats, but Republicans who are coming out and saying that she is the right choice in this election. And so she's very proud of the support that she's getting from Republicans across the country, including Senator Flake yesterday, including General Stanley McChrystal yesterday saying that she's the right leader to take on the commander in chief mantle during these times of great challenges around the world. Those are the endorsements that she's focused on. And, of course, she's going to continue talking to the American people in rallies and in interviews and in podcasts throughout the rest of this campaign.",

He's now facing five charges in this case. Just last week prosecutors charged him with attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump. That was in addition to the two gun charges he was already facing. Those were possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. Two other charges now on top of all of that, include possessing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence and assaulting a federal officer. So, he will, as I said, enter a plea today. Also, it's worth noting that the judge in this case is expected to be the federal judge overseeing the case will be Judge Aileen Cannon. She won't be here in court today, but for the future, she will be taking this case over. And she's the same judge who was overseeing Donald Trump's Florida classified documents case until she threw that out last summer - over the summer. But just in terms of the findings that the prosecutors say they have in terms of evidence, they say that they have a letter that was turned over as part of - turned over by a witness in this case who said that Ryan Routh had dropped this letter in a box at his home weeks ago. And this letter reads in part, \"dear world, this was an assassination attempt of Donald Trump, but I am so sorry I failed you.\" Prosecutors say that letter was written by Ryan Routh. Also, they did search Ryan Routh's car. They say they found six cell phones there, including - included on one of those phones was a Google search that looked at how to get from Palm Beach County to Mexico. Sara.",
