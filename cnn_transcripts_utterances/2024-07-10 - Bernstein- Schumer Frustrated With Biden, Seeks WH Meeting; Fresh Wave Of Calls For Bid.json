How she did it was something of a political master class. When asked whether he had her support at the top of the ticket, this was her answer. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

As a senator. As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend and I believe in him. Believe in his character. Believe in his morals. In the last four years, he's won many of the battles he's faced.\" He goes on, \"But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time. None of us can. It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago with a fundraiser was not the Joe 'big effing deal' Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all saw at the debate.\" Later in the day, New York Congressman Pat Ryan became the eighth House member to say the President should step aside.

He's frustrated with the whole situation, especially the way the White House, the way Biden, the way the First Family has dug in and has said that there's no more discussion of this. That's the frustration and Schumer is hearing from every quarter, from donors, from members of the Senate, from members of the House, that he, as a leader of the party, has got to do something to see that there is an orderly process in which the best candidate who could best defeat and face Donald Trump becomes the nominee. And there's grave doubt that that person is Joe Biden.Grave doubt among senators of the Democratic Party. Grave doubt among members of the House of the Democratic Party, among donors. And certainly, we don't know to a T what Schumer's doubts are. He's very careful in this master class, as you called it, of being a little bit evasive in language, the way Speaker Pelosi was also there. But he's frustrated, and he's feeling the anger, and he's voiced some of the anger to people he's been talking to. And the fact that he, the leadership of the House and the Senate, the party itself, the donors, everybody has left a little hanging here, except for Joe Biden, who says, I'm the nominee, I'm running and at the same time, it is the greatest secret in the world that has been unsecretized that there is huge movement against Joe Biden running in the party right now. And that includes among the senators that Schumer is talking to and the House members. And so you have an unprecedented situation here that Schumer is trying to keep from breaking open in a way that there is intra-party warfare. And his solution, which he thought he had a real shot at doing over the weekend, was to convene a meeting, probably today or yesterday, of three or four people who love Joe Biden in the Senate, in the House, among his friends, meet with Biden, not ambush him, but have a full discussion with Biden, maybe including Nancy Pelosi, about the repercussions of his decision that he is running and case closed. He still wants to do that, Schumer does, and is intent on having such a discussion.",

So there still is no modus operandi to make this happen and at the same time, Speaker Pelosi, as we saw today, Senator Schumer, others, are determined that somehow there has to be a discussion in which all of these factors can be aired out in a way among old friends.But look, the prevailing feeling among members of the Democratic members of the House and Senate is that Joe Biden is a weak candidate against Donald Trump after that debate, and that situation has not changed. And Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi know that better than anybody. And they're trying to see, is there some other way forward. It's very subtle.

Obviously, we heard Speaker Pelosi giving sort of leeway this morning, saying, let him get through NATO, and then basically putting the conversation back on the table for Friday.I think, you know, one of the things the Biden team, I think, needs to do is to be a little more forward-leaning about putting their case on the table, put some data on the table that shows the path forward. I personally, looking at the publicly available data, don't think that this race isn't winnable for Joe Biden. I think it is winnable for him. I think enough of his voters are sticking with him, even as you see some movement in the polls. I don't deny that. But I don't think the race is out of his grasp. I do think that his campaign team needs to do a more aggressive job of giving people - showing people the path, and showing them that they believe that he can win. I feel like there's been sort of a defensive crouch over the last couple days, and I think that some of this intensity and fire that's been aimed at Hill Democrats who are raising these questions needs to be re-channeled. The anger and the frustration is there because people are afraid of a second Donald Trump presidency, because Donald Trump is somebody who went out this week and said again that he was proud that he overturned Roe versus Wade. So it's a real fear, and that's where the anger's coming from. And I think that the campaign would be better served by channeling that anger and saying, we also want to beat Donald Trump. Here's how we do it. Come get on board. And then turning this fire that's been turned at the Hill toward Donald Trump.",

This comes down to, I think, the leadership in the House and the Senate.And I think the reason Chuck Schumer is frustrated is because it's put his member to a running for re-election in a very difficult spot. If they stick with Biden, where they have misgivings of how the strength of his candidacy, Biden might drag them down. They don't know that. But if they split with Biden, there are still large swaths of the Democratic base that are fully behind Joe Biden. And alienating that group makes it kind of a no-win situation. I think the two important things that have happened in the last two weeks, one is what's happened. Joe Biden has said he's getting in the race. He's put all these people in this position, but he's done it for a political reason, because he wants to be in the race he thinks he can win. The second is what's not happened, which is you have not seen private go to public. You've seen a few members here and there, the vast majority, 96-, 97 percent of Democrats have either held their power or come out in support of the President. So the frustration I think is political and this decision at the end of the day will be about the politics of the situation and how the politics impact each and every one of these members.",

The problem is right now, I think the real doubts are about whether Joe Biden as a candidate has the capacity to be the messenger we need right now, right? Like it is true, other candidates don't pull much better against Donald Trump, but we're counting on the idea that they'll do politics, that they'll go out there from 8 AM to 8 PM and make their case that they'll be able to carry the message cogently, coherently, directly, clearly over and over again, every time without us feeling like we have to hold our breath when they do. Like, if Joe Biden can do that, if he can get out there and make the case fine, great. I would love that. I think Joe Biden has been an excellent president. I think he's a decent and courageous man. The problem is right now, he's not using the torch or passing the torch. And that, I think, is the main problem. And if he's not going to do the former, then I hope he would do the latter.

The flip side of that is there's also -- it doesn't -- that gamble doesn't necessarily take into account the people who are just sort of so depressed by it or disgusted by the whole thing that they may just stay home or go for a third-party candidate, which again, in these -- this whole thing boils down to a few -- a couple of hundred thousand votes in swing states.",

And because of what has happened, because of new information, we have the opportunity to pursue that new option and I believe we would be foolish not to at the very least have that debate and force Joe Biden to either campaign aggressively to prove -- to prove that he deserves it or to give us a chance with somebody else.

Obviously, the president and the White House are insisting that he's staying in the race. REP. SETH MOULTON, (D-MA): While the president has to insist on staying in the race because he's all in until he's out and I think that's why a lot of Democratic leaders are all in with the president until he's out as well. But for those of us in the rank and file who represent the concerns of our constituents and in my case, just want to be honest with people about how I feel we need -- about what we need to do to win this race against Donald Trump, I think you are going to see more and more come out in favor of a change at the top of the ticket.",

MOULTONWhen you have a strategy that's leading you towards defeat, you don't double down on that strategy, you have to change your strategy. Ever since that disastrous debate, we haven't heard anything from the White House or the campaign team about how they actually intend to change their strategy, change their approach.

It's forever in our minds and it's going to be forever on the airwaves because of course, Republicans will repeat it on TV between now and the election.So, this is a tough spot and I'll tell you, Anderson, on a very personal level, it was a very difficult decision for me to decide to go publicly against the president after days of making phone calls in private, behind the scenes, trying to convince his inner circle to make a change. Joe Biden has been a personal mentor to me in politics. He came up in campaign for me after my first contentious primary. He is someone who used to have me over for breakfast when he was the vice president to mentor me as a new member of Congress. So this was not an easy decision but I firmly believe it's the right thing to do for our country. It's the right thing to do at a time when the stakes are so high, when the alternative to a Democratic president is someone who incited a mob to storm the Capitol, something that's never happened before in American history. We can't get there and that means we have to make some tough choices right now as Democrats.
