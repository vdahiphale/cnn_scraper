We know that social media companies have issues policing their own content, whether it's misinformation or harmful information for teens. But we haven't heard from them yet.

SARA SIDNER, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  Speaking of social media, Elon musk makes another unpopular change to Twitter and META's Mark Zuckerberg is swooping in to compete with Twitter. He's offering a new alternative with an app called Threads. I want to discuss this more with Sara Fischer, CNN Media Analyst and senior media reporter for Axios. All right. First of all, how will Threads work?",

      "sentences": "Well, likely similar to Twitter. If you take look at the screenshots that have come up in the app store, it looks like a forum where people can post their comments and you can reply to them, re-post them, like them. It's very, very similar. It's mostly text based, which is new for Meta. They are really focused, especially right now, on video and pictures.And so, I think it's going to work relatively similar to Twitter. The key difference here, Sara, is that you're going to be able to log in through your Instagram account. Now, that makes a huge difference because it means that Meta can pull from over a billion Instagram users worldwide to start to seed a user base. There have been dozens of companies that have tried to take on Twitter, especially now that it's going through a lot of struggles, but none of them have been able to really build up a huge base. Meta could be the first to do it because of their Instagram reach.",

      "sentences": "Yes, and it's not really working is the problem, right? So, Instagram, Twitter, all these companies are ad-based social media platforms. That means they require a lot of impressions to be served, meaning you have to consume a ton of content to put those ads around it. But as you know, Sara, rants have been uncomfortable with Twitter under Elon Musk's ownership. Those are \"New York Times\" report that suggested ad revenue was down 59 percent in April this year compared to last before Elon Musk took over.And so, what he's trying to do is scramble to make more money by charging people subscriptions, $8 a month if you want to be verified on Twitter, which means you can consume more tweets and you can send a lot more private DMs. But the data that I've see suggests that hasn't been super successful. You know, if you look at other platforms, Snapchat for instance, says that in it's first year, they had 4 million subscribers since that Snapchat+. I think the latest numbers that the third party put out was that Twitter has, you know, in the hundreds of thousands of subscribers, it's not going to be enough to offset that massive advertising loss.",

But to give you some context, both of them do Brazilian jujitsu, so both of them have a little bit of experience fighting and training. And Elon Musk, sort of, proposed it. Zuck has accepted it. And if does go through, sure, this is going to be super viral for both platforms. I just think it's weird business move.

The Palestinians say, the operation left at least 12 people dead and more than 100 others injured. UNICEF is reporting that at least three children have been killed in this round of violence. Today, some families and survivors will get their first look inside the site of the Parkland school massacre. Officials say that tours will be given of Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School, the families of victims requested to see where their loved ones spent their final moments. 17 people were killed and 17 others injured when a gunman opened fire in 2018. The building's been inaccessible and protected as a crime scene since the killings and as the trials were going on. The tours begin just after a jury acquitted the school resource officer of charges related to not running to help the students during the attack. And a wildfire in Southwestern Washington State has forced hundreds of people to evacuate. Firefighters have been battling the Tunnel 5 fire since Sunday when it broke out about an hour away from Portland. So far, more than 500 acres have burned. Officials say, record heat and windy conditions have made it quite hard for firefighters to contain the blaze. The cause of it still under investigation. John.",

Eight thrill seekers got a little more terror than they probably bargained when this fireball (ph) roller coaster broke down near the top of the loop at the Forest County Fair in Crandon, it's about 100 miles northwest of Green Bay, Wisconsin. A cellphone footage captured the terrifying moments as riders were left hanging upside down for hours.The local fire chief said that there was some sort of a mechanical failure even though that ride had been recently inspected. Now, because the ride was so high up, especial equipment and rescue teams from three districts were called in to help. It just so happened that an off-duty firefighter with specialized rope rescue training happen to be on the scene. He helped advise the Crandon Fire Department and possible rescue options. Eventually, this ladder truck with the 100-foot platform arrived and was able to reach the passengers. The fire chief said that emergency services were called to the location at around 1:35 p.m. local time. Now, the first ride goer got back to solid ground at 3:20 p.m., and the last person reached the ground at around 5:01 p.m., more than three hours after the ride stalled. 10 vehicles, nine ambulances, 50 people from three counties helped the rescue. Authorities say, nine people were treated on site by medics and one was taken to the hospital. John.",
