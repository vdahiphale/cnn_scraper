And we've seen that start to play out in a lot of different ways. He, of course, has offered this variety of personal insults. They posted a video online yesterday that I don't even want to show because it contains very graphic insinuations about Kamala Harris' sex life. It just gives you a preview of where this may be going from Donald Trump. Is your sense of this that it's going to get worse or that Donald Trump could actually listen to any of these people who are telling him hey, like, let's do this differently? JACKIE KUCINICH, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, THE BOSTON GLOBE:  I think -- I think a) I think it does get worse because he doesn't -- while there is incentive to not behave like this, I mean, I -- Shermichael is right. Every Republican you talk to really wants him to talk about the economy -- to focus on that. He just hasn't shown the ability or the will to do that. How detrimental that will be or if it'll be detrimental to his base, they don't care. But to Independents who are watching this who are exhausted by it, this could -- this could be problematic.

Part of what he is upset about is the fact that she does not respond to these kind of wildly inappropriate sexism and misogynistic points. She knows that they are going to come. She knows that he's going to be distracted. And, in fact, it's -- part of the argument here is just let him cook. Let him talk. He puts his foot in his mouth. It pisses off other Republicans. It pisses off Independents. And the way that we do this -- the way that we handle this is that we see what happened last time. We see what happened with Hillary Clinton and how she approached it. And, in fact, we're going to take a slightly different approach. We're going to take an approach that says we don't actually have to address this even as we acknowledge that being a woman -- being a Black woman, being an Indian woman is highly different and also is going to come with these kinds of attacks. And I think, actually, what we're seeing now, particularly in the bounce that came in the immediate aftermath of the announcement that she would be running for the Democratic nomination -- that she had essentially received it -- and after what's going to come after this convention is that voters, including swing voters and Independent voters, really do like this approach that she is taking.
