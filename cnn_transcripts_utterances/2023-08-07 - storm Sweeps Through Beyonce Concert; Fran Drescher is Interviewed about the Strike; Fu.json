And our friend and CNN anchor Abby Phillip was there at the show and joins us now on the phone.This is really dangerous. People were treated for heat exhaustion. Super crowded, Abby. We're looking at these photos. What was it like to actually be there? ABBY PHILLIP, CNN ANCHOR (via telephone): Yes. Hey, guys, good morning. It was very uncomfortable. I mean it was pouring rain for a while and there was lightning in the air, so they didn't want to let anyone in. And, obviously, the concert wasn't going to start. But it was really chaotic. And I think that was kind of the experience that I and so many other people had. The chaos and the crowds and the rain and the heat. You know, someone not far from me fainted and, you know, paramedics rushed over. There was a little girl in front of me and the crowd was -- everyone was so frustrated after all these hours of waiting and the confusion, the crowd was just kind of pushing forward. And a little girl was in front of me and I think we were all just trying to kind of create like a zone around her so that people didn't really push her to the ground. So, I mean, it was one of those moments where it was a great concert, but that experience was a little bit scary. I mean, the weather just causing not only delays, but a lot of confusion at the venue, which was frustrating for me personally. And I'm here talking to you guys, but -- because I - I just think it's - it's so important for these concerts to be as safe as possible for all of the people who -- and the fans who want to come out and do it safely.",

It's, to me, like a rain plan should be kind of standard for these venues in terms of understanding what they want people to do. And that was not the experience that I and a lot of other people that I talked to who were there last night had at that venue. And, again, I mean, it's a safety thing.

The meeting, sought by the studios, was seen as a first potential sign of a thaw between the two sides. And there are no talks planned yet with SAG-AFTRA, which represents 160,000 actors. They went on strike last month. The actor's union has historically been more willing to negotiate, but according to this \"New York Times\" reporting, studios have been reconsidering their strategy. The primary reason, Fran Drescher. \"The Times\" reports, quote, \"when Fran Drescher took a hard line as its leader, executives shifted their focus to the other striking guild.\" Drescher, former star of the 1990s sitcom \"The Nanny,\" and, by the way, creator and executive producer, has sharply criticized studio executives, calling them \"greed-driven\" and \"disrespectful people.\" That's a quote. While we may think of Hollywood actors as high-paid celebrities, some of them are. But the reality is, many of them are not. The average salary -- this is the average -- $65,000, according to one analysis of labor data. On Thursday, Drescher visited picketers right here in New York, urged them to keep up their morale.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FRAN DRESCHER, PRESIDENT, SAG-AFTRA: In it to win it!

And they want us to accept a deal that in real money is less than what we made in 2020, and take us through 2026? I'm sorry, but that's unacceptable.And they have presented us with a business model that essentially squeezes us out of our residuals. Now, I don't know whether they thought, oh, goody, this business model is going to save us a lot of money on residuals, or they didn't think of us at all.

And I will say, that's really what struck me as a 46- year-old mom of four kids, I want my kids to be confident, I want my kids to be happy, and I want them to be willing to celebrate their successes. And Simone Biles did just that. And that was something that, as you had mentioned, me being a part of the 1996 gold medal winning team, we couldn't do that. We were -- our joy was stolen from us from our coaches. And so I loved the fact that she's such a role model and showing how proud she is of her achievements.",

And she didn't quit, though, because while she spent some time during the last Olympic games on the sideline cheering on her teammates, (INAUDIBLE) the message that many people and adults can take away from Simone Biles is, then you can get back into the game. You don't just step away and (INAUDIBLE) the sideline, you can still step up and have you're a-game performance.And I am amazed at what she's doing at 26 years old. I was 23 years old at my third Olympic games. And she's going to be, what, maybe 27 at the Paris Olympic games. She's not going to have trouble getting there and possibly even winning it all.

And I bet you it's going to be a bit of a redemption opportunity for her because in 2021, in Tokyo, she didn't want to step away but she did because of mental health reasons. This is her time to come back and shine and prove to everyone that she's capable of doing it all.And, honestly, I don't want to put it out there, but do you even see a fourth Olympic games for this young lady, 2028 in L.A.?
