New intelligence in the Kazakhstan plane crash investigation, how Russia may be involved. And a look inside Russia's drone factory, making cheaper versions of Iranian drones to fuel its offensive in Ukraine.Israel's military says it intercepted a missile launched from Yemen early Friday before it entered Israeli territory. The interception comes just hours after Yemen's Houthi rebels vowed retaliation for a strike string of deadly Israeli airstrikes on the country on Thursday. The Houthis say the attacks on Yemen's main airport, a power station and two ports killed at least six people and wounded at least 40. The head of the World Health Organization says he and a UN Team were about to board a plane at the Sana'a airport when it came under Israeli bombardment. One of the plane's crew members was injured. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STEPHANIE TREMBLAY, U.N. SECRETARY-GENERAL SPOKESPERSON: The secretary general condemns the escalation between Yemen and Israel. Israeli airstrikes today on Sana'a International Airport. The Red Sea ports and power stations in Yemen are especially alarming. The airstrikes reportedly resulted in numerous casualties.

On Thursday, Israel responded, launching its first-ever attack on Yemen's main airport and hitting two power stations. The strikes, the Israeli military said, targeted infrastructure the Houthis have been using to bring Iranian weapons into Yemen. Among those hurt, a crew member for a plane for the World Health Organization, whose director general says he was just meters away from the impact.This was the fourth time Israeli planes have attacked the Houthis, who say they're firing on Israel and international shipping in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. On Wednesday night in the war-battered enclave, five men, all of them journalists, according to hospital officials and AlQuds Today TV were killed while sleeping in their van. The channel, affiliated with Palestine Islamic Jihad, which the U.S. and others proscribe as a terrorist organization, says the men were carrying out their journalistic and humanitarian duty. Israel says they were Islamic Jihad militants posing as journalists. For evidence, it provided what it said was a list of operatives it picked up during operations in Gaza, edited to translate names and details on which four of the men's names appear along with their roles. And as the war in Gaza rumbles on, ceasefire talks aimed at securing the release of the hundred or so hostages still being held captive appear to have hit another snag. On Christmas Day, Hamas accused Israel of moving the goalposts in negotiations and said this was why a deal had yet to be done. For its part, Israel said Hamas was lying and reneging on understandings that had already been reached. Whatever the case, despite renewed optimism that a deal could soon be done, the reality is the two sides appear no closer to reaching an agreement that could end the year-long war and bring all the hostages home.

The aircraft was traveling from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku to the Russian republic of Chechnya when it attempted an emergency landing in Kazakhstan. The crash occurred shortly after Ukraine fired drones nearby at southern Russia, possibly leading Russia's defense systems to inadvertently strike the aircraft, the official said.Video from onboard the flight shows panicked passengers praying and holes visible in the body of the aircraft. The source of the apparent damage has not been confirmed. The airline and Russia's Federal Air Transport Agency initially told local media the aircraft crashed after it collided with a flock of birds, an account disputed by Ukrainian counter disinformation official Andrey Kovalenko. Russian state media also reported that the plane had been rerouted due to heavy fog around Chechnya's capital. Several investigations have been opened, including one by a joint commission involving representatives from Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and Russia.

So there has been a similar situation to what the U.S. May be seeing when it comes to this Azerbaijan Airlines flight. Now it's worth looking at the environment there. Ukraine had just carried out a drone strike in southern Russia and according to Defense experts, Russia's air defenses were active in that region at around the time of this Azerbaijan Airlines flight.In fact, the U.S. Official with whom I spoke said that because of the poor training for Russia's air defense units and for its military, it may be that led to the confusion in which Russian air defense units may have fired on a commercial airliner.

Michael, always good to see you. And we've just heard Clare's report really shedding light on the fact that you've seen drone production increasing rapidly. I mean, it's such an incredible story and to see how the factory itself is expanding. We've seen a barrage of these attacks, sometimes they last hours in Ukraine. What kind of advantage is it giving Russia?MICHAEL BOCIURKIW, FMR. SPOKESPERSON, ORGANIZATION FOR SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE: Good to be with you. Well, quite a big advantage. I mean, President Putin has said he'd like to multiply drone production by 10 times, according to CN reporting, to 1.4 million drones or so this year. And what Clare's report there hints at is that Western sanctions are almost becoming a joke because not only are they using Chinese components. But according to Financial Times report today, there's also Western metal working machinery being employed to make this equipment. So what we thought would have stopped Russia from producing weaponry with Western components isn't happening. Now, having said all that, Ukraine is not taking this sitting down in any way. Their drone production is headed to the hundreds of thousands. And this ranges from small kitchen tabletop productions to factory based monotonic tweaks, jet engines, and can strike with force deep into Russia. One more thing, though, it has to say, Clare mentioned thermobaric warheads on some of the drones. Those are very devastating. We've seen firsthand in Ukraine what they can do.",

But the range of Ukrainian defenses are quite impressive. You have teams of volunteers literally standing on rooftops, shooting with rifles at some of them. And then you have the high-tech stuff.

To give you an idea they can cover -- they cover the distance from Russia to Dipro, about 800 kilometers, 15 minutes. That's equivalent to the driving distance from Washington D.C. to Toronto.
