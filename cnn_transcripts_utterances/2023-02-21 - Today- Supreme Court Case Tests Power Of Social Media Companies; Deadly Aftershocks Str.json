SCHNEIDER (voice-over):  The Gonzalez family's long legal fight started when their 23-year-old daughter Nohemi was killed in Paris in 2015.

Congress passed the law in 1996 to shield internet platforms from being sued for harmful content posted by third parties on their sites. Google argues its algorithms recommending content are what make it possible to find the needles in humanity's largest haystack, warning that if Section 230 does not apply to how websites sort content the internet would devolve into a disorganized mess and a litigation minefield. There is no evidence the Paris attackers were specifically radicalized on YouTube but Nohemi's parents still allege YouTube aided and abetted ISIS and should not be able to hide behind Section 230. JOSE HERNANDEZ, SUING GOOGLE, DAUGHTER KILLED IN 2015 ISIS ATTACK: They should stop it. They have the power to do it. SCHNEIDER (voice-over):  This will be the first time the Supreme Court has considered the scope of Section 230 and the extent to which it protects social media companies. The push to reform Section 230 is widespread. Last month, President Biden penned an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal calling for modifications. And Republicans have repeatedly blasted big tech for what they call alleged censorship of conservative ideas. The Gonzalez family, though, just wants justice for the death of their daughter at the hands of ISIS-linked terrorists.",

So when you have that powerful 6.3-magnitude aftershock a lot of buildings collapsed.And as you mentioned, at least six people have been confirmed killed. Hundreds were injured, some of them in critical condition. And then the search and rescue operations that had really shifted into search and recovery -- last night we saw the search and rescue operations resume. We were at the site of one of those buildings where you had these exhausted rescue and medical crews working for hours and hours to try and save three people who had been trapped underneath the rubble of that building. Unfortunately, they did not make it out alive. And, Sara, you can imagine the hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people across this earthquake zone who have lost their loved ones, lost their homes, lost everything in seconds -- made homeless by that 7.8 earthquake a couple of weeks ago. They were just starting to try and comprehend what they had gone through, trying to deal with the trauma of that earthquake and the loss that came with it.
