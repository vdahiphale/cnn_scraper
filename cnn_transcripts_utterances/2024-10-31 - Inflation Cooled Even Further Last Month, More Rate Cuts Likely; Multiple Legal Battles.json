I forgot what the exact saying is, but it's something like success has a million moms, or something like that, where everyone wants to take credit for success. Which - what would you say is most responsible for allowing the economy to achieve a soft landing? Is it Biden-era policies? Is it just that the American economy is just somehow exceptional? Is it Trump-era policies? What would you attribute it to?",

      "sentences": "I'm sure economists will be fighting over this for many years to come. I would say I think there are a few things that are probably contributing to the -- the better-than-expected outcome.You know, the fact that we haven't so far had a recession. Looks like we're going to have a soft landing and all of that, all that good stuff, assuming it materializes. I think it's partly the Federal Reserve, which has been better than a lot of people give it credit for in cooling inflation, arranging interest rates just enough to get demand a little bit cooler, to get price growth a little bit slower without out-right killing the U.S. economy. I think actually the increase in immigration, while it has been very divisive in this election cycle, has probably been quite helpful in terms of keeping the economy growing. You know, a lot of those immigrants are coming here are disproportionately, many of them, are working age and want to work. So they're filling a lot of those jobs of that work experience and those shortages. That's probably also helping supply chains. So there are a number of things happening here. And the fact that, like, we have been very insulated from a lot of the other shocks that have affected the rest of the world. So part of the reason why Greg Ef (ph), at \"The Journal\" and others have been calling attention to the great economic success that we've had in the United States is that, in contrast to these other countries, we're doing quite well. But remember, countries in Europe have been much more exposed to Russia's war in Ukraine and the fallout in energy markets from that. So to some extent, it's about being able to dodge some of the - the economic stresses that countries are experiencing. And to some extent, it's the luck, to some extent.",

      "sentences": "Yes, if you're a lawyer, this action, it's something you're watching very closely, with the state and federal cases.You mentioned a few of them so let's go through them. First of all, a lawsuit filed by Democrats. Remember, Republican- affiliated groups have filed and been involved with over 130 challenges in the elections. But here, Democrats are suing over deliver issues that can impact around 20,000 voters who may not receive their mail-in ballots. And they're asking the court to make sure that these folks actually get to vote. But there have also been some allegation by the former president and others of fraud around voter registration in Pennsylvania. And it's important to get to the facts here. Now, in Lancaster Counter, they have confirmed that they are investing incidents of suspected voter fraud, registration fraud, now by the law enforcement officials and a partisan election board. They say this is part of a large-scale canvassing effort where they received some registrations that have somewhat handwriting and unverifiable addresses they're investigating. They haven't reported any fraud. Now York County also doing an investigation that they will confirm is the same issue they're seeking in Lancaster. But you see Trump and his allies getting out ahead of the investigation. The state's governor suggested that this is all part of an effort to sow seeds of doubt in the court of public opinion about the outcome in Pennsylvania. But the biggest thing that I'm looking for right now is it possible decision from the Supreme Court out of Pennsylvania related to mail-in ballots. Their election is complicated in Pennsylvania, with envelopes, and there's been a lot of litigation about that that happens if you send in your mail-in ballot without that secrecy envelope. They're called necked ballots if they don't have that. And the RNC has sued to block people whose ballots are discounted because they didn't stuff them properly, form being able to file provisional ballots. And this something that is now gone all the way up to the Supreme Court. It is one of the most significant cases that my Republican sources have been watching for month because of the potential impact it could have on the race in Pennsylvania. SANCHEZ: That's just one case that's been at the Supreme Court. Is that where this is all headed?",

That's why you've seen so much litigation in and around the election already.Because my sources on the Trump side, the legal team for the former president, say that one of the lessons they learned in 2020 is you have to start litigating these issues before the election. One, they say, is to resolve the issues for voters ahead of Election Day. You are also sort of planting the seeds and building your network of lawyers and your expertise in case there is an issue that you think you can push all the way to the Supreme Court. So that's why we've seen not lawsuits in battleground states but also suits in states like Missouri that have a suit that could get up to the Supreme Court. So given how close this is, it would not supreme me if ultimately some of these questions go to the Supreme Court. Will that decide the election? It's unclear. But I think you can definitely expect continued litigation.",

What we know is that this decline is associated with how, over time, we have stricter guidance around the use of embryo transfers and how many embryos should be transferred during fertility treatments like IVF. And that's why we're seeing play out here.Because with the more the embryos are transferred, that raises the risk of having a pregnancy with multiples, twins, triplets, quadruplets. But if we limit the number of embryo transfers, which is what the guidance recommended, that reduces the risk of having a pregnancy with multiples. And that's what we're seeing play out here in the date. Because if you look at the numbers, from 1998 to last year, the birth rate for triplets and high-order births declined 62 percent. I mean, that's a huge drop. But most of that decline happened since the introduction of guidance in the early 2000s, Boris and Brianna. And the reason why that was introduced was to reduce the risks of complications that we know are associated with having twins, triplets and quadruplets. That's what we're seeing play out here.",
