So much closer to home than Russia could possibly have wanted.You referred to a Russian fighter intercepting what it says was the U.S. drone, Reaper M9QA -- sorry, MQ-9A. Now, they said they did that in strict accordance with international law. Well, that comes simply off matter of hours after Ukrainian drones, one that a waterborne have targeted two key vessels just this morning. A Russian oil cargo ship called, SIG, which was it appears struck by Ukrainian drone in the Black Sea, for quite some distance off the coast. But also too yesterday, Novorossiysk, the key naval ports, an amphibious assault vehicle hit by another Ukrainian drone. And also too, suggestions that an oil depo was indeed hit on the eastern side of the Crimean Peninsula. This part of a building number, Fred, of incidents occurring in the Black Sea and area frankly, which Russia must have felt was entirely impregnable, just a matter of weeks ago, and is now subject to a warning from a Ukrainian maritime agency, calling much of that area, Sochi, a popular city on the sea -- the Black Sea, that's Russian holiday resort, and parts all the way up to its north, suggesting all of those are \"at risk of war, a war risk area,\" to quote precisely. So, a dramatic change here. I thinking what were is where Ukraine is projecting its power, it may be a bid to show some element more of military success, given how slow the southern counter offensive appears to be being at the moment. Understandably, slow, frankly, but it certainly must make those in the Kremlin utterly perplexed, as to how this war could be getting quite so close to home, particularly, on the side of the Black Sea, where they must have withdrawn part of the naval forces, realizing they were at risk in Crimea, a startling turn of events.

The Trump team now has until Monday at 5:00 p.m. Eastern to respond to a request for a protective order by Special Counsel Jack Smith. Smith submitted a filing last night and cited this social media post from Trump that reads, \"If you go after me, I'm coming after you.\" Trump's campaign defended the post as the definition of political speech, and said it had nothing to do with the case. But Smith said it showed Trump's habit of speaking publicly on his prosecutions. And he asked the judge to ban Trump's lawyers from giving Trump copies of evidence deemed sensitive. Smith is also asking the judge to bar Trump from taking down any personal identifying information from the documents. CNN's Alayna Treene, joining us now from Columbia, South Carolina, where the former president will be attending a campaign event later on.

But it does lend a lot of understanding to what we believe is probably a bigger pattern. 1996 is when Ms. Vergata went missing. And part of her body was found on Fire Island. The skull was found on Gilgo Beach, where very close to where the other bodies were eventually found.1996 is the year that Rex Heuermann, age 33, got married to a woman who came to the relationship with another child, and she became pregnant very quickly, had another baby. All of this simply means he probably had a lot of stressors going on in 1996. The next body wouldn't surface for another three or four years, and eventually the killings would become compressed.

Casey this week, a woman from Seattle escaped from a makeshift cinder block dungeon, and it was at a home in Oregon. And now a 29-year-old man is in federal custody on suspicion of interstate kidnapping. Investigators fear that there may be more victims in other states. I mean, do you think they would expect these potential victims to have survived similar encounters?",

And he had just moved into this rental house, and the first thing he did was build this cell in his garage. This really does indicate a thought process, a very active sexual fantasy that's been going on for a long time. This is not a crime of impulse. So much thought went into this. Driving seven hours all the way to Seattle to find his victim, having a fake police badge, you know, and a stun gun, handcuffs, leg shackles, telling her he was an undercover cop. She's under arrest. She has to come with him.He has put a lot of thought into this, and that doesn't happen overnight, Fred. That is something that's come about probably from a lot of trial and error in the past. This is why the police are reaching out, hoping that anyone out there who's had an encounter with this man in the past and lived to tell, but perhaps because of their vulnerable lifestyle, did not want to go to the police because they're involved in sex work. They're telling them, don't worry about your reputation. Just come to us. Tell us what's happened in the past. Did he abuse you? Did he rape you? Did you escape? You know, did you survive this man? And then I think we're going to see a pattern fall into place. I don't think this was the first time he's done something like this.",
