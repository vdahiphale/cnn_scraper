The nation's capital now on the brink of the second Trump presidency, a new era of uncertainty and dramatically changing priorities at the highest levels of power. This is CNN's coverage of Election Night in America Continued. I'm Anderson Cooper. Tonight, Donald Trump's transition team is beginning to set up shop for the President-elect's return to the White House four years after he left in defeat and in the view of his opponents in disgrace. The political landscape historically changed overnight by Mr. Trump's overwhelming electoral victory that expanded the number of red states and broke through the Democrats' blue wall. Mr. Trump is celebrating his success, as Vice President. Kamala Harris has now officially conceded the election after their deeply divisive and unpredictable campaign. Kaitlan Collins is anchored in West Palm Beach, Florida for us tonight. So, let's talk about the transition process. What are you hearing, Kaitlan?",

I'm told that they're going to try to change that this time around. And right now, they have already drafted executive orders and certain policies that they want to implement on day one, as well as reversals of regulations that have been put in place by the Biden administration.We kind of saw that happening to a degree. When Biden first took office, he was reversing a lot of the work that Donald Trump did by executive order. Expect to see that on day one of a second Trump term. And of course, the question is, who is doing that for him, Anderson? And when it comes to staffing, as you just referenced, yes, there are already thousands of people lined up for potential jobs. The question is, who Trump picks for those positions? And right now, just to give you a sense of how much the jockeying is already underway, Palm Beach is teaming tonight with potential Trump staffers who are here, who -- a lot of them were here last night at his election night party, either at Mar-a-Lago or at the Convention Center, and changed or delayed their travel plans after last night's victory, and decided to stick around, because that's how quickly they believe he can make these decisions. And Kristen Holmes is here with me. I'm hearing that Trump could be making some of these decisions within days. We could see some of these high-level positions that obviously will have a big influence on what his term looks like, and just the process and the way that they're approaching this with.",

The other thing that he had wanted to do for quite some time is yield enormous amount of executive power, and in doing that, that would mean taking the Justice Department, which is under the executive branch, but technically has operated historically as an independent entity, and moving it underneath the executive so that he would have so much more power. That means that one of the most critical jobs in this administration will be attorney general, because that person will work hand in hand with Donald Trump. But, some of the names that we're hearing floated for attorney general are Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, for example, Senator Mike Lee is on there, Mark Paoletta, Matt Whitaker, a former Trump attorney. These are people whose names are being floated right now. The other part of why this is so critical, that person is likely going to be responsible for getting rid of or getting -- releasing those cases against him, particularly that January 6 case that they want to get rid of.",

He was saying that's how they're viewing that role in terms of the importance they're talking about. He viewed it as a more important and prominent position than his own.

It was a direct appeal to male voters, and it paid off. Trump gets 55 percent of male voters in this election to Harris' 42 percent. The gender gap, when you talk about it, hit that 13-point advantage, swamped the eight-point advantage Harris had with women. So, the gender gap played to Trump's advantage. Look among young voters, 18 young male voters, 18 to 29-year-old men, Trump wins them here by two points in this election, 49 percent to 47 percent. Biden won them by double digits just four years ago. Trump flipped it around now, winning young male voters.Take a look here at the Latino vote among men. Male Latino voters, Trump gets 55 percent of that vote. Harris, 43 percent. That 12-point Trump advantage, four years ago, Jake, this category was a 23-point advantage for Biden. It's a 35-point swing with Latino men to Trump from Biden four years ago. And black men performed roughly where they were four years ago. Harris wins 77 percent of black men, Trump 21 percent, a slightly narrower margin than existed with black men between Trump and Biden four years ago, Jake.",

MACE: Right. Well, I'm not going to speak for President Trump on how he wants to do it. But, I will say this. Yes, we need workers in this country. But, our visa program is broken. We have these arbitrary caps on H-1B and H-2B visas. My district relies on seasonal workers from other countries, but we have these arbitrary caps that limit the number of workers we can bring in. And they're seasonal. They come here for three months, six months, nine months. They go home. They reapply again. That system is broken. We need to fix that system and allow more workers to get on the worker visa program and come here legally, work, reapply as needed, however that program works. With the deportation, I'm going to tell you, I mean, Trump not only won the Electoral College, he won the popular vote so far, as we can see, and it looks like most Americans are OK with the policy of deporting those who are here illegally. Get in line like everyone else who came here legally, do it the right way, and let's get it done. I mean, that's what the most people in this country want. Immigration was on the ballot.

This was a campaign for President that was about enemies he has threatened, that he wants to bring to heal and in the courtrooms what he calls the enemies from within, including the press, including members of the military who were his Chiefs of Staff, etcetera.

There is your non- college here, highest percentage of non-college educated voters in that swath right there. OK? Turn this off. Look at it. That's the Trump base, as David just laid out. It's like clockwork. If you find those voters on the map demographically, it's going to be Trump red. That's a huge source of turnout for him and the like. So, let's bring it back out. Let me turn this off. We'll bring this back out and show you this again. This is non-college educated. We'll come back out. And again, you talk about what David just talked about, the inroads, right? So, you get into some of the cities and it's not as pronounced, right? Let's come over here to Wayne County, Michigan. You bring this up. Come on up here for me and bring this up. Detroit, not quite as purple as what you saw -- just saw in those rural areas of Pennsylvania, but it is. You do have, again, a higher population, a significant population, non-college educated. Why am I showing you this? Because let's go -- let's take a look at this now. Donald Trump gets 33 percent of the vote in Wayne County. That's Detroit, Wayne, Michigan. The suburbs around it. Dearborn and Hamtramck are there. He gets up to 34 percent there. If you come back, I think it's a little bit higher. You say, Oh, that's not much. No, in a battleground state, that makes the difference. One other key point, David noted, if you come to the suburbs, this is where you see it. I was just showing you in Pennsylvania, the idea of the non-college educated voters. Well, let's just look at Pennsylvania, right? If you look at Pennsylvania as a state, one of the reasons it's a battleground state, the battleground states tend to hug the national average. About 43 percent of Americans have a college degree. About 57 percent have no college degree. They hug the national average. But, now you see some of the diversity within the state. Watch the graph as I go. I was just down here in those counties that Trump was winning. You see what happens? The percentage of college degrees go way down, right, in the area of the Trump base. So, let's bring this back out. That's statewide again, right? Watch the number. This is no college degree. That's college degree. Then you come in to the more affluent suburbs. Let's pick Montgomery County. You see the percentage of the college degrees dump -- jump out. Non- college degrees goes back. What happens? Biden won it big. Harris won it big. So, it is - -education is now the biggest dividing line in American politics, and you can look at the demographics, look at what the Census Bureau tells you who lives there, and then look and it'll be red or blue. It's -- Jake, it's almost automatic.",
