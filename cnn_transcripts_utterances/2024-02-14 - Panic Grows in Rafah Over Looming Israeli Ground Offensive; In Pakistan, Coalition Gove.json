I'm Rosemary Church.Just ahead, by a margin of just one vote, U.S. House Republicans succeed in impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. We will bring down -- we'll break down where things could go from here. A special election in New York nets a big win for Democrats, giving them one more seat in the U.S. House. What the vote could signal for the 2024 race for the White House? And in the wake of Donald Trump's NATO threats, European leaders prepare for the possibility they will have to go it alone.

Tuesday's vote is only the second time in U.S. history and the first in nearly 150 years that a member of the president's Cabinet has been impeached.

So, it was a very narrow margin here in the House. And three Republicans crossed party lines to vote against these articles of impeachment for Mayorkas. That includes Tom McClintock of California, Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, and Ken Buck of Colorado. Those are the same three Republicans who voted against impeaching Mayorkas last week. But we should note there was one key difference here tonight, and that was Steve Scalise, the House majority leader. He has been absent from the Capitol. He's been out battling cancer receiving treatments. But he was back tonight, and I got a chance to sit down with him for an exclusive interview ahead of the Mayorkas vote, where he talked about how important his vote was, and just how narrow the margins are in the House right now. But he disputed the idea that the House is rushing through this vote ahead of a special election in New York tonight, where a key seat is up for grabs. Now, in terms of the Mayorkas impeachment, it's going to head to the Senate. But we are being told, it's dead-on arrival in the Senate. With Senate Republicans and Democrats collectively saying that they just don't see the support and the appetite in the upper chamber to impeach Americans. Republicans have accused him of mishandling the situation at the southern border, and the flow of migrants that have crossed at the southern border. But some Republicans saying that, that is a policy dispute, and it does not rise to the level of impeachment. So, the Senate has some options. They can vote to just entirely dismiss the trial. Or they could have a trial and go through with the process. But either way, very clear that even though Alejandro was -- Mayorkas was impeached in the House. He is not going to be convicted in the Senate. Melanie Zanona, Capitol Hill, CNN.",

It was a victory in the suburbs. And it was a question of who is going to win the suburbs in 2024. That's an indication that Democrats can do well there, it was a good test.And one of the most interesting things, I think, is that the Democrat won, not because of the issues, but in spite of the issues. The issues seem to favor the Republicans. Immigration was the most important issue. The border is very important, and crime. The Democrat found a strategy for dealing with that, which is to confront those issues, just talk about them openly and not try to hide from them. And so, that may be a bellwether in that it indicates that the Democrats now may have developed a strategy for the '24 campaign, which is to go against Trump, to confront the issues not to run away from them, and also run against the do-nothing Congress. So, that could be very significant because the Democrats were looking for a message and a strategy. Maybe, it will come out of the New York race. And you mentioned immigration. House, Republicans impeached Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, Tuesday night; succeeding on their second try. It is an effort to punish the Biden administration for its immigration policy, but this will be killed off in the Senate.

And so, instead, they go for a kind of frivolous stunt, a show that has no real political impact. It's all symbol, very little substance.In the process, however, they are degrading and cheapening impeachment. The standard that we've always had is constitutionally, high crimes and misdemeanors. There are no high crimes or misdemeanors here, it was a policy disagreement. And so, by dumbing down what it means to impeach, they opened a door kind of a Pandora's box that in the future could come back to haunt them. And so, I'm not sure as much of a victory, you know, the long and winding road of impeachment went from Nixon to Mayorkas. It went from high crimes and misdemeanors to partisan bickering. And from there, I don't think the Republicans are no longer going to win. I think that's going to come back to haunt them.",

That is according to a U.S. official, who says the negotiations will press on.CIA director Bill Burns travel to Cairo for those talks. He discussed the situation in Gaza with Egypt's president, who also met with Qatar's prime minister. The talks come as international concern and opposition grows over Israel's expected ground offensive into the southern Gaza City of Rafah. The U.N. Secretary General warns such an operation would have devastating consequences. Meantime, Israeli officials say they have obtained CCTV footage showing Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, inside a tunnel below the southern Gaza City of Khan Younis with his wife, children and another unidentified man. The IDF claims the video is from October 10th, though CNN cannot verify the video shows Sinwar or when it was recorded. Journalist Elliott Gotkine is following all these developments for us.

The main sticking point, we understand from a U.S. official is Hamas' demands for the ratio for the number of Palestinian prisoners and the type of Palestinian prisoners that it wants released in exchange for freeing the more than 100 Israelis that it kidnapped as part of its terrorist attacks of October the 7th.Now, you recall we were talking about Hamas's demands last week, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decried as being as being delusional. These included demands for the release of all women, minors, elderly, and sick Palestinian prisoners. That part doesn't seem too controversial. The controversial bit, seems to be the additional 1,500 Palestinian prisoners, including a third of whom, who are serving life sentences, including for killing Israelis or taking part in attacks that led to the deaths of Israeli. So, that seems to be one of the main sticking points. But Prime Minister Netanyahu and his government under pressure not just from the Biden administration, which seems to have pushed Israel to take part in these talks in the first place, but also, of course, from the families, who still have loved ones who have now been more than four months in captivity in the Gaza Strip. The main group representing the families of those still being held hostage in Gaza, telling the government do not return until everyone comes home, the living and the dead, a reference to the bodies of dead Israelis that Hamas is still holding as well. For its part, according to some reports, including the Wall Street Journal, Israel, pressuring Hamas, with the threat of this potential ground invasion in Rafah, which seems to be implying that, that invasion could be predicated or could be paused or called off in the event of a successful hostage negotiation. Now, we can't confirm that. But certainly, there are a number of things going on right now. And it would also seem and we've heard this from Hamas already that if Israel does go in, in the ground operation, Hamas has said that, that would destroy hostage negotiations. So, there's a lot of things going on right now, which needs to be balanced, but certainly for now, no breakthrough just yet, Rosemary.",

In a Facebook post, the mother-in-law says that Moreno suffered from a form of schizophrenia that caused her to be violent. Investigators here have been saying that they also have an extensive history of mental health issues. But despite all of that, what frustrates the mother-in-law according to her Facebook post, is that she was legally able to obtain the weapons used in all of this. Investigators also say that they had found anti-Semitic writings that belonged to Moreno, but the mother-in-law says that she believes who -- the mother-in-law is Jewish, but she does not believe that that hate aspect of this is what is central and what caused this horror at the Lakewood church in Houston.
