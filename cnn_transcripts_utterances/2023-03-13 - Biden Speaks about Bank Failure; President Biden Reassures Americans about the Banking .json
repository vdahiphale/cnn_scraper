And, at the same time, when people started taking their deposits out because the tech sector had turned, then suddenly there was this mismatch for this bank.

Now, Lewandowski denied that reporting to CNN, but I spoke with more than a dozen of people within Trump's orbit who have noted that Cory has been distancing himself from Donald Trump since the 2020 election.
