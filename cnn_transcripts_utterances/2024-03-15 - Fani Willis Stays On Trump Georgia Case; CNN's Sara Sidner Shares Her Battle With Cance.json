So, the judge really tried to strike this very delicate balance, Ryan, just in terms of not removing her from the case, but not totally exonerating her either. This decision, even though she is going to be on the case still, the decision ultimately wasn't exactly kind to her. RYAN YOUNG, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  No, not at all. And when you read through this, you can understand the judge was pretty clear in terms of the improper nature of this relationship. Let's also not forget there's even talk of a gag order maybe being put in place at some point. From what we do know right now, there's no plans for a news conference from Fani Willis' office at this point. So, you might see that step back starting to happen. But let's not forget about this. You're talking about 14 defendants plus the former President of the United States, Donald Trump, and that famous mugshot where he was taken into custody at the Fulton County Jail. This case has been moving forward, but this has really been a big speed bump. Everyone wanted to know when this relationship actually started. According to the two, Fani Willis and Nathan Wade, their relationship started after he was hired and, of course, he was going through a divorce himself. But there are people who are bringing up questions about when this relationship may have got going. And you think about the fact that he was paid more than $600,000 as he was moving forward with his prosecution, and people were saying whether or not this was benefiting her because they went on trips together to California, to Aruba, to Miami, to places in Alabama. So, that's why there was so much talk about this cash, the fact that she would take cash and hand it to him after some of these trips. And that led to some fiery testimony in court. Take a listen to Fani Willis firing away when she was being asked questions about this relationship. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, the judge essentially here is splitting the baby, right, saying he didn't take Fani Willis off the case, but offered a very sharp rebuke against her actions, but said that if she were to stay on the case, that her former romantic partner and special prosecutor, Nathan Wade, has to step aside.

They never had corroboration that they needed, especially testimony at those evidentiary hearings, whether from Terrence Bradley or others, to prove their claims. What they had was salacious gossip. It looked good. It plays great in the press. It's going to play great in political fundraising. It's not sufficient from an evidentiary standpoint in a court of law to mandate disqualification. That is what the judge concluded. It was an absolutely correct decision. Nathan Wade almost certainly will be resigning probably by the end of today. And this case will go forward. In this case, you have to remember, it's got to be the most dangerous for Donald Trump because he has no control, even if reelected, over what happens in Georgia. He has no powers there. He can't even get a pardon from the local -- I'm sorry, from the state governor. He has no ability to stop that train.",

He says, look what they're doing to me. I'm wealthy. I'm powerful. I'm a former President. And yet they're doing this to me so they can certainly come after you. We need to fight. And it increases enthusiasm. It increases their contributions to his campaign. And it increases the likelihood that they will vote when it really matters in the fall. So, you'd better believe this is a plus for Donald Trump. And he will use this day by day, whether Fani Willis is in the courtroom or not, whether we ever see her again, it won't matter.

And then once she got that report, she had to decide to go to the actual grand jury who she would actually seek indictments against. She didn't necessarily use all the potential targets that were listed in that special grand jury report. She had to identify what was the most viable for going to trial. She had to be prepared evidence-wise in terms of discovery obligations. She had to be prepared for a whole bunch of pretrial fights that they've obviously had to deal with, whether it's ranging from immunity to any other number of issues that have been raised in these pretrial motions. It takes time to do that. This case has moved a bit slowly, but in terms of criminal cases, not that slowly. Some of them take years.

It is on them to agree to a deal. We now have a counter-proposal that was submitted to the mediators last night by Hamas to Israel. And Israel is essentially dismissing what they are now hearing from Hamas, calling the proposals ridiculous, saying that the demands are unrealistic. Now, at the same time, Israel is planning on sending a team of negotiators to Doha to continue those conversations. So, that is good news. Now, what we understand these new proposals from Hamas to be is, as you can see there, in the first phase that would be expected to last around six weeks. The hostages who are Israeli, who are women, elderly, the sick and the wounded, would be released by Hamas. And Hamas would expect a huge number of Palestinian prisoners to be released in return, some 700 to 1000. And then, as the ceasefire, the humanitarian pause, moves into a second phase, Hamas is saying they want all Palestinian prisoners to be released from Israeli prisons. And they, in turn, will release all of the remaining hostages. So, that would be primarily male IDF soldiers. And here is the major sticking point. Hamas wants to end this war. They are saying that in a later phase that they want to negotiate an end to the conflict and for the IDF to withdraw fully from Gaza. And that is not something that Israel has given any indication that they are willing to agree to.

On the first of three days of voting, a woman actually poured dye. She poured dye into a ballot box, which was in Moscow. She has been detained by police. Time now for The Exchange. Our next guest had to leave Russia after criticizing Vladimir Putin for invading Ukraine. Ekaterina Kotrikadze once ran the only independent television channel in Russia before it was shut down by Moscow two years ago. She now lives in Europe and she continues to broadcast online. Ekaterina, thank you so much for being with us. Now that the only real sort of, I guess, credible opposition figure in Russia is now dead, where does the opposition get its strength from now in Russia? I'm not just talking about the opposition figures that are on the ballot, who are token opposition figures, but the real opposition figures. Where do they get their strength from now? EKATERINA KOTRIKADZE, NEWS DIRECTOR AND HOST, T.V. RAIN:  The biggest part of the opposition is, of course, abroad. You cannot work and live in Russia these days. And Alexei Navalny's example says a lot about how Vladimir Putin behaves with his opponents. So, the situation is devastating. But what we know is that Alexei Navalny's last wish was to ask people to come to the election polls and to see each other at 12 o'clock, March 17th, mid- day. This is, you know, the big thing, a big rally, which is actually not something illegal in Russian Federation. Just go to vote, but you go exact time at 12 o'clock and you can see how many Russians do not support this. And this will happen tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, on Sunday, on 17th. And people will see each other. This is the only thing that we can do, actually, right now. And the opposition leaders can do. Yeah, and this is really an election showcasing the absence of choice and a coronation, for all intents and purposes, for Vladimir Putin. But once again, wanting to show that he was, quote unquote, elected and that the majority, the overwhelming majority of Russians support him. But what could hinder that is if he doesn't have control of the situation. And that is why you're referencing what could indeed happen on Sunday and what you're going to be focusing on. You wrote a really moving piece for CNN.com, and I want to read some of it. You said, \"My job in the new reality is to inform Russians about what is happening in Russia while being in Amsterdam. I can't go to the polling station. I can't talk to voters like you used to do. I can't ask questions of government officials. But it turned out that you can adapt to anything. We've learned how to get videos from all over Russia. We've learned how to invent relatively safe ways to interview people from Russia. And it became possible to talk about Russia from outside its borders. All of this news, from Alexei Navalny's death and murder to what we're seeing in Russia right now and the war in Ukraine, it's all very depressing. Yet you have a sense of optimism that still lives. And does that come from these conversations that you're having with people not outside of Russia but inside the country?",

It can lower your blood pressure, boost your immune system, reduce the release of the stress hormone cortisol in your brain. And speaking of your brain, there's been a ton of neuroscience that shows that meditation can rewire key parts of the brain that are associated with focus, with self-awareness, with self-compassion, and also with stress.

Having said that, meditation is doable even for people who think they have the wildest mind on the planet. And these are my people, the people who come to me and say, you don't understand. My mind is so busy. I'm so distractible. I could never do that. These are the people I want to talk to directly because really, this sentiment is based on a misunderstanding of what meditation is. Meditation is not about clearing your mind. As I like to say, clearing your mind is impossible unless you're enlightened or you have died. The whole goal of meditation is just to pick one thing to focus on. Usually it's the feeling of your breath coming in and going out. And then every time you get distracted, which will happen a million times, you just start again and again and again. And this noticing the distraction and starting again, this is like a bicep curl for your brain. And it's what shows up on the brain scans of people who meditate. And so, getting distracted is not proof that you're failing. It's proof that you're doing it correctly. Why? Because the whole goal of this practice is to get more familiar with the wildness of your mind so that it doesn't own you as much.",
