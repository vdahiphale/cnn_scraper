This video, captured by the Turkish crew aboard the cargo ship, shows crew members sitting and waiting on deck as a Russian military helicopter hovers closely over the vessel and soldiers with guns board the ship. CNN's Nic Robertson joins us now. So, Nic, what more can you tell us about this incident?",

      "sentences": "Yes, they're going to put these hypersonic Zircon missiles aboard nuclear-powered submarines.This will give them a greater stealth capacity because obviously that type of submarine can stay submerged for longer, and it will bring the potential for a hypersonic missile closer to land in unpredictable locations, which is an advantage for the Russians. Now, they do, of course, have other hypersonic missiles, the Kinzhal, which is fired from aircraft. But this particular missile that they want to put on board the subs is a Marine-launched missile. And the ability to shoot down a hypersonic missile is determined by how long you can see it coming, can you track it, and can you shoot it down. And the answer is it is possible. But if you shorten the flight distance, which is what the Russians essentially by doing this are talking about, it's much harder to intercept and therefore is an increased level of threat.",

CNN's Kara Scannell is covering this story for us. Kara, to be clear, there were two parts to Hunter Biden's plea deal, one dealing with the tax misdemeanors, and then this diversion agreement on a felony gun charge. Why do his attorneys think at least the gun portion of this still stands?",

      "sentences": "Well, Jim, so the gun diversion agreement was something that was struck between the prosecutors and Hunter Biden's lawyers.And normally, these diversion agreements are between two parties and they are binding and valid when they are signed. The issue in this case was that the judge had raised this exact question to the parties in court last month where she said they had inserted her into the process and, therefore, it was now before her. And she had some questions around that. She questioned, in fact, whether it was a constitutional deal. So Hunter Biden's lawyers now, after DOJ filed a court filing on Friday, saying that talks had broken down, they were at an impasse, and none of these deals are together, they're saying they actually do believe that this one is valid and binding. And the judge is giving prosecutors until noon tomorrow to make their position. It's really unclear where that's going to go from here since she already had some concerns and issues about it. You know, that said, Hunter Biden's legal team over the weekend has been saying, even with the elevation of David Weiss to special counsel, they seem to be optimistic that they will, at least on the tax charges, end up in the same place that they were a month ago, hopefully, in their minds with another plea deal. And one of Hunter Biden's attorneys, Abbe Lowell, was on CBS yesterday and he was asked if a trial is inevitable. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And then there was, of course, one other police officer that was part of the Ridgeland Police Department. Now we have their mug shots. Now they all walked into court and they pled guilty. Now, what they pled guilty to was basically they went to the home of two men and they tortured them over a two-hour period. They used tasers to see which one had the most powerful taser. They threw eggs at them. They called them the \"N\" word over and over again. They then even tried to sexually assault one of the men. But unfortunately, he became so sick and so terrified that they could not complete that sexual assault. The story had been going on for months. It happened back in January. These men have been trying to get the attention to so many in the law enforcement community. Once the Mississippi state investigators got involved, they started unveiling things to make sure that they saw that there was something wrong with this. In fact, take a listen to one of the victims who was in court today to watch these men plead guilty. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But we were hoping to hear from the sheriff himself in a news conference. We're not sure that's going to happen. CNN has asked him multiple times for interviews. Of course, we traveled to Mississippi to talk to these two men, and one of their mothers just about this pain they've been going through for months. Because as you can understand, this really came to light because, at one point one, of the deputies took a gun, placed it into the mouth of one of the men and pulled the trigger, lacerating his tongue and having the bullet come out his throat. That man will suffer with that for the rest of his life. So you understand there's an entire Mississippi community trying to figure out exactly what happens next.
