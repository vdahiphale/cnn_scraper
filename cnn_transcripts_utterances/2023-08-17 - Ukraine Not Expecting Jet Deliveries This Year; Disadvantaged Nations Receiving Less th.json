That is the word from Ukraine's air force, pushing back the timetable for any delivery of thefighter jets that Ukraine says it desperately needs to counter Russian missile and drone attacks. Now this announcement on Ukrainian television did note that progress is being made toward training pilots to fly those jets once and if they arrive. However, the course of the all-Russian aerial attacks have hit targets across Ukraine, often killing and injuring civilians. Let's get you to the ground. Nick Paton Walsh is in Dnipro in east central Ukraine. This is important, Nick, let's put this into perspective for our viewers. Training has been promised. There is no promise as of yet of physical jets from either the U.S. or its allies. But should they be delivered at some point, what would that mean for Ukraine?",

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean part of the Biden administration with a number of allies at the recentG7 was essentially the notion that they would be ending up supplying F-16s to Ukraine. And the issue was, of course, how fast the training around that could be implemented. These jets require repair and vast amounts of maintenance for just the amount they spend in the air and of course, require training in English. But for Ukrainian pilots to occur the issue has been the pace at which the European allies, who would contribute to the training and have the training happen on their territory, could put that plan together. This is always been the most complicated potential part of NATO's bid to arm Ukraine  because of the complexity of servicing high tech jets like this, because of the fact that they would essentially have to land in Ukraine and be serviced there in order to not have NATO a party to the conflict in such a way that the Biden administration and NATO allies have been very keen, they don't want to be dragged into. These are the challenges though. They were very apparent when these first promises were made. And clearly it has been a slower ground they would've liked it to have been. But they are urgently required by Ukraine. That we've seen ourselves on the front line, to find Russian air superiority a daily hazard -- hazard is probably a light word if you are facing a half- metric ton bomb being dropped on your position as you try and move forward. It is a reason why Ukraine's progress has been slower than NATO allies had hoped, the same NATO allies though, it is fair to say, that never even dreamed of attempting an operation like Ukraine is without air superiority. And so I think this is Ukraine being clear that the more optimistic timetables put forward by U.S. and Western officials for the delivery and training on F-16s aren't going to be made. We've seen this happen repeatedly throughout the open debate about arming, promises that don't necessarily turn into stuff on the ground. That hasn't necessarily been the case with the Leopard takes and some of the other important armored equipment that has arrived in time for this counteroffensive. Its effectiveness though, is still, I think is fair to say, being assessed by the Ukrainians, who we have heard talk on the front lines about actually how they prefer their Soviet models, because they're easier to repair and possibly more robust. But this is, Ukraine, I think trying to explain that these are the things you said we would have. These are what we need them for. And we have not got them yet. And potentially preparing Ukrainians here, look, put aside all of this geopolitical stuff and paperwork bouncing around. Ukrainians are hearing sirens, just in the last hours. We think that F-16s would potentially make their lives safer. And that is probably absolutely fair, Becky.",

It departed despite Russian threats to target Ukrainian shipping interests in the Black Sea. Fred Pleitgen is connecting us from Berlin this hour.

If we look at theship specifically that is now left the port of Odessa and as you said has made it to Turkiye, that ship is actually German co-owned. And I was looking at the company that co-owns that ship and what they say about how that ship got out. That ship was actually moored in the port of Odessa, since February 23rd of last year. So it's basically been stuck there for about 1.5 years. And now there are corridors in place, they decided they would try get that ship out now and they obviously have successfully done so. That seems as though that ship was also loaded with cargo as well. But of course, we have to point out that that is one ship. And what we have not seen yet is actually ships going into Odessa using that corridor, loading up and then coming back out. Now of course, we have to point out that that could still be a huge risk for any shipping company to do that. And certainly something that a lot of them would want to think about before committing their ships to move into a port like Odessa and get the grain out despite the fact that of course, it is something that would be so very important. On top of that we've already seen in the past couple of days that the Russians seem to have their own thoughts about all of this. They boarded a vessel that was actually heading to a Danube port earlier this week with a helicopter and putting their troops on board, searching that vessel.",

The global blockbuster, set to be the highest grossing film of the year bysome distance, opened in Saudi Arabia this week, to popular acclaim. A stark turnaround for a country where going to the cinema, full stop, was banned until 2017. But in neighboring Kuwait, moviegoers were left disappointed after \"Barbie\" there was banned to preserve, quote, \"public ethics and social traditions.\" It is an ironic twist for the Gulf country, which used to be a popular destination for Saudis intent on watching films in theaters. Here is more on the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (MUSIC PLAYING) ANDERSON (voice-over):  Scenes like these were unthinkable just a few years back, Saudi women packing cinemas to watch \"Barbie,\" an empowering movie, with feminist themes. But \"Barbie\" mania is alive in the kingdom, which only ended its decades- long ban on cinemas in 2017 as part of crown prince Mohammed bin Salman's plans to transform the country. JAMAL MOUSSA, EGYPTIAN CITIZEN (through translator):  I asked people coming out of the screening. They told me it is an excellent film. It is a romantic film (INAUDIBLE). It is a compelling story. So I thought to book for me and the children to watch it. And they were happy about it. An advancement we are witnessing every day. We can now see movies and a lot of things that we didn't see here before. (END VIDEO CLIP) (VIDEO CLIP, \"BARBIE\") ANDERSON (voice-over):  However, the film will not be delighting audiences in every nation across the region. Despite showing \"Barbie\" at cinemas for several weeks, Algeria took the decision to remove the blockbuster from screens for promoting homosexuality. Oil-rich Kuwait also banned \"Barbie\" to, quote, \"preserve public ethics and social traditions.\" Social media, awash with Kuwaitis joking about driving to Saudi Arabia to see the film and some even posting guides on the theaters closest to the border. The irony of the reversing of cultural norms not lost on Kuwaitis, who have been used to Saudis making that journey in the past. And in Lebanon, a country generally regarded as being more progressive toward the LGBTQ community, the culture minister moved in to banned the movie from theaters, saying it, quote, \"promotes homosexuality.\" JEAN CLAUDE BOULOS, LEBANESE FILMMAKER (through translator):  The movie is being shown in Saudi Arabia and in the Arab world, while we here are banning it. It started with all of us postponing it. But in the end, they chose to run the movie and we decided to ban it. This shows that we want to stay still. We don't want to develop. ANDERSON (voice-over):  While Saudi Arabia's socioeconomic deliberalization is moving at pace, there was still criticism of certain facets of that transformation. Former head of Human Rights Watch, Kenneth Roth, tweeting that while Saudi women find much to admire in Barbie, they still need guardians' permission to marry and there is yet no appetite for activism in the country. Despite the progress still to be made, that this film is being shown in Saudi Arabia, a nation traditional reinforced by the patriarchy, is a sign that bin Salman's vision is rapidly changing the country.

And the Trump aligned political action committee actually paid that bill for him. But he hasn't received any other additional help from the former president. And this is significant for many reasons. One, Trump certainly has an incentive; even his own advisers are telling him to pay Rudy Giuliani's legal bills, to keep him happy and keep him in the fold, to discourage him from cooperating in these many investigations. Also Rudy charged in the state of Georgia, (INAUDIBLE) Georgia's state attorney.
