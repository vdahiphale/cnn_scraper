Another case of where we have seen massive rocket and missile attacks in that southern region of Zaporizhzhya. We have been talking about it so much over the past week. But really over the past two weeks, if you will, that city of Zaporizhzhya is one of the main targets. You saw them use 10 S-300 missiles. And one thing about the missiles is they're usually used to shoot down aircraft. When you use them against ground targets, they're pretty inaccurate and that very much increases the chance of there being civilian casualties. Other thing we see in Zaporizhzhya as well, this is close to front lines where the Russians are as well, is the use of those kamikaze drones that attack in swarms and then essentially hit infrastructure and important key infrastructure, not just there in Zaporizhzhya but something we have seen in other places in Ukraine as well. But Zaporizhzhya, taking a beating once again as we have seen over the past couple of days.
