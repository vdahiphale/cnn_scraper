So, 150 search and rescuers went. This is a specialized team, an IDF team, they've been on more than 30 such missions around the world to try and rescue people out of rubble. They are -- this -- Israel also sent a team like this in 1999 to that devastating Turkish earthquake. And so, they are very well experienced. But they did say before they left that the conditions on the ground will likely make this very difficult. But they do believe that they will have the opportunity, they hope to be able to save some lives in these coming hours. Because as we've heard, these are the critical hours to still be able to pull people alive out of the rubble. Other Israeli aid groups are also sending planes, passenger planes up to Turkey. There -- they've told me that they're trying to get these arranged as quickly as possible, get people up there as quickly as possible. All in coordination with the Turkish authorities so that they know exactly where to go and where to get the most needed supplies. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announcing this aid to Turkey and also announcing that Israel will be sending aid to Syria as well. Take a listen.

I ordered to send at the request of the Turkish government rescue teams and medical aid. This is what we do around the world. And this is what we do in areas close to us.

Temperatures now in Aleppo currently at six degrees.So, we're near freezing just as you mentioned, Rosemary. But we're really going to struggle to warm in the upcoming days as the skies start to clear out. So, we notice satellite showing you quite a bit of moisture yet across the region. Once we clear out all of what's left that warp escapes back up into the atmosphere. And as the northerly winds set in, we get even colder with. So, we can expect to be below freezing here in the next two days. Scattered showers and snow showers finally starting to come to an end. You still see a few here and there over the next 24 hours. There's Wednesday into Thursday noticing that moisture really starting to push out and here comes the colder air. Below normal temperatures Tuesday morning, Wednesday morning, doing the same into Thursday morning. The darker blues indicating that especially across central Turkey where temperatures will stay below zero. And we're doing the same thing and Aleppo. Four below in the morning on Thursday. High temperatures, still staying below normal but at least above zero at eight degrees Wednesday, Thursday and Friday in Aleppo. We have that 7.8 magnitude epicenter on February 6 early in the morning. We've also noticed several aftershocks along the east Anatolian fault line, right there. The Arabian plate pushing north along the Anatolian plate. And what that's going to do is unfortunately continue on the aftershocks here in the upcoming days. Now, Rosemary, you mentioned that they'll start to weaken or not be as strong. Yes, that will be the case but unfortunately many are left homeless and with the aftershocks continuing on in the colder weather. It's just not a good situation overall.

Dropping the outriggers, checking the radar, steering us towards the U.S. military's operation to recover debris from the suspected Chinese spy balloon. The U.S. Air Force shut it down with a single missile on Saturday over the Atlantic Ocean roughly six miles off the coast of Myrtle Beach. The NORAD command are now saying the full payload was about the size of a regional jet and the attached balloon was some 200 feet tall. As day breaks, we began to see something on the horizon. The first glimpse of a multivessel mission which officials say includes Navy divers and ships coming from as far away as Virginia. A law enforcement source tells CNN the first pieces of sensitive spy balloon wreckage are already arriving at the FBI headquarters in Quantico for analysis. But recovery continues. CNN captured this exclusive video of additional Navy salvage teams arriving in North Myrtle Beach today and setting out on two more boats towards the search area.

The best guesswork that I've heard, Rosemary, is that as the United States has improved, digitized and better encrypted, the communications used in our nuclear forces, that's a subject of great interest to the Chinese.And something you can pick up from a device like this, floating 65,000 feet above the Earth's surface that you can't get from a satellite. From a satellite you can get imagery, of course, but not much telecommunications that are on the ground. We don't know for a fact that that's what they were looking for. What we do know is that China's got to be programmed to do this. You've seen another balloon that is flying over Latin America. We now know that there were three previous incursions and the head of the North American Air Defense Operations U.S. General said today that in fact, they did not pick these up in the previous cases in real time.

And that people are actually trying to recover their loved ones themselves, bringing in machines, construction machines to actually pull from the debris, and there is no professional help. And so, there's been this criticism of the rescue efforts. There's been a lot of weather conditions that have been preventing also the reach and whatnot.

Now, given the criticism of the government at the moment, the critics, the experts, the geologists are saying that over the years since Turkey has been experiencing these earthquakes, they've been urging and calling on this state to make sure that there are more places, more safety locations for people in case they're affected by earthquake, but these measures have not been in place.And this has been one of the biggest criticisms thus far, since the earthquake has hit those 10 provinces. Is that the government dismissed numerous reports by the experts, by the engineers who have been warning the state not to build or overbuild in areas to make sure that there are safety places, safety houses, safety locations, for the people who may get affected by the earthquake. And that also goes to the state of the buildings that have collapsed or there are in state of collapse. That also is one of other criticisms is that these buildings were not built according to the recommendations that were given by the engineers, recommending to use better equipment, better construction materials. So, there are levels of challenges that could have been addressed in time if the authorities would have taken into account all the recommendations, all the reports that were sent in order to prevent at least the scale of the damage.
