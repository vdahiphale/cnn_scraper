Speaker Mike Johnson, yesterday, making this announcement to his Republican colleagues that he does plan to move on separate bills at the end of this week to fund Ukraine, the Indo-Pacific, as well as Israel. And his argument for making these separate votes is simply that lawmakers deserve the opportunity to decide each one upon their own merits.Obviously, behind the scenes, Republicans are deeply divided over this question of additional aid for Ukraine. But on Israel, perhaps, they are much more united. Meanwhile, Democrats are more divided on that issue. So essentially, this is a gamble. He's going to put these bills up for individual votes. And then there's a question of what exactly happens in the United States Senate. The other huge question looming right now is what does this mean for Mike Johnson's ability to keep his job? He was defiant last night, saying that he does not make decisions in his leadership to hold onto the speaker's gavel, saying that he thought that this was the correct moment to have this discussion. That he has been moving toward this for some time and that he doesn't keep an eye on whether or not he is going to be able to keep his job. But, of course, looming in the not-so-distance is the fact that Marjorie Taylor Greene is arguing that she has not made a determination yet about whether or not she would try to oust Johnson if he moves on Ukraine. Here's what she said last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE (R-GA):  He's definitely not going to be speaker next Congress if we're lucky enough to have the majority.

And Live Nation and Ticketmaster got all the wrong headlines you'll remember back in 2022 after that presale ticketing debacle for the Taylor Swift Eras Tour.Joining us right now is CNN media analyst and senior media reporter at Axios, Sara Fischer.

I think the whole Taylor Swift debacle forced everybody in Washington to figure out whether or not one company consolidated too much power. And this becomes a problem, Kate, because then, 1) there's not room for competition. But then, 2) when something bad like this happens you have to wonder why did it happen? Were they not innovative enough? Were they not prepared enough? And if they had stronger competition maybe this could have been prevented. And so, this is a huge deal for the live music -- live ticketing industry. If they were to get sued, sources tell me, likely, they wouldn't get broken up.

Suddenly, you have trade groups representing consumers that are weighing in. You have campaigns targeting Washington on behalf of them.

But they need to understand that -- and I'm sure they do understand -- that they cannot count on that kind of success in the future and that Iran still has some cards it hasn't played, including the fact that Hezbollah in Lebanon, has an estimated 150,000 rockets. Iran did not fire those rockets on Saturday night. If it did, they would have a chance to inundate Israeli air defenses and those missiles would be fired right next door to Israel. They wouldn't have the kind of flight time and they would not have the kind of warning time they had with all of the missiles and drones that were fired from Iran on Saturday.
