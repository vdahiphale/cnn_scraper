The school was said to be housing displaced refugees.These Israeli military has confirmed it carried out the airstrike, but saying it was targeting a Hamas compound operating inside the school. And now, a CNN analysis shows that American-made munitions were used in that strike. CNN's Nada Bashir, she's tracking this one for us. Nada, what more are you learning?",

      "sentences": "Look as you mentioned, Kate, this was an area known to be sheltering thousands of displaced Palestinians. The U.N. agency for Palestine refugees says it believes approximately 6,000, at least Palestinians having been sheltering within the school building, thousands more sheltering on the actual grounds of the U.N. complex. That strike taking place overnight according to eyewitnesses, several strikes took place targeting this school.And we've been hearing from medical officials and health officials on the ground in Gaza saying that their hospitals are simply overrun, that that death toll of at least 45 people killed in the strike could certainly rises. They are continuing to receive casualties. And, of course, dozens more all said to have been injured. Now, of course, CNN has been carrying out analysis of video footage from the scene, appearing to show fragments of what was a U.S. made bomb, a GBU-39 small diameter bomb. This is the same bomb that we would have seen used in Rafah. This means this is the second time the two weeks that we have seen us made munitions being used by the Israeli military in areas of Gaza known to be sheltering thousands of displaced Palestinian civilians. [09:35:08] Of course, the Israeli military has said that it was targeting Hamas militants and Hamas infrastructure, but again, this was an area known to be sheltering civilians and in fact, this comes just a day after another deadly strike in central Gaza. We saw an area of Deir al-Balah coming under attack overnight while people were sleeping. Again, dozens killed in this particular strike. And of course, important to know that what we have seen over the last few days and weeks is civilians who have been sheltering in the south, particularly in the city of Rafah. Now, fleeing, returning back to central Gaza because of an intensification of Israel's military operation in the south. So we've been seeing civilians returning to central Gaza only for this region in particular, to come under heavy bombardment once again -- Kate.",

We have been repeatedly totals are the three top contenders at this point, but others have been getting inquiries as well and have been trading paperwork back-and-forth with the Trump campaign. And they include Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, Representative Elise Stefanik, Representative Byron Donalds, and former HUD Secretary Ben Carson. Now, this list is going to change probably over the next month. We are told that Donald Trump maybe even considering some dark horse candidates but at this point, these are the individuals who we know.

You spent a sizable chunk of your adult life as a prosecutor if I'm not mistaken. So what is it like for you to hear a Republican presidential candidate, the nominee basically running or not running away from the notion of getting elected to prosecute your political foes? ASA HUTCHINSON (R), FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR:  Well, it's something very unusual for me to hear as a former prosecutor. I served in the Justice Department and anybody who's been a part of the Justice Department family values the independence values, the fact that you go after wrongdoing and not based upon partisan politics. And so this is foreign to our system of justice. And you're seeing it played out in the courtroom. And what I think as time goes on, America will have more and more confidence in the jury result, both in New York but also as you see it happening in the Hunter Biden trial in California, we have confidence that 12 of our citizens are going to make a fair and just verdict and I hope that in the end, there's confidence, more confidence versus less confidence in our justice system.",

There's a new \"New York Times\" poll which shows that there was a slight shift and we have seen that in polls in the presidential race, two point or so shift toward President Biden overall since the verdict.I'm going to read you some of the analysis in \"The Times\". The shift was especially pronounced among young nonwhite and disengaged Democratic leaning voters who propelled Mr. Trump to a lead in the early polls, of the people who previously told us they had voted for Mr. Biden in 2020, but would vote for Mr. Trump in 2024, around one- quarter said that they would now stick instead head with Mr. Biden and it goes on.

They tried to do the right thing and it was not a 9-3 hung jury. It was 12-zip.And, so I think that it will build confidence over time, but it's also important how the jurors handling themselves. They're not going out and holding news conferences. They're really did it as a citizen. And I think that draws respect. There was one poll that said majority has confidence that the jury verdict, even though a plurality believes that the whole case was politically motivated, and that's the buffer that we have our jury system.

We worked together on the coronavirus pandemic issues while I was governor but it's not really about the outreach. It is simply about who's going to govern our country the best same whenever I ran for president, because I see Biden's failed policies and a number of area one of them being border security. He's trying to shore it up.But it's about policy. It's about the right direction for our country and the highly regulatory environment that he is creating. President Biden is creating is problematic for growth in our country. Obviously, I have challenges with Donald Trump now being a convicted felon, but also the character that I think is important. The White House, I don't see in him. So I represent many Americans. It's in a quandary.",

You need to have a VP match with Donald Trump that will expand his base, that will reach out and appeal to independents. I don't know that he's going to do that, but that I do believe the VP selection can make a difference to the Haley supporters and Republicans. And then secondly, it's a calmness. It's -- are we going to get what he's saying we're going to get, which is retribution or is he going to govern in a way that gives us the economy they we want and respect around the globe. And America leads again. And that remains to be seen. So I think a lot of people are waiting to see how this develops in the fall and in the debate which will be very important.",
