But just given this news -- given what CNN obtained here -- you held this position, right? If this were you while you were serving as Defense Secretary, what do you make of that -- asking -- his aide asking for the ambulance to be discreet when it came to his home given the broader context that not only did the American public not know for days that he was in the intensive care unit, the president didn't know? His own deputy didn't know.MARK ESPER, FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY UNDER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah. Well, first of all, I'm -- we're glad to hear that Sec. Austin is on the mend and he's back home continuing his recovery. Look, I think it's well-known that Sec. Austin is a very private and personal man. Clearly, his staff knew this as well, and whether or not he told them to do so this is how staff acts on your behalf, and they try and enhance that. They try and meet the needs and the expectations of the boss. And so that's something you have to be very careful of in these roles. And so, this is clearly what has compounded the troubles -- the initial not notifying of elective surgery and going into the hospital. Then it continuing with staff not being notivated -- notified, let alone the president not being notified. So this is kind of the culture if you will that has been built up around him that clearly, he recognized and took responsibility for and say he's going to address.",

We've even seen U.S. servicemembers injured -- one -- at least one, critically.Do you believe that this strategy is now the right one? The U.S. had said if you cross this line we're going to respond.

It's obviously changed a lot.Add another twist over the last few years, which is these new weight loss medications -- Ozempic, and Wegovy, and Mounjaro. Everyone knows these medications now and they cause people to lose a lot of weight. Does it also make them healthier? The answer seems to be yes. So there's a lot going on here. What is sort of interesting is that for a long time -- and I mean 200 years or so -- we looked at something known as BMI (Body Mass Index) to sort of determine is somebody actually too heavy. And now we know that is a really very overly simplified measure. It was created for Belgian soldiers back in the 1800s and has little relevance. I predict that it's going to go away. So how do you then draw the connection between weight and health? That is what we wanted to explore this season. We're really excited about it. Our first guest was Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford. She is an obesity medicine doctor at Harvard. We asked her about this issue specifically, starting off. Here's how she answered. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR.
