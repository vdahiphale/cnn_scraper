It's those critical battleground states, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and we saw some movement for Harris. To be clear, it's still too close to call, still within the margin of error there.

It's being led by those who I call paycheck-to-paycheck voters. People who literally have challenges at the end of the week or end of the month making ends meet.By the way, don't call them working class. They resent that. These paycheck-to-paycheck voters really do want to make a difference and they really do see in her campaign someone they can relate to. And third, and probably equally important, Donald Trump has not had two good weeks since Biden pulled out. He's been off message. He's been very negative and very hostile, and clearly he's kind of lost his balance. He absolutely emerged from the convention with a clear and convincing lead but what has happened, he stopped talking about immigration. He stopped talking about inflation.

And it's also immigration, which is a broader issue to them because that's a sense of safety and security. Trump has the advantage, and this is what I do not understand as a pollster and someone who's been doing this for 35 years.

And though it's not clear when that might happen or what form it would take, the attack could come he reports as soon as in the next few days.With us now, CNN military analyst, retired lieutenant general, Mark Hertling, and former State Department Middle East negotiator, Aaron David Miller. General, starting with you, what do you expect from Iran as compared to the drone and multi missile attacks, some 300 rockets and missiles that were directed towards Israel back in April from Iran, directly from Iranian territory? Do you expect something similar or something different? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: You know, Wolf, you can't really say. It could be a spectrum along that line, anything from a massive attack, not only from Iran, but also in coordination with Hezbollah and with other forces in the area, the PMF forces in Syria and Iraq, as well as the Houthis in Yemen, or could we see just a kinetic strike that's precision and surgical in nature to show Israel and for Iran to show their own population that they are doing something about what struck in Tehran. So it could be anywhere between those two extremes but I think they have to do something just to appease their own population, but also to show Israel that they are ready to confront them. But anything that they do could certainly expand this region into a catastrophic conflict.",

If that happens, what I'd say is Katy, bar the door. If Israel is struck to the point where there are multiple casualties or a lot of deaths, I think we're going to see that conflict spin out of control.That's the part where I'm very concerned because it has to do with not only what Iranians -- Iran's action will be, but as Aaron David just said, also what Hezbollah and Hamas will do to contribute to this. But it could certainly rise into a regional conflict or beyond in my view. And I don't think Iran is ready for that or has the military or the diplomatic capability to do something of that scale. So they should be very careful in what they do next.",

I think you make a very important point, General, because based on the briefings I've been having here, if Iran were to do a direct assault on Israel and wind up killing a lot of Israeli civilians, especially destroying a lot of buildings in Tel Aviv where I am right now, attacking military bases, Ben Gurion Airport, the international airport outside of Tel Aviv, Israel would respond with enormous, enormous military force against Iran, something the Israelis believe the Iranians would deliberately desperately try to avoid, but they won't be able to do so. So we'll see if this explodes into that type of regional war.Aaron, this forthcoming attack from Iran, as is now expected against Israel, is in response to the killing of a top Hamas leader who was into Tehran. Obviously there's more to come here. But how has that already impacted the region altogether?",

Wolf, has now been elevated to the head of Hamas, which is something frankly we all knew from the beginning that he's the major decision-maker. I will say, though, that Mark -- General Hertling raises a critically important point and that is the Hezbollah piece of this. You know, it takes 12 minutes for a cruise missile to impact in Israel, assuming it's not intercepted launch from Iran,. We're talking a minute and a half, Wolf. Probably less time for Hezbollah's high-trajectory weapons and its precision guided munition to strike Israel proper.The real damage here, frankly, is not going to come from Iran. It's going to come from Hezbollah. But I really do believe that both -- and again, General Hertling is right. I don't think Hezbollah nor Tehran is interested in the kind of strike that would trigger a massive Israeli response, a response I might add, Wolf, and Iranians know this, that could easily draw in the United States. The question is, will there be able to (INAUDIBLE) the fine line between doing something that is significant but not triggering a regional escalation that would create something the Middle East, Wolf, has never seen before. A genuine multi-front war involving Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Israel, and perhaps even an Israeli and U.S. military involvement against Iran.",

This fire that's occurring at the Zaporizhzhia power plant I believe in all intelligence, at least all open source intelligence, is saying it's the result of a tire fire inside or near the smokestack or the stack of the nuclear power plant. That is to distract and it's a Russian way of doing distraction.Remember Russia has control of that power plant. They have forces in the area. There are IAEA members there as well, saying what's happening. They say all radiation is safe still, but they are very concerned. They've been saying that for months. But the fact Russia would start a tire fire to envelope smoke into the area and indicate that something is going on is just another approach by Mr. Putin to conflict what's going on in this area and cause more danger to not only Ukraine, but also the entire region.",

It now appears to be more of a demonstration. I certainly wouldn't call it an offensive yet. The key is going to be, can they sustain this fight? When you put that many forces and there's apparently two brigades or more of Ukrainian forces have gone across the border, not just Kursk but also in Belgorod, you need a lot of logistics for an armored force that goes 20 kilometers.They've been there seven days. They need water, fuel, ammunition, supplies, parts. So we'll see how long they are in there. They have taken a lot of prisoners. Estimates are over a couple of hundred Russian prisoners that have already been taking and there are some indications of movement of Russian reinforcements into the area to counter it. There's no proof of that just yet. The fighting has not been intense other than beyond the border guards and the forces that were in the area. So this is Ukraine saying we can do the same thing. The other thing that I'd point out, Wolf, is indications are that it's Western style vehicles, the ones that have been given to Ukraine, they are conducting most of this tack and one of the things that I find most fascinating is having been a striker brigade commander, it appears that strikers are in the areas. They move fast, they're very mobile, they're very quiet, and they're exactly fitted for this kind of operation that would be a quick strike inside of a country and then a pullback very quickly without the need for a lot of logistics.",
