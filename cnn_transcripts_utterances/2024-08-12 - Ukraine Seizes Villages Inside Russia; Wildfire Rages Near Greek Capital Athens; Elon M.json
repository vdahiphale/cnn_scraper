Tonight, Ukraine claims it'scaptured 1,000 square kilometers of Russian territory as Kyiv's forces press further into Russia. Plus, Greece calls for aid as a fast-moving wildfire burns near its capital, Athens. We'll speak to a nurse who's working on the frontlines there. And then later, new polling showing that Kamala Harris is pulling ahead of Donald Trump in critical swing states. We'll break down those numbers for you. Well, we begin with Ukraine's cross-border advances in Russia. That surprise incursion began one week ago. The Ukrainian military chief says, troops now control about 1,000 square kilometers of Russian territory. Video into us geo-located by CNN shows how Ukraine appears to be making gains on the battlefield. It shows a Ukrainian armored vehicle passing through a Russian village in the Belovsky District and heading north to Lipetsk in Russia's Kursk region. Russian authorities have now evacuated over 100,000 people, 11,000 people in the Belgorod region, the second border area where civilians have now fled. Russian President Vladimir Putin is ordering his forces to quote, 'squeeze out\" the invaders. Well, CNN's Frederik Pleitgen is following the story and joins us now from Berlin. Good to have you with us, Fred. So, we know that Ukrainian troops have now been inside carrying out this incursion in Russia for almost a week, forcing the evacuation of more than 120,000 people. More people are now being told to evacuate, certainly, an embarrassing development for Vladimir Putin.",

It's been going on for six days now, and the Ukrainians still appear to be on the move and trying to gain additional territory. And you're absolutely right, 180,000 people are now under evacuation orders. And that's in the Kursk region alone. There's other people who are under evacuation orders in the Belgorod region, which is just south of there as well. And the Ukrainians say that this operation is going to be ongoing as they want to take the fight to the Russians inside Russia. Here's what we're learning. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And while the Kremlin claims its forces have held up Ukraine's advances in some areas, posting videos of bombed-out, alleged Ukrainian vehicles. The numbers the Kremlin does admit are staggering. Almost 30 villages under Ukrainian control, more than 120,000 Russian civilians evacuated in the Kursk region alone, and more under evacuation orders in Belgorod region to the south. Russian President Vladimir Putin irate, vowing to respond while ripping into Ukraine and its western allies.

I mean, this is -- this is long-overdue by the Ukrainian forces. But what we need to keep in mind is what is their near-term objective? Is it to stay in Russia to begin to bury, you know, to kind of dig away, bury their defensive positions as deeply -- and is hard, you know, hardened them as much as they can, or is it to create havoc?

That's a fact, and that has been demonstrated. And at -- but as a result of the law of large numbers, Russia has been able to just continue to bombard the infrastructure of Ukraine to really attack the will of Ukrainian people to resist, but they have been able to resist. So, this is an amazing morale boost for Ukraine, the Ukrainian citizen, certainly for the military. And it puts them in a much better position if there was a desire to negotiate.

U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has deployedthis nuclear-powered submarine armed with cruise missiles to the Middle East. He's also ordered a carrier strike group to speed its arrival to the region, saying that the U.S. is committed to taking every possible step to defend Israel. Well, the White House says the U.S. shared Israel's concerns that a significant attack by Iran or its proxies is increasingly likely, and it could happen within days. National Security Spokesman John Kirby says that could jeopardize Gaza ceasefire talks, which are set to resume Thursday. But he's still calling on all parties to show up. The U.S. and its allies are trying to defuse the regional tensions by mediating an end to the Gaza war. Hamas has indicated that it may not attend the next round of talks, saying mediators should compel Israel to accept a U.S.-backed ceasefire proposal that is already on the table. Let's get more now from Jeremy Diamond in Haifa in northern Israel, and our Ben Wedeman who joins us from Beirut, Lebanon. Good to have you both with us. I want to start with you first, Jeremy, because it's interesting that the Pentagon confirmed that it was sending this guided nuclear submarine. And the big question is, why publicize it? Because that is unusual. What sort of message is the U.S. sending here?",

And also, effectively, indicating that it is prepared to help us defend U.S. troops in the region and to support any potential Israeli response to those attacks. We know that this is obviously just the latest indication of the U.S. sending weapons and material to the region. Defense Secretary Austin also accelerated the movement of a carrier strike group to the region as well. We know that U.S. troops, U.S. Marines are already in the Mediterranean prepared to assist with a non-combatant evacuation of civilians from Lebanon as well. So, clearly, all signs are pointing to very heightened readiness, not only from the United States, but also from the Israeli military, which tonight we heard from the Israeli military Spokesman Daniel Hagari who said that there are no changes yet to instructions to civilians, but that the military itself is very much at a heightened state of alert as we are now getting reports indicating that U.S. and Israeli Intelligence believe that this Iranian attack, perhaps in coordination with its proxies like Hezbollah, could come effectively in a matter of days, perhaps even hours. And so, this is a very tense moment in the region, and one that could of course, potentially derail plans for ceasefire negotiations later this week.",

The potential even for some kind ofa diplomatic off-ramp as even Iran indicated, that movement towards a ceasefire or certainly a ceasefire itself, could potentially change its calculus in terms of retaliating against Israel for the assassination of Hamas' political leader while he was in the Iranian capital. And all of that hope and optimism is very quickly vanishing this week. In particular, because Hamas, first of all, yesterday indicated that it was unlikely to attend these talks, casting doubt certainly on its participation, following that Israeli strike in Gaza on Saturday that killed more than 90 Palestinians according to local officials. But also because we are now seeing this movement from Iran and from Hezbollah according to U.S. and Israeli Intelligence, indicating that they are preparing to carry out some kind of an attack likely before those talks even kicked off on Thursday. And so, all of this hope is now dissipating not only with that statement from Hamas following that Israeli strike this weekend, but also as it appears that we are headed for more escalation in this region rather than the de-escalation that was hoped could be achieved through those talks on Thursday.",

Is that they would -- they don't want war, but they are -- feel obliged that they have to reply. So, for instance, the -- Iran's U.N. mission in New York put out a statement saying that Iran has the right, the legitimate right of self- defense, and that it will not be that response will not be tied to the Gaza ceasefire. But it added that we hope that our response will be timed and conducted in a manner not to be detrimental to a potential ceasefire. So, clearly, both Iran and Hezbollah are not eager to engage in a full- scale war with Israel. They don't have the capacity to do so. But we spoke with a diplomat recently who said that the problem certainly with both sides is that they've sort of talked themselves into a corner, saying that they must respond, and the reputation, the legitimacy of the so-called Axis of Resistance, of which Iran is the leader and Hezbollah is the senior partner, that's on the line. If they don't in some way respond, then they will be seen as weak and ineffectual. So, they're in a bind, but they don't want to sort of bring down upon them the kind of Israeli retaliation that Israel is capable of doing, giving its vast superiority in terms of weaponry, Lynda?",

He actually -- you know, this is a far-right conspiracy that he saw and bought into, and then amplified himself on his own social media. But there's no basis for this. I mean, hundreds, if not thousands -- of thousands of people were at that rally, but a lot of people in the media as well were there, including CNN who witnessed the crowd. We have our own video people shot at CNN who were at that rally. Its just completely false, but it does speak to -- I think the broader -- you know, the broader frustration that I've been hearing from Donald Trump's team about how the former President is feeling, particularly when it does come to crowd size. It's no secret that Donald Trump has long been obsessed with crowd size, even back when he was running in the lead up to 2016. And I mean, for a long time, it's something that he took pride in, I mean, he still takes pride in it, but for a long time, he was the only one who could really turn out those massive numbers. You know, you look at Joe Biden's campaign, they were not bringing in thousands and thousands of people to his events, but that has changed with Harris now at the top of  the ticket, and it's really gotten under Donald Trump's skin. It is frustrating him. You've heard him mention this and talk about it at a number of his rallies ever since Biden ended his campaign and Harris became the successor and the presumptive Democratic nominee. And so, that's why I think a lot of this is coming from, and I can tell you it's definitely not something that I think a lot of Republicans are happy with.
