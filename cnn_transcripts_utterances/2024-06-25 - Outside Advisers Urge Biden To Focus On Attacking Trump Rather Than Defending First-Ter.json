We'll bring you new reporting and how the candidates are preparing for the momentous event that could define the entire race.Plus, the most expensive House primary ever. Voters are choosing today between liberal Congressman Jamaal Bowman and his more moderate opponent. What will the results say about the democratic divide over Israel? And the supreme weight. The court has nearly a dozen pieces left and just a few days left until the term ends. Among them is an opinion that impacts not just Donald Trump, but every president that will ever sit in the Oval Office. I'm Manu Raju in for Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. First up, 57 hours that's when the current president and the former president will meet for a historic debate at CNN headquarters in Atlanta. While Donald Trump does interviews and attends fundraisers, Joe Biden stay behind closed doors at Camp David and prepping with a large team of advisers. And we've got reporters covering them both. Kristen Holmes is in West Palm Beach, Florida. Kayla Tausche at the White House. And Kayla, let's start with you first, because you've got new reporting this morning about the advice that Biden is getting from some top Democrats. What are you hearing?",

      "sentences": "Manu, several senior Democrats who have the Biden camps ear have in recent weeks been urging them to change tack on the economy, instead going directly after Trump's economy, instead of taking credit for Biden's own. Now they say as a lifelong politician that Biden is naturally inclined to see credit where it's due, but they say that it's currently at odds with the way voters feel. As so long as the cost of living is so high, no amount of good data would be able to sway them otherwise. In the words of one senior Democrat I spoke with, he said Biden -- he wants the credit, he needs to stop.And while it's true, Manu, that everyone in Washington has advice. What was so striking about these conversations was the synchrony of them. And that there seemed to be a widely held view among Democrats, that Biden's economic messaging simply was not working. Now that tide began to turn just a few weeks ago. Earlier this month, the Biden campaign was out with an ad in English and Spanish, talking directly to voters and saying he understands the plight of the working class. And just today he has a new ad out, taking aim at Trump saying that Trump is out for himself. And it's Biden, who is trying to make life more affordable for voters. I would say far cry from the Bidenomics banner of 2023, as the president tries to refocus and reframe an issue that is so critical for the homestretch of the campaign. Manu?",

So, to talk about how great the economy is, is not landing because people believe that the cost of stuff is still too much. So, regardless of what the unemployment rate is, regardless of how well the stock market is doing. That's not how they're gauging their own economic circumstances.

In writing in today's New York Times about how she dealt with Trump back in 2016.It is nearly impossible, she said, to focus on substance when Mr. Trump is involved. In all three debates in 2016, he unleashed a blizzard of interruptions, insults and lies. Is a waste of time to refute Mr. Trump's arguments, like in a normal debate is nearly impossible to identify what his arguments even are. These ploys will fall flat if President Biden is as direct and forceful as he was when he engaged Republican headquarters at the State of the Union address in March.

If you look at first term presidents, compare this president with any other going back 30, 40 years, the only person who has had costs increase this dramatically during their tenure was Jimmy Carter.And so, from the time that Biden started till now, the cost of stuff has gone up 20 percent. With Carter, it was close to 40 percent. That's a -- that's a lot. And it felt -- and it was very dramatic. So, to make the case for one, how am I going to bring prices down? And two, the one opportunity that Biden has, I think, in contrast on the economy is -- and we saw this in our own battleground state polling, voters do trust Biden to look out for them. So, if the question is, who's going to do a better job on the economy? Trump wins that argument. Who understands me and my concerns? Biden does have an advantage with swing voters on that question.

The race is amplifying deep divides in the party over the war in Gaza, and it is also the most expensive House primary race in U.S. history. More than $25 million have been spent on ads alone, and that includes nearly $15 million from a Super PAC tie to the pro-Israel group AIPAC. My panel is back. So, Bowman is in real trouble here.

So, he doesn't have a real deep base in that district. The district has changed because we had redistricting after he won in 2022.So, a lot of his core base is no longer in that district. And the fourth thing is you pointed out that you have an issue like Israel, which is a dividing line within the Democratic party and AIPAC saw these vulnerabilities of Bowman, and as a candidate, I know, that's the other thing you need., You need one candidate. And it's helpful to have one candidate who's as well-known as his opponent. He represents Westchester County, which is basically the entire district. So, you have all those things that are working against Bowman and the money that's coming in, makes this really, really challenging for Bowman to survive.
