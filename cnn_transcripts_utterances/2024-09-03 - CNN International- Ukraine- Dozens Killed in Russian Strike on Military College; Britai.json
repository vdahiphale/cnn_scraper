It is one of the deadliest single attacks of this war, as we hear from CNN's Fred Pleitgen from Kyiv.",

The emergency services, though, Kate, we're pretty quick to be on the scene. The Ukrainians say, and were able to rescue 25 people, 11 of whom were trapped underneath the rubble.

That makes it already one of the deadliest single incidences since the start of this conflict, and it deals a major blow to morale. It was only a few weeks ago that President Zelenskyy was flying high on the surprise incursion into Russian territory, into Kursk. Now, for the last few days, we have seen this constant bombardment, this constant barrage of rockets and drones coming from Moscow. And of course, this the latest hit on a military educational facility that also bears significance Becky in many places along these front lines. President Zelenskyy is simply struggling to find the manpower. So, to have a military educational facility struck at a time like this, that will deal a moral blow to Ukraine's military. And it will also embolden the country in other ways. They have been pleading, they have been begging, for more air defense capabilities, and that's exactly what they're going to do in the wake of this. In fact, Ukraine's Foreign Minister, just a short time ago, speaking to our Christian Amanpour, said, if we had the proper technology, maybe lives could have been saved here. I'm paraphrasing of course. Ballistic missiles, which is what was used here, according to President Zelenskyy, are more difficult to intercept.

And he said, look, we had to do that, because we needed to put an end to this waffling around, as he sort of said in foreign capitals who were believing this notion that there was a stalemate and that actually Ukraine could not punch through. So, he said we had to do something to show that not only can we break a stalemate, but we are capable, when we do have the weapons, of taking the fight to the enemy. And we absolutely had to do that to change the calculation in our allies, capitals and to -- you know affect a little bit the Russians, perhaps as well. But most importantly, to make this plea as well for more and timely weapons deliveries, again, saying that we have been promised things that have not yet come to again, make an appeal to have restrictions on the use of a lot of that military support lifted.

And even, as you know, the Polish Foreign Minister has put out a statement earlier that they had to scramble their own jets on Monday when this barrage was coming into Kyiv, because -- you know they didn't know where these ballistic and cruise missiles were going.

      "sentences": "Well Becky, over the last two days, we have seen Israelis pour into the streets, not only just here inTel Aviv, but in towns and cities across Israel, demanding that the Israeli Prime Minister and his government change course, prioritize a hostage deal. And strike an agreement now that would see Israeli hostages return home alive, rather than in body bags, as we saw over the weekend, as those six hostages who were murdered by Hamas were brought back -- their bodies brought back by the Israeli military. And despite the fact that we have seen so many Israelis raising these demands and hoping that perhaps the deaths of these six hostages would be a wake-up call for this government that would cause it to change course, to change priorities. The Israeli Prime Minister last night doubling down on his position, doubling down on his demands that Israel retains control of that Philadelphi Corridor along the Gaza Egypt border, explaining repeatedly in a press conference last night why he believes it is so critical to Israel's security that Israeli troops remain along that corridor. And so, with his doubling down and as Hamas continues to insist that Israeli troops do withdraw from that corridor in order to get to the first phase of a ceasefire agreement, it doesn't leave much room to manoeuvre here for these negotiators who are still trying at this hour, to try and bring these two sides closer together, to try and strike a ceasefire agreement. As we understand, the United States is working to present a final proposal to both sides to see if they can get some kind of agreement. But it's really not clear how that can be achieved, as both sides seem to be dug into their positions. But the families of the hostages and many other Israelis who have come out into the streets over the last couple of days, they are planning to continue to raise their voices. Protests are planned for here in Tel Aviv, as well as several other key locations across the country. At 07:00 p.m. local time, we will see in what numbers people continue to show up as the families of these hostages try and keep the momentum going from the horrible news that we learned over the weekend and even in the face of Netanyahu digging into his current position.",

I mean, look, we did see President Biden as Israelwas preparing to go into Rafah, suspending the shipment of certain specific types of munitions, in particular those very, very large bombs that the United States has been sending to Israel. But beyond that, we haven't seen a willingness from the Biden Administration to impose real consequences on Israel from a security assistance perspective that would actually put consequences to the rhetoric that we have been hearing from the United States. We heard yesterday, President Biden said that he doesn't believe that Prime Minister Netanyahu is doing enough to get to a deal. I think the real question will be if the United States submits this so- called final proposal to both parties, and if it becomes clear to the United States that the Israeli Prime Minister is the central impediment to reaching that deal, does that trigger new consequences from the United States? We had already heard during the last month or so that should Netanyahu be viewed as the problem from the U.S.'s standpoint that we might hear President Biden and other top U.S. officials being blunter about the blame that they believe Prime Minister Netanyahu should hold for the failure to reach a ceasefire agreement. And so, we could see that, and then the question will be, will we see more? Will we see actual policy actions to make clear that the Israeli Prime Minister is standing in the way of this deal. I can tell you certainly that privately, a number of diplomats and other officials involved in this. They believe that Prime Minister Netanyahu additional demands which he had added after there was that framework agreement in early July regarding, for example, this demand on the Philadelphia corridor, and also a security mechanism that he was trying to enforce to get to check Palestinians going from Southern Gaza to Northern Gaza. That those certainly have been impediments to reaching a deal, but we certainly haven't heard U.S. officials say so, quite so bluntly in public. And so, will the rhetoric heighten and will policy action follow suit? Should these negotiations actually collapse, and should the United States view Israel as the central reason, why? But I think that still remains to be seen, and there's quite a bit of ground to cover still before we get there.",

And France is going to put that into action when he goes to the Istiqlal mosque here in Jakarta for a major interfaith gathering. Now that mosque is the largest in Southeast Asia. It's also connected by a tunnel to the Catholic Cathedral across the road is known as the tunnel of friendship and that kind of embodies the vision that Pope Francis has for religions to coexist. The importance that he's repeatedly emphasized, for faith to talk to each other, to build relations, to try and further peace, to work on things like climate change. So, Francis wants a Catholic church in the region to be a creative and impactful minority, and that's one of the reasons why he's come all this way.

Rolls Royce hasn't commented on exactly what the issue is with the engine. Reuters, citing people familiar with the matter, said it relates to a fuel nozzle, which experts say is generally less serious of a problem than the failure of a major rotating part of the plane, such as a turbine blade.
