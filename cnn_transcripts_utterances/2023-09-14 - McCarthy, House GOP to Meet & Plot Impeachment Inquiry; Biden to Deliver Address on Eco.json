President Biden will be heading out to Maryland to try to enter into this new phase of selling his economic vision to the American people, which remains very wary about the state of the economy.Now, the White House says they will be doing today is trying to draw more of an explicit contrast with Republican policies. You often hear President Biden talk about Bidenomics. Well, today he will be trying to contrast that against MAGAnomics. This is an effort to try to sell the president's vision a bit more to the American people. Now, one of the president's top advisers, Anita Dunn, wrote a memo that was released this morning, highlighting some of the facts that the president will be leaning into. He will be drawing from the Republican study committee's budget, released over the summer, to argue that Republicans want to raise [SIC] taxes for wealthy Americans and also make cuts to Medicare and Social Security. That's something we've often heard President Biden talk about on the campaign trail. And this all comes as there has been these internal debates and, really, a budget standoff up on Capitol hill as that September 30th government shutdown deadline looms. But the really big question is whether Biden could actually move the needle with Americans' perceptions on the economy. As you mentioned, recent polling has shown that the majority of Americans believe that the president's economic policies have worsened economic conditions for them. Even as there are some bright spots in the economy, people still just aren't feeling this at home. The White House has acknowledged it will take time for a lot of this to settle in, but they are trying to ramp up that messaging, especially as that 2024 election looms.",

And then the presidential office coming out with this line that they believe that certain kinds of weapons that North Korea has given to Russia have already been used in Ukraine on the battlefield, saying that \"We've long confirmed that certain kinds of weapons have been used in the battlefield.\" So certainly, this is of concern. We've heard from the Biden administration before that they believe North Korea had already given infantry rockets and missiles to the Russian mercenary group, Wagner, last year. But this goes one step further. The South Korean presidential office saying they believe those weapons are already on the ground and have been used. We're also hearing elsewhere in the region from Japan, the new foreign minister saying she's very concerned and worried about what exactly this kind of deal would mean for any kind of sanctions, U.N. Security Council resolutions, for example. Very problematic, though, of course, because Russia and China are Security Council members. And they certainly have the veto for any new sanctions.

Ukrainians need our help, and they needed it yesterday. Ukraine's victory in the war is a strategic -- is in America's strategic interests.\" And one of those retired generals who decided it was so critical to write that letter is with us now, former NATO supreme allied commander, retired General Philip Breedlove. We really appreciate your time this morning. Did you feel that you needed to write this letter, not only because of what is happening in Washington and these efforts to strip this right now, but because of the sentiment of the majority of American people, who do not at this point support more new funding? GEN. PHILIP BREEDLOVE (RET.), FORMER NATO SUPREME ALLIED COMMANDER: Well, first of all, good morning and thank you for having me on your show. The timing is important. As we approach the presidential elections, you know, now what is happening is politics is having much more influence on what we are doing and what we should be doing for Ukraine. And part of our letter was to urge that we set aside those sort of current politics and refocus on the strategic nature of what's happening in Ukraine. And there is so much economically that Ukraine affects us here in America and the world. There's so much in the manner of food and grain that Ukraine affects in the world.
