Former Special Counsel Robert Hur defending his investigation of President Joe Biden's handling of classified documents. Haiti's Prime Minister resigns as the World Food Programme warns a million Haitians are on the brink of famine. Authorities launch an investigation into the dramatic mid-air drop of a LATAM Airlines flight on Monday. And so-called Sephora kids are a viral hit on TikTok for their skincare trends, but with children as young as eight taking part, is enough care being taken? All that and plenty more coming up on the show. But first, the U S. prosecutor behind a report describing Joe Biden as a \"well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory\" defended those words on Capitol Hill. Former Special Counsel Robert Hur, who investigated the president's handling of classified documents, came under fire from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Republicans pressed him on his decision not to prosecute the president. Democrats meanwhile criticized Hur for his comments on President Biden's memory while directly comparing his conduct with Donald Trump's own mishandling of secret files. Paula Reid has the highlights from Tuesday's testimony. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Former Special Counsel Robert Hur grilled by lawmakers from both sides of the aisle today about his investigation into President Biden's mishandling of classified documents. REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: Mr. Hur, why did he do it? Why did Joe Biden, in your words, willfully retain and disclosed classified materials? I mean, he knew the law. He's been in office like 50 years. REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL (D-WA): You exonerated him.",

But he stood by the findings in his report. And ultimately, as a prosecutor, he had to make a recommendation as to whether or not he thought a jury would be convinced of the president's potential violations of law. And he found that they would not. And a prosecutor working under the guidelines of the Justice Department cannot bring a case, cannot bring -- charge a case unless they think that they reasonably would persuade a jury that they would succeed at trial. And so, what he articulated, based on the extensive facts contained and the analysis contained in his report, which was over 350 pages, he ultimately determined that that case, if he were to bring it, would not have been successful.",

I actually don'tthink that Special Counsel Hur needed to make that distinction in his own report, since he, as a prosecutor, did not evaluate all of the facts in the Trump investigation. But one of the big distinguishing characteristics of the two cases is that when the government brought to the awareness of Former President Trump that he was believed to retain classified documents, he refused to return them. He did not sit for an interview. He did not cooperate with the investigation. And so, ultimately that's why he was charged with obstruction. In the case of President Biden, there was a much longer time period over which the retention of classified information at various locations was involved. But once he was alerted and his counsel was alerted to the investigation and to the concerns of the government, he cooperated, his legal counsel cooperated, they returned documents, he sat for an interview, he cooperated in every possible way, and those are really the main distinguishing facts between the investigations.",

I do think it calls into question the special counsel regulations as they exist, because the report that the regulations called for is supposed to be a confidential report. That's not really the way that it works in practice. In this case and in others, those reports end up being released publicly as this one was. His report also is very, very extensive. It has chapters. And I think that goes beyond what a typical prosecutorial memo, particularly one that's declining a prosecution would do. I don't fault him for that, but I do think that it raises the question of whether the regulations themselves need to be streamlined and tailored and more narrow so that a future special counsel has more guidance about what should and should not go into their report.",

The latest explosion of violence leading to a massive jailbreak that freed thousands of prisoners closed the country's main airport indefinitely and forced the United States and other embassies to evacuate diplomats by helicopter.

But then west of Denver, in those higher elevations, you give it about 2, 000 meters, 6,000, 7,000 feet, it is going to be a snow storm.

What we didn't see is the president then out talking about it. He didn't do an interview for Super Bowl Sunday, for instance. He wasn't out there then on Monday, Tuesday, making the case to the American people of why the economy is improving and why he thinks his policies are responsible for that.

But at the core of this, I think for the Democrats, perhaps relief that we didn't hear more about some of the concerns that were raised in that initial report, which was about the president's mental acuity and whether or not perhaps he's got the brains and that the potentials to survive not only the campaign, I think, and the winning the presidency, but what the next four years brings.

It really follows on the heels of what was a successful speech in the State of the Union for the president. And that's not that one speech resets everything and changes the narrative or changes voters' opinions, but it should be the start of something. The challenge for Biden is that he needs to keep doing it over and over again. And ultimately, the problem that the president has, it's also a problem that Donald Trump has. So, I think the real endurance test here is ultimately for the voters. Poll after poll shows that this is a sequel that they do not want to see and will be forced to. And this -- what we see is Joe Biden is unpopular, Donald Trump is unpopular. Voters don't want this. And they're viewing this election as the movable object versus the resistible force.
