Tonight, almost 90 hours on from the devastatingearthquake in Turkey and Syria, time is running out. We'll have the latest on the intensive search for survivors. Then, Ukraine's President Zelenskyy is in Brussels, rallying support for his country. But will the bloc budge on his request for fighter jets? Plus, the U.S. says China's suspected surveillance balloon contained technology to monitor American communication. More on those findings next. Well, they're holding on to hope, but as the hours go by, families gathered around collapsed buildings in Syria and Turkey are fearing the worst as rescuers search through the rubble. The death toll from Monday's devastating earthquake has now soared past 20,000 people. And while we are still seeing some incredible rescues, they are now few and far between. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Somebody who has an affinity for President Putin. He said he wants the war to end now, and wants -- doesn't want any more weapons to go to Ukraine and essentially wants peace now. Now, that would be capitulating to President Putin's annexation and demands. And there's no other country within the European Union that is anywhere close to the language that Viktor Orban is using. So yes, I mean, absolutely set Viktor Orban aside as a separate issue. There has been absolutely tremendous steps for support, lockstep if you will, for President Zelenskyy. And you know, he'll see that, he'll read the room, and he's trying to reach out to European people to shore up support for Ukraine. Because if the people of Europe, more than 440 million of them support Ukraine and its endeavors, then that helps keep political space for the European Union's leaders to continue to get the humanitarian support, the economic support and most importantly, the military support.

And what they moved to do, you know, out of the gates, was to just investigate it, try and figure out what it was, trying to figure out what was going on here. But then when this balloon took a sharp turn to the south, and it appeared that it was going to be potentially headed for continental U.S. That is when alarm bells began to increase. And that may sort of explain why there weren't steps taken right out of the gates there to shoot this down before it came into Alaskan airspace. But, of course, many members of Congress, as you just played there, are still frustrated and baffled by the fact that the administration didn't move to shoot this down before it came in to U.S. airspace, including Alaskan airspace. You know, we also heard from the -- from the senator from Alaska saying, it appears essentially that they were saying that China could, you know, have its run over Alaskan airspace and they just weren't concerned about that. So there are a lot of questions about the timeline here. And the decision making that the Biden administration went through. We should note that they do say that when it came over the continental U.S., it was not a threat militarily or a threat to American civilians. And when they did shoot it down. Now, they're collecting a large amount of intelligence about this Chinese intelligence gathering operation.",

They were also capable of collecting signals intelligence. And what that does is it collects intelligence from electronics, things like radios or radars.
