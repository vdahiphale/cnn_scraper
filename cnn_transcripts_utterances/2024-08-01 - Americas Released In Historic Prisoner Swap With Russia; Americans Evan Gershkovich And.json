      "sentences": "Welcome to Inside Politics. I'm Dana Bash. And we are following big breaking news today. American's Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan are in American custody after a massive, massive prisoner swap with Russia. It involves 26 people and seven countries. This exchange happened at an airport in Ankara, Turkey. You see that airport there. It happened just moments ago.President Biden confirmed the exchange. The deal also included Washington Post columnist Vladimir Kara-Murza among others. Now we haven't yet seen, of course, the people who are coming off. And historically, just to put this in context, this has not happened. Nothing close to this has happened since the end of the cold war. Any moment, President Biden will address the nation from the White House. We will of course bring that to you live. CNN journalists are in place across the world, working their sources, and they're going to bring you all the latest details. Matthew Chance is in London, Kylie Atwood at the State Department. We're going to start though with MJ Lee at the White House. MJ, I know you have some new reporting on what to expect from President Biden and some of the details that went into this historic day.",

And you talked about the U.S., the Biden administration in particular, saying that there's no change with regard to its relationship with Russia. We're hearing some different sentiment from Russia, which we'll get to with Matthew Chance in a moment. Thank you so much for that excellent reporting as always, MJ.And we just got a statement from Paul Whelan's family. And I'll read part of it. It says, quote, Paul was a Russian hostage for 2043 days. Thank you for covering Paul's story and helping us share our messages and advocacy for his release. Over that time, Paul will be receiving U.S. government support as all freed hostages do in the next few days and weeks. I hope you will give him some privacy as you have done with other released hostages. This is now Paul's story to tell. And I'm sure he will, in time, communicate how he wants to tell it. It is vital that he be given agency over his life again, something the Kremlin took away for so many years. Wow, powerful statement. I want to bring in CNN national security correspondent Kylie Atwood. And I want you to talk about what you're learning from your sources. But as you do just listening or reading that statement and thinking about what Paul Whelan's family is saying. And thinking about the fact that our colleague, Jenny Hansler, has been able to talk several times to Paul Whelan as he has been in this Russian prison. And you could always hear that -- understandably, you could hear the frustration in his voice, the idea that he's now in U.S. custody is just remarkable.",

As Paul Whelan figures out how to tell his story as a freed American, who was wrongfully detained in Russia for more than five years.It's worth noting that he has already been telling his story throughout the course of the last few years here, because he has made phone calls from prison to our colleague Jennifer Hansler to tell her what kind of emotions he's been going through, particularly as there were other prisoner exchanges where he was left behind, other Americans left Russia and he was left behind. That was tremendously challenging for him. So now, we'll watch and see, you know, what the next steps look like for him in sharing that story. We've got a statement just in the last few minutes here from the secretary of state who said that there are three Americans who are now on their way home to the United States from Russia, of course, that's Paul Whelan, Evan Gershkovich, and Alsu Kurmasheva, and then there's one green card holder. We've been talking about him Vladimir Kara-Murza, who is a prominent Kremlin critic, who had been very vocally against the Kremlin for years. And he's also been freed as part of this prisoner exchange. And the secretary of state spoke about the extraordinary effort on behalf of the government, State Department, NSC, CIA, that came to the point, where there will secure the release of all of these Americans.",

There was an enormous amount of nervousness, right, because you're in those final moments, despite everything you've heard, you know the enormous efforts that were made and all the pieces that were coming together until all those pieces come together. And until they're able to see their loved ones safe on that tarmac in Turkey. And now see the statement from the U.S. secretary of state saying, they are on a flight back to the U.S. They were not going to be ready to celebrate.

They gave up a prisoner because they thought it was the right thing to do to get all of these other prisoners out.And so, also, I think that, you know, the United States intel community has been at the forefront of so many of these. Leon Panetta in 2010. When we had these 10 Russian illegals and other people. Russians buried into our society, pretending to be Americans were exchange. Leon Panetta was at the forefront of that. And our own Jim Clapper was, you know, went to North Korea to get poor Otto Warmbier out. So, so many of these and of course, during the cold war, but absolutely crucial.",

This is a moment for Joe Biden that he does, you know, when bad things happen on presidents' watches, they get blamed sometimes unfairly. And when good things happen on their watches, they get credit sometimes unfairly. I don't think this is an unfairly time. It is particularly where I've always been a critic of this idea of multi tracks and diplomacy in national affairs, because you're always dealing with one other country. The fact that this happens the same week, the first F-16 show up in Ukraine is really kind of amazing. You would think that Putin would say, we slow that down and that wouldn't go forward with this. So that's very impressive to me. And I hate these kinds of deals, because we're trading guilty, horrible people for -- guilty and or horrible people, for innocent people.
