In other words, she is not going to make this an entire rebuttal of the former President and what he did on January 6th. And what she said is the risk democracy. Rather, it is going to be painting a broader vision. But the location is significant and intentional. The reason they chose this venue, according to sources, is because they wanted there to be gravity to the speech and recall the Oval Office. The office she's seeking is only 500 yards behind her. So they are also painting a visual here. The Vice President on the campaign trail has been saying that she's going to focus on her to-do list, while the former President she's cast as someone who is consumed by revenge and focused on what she says is his enemies list. So that is the visual she's trying to paint there with Oval Office behind her. She described this a bit herself in an interview with the Breakfast Club earlier today. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (D) AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I would ask people to imagine the Oval Office. And people have seen it on TV. You know what it looks like? It's either going to be Donald Trump sitting behind that desk writing out his enemies list of who he's going to seek revenge and retribution on, or it's going to be me working on behalf of the American people, as I always have done, working on my to-do list.

Donald Trump is obviously not one too often apologize, despite the fact that so many Puerto Rican leaders are calling on him to do so. He did address before his remarks in West Palm Beach the comments from the comedian who led off that Madison Square Garden rally, saying that Puerto Rico was literally an island of floating garbage. And this is what he told ABC. He said, I don't know him. Someone put him up there. I don't know who he is.Now, according to ABC, they pushed back on that, saying, well, did you hear the comments? What did you think of them? He said he never heard them, again, despite the fact that they've been playing on every network incessantly. And we know that he watches television. And he did not take the chance to decry those comments or condone them in any way. Essentially, all he said was that he believed he was going to win the White House. Now, when I talked to a number of his aides and allies, I specifically asked about this event and while they wouldn't say whether or not Donald Trump was going to say anything, they did have the statistics on hand of the Latino population in this area, including the number of Puerto Rican voters in this area. And we have since learned that the shadow senator from Puerto Rico is going to be speaking at tonight's event. So regardless of what Donald Trump is doing, clearly, the campaign is seeking to have some cleanup here. Now, the really remarkable thing about what we heard while he was talking in West Palm Beach, that he actually addressed the Madison Square Garden rally without addressing those controversial remarks. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (R) AND CURRENT U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't think anybody has ever seen anything like what happened the other night at Madison Square Garden. The love in that room, it was breathtaking. Politicians that have been doing this for a long time, 30 and 40 years, said there's never been an event so beautiful. It was like a love fest, an absolute love fest. And it was my honor to be involved. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And of course, I just want to mention, it's not just the comments that the comedian made. There was a series of racist, sexist, and vile comments made in that pre-program. But instead of addressing any of that, he addressed the entire thing as a love fest. But of course, we'll have our eyes on tonight. He's doing another event in another part of Pennsylvania right now as we speak. We'll see if he addresses it there. But this would really be the opportunity for the former President to have some kind of remarks, particularly, as you said, Brianna, this is an area that has a heavy Latino voter, a very heavy Puerto Rican presence.

But I don't need it today, so we're going to toss it aside and we're going to talk about what the polls may or may not be underestimating.Look, if the polls are off like they were in 2020, Donald Trump's going to win this election easily, right, 312 electoral votes, 226 for Harris, because he's going to win up here in these Great Lake battleground states, right. He's going to win down here in the Southeast. And he's going to win in those western battleground states as well. But here is why -- one of the reasons why I'm skeptical of it. Because the polls underestimated Donald Trump in 2016 and 2020, right? They underestimated the Republicans across the board. So I went back through history. Has a party outrun the polls three presidential cycles in a row? The answer is at least dating back since 1972, they never have, they never have in the battleground, presidential polls. So even though they've outrun them twice in a row, the Republicans have the idea that they do it a third time, there's no analogy to it in history.",

You go back to 2022, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, 2022 polls, an average across those states, the Democrats were actually underestimated. They were underestimated by four points. Maybe the pollsters were making adjustments that actually ended up overestimating Republicans. And you know that first map I showed you, if the polls are off like they were in 2020 and Donald Trump won all the swing states, if the polls are off this year like they were in 2022, the Democrats, Kamala Harris, will win in all those key swing states. We're talking across up here, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, down here in the Southeast, North Carolina, Georgia and Nevada and Arizona in the Southwest, and she gets to 319 electoral votes.So the bottom line is, a lot of folks are thinking that Donald Trump will be underestimated in the swing states. Maybe so, but I think there's a decent case to be made for Kamala Harris being underestimated as well based upon the data that we see in.

You've been very busy campaigning, so we'll talk a little bit about that.But in 2022, as Harry was just talking about, there was this ghost voter phenomena, right, where you saw a lot of voters who had eluded polling, maybe they had irregular or they had no voting history, and they turned out. A lot of them motivated by the overturning of Roe v. Wade for Democrats. Are Democrats relying or expecting ghost voters to show up and have an impact this cycle? SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): Look, this will be an incredibly close election. That's what I've seen on the ground. That's what I've heard as a co-chair. That's what I think the polling is showing us, is that there are lots and lots of people who are motivated by both of these candidates. I think if you look at the sharp contrast between Trump's message at Madison Square Garden and the optimistic, forward looking message you'll hear tonight from Vice President Harris, that frames the difference as clearly and sharply as we can. And the campaign is relying on a margin of effort. Too many of these polls are within the margin of error. What we've got going for us as a campaign at this point is a lot of volunteers and a lot of organization on the ground. I was talking earlier today to folks who are in York, Pennsylvania, knocking on doors, talking to voters, connecting with people. We've got a small margin of voters who haven't made up their mind yet whether to vote or for whom to vote. And I think we're going to do a better job in the end of connecting with them. Vice President Harris tonight is going to deliver again the concrete, positive, forward-looking proposals she's got for how to deal with the costs that concern average families, whether it's housing and childcare, healthcare and building a better future through opportunity. In the meantime, former President Trump is commenting on or not commenting on, avoiding responsibility for an anger and hate filled rally at Madison Square Garden. The Archbishop of Puerto Rico has demanded a personal apology from former President Trump. He's going to be focusing on that today on the defensive in Allentown. And Vice President Harris is going to be delivering a positive forward-looking message.",

But they have also raised repeated concerns about humanitarian issues in Gaza. And just a few weeks ago, the Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense sent a letter to the Israeli government saying, you have to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza to not do so as a violation of law. I think that shows both the balance in the President, Vice President's position, and the very real possibility that there will be further movement in that direction. I agree with what the Senator said, which is former President Trump will do nothing to constrain Prime Minister Netanyahu in terms of his chosen direction of imposing harsher and harsher consequences on the Palestinian people.

He's saying that anybody who may have dropped off a ballot in that box that you're seeing right there over the weekend after Saturday at 11 a.m. should request a replacement ballot. This is just very disheartening to people, including the manufacturer of ballot boxes that we talked to in the area. The company called LaserFab made the ballot box in Portland, not the one you're seeing there. But LaserFab makes a lot of the ballot boxes throughout the West Coast. And they talked to me about how they worked closely with local elections officials to make boxes as tamper-proof as possible. So when this happened, he felt it was extremely disheartening. Here's what he told me. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And that troubles me more than, you know, yeah, a box can be replaced. You know, hopefully they can track down the people who put the ballots in, things like that. But, you know, it's the people side of the thing that distresses me more.(END VIDEO CLIP)",

And that's because there were fire suppressants in that box that actually worked. There were also fire suppressants in the Washington state boxes as well, I'm told, but they didn't quite function or protect the ballots as they thought they would. So really tricky here. A lot of logistics that officials are having to figure out.Meanwhile, law enforcement is working on finding who did this. They believe it's all connected. That's the vehicle you see there, a dark Volvo S60 of 2001 to 2004, they say. So there's a lot of work there, extra work as Election Day approaches, Boris and Brianna.",
