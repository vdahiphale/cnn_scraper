When we asked Trump's campaign, what's behind this total 180 flip on bitcoin. They really didn't give us much of an answer. But I will point out that Trump has received considerable financial support from the bitcoin community. Many of its investors and founders have contributed to his campaign. Trump himself has -- his campaign has taken about $4 billion -- excuse me -- $4 million worth of bitcoin. That's something that we heard from his campaign and he also received a bitcoin on stage today as this community continues to court him. It'll be interesting to see how this courtship though plays out with the rest of the country. When you look at polling on bitcoin, a majority of Americans -- the vast majority believe it is unsafe and unreliable, especially given some of the controversies that it has faced over the years.

Marc, let's start first with you. You have some new reporting from inside the Trump campaign about how they essentially thought maybe they could cruise to victory before President Biden dropped out. That this was all kind of shaping up in the way they wanted it to. Now there's a question of if Trump even wants to debate Vice President Harris. Is this a sign of a larger worry on behalf of the Trump campaign? What -- where are they in all of this? MARC CAPUTO, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, \"THE BULWARK\": Where they are is they're fighting the fight that they now have to join in. So the fact that we're asking and talking about whether he's going to debate or not, that I think is part of the strategy to get the ok, we were the normal campaign before while Biden was the chaotic one. Now, Kamala Harriss campaign is looking like the normal one, so time to inject some chaos into this. And so as a result, you saw Trump's campaign say, you know what? Maybe we're not going to debate Kamala Harris. She's not the nominee yet. And oh, by the way, Barack Hussein Obama -- and, you know, welcome to the Trump show.",

Alex to that end, it's been six days since President Biden dropped out of the race. There is a lot of momentum around the Harris campaign. They have that record fundraising haul from grassroots donors, not necessarily -- I mean big donors have also jumped on, but -- but a lot of small dollar donors. Do you think that they can keep this enthusiasm up through election day or is this the sugar-high that the Trump campaign pollster thought it might be? ALEX THOMPSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, AXIOS: Well, the greatest mobilizer of Democrats in American history has been Donald Trump. And the greatest unifier of Democrats in history has been Donald Trump. So while there is this, you know, sugar-high of cash and enthusiasm, the prospect of another -- a second, Donald Trump term is going to continue to propel Democrats forward and propel enthusiasm. Now, maybe it won't take place in the same way that were seeing now. You know, another thing under the radar that's been happening as Harris has tried to start leading the campaign is the Trump team while they were initially caught a little bit off guard, they have invested tens of millions of dollars in TV advertising that are focused on a few select things. One is Kamala Harris and the border. Kamala Harris' record before she was vice president. You have to remember in the 2020 primary, she ran well to the left of Joe Biden and was among one of the most progressive members on those debate stages. And the third thing they're going to focus on is what did she know about President Biden's health and why was she such a public validator of it? So those are the three notes they're initially doing in this first week and Harris' campaign has still to really put any money on air so far despite raising a lot.",

What does the Kamala Harris' internal polling say. Does its actually swing any sort of state? The other thing you have to think is they're doing a very rushed vice- presidential process. You are vetting these candidates in record time because she's looking to nominate a ticket by August 7, not August 19 when the convention starts, but through a virtual process. You are asking to go through and pick someone very quickly.

We have to get a ceasefire and the hostages in Gaza in order to calm down the north.

And actually will help us think about what might come next.First of all there's a lot of Trump fatigue in the country. And President Biden's performance in June -- in June had a seismic, in a negative way, effect on Democratic voters and Independents who would like to consider the Democratic option. There was such a flagging in enthusiasm and concern about President Biden's health and his ability to be present for four years, let alone win the election. Once he moved out of the way, stepped aside, just the idea of a vibrant energetic Democratic nominee -- for a couple of days, we weren't -- for a day and a half, we weren't sure that it would be Vice President Harris. That alone restored a lot of hope among those who just don't want to vote for Trump. During the period just after the debate, when it was -- when there was much concern about President Biden, if Donald Trump had not been the Republican candidate, I believe that the difference between President Biden and the Republican candidate would have been much more than six points. But there is -- there seems to be a glass ceiling to how far president -- former President Trump could go. So that's the first thing. The second really big development is the extent to which the Democrats managed to avoid the chaos that many people feared would happen if President Biden stepped aside. I can't wait to read the story. We're getting little bits and pieces about the role behind the scenes that Nancy Pelosi played, former President Obama played, and others. In, first of all, moving the current president aside. Absolutely unprecedented in American history. But also in making clear to the rest of the Democratic Party it was a time to unite. At the same time, one has to look at those that could have run against Kamala Harris and decided not to. Very significant, very interesting. So now the real race among the Democrats is not for the number-one position. It's for the number-two position.",

No presidential candidate of a major party has ever made that claim or made that promise. They've never sought a mandate to wreak havoc on the country. And so the question was, were Americans willing to embrace that kind of deeply negative vision for the future? And with President Biden -- not debilitated, but certainly weak -- it looked like President Trump would have an easy glide path to the presidency. It doesn't look like that anymore. So in the next hundred days, we're going to have a discussion, a national discussion about what we want our future to be. Do we want a dark future of recrimination or do we want to find a way to work together in a more hopeful approach? That debate might not have happened if President Biden had remained at the top of the Democratic ticket. It's not his fault. His body betrayed him at this point. But we will have it now.

But talk us through some challenges involved in an unexpected situation like this.O'BRIEN: Well, there's one other little detail, too. Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams gave up their suitcases on launch because they had to carry up a crucial piece of equipment for the space station's plumbing system. Essentially, its toilet and recycling system for water. And so -- but they we're like, oh, we'll just be up there for a week. We don't need any clothes. So they've been up there for quite a long while and there's no laundry on the International Space Station. So they have lots of extra stuff up there, lots of provisions to last a big crew for a long period of time. But, you know, astronauts are very mission directed and mission focused. And when it just day after day without a specific flight plan, they get a little bit antsy, even if the view is spectacular.",

And so there is not -- it's not inconceivable that come -- it could come into play. No one's talking about that just this moment, but there are other options. And in an emergency, these two astronauts would, in fact, get on the Starliner and leave the space station with that as a lifeboat. NASA is framing this as not a high level of concern about the spacecraft. But the fact that they don't fully understand why so many things have gone wrong, they want to figure it out. And the equipment that is in question here, Jessica, will be jettisoned and will burn up in the atmosphere on the way home. And so they won't have any way to examine it and try to get evidence later.
