They reveal concerns he had about Trump becoming president again. In a letter obtained by \"The New York Times,\" Navalny told a friend that the prospects of a second Trump presidency, and his agenda, were really scary. CNN's Melissa Bell is live in Paris.

She had been planning to speak about his imprisonment and ended up addressing the group just hours after she learned that he had died.It was an emotional moment, but it was also one of great determination. And now, she has declared that she will sort of take up his old cause and become the centerpiece of the dissident movement that Navalny was, of course, at the center of until his death. But I think what really struck people in Munich was not just the Navalny moment, but this in sequence with two other events. One was that Russia was beginning to make significant progress against the Ukrainians at a moment that the U.S. this has faltered in providing more arms. And the second was that the revelation of a Russian plan -- We don't know if it'll happen yet -- to put a nuclear weapon in space came just within hours of this. And I think the three things together made them realize that they had underreacted to Russia, even after the Ukraine invasion.",

I mean, if you think about it, Putin himself came to Munich in 2007 and basically said there are lands that have been separated from Russia that need to be restored. That should have been the first message.Then he invaded Crimea in 2014. Europe was very slow to impose sanctions. Signed the deal in 2015, the next year, to get Nord Stream 2, additional gas from Russia. So it was really only after the invasion, two years ago this week, that the Europeans got serious about cracking down. And they're way behind in their military buildup. And so the statements that former President Trump has been making, the slowness of the House Republicans to provide aid and arms, the doubts about NATO has suddenly sent them into something of a panic, because they moved way too slowly in reacting to the new reality.",

It's not clear that he's built up any significant allies, other than China, Iran, and of course, North Korea, all of which are helping in their own way with the war, but they also think, I believe, that our own democracies are faltering.And it was interesting that when President Zelenskyy addressed the group on Saturday, he referred to self-defeating democracies, and he was clearly making a reference to the United States. And at one moment, in a jab at Congress for being off and out of session while this is going on, made the point that dictators don't take vacations. So I think there is a sense that the U.S. and the allies are losing ground, may not be able to recover it, and clearly, don't have a strategic plan to go deal with -- from this point forward.",

Torrential rains soaked the region Monday, turning many roadways into rivers, leaving major cleanups for multiple communities and travel chaos after thousands of flights were delayed. Meteorologist Derek van Dam is tracking the system. Derek, you told us it would be bad. Now it's here. Can you talk about when this ends?",

This is the concern in this state.These creeks and tributaries turn into raging torrents of water in a matter of seconds. The water lifts so quickly because of the amount of rain they've had. And it sweeps all kinds of debris, including full vehicles and SUVs, along with it. And of course that could be so, so dangerous. And just to put this all into context, we're talking about, we're approaching, were inching closer and closer to the wettest February ever recorded in Los Angeles, for instance. We're just about two inches shy of that record, which has set back in 1998. We have had over 11 and-a-half inches so far this month alone. And there is more rain to come. Slight risk of flash flooding, the Bay Area southward. But let's focus -- focus into Southern California. That is a level three of four from San Bernardino to Los Angeles. That is a moderate risk of flash flooding today. You can see the on and off again, heavy rain showers that continue to move in across Southern California, and that will only exacerbate the flood threat through the course of the day today. Of course, snowfall continues across the Sierra Nevada mountain range. There's the millions of Americans impacted by the flood alerts, impressive rainfall totals from this latest atmospheric river event, over half a foot in many locations and several inches of snowfall. Another one to three inches of rain possible across Los Angeles County. So watch out for flooding today.",

Now, he was identified by police as 25-year-old Nicholas Jordan, originally from Detroit, Michigan. They believe that he was responsible for last Friday's fatal shooting of two people, a young man and a young woman, in that dorm room. He was apprehended, arrested shortly after found -- being found inside a vehicle on Monday. He was taken into custody without any sort of incident, according to police. Authorities indicated that the suspect and these victims may have known one another. In fact, the police have previously said that this was, quote, \"not a random attack against the school or other students at this university.\" Authorities, however, did not go into how they were able to to identify him so quickly. But they did say that they obtained the arrest warrant on Friday evening, the same day that these shootings took place, which effectively means this individual was on the loose, pardon me, for two days. And so there were growing questions about why authorities didn't reveal more information about his identity before apprehending him. The Colorado Springs chief of police was asked about this. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
