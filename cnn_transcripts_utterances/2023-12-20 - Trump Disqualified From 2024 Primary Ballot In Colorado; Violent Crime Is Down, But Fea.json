This bombshell ruling is reverberating through the campaign, setting up a collision with the Supreme Court. Also this hour is crime remains a major concern to voters. We're going to talk with San Francisco DA about what she is doing to clean up the streets. And President Joe Biden is heading to the swing state of Wisconsin to sell the benefits of Bidenomics, even as polls show voters aren't really given credit for the rising economy. Good day, everyone. I'm John Avlon, in for Kasie Hunt, to our viewers watching in the USA and around the world. It is 11 a.m. here in New York on Wednesday, December 20. There are 26 days until the Iowa caucus, 320 days until the election. This is today's State of the Race. The United States has never seen anything like this, an extraordinary court ruling that could upend the race for the White House. Colorado Supreme Court has disqualified Republican frontrunner Donald Trump from the primary ballot in that state. It cited the Constitution's 14th Amendment, which prevents anyone who engaged in insurrection from holding public office. But, this isn't the final word. Trump will certainly appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. And if it takes up the case, all 50 states could be affected. Now, Trump didn't mention the ruling on the campaign trail last night, but some of his GOP rivals definitely did. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRIS CHRISTIE, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I do not believe Donald Trump should be prevented from being President of the United States by any court. I think he should be prevented from being President of the United States by the voters of this country VIVEK RAMASWAMY, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: In elections, we can trust. Then we can believe it. That means, yes, unelected judges are not going to decide willy-nilly across the state who ends up on a ballot and who doesn't. NIKKI HALEY, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: But, I will beat him fair and square. We don't need to have judges making these decisions. We need voters to have -- make these decisions.

CNN Economics and Political Commentator, Catherine Rampell; Michael LaRosa,former Special Assistant to President Biden; former Republican Congressman Charlie Dent, and CNN Legal Analyst Carrie Cordero. Carrie, I want to start with you because this is in your wheelhouse and we need some guidance. You're looking at an unprecedented situation. The Supreme Court could very well play a pivotal role in this presidential campaign, not only with this case, but all the other cases that are on its docket right now. Looking at the merits of this 14th Amendment Section 3 claim and the composition of the court, what do you expect? CARRIE CORDERO, CNN LEGAL ANALYST, &amp; FMR. U.S. DEPT. OF JUSTICE ATTORNEY: John, it is a big question mark how the U.S. Supreme Court is going to rule on this case. I think we can absolutely say that it will end up with the Supreme Court. They will have to consider this. They will have to make a decision quickly, which is not the way that they normally want to work in such a matter of constitutional gravity. As the Colorado Supreme Court said, this case puts them into uncharted territory when it comes to constitutional analysis. But, the Supreme Court is going to have to weigh in on whether or not the presidency is an officer under the Constitution. And it's going to for the first time have to take up the issue of whether or not a former President can be disqualified, not get onto the ballot in Colorado, here in this particular case, because he engaged in an insurrection. So, just a case of historic significance and consequence.",

CATHERINE RAMPELL, CNN ECONOMICS &amp; POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, &amp; OPINION COLUMNIST, WASHINGTON POST: Look, I am not an expert in the law. It does seem pretty clear that if Donald Trump were not old enough to be President or not born in this country, all sorts of other things, he would be barred from running for election. Whether this meets the threshold of aiding and abetting an insurrection, I don't know. Certainly, as a layperson, it seems that way to me. I agree with the others on the panel, though, that the best possible outcome would be that he is rejected by the voters. And if Republicans are saying behind closed doors that they think this is yet more evidence that he does not belong on the ballot, it would be really nice if they said that more publicly, particularly the other candidates who are running against Donald Trump. We see them circling the wagons saying, oh, he should be on the ballot. He should be on the ballot, maybe. I wish that they had that same strength of character and spine to say, look, whether or not he meets the definition of violating this amendment, he should not be our President.

I will get your take. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) J. MICHAEL LUTTIG, FMR. U.S. COURT OF APPEALS JUDGE, FOURTH CIRCUIT: The 14th Amendment Section 3 is what we call self-executing, by that is meant that neither a finding by the Congress of the United States, nor a conviction for the crime of insurrection or rebellion against the United States. It is required. That's very, very clear. Those who would characterize this decision as political or politics from a liberal state Supreme Court are misguided. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Right. So, I think what Judge Luttig is trying to point out there is that there is not -- it's a reasonable way to read the Constitution andthis particular section of it to say that there is no requirement that an individual, for example, be charged and convicted of insurrection or seditious conspiracy or something that is that more grave charge that would form the basis. In this particular case, in the Colorado case, what there was there was a finding of fact by the district court judge, and the Supreme Court of Colorado actually showed that their standard of review of that factual finding that the former President did in fact engage in insurrection, and that the events of January 6 were in fact an act of interaction. The Colorado Supreme Court gives a lot of deference to the district court in making that factual finding. And so, then the issue of law, which I think Judge Luttig has a very reasonable and conservative interpretation of the Constitution, is that the section of the Constitution doesn't require that there actually be a trial. One of the issues that the Supreme Court of the United States might take up is the fact that the Justice Department did apparently look at former President Trump's activities because they have charged him with certain issues related to January 6, but they did not charge him with incitement to an insurrection. And they did not charge him with seditious conspiracy, which was one of the more serious charges that some of the other individuals who engaged in the actual violence were charged with. That might be one of the issues that the Supreme Court takes a look at. I think the bigger legal issue that they'll take a look at is actually the officer issue, whether the office of the presidency is an officer under the Constitution.",

Brooke, it's good to see you. We first met on the set of Real Time with Bill Maher some time ago before you were DA. I want to just run through some of these stats. As I mentioned, violent crime is down in the United States. Perception of crime, though, still a major problem. Under your watch, since you were DA, crime is actually down eight percent in San Francisco. But, in California writ large, crime has been on the rise.

We have a court injunction right now that's preventing us from forcing encampments to be removed from our streets in a lot of ways.

You know that -- I mean, in a very short period of time, Rudy Giuliani, when he was mayor, and Bill Bratton, were able to bring crime down a dramatic amount in a very short period of time, in part by focusing on these quality of life issues that are committed -- the vast majority of crimes committed by a small number of folks.

And we saw crime dropping notjust in New York City, but in cities around the country, as the economy strengthened. And those two things don't always go together, but they tend to correlate. So, I think just as you will see Americans shift their attitudes towards the economy, they also may shift their attitudes towards crime in the year ahead, for much the same reasons, the same underlying forces, that as there are greater job opportunities, as there is sort of more opportunity cost for committing crimes, you may continue to see that go down, and that may be felt increasingly by regular voters. The other thing that I would point out about local news, my own pet theory about this is that as local news stations, newspapers, TV stations, etc., have been hollowed out, it's not only a matter of like deliberate strategy to end up playing out more crime, but it's basically the easiest thing for them to cover, to just write up the police blotter. Essentially, that requires many fewer resources than having a lot of full-time investigative reporters, for example, on staff going out and pursuing other kinds of stories. So, I think it's not only that deliberate strategic change that we saw happen a couple of decades ago, and how news organizations covered this issue. I think it's a matter of survival for them that it's just much easier to write up -- again, whatever is in the local police blotter and to cover a lot of other things.

And two, at the UN Security Council, maybe right now, if there hasn't been another delay, but were soon, there will be a vote on this Gaza -- Israel- Gaza resolution. What will it take, or what does the United States need to see in such a resolution for it not to veto it? And if that can't be done and you end up vetoing it, are you not concerned that the number three priority that you mentioned in your opening, the coalition building, will be damaged, very badly damaged? The U.S. is already isolated internationally on this issue, and another veto, are you not concerned that another veto will further isolate you? Thanks.",

As you know, we wereinstrumental in getting the first humanitarian pause that facilitated the release of 110 hostages. Israel has been very clear, including as recently as today that it would welcome returning to a pause and the further release of hostages. The problem was and has been remains is Hamas. They reneged on commitments that they made during the first pause for hostage releases. And the question is, whether they are in fact willing to resume this effort. But, certainly, it's something that we would welcome. I know that Israel would welcome. And I think the world would welcome. So, we'll see what they choose to do. We remain very actively engaged in seeing if we can get a pause back on and hostages moving out again of Gaza. That's something we're on every single day. More broadly, I think what's important to always remember is that virtually none of the challenges we're dealing with are like flipping a light switch. And you suddenly get total success in the course of a day, a week, a month, even a year. It's almost always a process and a constant effort to get to a better place. We were talking about Ukraine a short while ago. Very important to put this in context. As I said at the outset, if you look at where we were in February of 2022 and where we are now, well, February 2022, when the Russians went in, most people were predicting that they'd make very quick work of Ukraine, and Putin would succeed in his goal of erasing it from the map, and subsuming it into Russia. That has failed. And it's failed, first and foremost, because of the courage of the Ukrainian people. But also, because of the leadership we provided in making sure with dozens of countries around the world that Ukraine had what it needed to succeed in repelling the Russian aggression. And now, we're engaged in an effort to help Ukraine stand on its own two feet democratically, militarily, economically, not only dealing with the current challenge that Russia continues to pose, but setting it up for the long term. And a lot of very important and good work has been done and continues to be done on that. Militarily, we have 30 countries around the world now that are helping, including the United States, that are helping Ukraine build a future force where they can deter aggression and defend against it if it comes in the future. We're extensively engaged on trying to bring much more private sector investment and activity into Ukraine, so that it can thrive economically. And we're having some real success there. And that creates a virtuous cycle.",
