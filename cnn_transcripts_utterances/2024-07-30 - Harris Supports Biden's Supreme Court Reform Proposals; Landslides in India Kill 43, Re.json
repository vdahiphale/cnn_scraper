And it's not just demonstrators casting doubt. The U.S. and regional leaders are also raising questions about the validity of the result and calling for election data to be released. The permanent Council the Organization of American States is set to meet Wednesday at the urgent request of nine Latin American countries. Venezuela is responding by expelling diplomats from seven countries, as Maduro had this to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NICOLAS MADURO, PRESIDENT OF VENEZUELA (through translator): How do you call this?

They did talk about this, they both agreed that Hezbollah was responsible.And from the readout, the Israeli side said that they provided evidence that they believe that Hezbollah was behind this. Now when it comes to the response itself from Israel, we have heard from the Lebanese acting Foreign Minister telling CNN, that they've had assurances from third party countries that the response would be limited, also hinting that the United States and France could be those -- among two of those countries that have given those assurances. Now the interpretation as we understand it from the Lebanese side, at least within the government is that that means that potentially the Beirut airport will not be hit, that southern Lebanon where there is a strong Hezbollah presence will not be hit, either. But we have been hearing from many countries urging their citizens to leave Lebanon at this point. Now, there is still commercial airlines to be able to take advantage of the U.S. European countries, both urging their citizens to leave. In fact, the U.S. said that if their citizens do not leave now, and the situation deteriorates, they must be prepared to shelter in place. They haven't though, said that they are planning to evacuate civilians at this point. And also, that the staffing and the security at the U.S. Embassy remains unchanged. Rosemary? CHURCH: All right.

The question is where will this attack take place and will it involve civilians? If they decide to target an area like the southern suburbs (INAUDIBLE) which is a large in the past used to be a Palestinian cap.Today, it's a mix between Palestinians and Syrian refugees and impoverished Lebanese. So, if they decide to attack a predominantly civilian areas -- area, then that is going to elicit a different response from Hezbollah than -- if it is a targeted attack an assassination or against the weapons they pull, et cetera. So, I think it really -- it really depends on what Israel decides to do. The question is, again, the response not only from Hezbollah but also from the allies of Hezbollah, i.e. the Popular Mobilization Forces in Iraq. The Houthis in Yemen, among others, will also depend on the extent of, you know, how severe the attack against Lebanon is. So, this is -- (CROSSTALK)",

Why is more effort not being invested in getting this deal done? Getting everyone to the table and figuring this out?I think there's a lot of effort that has been done, actually. And it's still ongoing. CIA Director Burns have just been literally been shuttling back and forth. And there are many other actors that have been involved in getting a ceasefire deal. There are two calculus here. One is Hamas's calculus. They would like to see a more permanent ceasefire. They're worried that if they release all the hostages and these hostages need to be released, then they lose kind of their trump card. But at the same time in Israel will just resume bombardment from the Israeli perspective, I think, which is where the biggest obstacle we've seen so far is that -- you've got a beleaguered Prime Minister and the government. A beleaguered Prime Minister, for whom war is a way to maintain his own political relevance, especially in light of growing discontent with his performance within Israel, amongst Israelis. But also, a government that is, as you all know, the most far-right government that Israel has ever had. And where the ultimate goal, as they keep saying is the destruction of Hamas, but as we're seeing more and more, is actually the destruction of any viable life in Gaza. And perhaps the, you know, ethnic transfer of Palestinians at the end of the day. What we're looking at is an area that has been completely destroyed almost. The casualties is just unbearable. The number of casualties, we're looking at many -- they're now talking about 40,000. But estimates are there at least 10 to 15 who are either under the rubble unaccounted for. People dying from famine, from injuries, from chronic diseases because they don't have access to medication.
