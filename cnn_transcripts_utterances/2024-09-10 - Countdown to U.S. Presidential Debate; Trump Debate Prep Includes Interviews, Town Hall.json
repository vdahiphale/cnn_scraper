But another key tactic here is going to be to try to get under the former president's skin, to try to needle him a bit and lean into these perceived insecurities. We know as such, because there is an ad out this morning, airing here in Philadelphia and also in Florida as well as on FOX News, the conservative news channel, to ensure that the former president sees it, poking fund at his obsession with crowd sizes.

And they know that the Harris campaign is expecting that. But they don't necessarily want that. As you mentioned, Becky, they want to have some of the attention and a lot of the attention I should argue be on Kamala Harris and let her try to explain herself and explain her policies. Now part of that means trying to have Donald Trump be more restrained. We'll see if he's able to do that, just given, you know, we have covered him for many years. I've personally covered Donald Trump for many years. It is not something that he is quite good at. He likes to veer off script. He likes to, you know, riff. We'll see what he does tonight. But as for specific policy areas, we did hear the Trump campaign in a call yesterday with reporters, try to walk through some of the attacks that he is going to lob at her and particularly their goal is to try and tie her to the Biden administration's record.

Of course, as Eva just laid out, she's going to try and distinguish herself in some way. So we'll see how that ends up playing out on the debate stage. But one thing I really want to drive home right now, Becky, is that, in my conversations with Trump allies, as much as they want to make sure that they can keep Donald Trump pivoting back to policy. Particularly the three policy areas we know that he polls better on it, the economy, immigration, crime, one thing that I consistently am hearing from Donald Trump allies and people close to the former president is that even more than on the substance, the concerns around his tone and his temperament. Whether he can keep his rhetoric in check, not be as aggressive, not go after and delve into the personal attacks on Harris. One person in particular said that they note that this is a completely different candidate than who he faced in June with Joe Biden. Harris is more popular now and she's also a woman and the subjects of some of those attacks can play very differently as well. So that's on the top of their minds tonight, Becky.",

In response though to all of the attention that this incident has received, the Miami-Dade Police Department, they released nearly two hours of body camera video capturing this encounter between Hill and the officers following a traffic stop. Hill was pulled over near the players' entrance at the stadium where the Miami Dolphins play. As you heard there right before me, there's this back- and-forth between Hill and one of the officers about the driver's side window of Hill's sports car. At some point, as you're taking a look at right there, they end up taking Hill out of the car and they later detain him. Now the officers eventually release him after giving him two tickets. A second Miami  Dolphins player who stopped to see what was going on -- remember all of this is taking place near the players' entrance to the stadium. Well, that player is also handcuffed and also later let go. A police union rep said that Hill was only detained because he was not cooperative and that he, again, was able to go after being issued these two tickets. Here now is Hill on CNN with my colleague, Kaitlan Collins, last night, hours after the video was released. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

These performances just get added into this giant pile of information.\" And another study looking at American debates through 2020 found the same thing. I think it's really clear that Kamala Harris has come out from under Joe Biden post the object debate and him handing over the sort of the baton. She's really ignited the Democratic Party. She had a successful national convention. But at the end of the day, with this being such a short campaign period, this is really important for her. Could this be the debate, the event, the night that really matters? For after all, we know who Donald Trump is. The American people know who Donald Trump is. They know less about Kamala Harris.",

We just went through an exception. The Biden-Trump debate was an exception which fundamentally changed the nature of the contest. Tonight, you're correct. I think there's less to know about former president Trump. Most voters know exactly who he is, what he sounds like, how he is in political competition and combat. So more of the pressure is on her, again, to show a little bit about who she is as a person; I think, more important than the substance of what she stands for and also to see how she performs. I mean, this is a vision of how will she compete in the political arena as president, facing someone like the former president? Finally, she doesn't want to make a big mistake.

You're saying you don't expect the impact to be significant at this point. I mean, are they up to encourage people to upgrade their iPhones, their older iPhones, for example? O'DONNELL:  Well, that was the number one question I had and many others had going into this event. I walked away saying, I don't think so. It was very interesting because, during the Apple event, we saw them more than once, twice actually, talk about trade-ins for older iPhones. Now in the U.S., you know, a lot of the carriers will do that. But to see Apple talk about that, to encourage those developments -- because the problem we have is iPhone 16 looks like the 15 and the 14 and the 13 and the 12. And people aren't feeling compelled. Now you know, as we said, iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, will be upgradable to have the Apple Intelligence features. And all the 16s. But some of these features, first of all, they're only going to be in U.S. English for the first several months. And oh, by the way, most of them are not launching for another month or two so there's no immediate need. It's not going to help in a lot of countries around the world. So that's impacting Apple as a global business. And I think some of the capabilities are interesting and I think people will enjoy them. And I will say, for the record, I think Apple did a better job of telling the AI story than we've seen from others. But at the end of the day, I don't know that it's enough to trigger, you know, what people call a super cycle, where a whole bunch of people upgrade.

And very specifically based in Ireland, where there is a real sort of cohort of tech companies, which are really helping support both the Dublin and Irish economy? O'DONNELL:  Well, I mean this is a historical issue. Ireland traditionally, it had a very low corporate tax rate for a very long time. And they're very eager to encourage tech companies to land there. And of course, they were successful. I mean, they're all there now. And so I think at this point, for Apple's, given the huge cash pile to have, this is a drop in the bucket compared to any big issues. They're going to continue moving forward. A lot of this is backward-looking, not forward-looking. So I think we're going to see it. It's a blip in time, it's a big win for the E.U. and their desire to have a little bit more control over tech companies that they feel are getting too much power. But at the end of the day, look, Apple's not going to pull out of Ireland. Other tech companies aren't going to pull out of there. They've established Ireland as a great place for tech. A lot of the tech workers are there. And so I just think this is something that moves forward but I think tech companies in general are going to have to be more cautious in the E.U.
