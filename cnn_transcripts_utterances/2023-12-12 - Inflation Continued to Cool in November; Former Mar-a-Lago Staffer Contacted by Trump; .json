Shelter still really that pain point.But the federal reserve is meeting today for their two-day meeting. They're going to be looking at this entire picture. This is the last piece of economic data that they're getting before they're going to make a decision whether to pause rates or hike rates. What they're seeing here is a continuing cooling trend. Will they be upset about shelter still being too expensive? Yes, probably. But is that enough to hike rates? Probably not. This is a good sign. We want to see a pause in rates, and then hopefully next year cutting of rates because that means mortgages become more affordable, student loan interests, auto loan, and anything that you're having debt on that you have to pay interest on, that hopefully will start to cool. So, this is a good report. It's a good report. And hopefully a sign that this trend will continue.",

And after he quit his job at Mar-a-Lago, just a couple months after the FBI search made public this investigation into Donald Trump and others, he gets a personal phone call from Donald Trump. So, the thing that was really unusual for him in that - in his position, Trump asking him, you know, why are you leaving the club at a time where it was quite clear that this person was a witness to several things, conversations and also had moved boxes at the club.And then after he had this conversation on the phone with Trump, got word back that Trump thought he was a good man. Now, could that just be some pleasantries from his boss as he's exiting his job, of course it could. But the timing was very interesting here. There were also a couple other interactions he had that he noticed, even close friends of his who eventually were charged in this case along Trump, talking to him about the lawyer that he was choosing, why wasn't he using a Trump paid-for lawyer for free, did he want tickets to a golf tournament, Trump probably would really like to see him there now that he didn't work at the club anymore, and also repeated reminders that he could return to his job at Mar-a-Lago if he wanted.",

And he failed to recuse himself there. The Supreme Court is basically a self-policing institution. And so it really is his own say-so, will he recuse himself or not. We've seen in the past that he hasn't. And so I would imagine that past is precedent here and that he's unlikely to do so now, even though we know a lot more about his wife's activities involving January 6th and surrounding that date.
