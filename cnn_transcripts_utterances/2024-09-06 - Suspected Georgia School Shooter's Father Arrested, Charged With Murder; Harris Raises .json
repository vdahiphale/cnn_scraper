He is charged with murdering two students and two beloved teachers at his high school less than 48 hours ago. Very soon, we will see him before a judge.His father has now been taken into custody too, charged as well in those killings. Colin Gray is the second father in the United States' history to face manslaughter charges stemming from a child mass shooter. The first was Michigan father James Crumbley, who was convicted after his son opened fire at Oxford High School, killing four people. Gray is, however, the first father now to be to also face second-degree murder charges. Let's get straight to CNN's Rafael Roma outside the court there in Georgia. Rafael, first, can you give us some sense of how this hearing for the 14-year-old will happen in the next hour?",

And as you can imagine, there's a lot of interest here, not only from the community and the state of Georgia, but a lot of media presence here this morning.Now, I have to tell you something, Sara, the suspect himself will not be here. He's going to appear virtually because right now he's being detained at the Gainesville Regional Youth Detention Center. But what we know already is that he is facing at least four charges, Sara, and the charges that he faces, of course, have to do with the horrific murders that happened Wednesday here in Winder, just about an hour away from Atlanta, northeast of Atlanta. And in a significant development overnight, Sara, we have also heard and got confirmation from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation that the suspect's father, Colin Gray, has also been arrested and he faces multiple charges. Let me read to you what he is facing now. The 54- year-old is now facing eight counts of cruelty to children in the second-degree, two counts of involuntary manslaughter in the second- degree, and another four counts of involuntary manslaughter. Now, why did authorities here decide to charge the father? This is what the director of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation had to say about it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And when you look a little bit deeper into these numbers the Harris campaign is releasing this morning, you're getting a sense of just the depth and the breadth of the fundraising. But it's also a sign of excitement and enthusiasm. Look at these numbers here, $361 million in August compared to the former president's haul of $120 million.Now, for him, that is slightly lower than the month before. But if you look at Harris' numbers specifically, $361 in August, but cash on hand. That is the key number here. That means she can spend that much money in the next 60 days before the Election Day. But look at that, since July, $615 million since she, of course, has become the Democratic nominee. So, that certainly is one more of the metric here that speaks to the enthusiasm. But one other thing, in August, 3 million donors, but 1.3 million of her donors were new donors, giving for the first time. You see the Trump numbers there as well that we just talked about, but these new numbers for Harris showing, look at these, 3 million donors, 1.3 first time donors. That means, of course, that they can almost certainly give again and again up until November. So, certainly, one more metric of the excitement and enthusiasm for the Harris campaign, John.",

ZELENYSo, what this money is being spent on is a different strategy. We're seeing the Harris campaign spending across the seven battlegrounds. The Trump campaign has trimmed its sails a little bit in terms of what they are spending. Again, money is not likely to be an issue for either side, but this is a sign of excitement and enthusiasm, and it gives the Harris campaign more options to spend more on T.V. ads, digital ads, and certainly building a grassroots campaign.

Trump's lawyers asked for that to be delayed until after the November election, saying that if the judge rules against them in their attempt to get the entire verdict thrown out based on the Supreme Court's ruling of presidential immunity, they say they won't have enough time to appeal that decision. So, they've asked the judge to push this off.The prosecutors have not opposed that request, saying that they defer to the judge.

And he certainly did. You're absolutely right. Sound the alarm bells in that meeting. He said that he was very grateful for the air defense weapons that the Ukrainians have got. Of course, a lot has been pledged. Some of those weapons have been received. But he also said that some of the things that had been pledged had not yet reached Ukraine.

We had one of the deadliest, in fact, this past week, when the city of Poltava was hit and the death toll there now stands at 55 people who have been killed and almost 300 who were injured, but also massive missiles attacks happening on Monday of this week as children were just going back to school here in Ukraine and the week before that as well.
