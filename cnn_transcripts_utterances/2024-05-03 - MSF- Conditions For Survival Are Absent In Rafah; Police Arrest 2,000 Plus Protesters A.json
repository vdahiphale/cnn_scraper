And does that devalue the meaning of the word which because it is a very real and dangerous thing? MILANICHAll of whom who upgraded onto campus they have suddenly discovered the, you know, the problem of Jewish safety. Well, I'd like to suggest that that's not actually what is going on. What's going on is that anti-Semitism is being weaponized by people who are hostile to the university, hostile to students, hostile to faculty, hostile to the values of inquiry, research, teaching, learning that are at the heart of the university. So I really see this as a Trojan horse. This is not just about the Middle East.

Keith Davidson, a Los Angeles lawyer who formally represented Stormy Daniels was back on the witness stand. Trump's lawyers trying to paint him as a lawyer with a history of extracting big money from high profile figures and directly asked if he was engaging in extortion. The defense pointed to a $2 million deal he secured for one of his clients from actor, Charlie Sheen. But Davidson refused to answer questions about the agreement, citing attorney client-privilege. Davidson was then grilled about his representation of a client who tried to sell Hulk Hogan his own sex tape. I did everything I could to make sure my activities are lawful, Davidson said. He acknowledged that his dealings with Hogan's representatives were under scrutiny from the FBI. They had an investigation. Yes, Davidson testified. Davidson repeatedly answered that he could not recall when asked about other deals which resulted in a testy exchange with a defense attorney who said we're both lawyers. I'm not here to play lawyer games with you. Defense Lawyers tried to tie Davidson's other deals to his monetary settlement for Daniels, suggesting that he was trying to avoid being accused of extortion Trump's attorney asked, one of the issues you had to be sensitive about was not to threaten that the payment needed to be made prior to the election. I don't recall that, Davidson responded. Trump paid close attention to his legal team as they cross examined Davidson, even turning his chair towards the witness stand at one point. Under questioning from prosecutors, Davidson admitted that he told Michael Cohen that Daniels would lose her leverage if Trump lost the 2016 election. He also testified to Cohen's chaotic state of mind in December 2016. Recalling a phone call with Cohen, Davidson said that he was very upset that he had not been chosen for a role in the Trump administration. I thought he was going to kill himself, Davidson testified.
