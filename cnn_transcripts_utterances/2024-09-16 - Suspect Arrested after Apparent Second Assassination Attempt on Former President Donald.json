Obviously, folks who are supportive of those troops being there say that they are critical to U.S. national security. They deter any aggression from North Korea or China in the region, particularly, of course, as both are growing more and more aggressive.But what the concern is now is when they'll actually get this agreement done. And I'm told by sources that there are talks ongoing right now that could actually conclude this agreement by the end of the year. That would be almost a year in advance of when they have to. And the major reason for that is former President Trump. South Korean officials particularly feel a sense of urgency to get this done before the end of the year, before the possibility that Trump wins the 2024 presidential elections. The reason for that is that during him his first term in office, it was a tumultuous cost-sharing agreement set of negotiations with the South Koreans. At the time, the former president was demanding that South Korea pay 400 percent more than they had been paying previously. And so it was a really challenging back-and-forth between two allies. The South Koreans want to get out ahead of it, put an agreement into place before the end of the year. We'll watch and see if they're able to do that. But some are warning that might not be their best move because they may be in the former president's line of fire if he does win the elections in 2024 because they've tried to fast track this.

Thankfully they did. But unlike in Butler, they did not pause. They immediately pulled their weapons and fired.

So the state's attorney was with us yesterday at the press conference saying were drawing up charges. We're going to ask for attention. But in Florida, possession of a rifle is not illegal. In Florida, possession of a concealed handgun is not illegal unless you are prohibited person, meaning you have a felony record. And we don't know what the disposition of his 2002 arrests for possession of a machine gun in North Carolina was.So if he doesn't have an illegal gun and he didn't fire a shot, and that's still up in the air, but its increasingly appearing that he didn't fire, the Secret Service fired when he pointed a rifle, then what exactly was the crime? So it's going to weigh heavily on his statements to them. What did he say he was doing? What did he say his intent was? What has he shared with them? In the meantime, the state should come up with some kind of holding charge, and the U.S. attorney is going to have to look on the federal side to say, what do we have to hang this charge on?",

But obviously that stands out.The other thing that stands out to me is an open question, and that is how did he know the president was going to be on the golf course? I mean, this is an individual that apparently has scouted it out. When you look at the map you see a roadway very close to holes five and six which it would make sense that that would be a location if you are going to try to take a shot. It would be closer and would give you an opportunity to do so and also give you an escape route, too.

But this is an individual that had planned this, was very cold and calculating. And so it's not surprising that his reaction would be like that.And again, to me, that points toward his involvement in this. And I'm sure that Secret Service, FBI, have probably already confirmed that he was the individual that was seen there. We have to remember now, a witness actually saw him leave that area and had to presence of mind to take a photograph of both the car and the license tag. So he's there. They can put him there.

The way the agents assigned to the former president yesterday reacted was exceptional. They were doing their jobs. They were out in advance a couple holes ahead of the former president.But the question then takes us back, as it did in Butler, Pennsylvania, to the planning of the outer perimeters and how much is enough for the former president. What I can tell you is a losing argument is he's a former president and this is all he's entitled to. That's not going to work. You don't sign up to protect the former president as the Secret Service and say, look, the threat level can only get so high, and this is all we're going to give you. That's not the reality of their mission. So they're going to have to constantly assess this threat both domestically and from foreign entities like Iran up the resources and planning here.",
