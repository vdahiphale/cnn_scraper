      "sentences": "Yes, that's right, Christine. And on any given day, we wouldn't be leading the new show with snow in Buffalo. But this one is different. This snowstorm has the potential to paralyze, actually using the word cripple, the city of Buffalo and a few other locations as well.The -- we go back to 2014, they had a similar snow event, lake-effect snow event. And there were fatalities associated with that just from buildings collapsing from the sheer weight of the snow. Now you can see we're not going to be measuring this in inches, we're going to be measuring this in feet, especially downwind of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. Yes, Michigan will be getting some heavy snowfall totals but I'm really going to focus in on Western New York because this is where the lake-effect snow warnings are in place. And this is currently where the heaviest snow bands are taking shape. You can see it lining up right here. That's Erie County where buffalo is located. I found this very interesting this morning. This snow band, the heaviest one dropping the 3 inch per hour snow rates is over 200 miles long, but it's actually only about 10 miles in diameter. So the exact placement of where this let's say, quote unquote, firehose of snow actually goes is going to determine who sees the heaviest of snowfall. And by the way those lightning strikes just south of buffalo in South towns. That is lightning, snow lightning. It just incredible to see what lightning snow and thunder during the middle of a snowstorm, right? Look at the snowfall, totals already upwards of 2 feet for Williamstown. It is the wind direction that is so crucial and that is going to determine who sees the most snow. Will it be just to the south of Buffalo? Well, that will be determinant on whether or not we have more of a west to southwesterly wind direction. However, as the winds start to back towards the southwest, we get more of a fetch along Lake Erie, that means more open waters, warm open waters to collect the moisture and produce that heavy snow as it deposits its own land right over the Buffalo region. As it stands, we currently have over 3 feet of snow just south of the Buffalo metro region. Watertown, you're in the bullseye, the crosshairs for the most snow. And, by the way, some of these colorings, Christine, breaking our color table over 36 inches. Never seen this in the history of my career.",

The United States, Canada, Japan and South Korea, Australia, New Zealand are the countries here in Bangkok that condemned this North Korean intercontinental ballistic missile launch, a highly provocative test of a weapon that could theoretically hit the mainland of United States.This missile traveled so far up six -- more than 6,000 kilometers, that's 4,000 or so miles up into space and came down near Japan in the waters that Japan claims as its exclusive economic zone. It did not go over Japan, unlike previous, you know, missile test by North Korea. But certainly, it is the type of weapon that North Korea is demonstrating because they want the United States to know that pretty much any city could potentially be within striking range, whether it be New York or Washington or Los Angeles. Most of the world, in fact, can be reached by a missile with this kind of capability. North Korea has launched some 50 ballistic missiles this year. And the countries that are not condemning them are permanent members of the U.N. Security Council that is China and Russia. They have veto power. And so, the U.N. Security Council has been able to put out these statements with Western countries allied together but China and Russia are basically staying neutral on this, which basically gives Kim Jong- un permission to continue these launches unabated, Christine.",
