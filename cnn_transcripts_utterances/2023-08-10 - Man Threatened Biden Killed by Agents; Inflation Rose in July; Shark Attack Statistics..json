FBI special agents shot and killed him in his home in Utah yesterday. A law enforcement source says Craig Robertson pointed a gun at the agents as they were giving him commands while trying to serve him a warrant, and that's when they shot him.This all happened hours before the president landed there in Utah. CNN affiliate KSTU got the video of the moments agents descended on Robertson's home. Watch. (VIDEO CLIP)",

Digging out my old Ghillie suit and clearing off the dust from my M24 sniper rifle. Welcome, buffoon-in-chief.\" Joining us now, CNN legal analyst and former Manhattan prosecutor, Karen Friedman Agnifilo, and Astead Herndon and John King, they are back with us too. You're new to the table, so let me start with you. It is - like these tweets and these posts are contemptible, but at least they have a heads-up. How is the FBI, their resources, are they keeping pace with the expanse of having to search for all of these. And, fortunately, they got to this one when they did.",

Given what happened in Michigan, given what happened on January 6th, anyone in position of authority and influence, including people in the news media, especially politicians, be careful. Look at the environment you're in. Accept your responsibility and act responsibly. If you didn't mean it but you saw some unintended consequence, then dial it back. Change it. Say, I don't mean violence, right? Tone your language down. We - we live in a polarized society. You see this slice of radicalization now. We used to think it was a tiny fringe. It's growing.

And he pitched the fourth no hitter of the baseball season. He needed 124 pitches to get that done and it was just his first start in front of the home crowd there in Philadelphia. You see here, after he got mobbed by his teammates, Lorenzen then celebrated with his family on the field. And that was his nine-month-old daughter June, lifted her into the air. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
