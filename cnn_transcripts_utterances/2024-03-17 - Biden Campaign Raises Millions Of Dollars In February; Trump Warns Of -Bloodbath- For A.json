We'll see if it happens there.

This morning, David Culver shares a glimpse into one of the neighborhoods affected by Haiti's gang conflict.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DAVID CULVER, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Neighbors protecting neighbors. That's essentially what this has become here in Port-au-Prince just to survive. And this is one community that we're in that feels rather safe. And that's just because several blocks out, you've got perimeter after perimeter that is set up by the community and works with the police. So the police essentially allow the community to do what they need to do to set up these blocks at entries and exits. And the community in turn helps empower the police so that they can then do their patrols. But for many of them, it's about setting these up to block what is not far from here, and that is an expanding gang territory. One that has been trying to encroach on this community in particular many times over the past year or so. And it got to a point where community members, according to one police commander, had to take justice into their own hands, and they were able to take into custody 14 suspected gang members. They then executed those gang members right in the middle of the street. It was a very public display, but for them, it was to send a message to other gang members to keep out of their community. It hasn't stopped the gangs from trying to push further and further in. But for the folks who live here, it's a everyday life has gotten increasingly difficult. We see a few street vendors, but not many. We were here three weeks ago. Many of the sidewalks were filled with street vendors folks. Now, simply don't have things to sell. And so they've resorted to trying to secure as best as possible using the police's help. Some of the supply lines trying to bring water and food into areas like this. I asked some of the community members, how is it that they're able to stay afloat. And he said, we rely on each other. Essentially, they will have some of these community members go door to door, collecting food, maybe some money, some water. And then that provides some substance for the folks who are securing these communities. If you ask who's in charge, they look around and they say no one. That's why they've taken matters into their own hands. If you ask what do you need, what can help Haiti in this moment, the first thing that most folks have told us is for the international community to not intervene in the way they have in the past. Instead, they want help in the form of aid. They also say that they need some sort of security backup. What that looks like, they didn't really articulate. Folks really didn't want to go into too much detail in trying to explain what that added security might come in the form of. But for most here, it's just about trying to figure out how to get to tomorrow. And knowing that tonight could bring another round of violence. David Culver, CNN, Port-au-Prince, Haiti.

There have been people pouring sort of dye, paint or ink, or antiseptic dye into the polling boxes, the voting boxes, to ruin the votes that have already been cast.

There's also been quite an interesting protest today on the last day of the voting, at midday local time across the various Russian regions. The team of Alexei Navalny, the late Russian opposition leader, called on people, urged people to go to polling stations at that exact time so they could see each other in a sort of, you know, in a way of sort of showing some defiance without actually breaking the very strict rules here. I can tell you, we were at one polling station here in Moscow and over the period of about five minutes around about 12:00, many people came out, maybe 150 people, maybe a few more came out at one time and formed a line to go into that polling station.

In New Mexico, the manhunt continues for a 32- year-old man who, authorities say, shot and killed a police officer who offered to help a driver in a disabled vehicle.Police issued an arrest warrant for Jeremy Smith of Marion, South Carolina, and say he's considered armed and dangerous. He allegedly shot New Mexico State Police Officer Justin Hare around 5:00 a.m. on Friday. The suspect is also linked to another killing of a 52-year-old South Carolina paramedic. And in Indianapolis, authorities have arrested 25-year-old Nicholas Fulk in connection to a nightclub shooting that left one person dead and five others injured. The shooting happened at a popular nightclub early Saturday morning where police arrived on scene to find five men with gunshot wounds. A sixth victim made his way to a hospital. Now, the incident is just one of 77 mass shootings that have happened here in the U.S. in the first three months of 2024.",

Those have now been decoupled.So, the seller's agents fee and the buyer's agents fee are now completely separate. And so, if you're a home seller, you should absolutely feel free to say to your agent, look, what are you charging? Why are you charging that? How much work are you putting into listing this house? And the same is absolutely true for buyers as well. Before buyer's agents would say, well, you know, don't worry about how I get paid. I get paid on the final sale of whatever house you buy. Now.

I think brokerages are going to be explaining to their agents that they need to be clearer with their clients about why it is that they get paid in the way that they do, or how much work that they do, as a reason for why they get paid. But I think -- I would caution again that I don't think these changes are going to happen overnight.
