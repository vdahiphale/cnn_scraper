Hint. It's not anybody named Trump. Tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\" So, Donald Trump, Jr. was the opening act today in the Trump family's quarter of a billion-dollar New York courtroom drama. He testified today in that civil fraud case against the foreign president's namesake business, and it went, well, maybe pretty much how you thought it would go. He testified that he was not involved in the preparation of his father's financial statements at any point in time, and you guessed it, he said, well, blame the accountants. Quote -- \"The accountants worked on it, yhat's what we pay them for.\" Now, Don Jr. and his brother, Eric, are accused of knowingly participating in a scheme to inflate their father's net worth, to obtain benefits like, you know, better loans or better insurance policy terms, and then deflating it when it was also convenient to do so. And while her brother was on the stand, the sister, Ivanka Trump, appealed to ruling ordering her to testify in that civil trial. And remember, she's supposed to testify next week, and she's saying, please, no. Eric Trump will have to file later on this week as well. And while the former president has quite a few cases in court right now, this is the one he has been in the room for. Remember where he hasn't appeared. Think E. Jean Carroll. Think other court appearances and other jurisdictions. But this is the one that he's appearing in and is going to be testifying likely as early as Monday. So why this one? Why is this the one? Remember, he already left New York, relocated to Florida. Why is this the case he wants to appear in? Well, maybe because it hits him exactly where it hurts. Remember, his reputation, his business, they're really intertwined. And in fact, some would say whether the business led to the presidency or the presidency will then fuel the business, chicken and egg might be coming a bit of a story. And here it all is happening in his hometown of New York City. Joining me now, former Trump attorney Tim Parlatore and litigation attorney A. Scott Bolden. Gentlemen, I'm glad you're here tonight because, look, of all of the -- has a Casablanca theme -- of all the bars in the world -- (LAUGHTER) I won't go into the whole thing right now, but I love the movie. He is focused on that particular courtroom. That's where he wants to be. This is where he has taken the greatest umbrage about being accused of fraud. But let's just be honest here. First of all, there's already been a summary judgment motion. The judge has already said the documents are fraudulent. Now it's about how expensive it's going to be for him. When you look at this case, you've been his attorney in counsel in the past, why do you think this is the case that's so important to him?",

So, he hasn't had to go after his father yet.I do think that Eric and Don as well as Donald Trump, Sr. are going to have a problem on cross-examination or rather direct examination if the AG starts to ask them about what they know about what Eric did, what Ivanka did, or what their father did. That could put them in a conflict piece but, still, I don't see them invoking the Fifth Amendment because, um, they don't want to draw an adverse interest from this judge who has found that these were fraudulent documents.

Over the last three weeks, there has been rising antisemitism around the country on college campuses (INAUDIBLE) Cornell. I think there's something about these threats that are manifested in part of this culture of antisemitism. But what I tell students is be proud. The response to antisemitism is not to hide Judaism, but it's to stand together, to be proud, to affirm your Jewish identity. This Friday night, we are going back to 104 West where the kosher dining hall is.

We're committed to educating Cornell about antisemitism, about its history, and about ways of fighting antisemitism. I think at the core is to fight hate with light, with affirmation, with coming together, and to stand strong. It will take weeks, it will take months, but I think we'll be able to turn a corner.

I covered him then.And so, there are many who just love him. And the players who played for him also, you know, obviously praise him and say that he changed their lives. There's that side. And the other side is the man who, I could think of five or six things alone that I've read or remembered over the last couple of hours, Laura, that would have been fireable (ph) at any job in the country today and probably even in the last five years.

So, you think about him and he really was a fixture and an icon of a generation that is no longer around.

So, you know, that would not obviously be acceptable in our society today, and I think that, of course, that is absolutely correct, that it should not be acceptable in our society today. COATES: I mean, the characteristic of an abuser of players is one that many would take some umbrage to given -- and they will remember, frankly, the wins.
