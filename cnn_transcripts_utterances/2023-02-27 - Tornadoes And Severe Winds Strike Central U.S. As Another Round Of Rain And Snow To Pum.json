PETE BUTTIGIEG, U.S. TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY: The President is taking a personal interest in this situation from early on, and I wanted to make sure he knew about what I saw on the ground, both in terms of the administration response and that's something that has been really well coordinated where our department comes in really is transportation policy, making sure that in this moment, with so much focus on what happened with this derailment that we are acting, both to hold Norfolk Southern accountable and to make sure that we do more to prevent all derailments.",

Russian forces, primarily from the Wagner mercenary group appear to be making games claiming that they have taken several villages to the north of the city in an attempt to encircle it. Ukrainian forces say that they are standing their ground in the face of intense Russian assaults. Now, this fight for Bakhmut has evolved over time from a longer range fight with artillery and tanks and mortars to something that is much closer quarters urban warfare, the fight going from house to house and street to street. For now, there is no talk from Ukrainian officials about surrendering the city but President Zelenskyy's stance on that has softened recently saying that they will not defend it at any costs if it means that everybody is going to die. Meanwhile, U.S. officials now publicly warning that China is actively considering sending lethal aid so weapons to Russia for use in Ukraine.

[01:20:00] So we found kids making Cheerios, chewy bars parts for GM, Fruit of the Loom socks, J. Crew shirts. It's just everywhere.

AILA: Well, these are just such incredible important reporting. And they certainly comport with my experience as an immigration advocate and child advocate. In the 1990s, I started my legal career advocating for migrant children in San Francisco, many of whom were trafficked or exploited. But the situation has now changed more than 25 years later. And as Hannah said, more children are coming from Central American countries in particular, fleeing from violence, persecution, criminal cartels, and poverty. And that number has more than increased by 10 times in just the past decade, since, let's say, 2012. The other major phenomenon here is that U.S. efforts to block people from getting humanitarian protection, including asylum is forcing more children and families to seek assistance by smugglers bring them into the country. And oftentimes these children arrive, and they are in debt. And they have to seek work to pay off that debt.",

And they had been working maybe with their parents at a farm after school and sort of thought that that is what they were coming to. And then I mean, I've talked to kids who would meet somebody on Facebook would say, Oh, if you come up here, I'll take care of you. They would show up, in one case, a 14-year-old showed up in Florida, and the man the government had released him to said, No, actually, you have to go find your own apartment. And guess what you owe me $4,000. So you'll be working at a restaurant every night until 3:00 a.m. until you pay that back. And other kids come up. And they're just completely on their own, or they're living with other children, you know, in a house. I talked to a 13-year-old boy in Michigan who works on an egg farm. And he says he would love to go to school. He thought that he would be able to buy it's so expensive in this country.

And there are investigators who are making sure to go after people who exploit children and break the US labor laws.The other aspect of this is that children who are in these situations need to be protected from the fear of being deported out of the country. Because if you're afraid that you might be deported on the country, what happens is you're going to be too afraid to report labor law violations. And you're going to be unable to take advantage of the protections that U.S. labor law provides. Actually, the Department of Labor and Homeland Security have set up protections for adults and children so that if they are in that kind of situation, they can get protection, and the fear that they will be deported is much less because they can get protection from that deportation process. So that's a critical element. But they have to go hand in hand. You have to -- both the labor law violation investigation, but also protection from immigration deportation.",

I thought it was going to be so subterranean. But actually, my experience was, I would go to a town and by the next day, usually, I would be talking to a child who is working in violation of child labor laws for a big company.So, I can't tell you what's going on there. Companies are often, you know, protected, because there's a manufacturer and often a staffing company between them and the child who was hired. But we found kids who, you know, their lungs were burning because they were making Flaming Hot Cheetos all night, or they were spending 12 hours bent over a machine in a sock factory. Like I said, making socks for Fruit of the Loom. Some of these companies like Ben and Jerry's are acknowledging that there are children in their supply chain. And their take is it's better for kids to work for us, where at least some minimum labor laws are followed, then to not be able to work for Ben and Jerry's, or Ben and Jerry's supplier and have to go work at some other worse situation.

But because as Hannah was describing, in such compelling detail, the number of these children has increased in the past many years, the Health and Human Services Department is cannot cover and provide protection for all of them.One thing that is so critical is that these children needs social workers and lawyers to advocate for their needs on a daily basis, as well as for their protection, because they are so extremely vulnerable. And they won't know what kind of labor laws protect them to begin with. They don't understand English, most of the time, we're have very limited English, and certainly won't understand the complexity of U.S. labor law. Our current U.S. law does not guarantee these children lawyers to represent them, and to look out for their interests. The other thing that I'll just say that so important is that we have to make sure that the U.S. humanitarian protection system is available to children and families, and the fact that in recent years, particularly under the Trump administration, but it's continued under the Biden administration, we've seen more restrictions being placed on asylum, and on humanitarian protection, it makes it harder for people to get the kinds of legal protection, they need to be able to stay here.

And a lot of them would qualify for work permits if only they had lawyers. There's really no reason for them to be working the most dangerous, you know, the most illegal jobs.

It started when two Israeli brothers were fatally shot on Sunday in what a local settle leader calls a terror attack.That shooting sparked revenge attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinians. Officials say at least one Palestinian man was killed, more than a hundred wounded and several homes and buildings set on fire. Well, the attacks erupted on the same day Israeli and Palestinian officials reached an agreement to try to reduce violence. CNN's Hadas Gold reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

The Israelis had agreed to essentially stop settlements for a few months while the Palestinians would commit to not issuing any sort of actions against Israel in the United Nations. They also agreed to meet once again in March ahead of Ramadan in Egypt, but then just soon after these joint statements came out that were agreed upon by the officials there from all the different countries, we were getting statement from Israeli officials seemingly contradicting what had been announced at that summit. The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying that construction and regulation in the occupied West Bank will continue, and that there will be no construction freeze. Then his minister of national security Itamar Ben-Gvir, he is one of the most right wing members of this new right-wing government tweeted out something that essentially said, what happens in Jordan stays in Jordan, essentially, pushing back against this agreement that Israel would stop settlements, considered illegal under international law, but Israel does not agree with that assessment, that there would be any sort of stop in settlement activity, some thing that's so important to many members of this right-wing government. And then as night fell, more violence in the West Bank, specifically in the area where the attack took place, seemingly might be called revenge attacks by Israeli settlers, we know that at least one Palestinian man was shot dead, Palestinian officials say it was the result of clashes with settlers, and Israeli forces, but clearly the situation on the ground only worsening, and many people are not necessarily optimistic that whatever the officials came to agree in Jordan will have any sort of immediate effect to help calm the situation here in the region.
