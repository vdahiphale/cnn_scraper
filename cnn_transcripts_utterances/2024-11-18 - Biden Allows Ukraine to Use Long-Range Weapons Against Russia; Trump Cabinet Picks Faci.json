      "sentences": "Sixty-three days until president-elect Trump's inauguration, and his transition is moving forward at breakneck speed.And speaking of whiplash, eye-popping revelations about his most high- profile Cabinet picks have Washington in a tizzy. There's also his TRUTH Social post from the wee morning hours today confirming Trump's plans to declare a national emergency over illegal immigration and use the military to assist in the mass deportations, like he promised throughout his campaign. Trump appears impervious to the backlash against his Cabinet picks, even as some could face an uphill confirmation battle in the Senate. Trump's newest administration pick is Brendan Carr to head the Federal Communications Commission. Carr is currently an FCC commissioner and authored a chapter on proposed changes to the agency in Project 2025, that controversial Trump tried to distance himself from during the campaign. CNN's Kristen Holmes is joining us now. So, Kristen, tell us a little bit more about this FCC pick and just where things stand overall. KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, he was appointed to the FCC by Trump in 2017. He is considered the senior-most Republican and really a shoo-in for this position. But the thing to keep in mind here is, he's not just an ally of Donald Trump. He's also an ally of Elon Musk's. And it is likely, or at least possible, that he could help him with some government contracts, particularly when it comes to Starlink. Now, just to give you an idea of what Carr is going to be focused on, this was a quote that he put on Twitter right -- or -- excuse me -- X right after he was named. It says: \"We must dismantle the censorship cartel and restore free speech rights for everyday Americans.\" The reason why this is interesting, it's something we have heard time and time again from the president-elect as something he cares about, essentially tech companies censoring people, particularly when it comes to Facebook. He's brought that up or Instagram. But, again, this is an ally of his. But the real thing to watch here is something that we reported some time ago, my colleague Steve Contorno, when he did a deep dive on people who are still advisers to Donald Trump or in his orbit writing those different proposals for Project 2025. He was one of them. And with this same idea that Donald Trump tried to distance himself from so many of these proposals, clearly, here, he is linking up with someone who was the author of an entire section about the FCC for Project 2025.",

There's been a lot of knife-fighting, I am told, particularly on this part of Lutnick, who ran the transition. They are still working out how this is going to play out. One thing to keep in mind is that Lutnick has been close to Trump for a very long time. So, clearly, some people are trying to handle this entire situation with kid gloves. We will see when we actually hear about that post.",

      "sentences": "Yes, so this all comes out of civil litigation in Florida.This is a lawsuit that was filed by one of Gaetz's associates. The congressman is not a party to this litigation, but the lawsuit went after both another one of their friends, but also the girl who was underage when she allegedly had sex with the former congressman. And as a result of this litigation, they did discovery. They engaged in the process of creating a whole new record of evidence, including depositions with some of the women who were at these parties, including also that girl who was allegedly underage when she had sex with the congressman, though those depositions of the underage victim and the other women, those are under seal. But the lawyers involved in this case were kind of clever. They took some parts of her deposition that's under seal and incorporated portions of it into their questions that are publicly available in the docket. So they referenced, for example, that she said in her deposition that she had sex with Gaetz on an air hockey table. So the lawyer asked specifically, he said -- quote -- \"And you heard her testimony that she said that you observed her and Matt Gaetz having sex on the air hockey table.\" So there he's putting her deposition right before -- part of it in his question. So the person being asked that denied that he saw it, but the lawyer also notes that the friend of the underage woman who brought her to the party that they were talking about testified that she too had sex with Gaetz at the same gathering. Now, the reason this is relevant to the Ethics Committee report is that we know that the Ethics Committee has spoken with many of these same witnesses. They have also gotten access to a lot of the evidence that was gathered in the civil litigation. And, again, this is a flavor of what they have collected. Now, the congressman has, of course, consistently denied wrongdoing.",

And the decision is going to be about whether or not to go ahead and release this report.Even though he is now a resigned member of Congress and even though the speaker of the House has leaned on them not to release a report, they can still go ahead if one Republican were essentially to vote with the Democrats. This is a narrow, evenly divided panel. So, it would require one member. But given the amount of pressure that they're under, it's unclear whether or not they would actually do that. Johnson has maintained that the reason why he is -- that they shouldn't release it, because he said it would breach protocol. Typically, he says this does not happen for members who have resigned. But there is precedent for people who have resigned both in the House and the Senate to see their investigations by the Ethics Committee come out afterwards in a form of reports. So we will see which side they ultimately come down, but no doubt about it there is a ton of pressure on these Republicans, because, on the Senate side, there are a lot of Senate Republicans who say they want to see this before they cast a key vote.",

They're trying to protect not only the subjects of these Ethics investigations, but also the witnesses. Because remember, at the heart of the Gaetz investigation is a group of pretty vulnerable women who were perhaps preyed upon by much more powerful, wealthy men in the state of Florida. I have talked to some witnesses who were interviewed in the Justice Department probe and for the Ethics probe. They don't want the report released. They don't want to drudge all this up again. That's part of why they don't just leak information. They wouldn't talk to us about their investigation. But there is an enormous amount of pressure on them politically to release this, so lawmakers can assess whatever evidence they have gathered as they decide whether or not Matt Gaetz should be the nation's top law enforcement official.",

This is a move that the White House previously resisted, fearing thatit would escalate the conflict further. But Moscow has now deployed 50,000 troops to push Ukraine out of its Kursk region in the south, where Kyiv launched a surprise counteroffensive this summer. There are also thousands of North Korean soldiers who are among the troops there supporting Russia's efforts. And the Kremlin says Biden's decision is showing that his administration wants to -- quote -- \"throw oil on the fire.\" The U.S. responding by saying it was Russia who ignited it in the first place.

We now expect that these long-range missiles known as ATACMS will be used primarily in the Kursk region that you were just mentioning in Western Russia, where Ukraine had made some strongholds and hopes to hold on to that territory to bring Russia to the negotiating table for an eventual peace deal. How and when these weapons will be used, neither side will say at this point. They don't want to give away the game on the battlefield. But, just today, U.S. Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer said that the U.S., they believe, is on stronger footing on the world stage than four years ago, even as he acknowledges inevitable changes coming forth with a new administration that could change tack on everything from Ukraine to Israel, just the general relationship with the world under the new administration. President Biden himself nodded to that when he spoke from the Amazon rain forest yesterday, saying no one can undo his legacy on climate in particular. And he echoed that message when he was speaking to leaders and their delegations from the G20 here in Rio earlier today. Here's what Biden said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's quite unprecedented. But I don't know what the overarching strategy is for NATO and the United States moving forward. Look, conditions on the ground change. Ergo, policies will change. And, clearly, with the effort by Russia now going against the Kursk region and the application of possibly 10,000 North Korean troops, we will see how that plays out, certainly will alter the determination in terms of what needs to be done.
