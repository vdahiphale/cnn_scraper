      "sentences": "And a reminder it also includes about $45 billion in aid for Ukraine as well as disaster emergency relief money.And worth noting as well, this is likely the last time we will see House Speaker Nancy Pelosi presiding over a vote as House speaker. Of course, she will not be in Democratic leadership when the new Congress starts in January. And right now, it is brutal outside. For millions of Americans as a historic winter storm creates chaos and upends travel coast to coast. And the cold is preliminarily staggering out there. A massive chunk of the country feeling subzero temperatures. Look at those. Blizzard conditions so bad in parts of North Dakota that visibility there is practically zero. And in the south, people are scraping off cars as the ice and cold now turn deadly. We know at least three people have been killed in the state of Kentucky. And in Memphis, Tennessee, dangerous ice and now rolling blackouts are under way as power outages across the nation spike. We want to take you to Memphis now. Jeremy Pierre, from HBQ, is joining us live from there. Jeremy, I see the car behind you going ever so slowly on that road that looks like it's covered in ice. JEREMY PIERRE, REPORTER, WHBQ-TV: Yes, let me tell you for most parts of the morning we have been seeing people spin and lose control on these streets, But thankfully we began to get some sun in this area, which has resulted in melting a lot of the ice on the roads. But just down the way here, this is Highland we're on in the east part of Memphis near the University of Memphis. It's a lot of ice and it still remains, And people are taking it easy now that the sun is up. But let me tell you something, we are now listening in on a press conference with our power provider here, Memphis Light, Gas and Water, and giving us an update on rolling blackouts. And they have paused them, and that's according to the Memphis, Light, Gas and Water in Memphis. That's extremely good news for people who live in several counties here in west Tennessee, including us here in Memphis, because of the freezing temps we are experiencing right now. Now, MLGW leaders have asked customers to turn off all nonessential lights and appliances. The rolling blackouts have affected millions in this area, including water pump stations, sewage, treatment plants, hospitals and airports. The Tennessee Valley Authority is the power supplier for several utility companies here in west Tennessee. TVA asks power companies to scale back on usage due to this critical power supply situation here during these freezing temps. The blackouts would have been for every 30 minutes twice a day until further notice. But, again, those blackouts, those rolling blackouts, we're receiving word from Memphis, Light, Gas and Water, they have been paused. And as the ice continues to melt, hopefully people will continue to take it easy on that gas pedal and pay very close attention on these icy roads -- Jessica?",

Hopefully, the sun helps thaw things out before it goes down,Jeremy Pierre, in Memphis, Tennessee, thanks for that update. Fierce winds are also whipping snow in the northeast. Places like Buffalo getting pummeled and Pennsylvania about to get hit. Tom Lehman, from CNN affiliate, WGAL, sent us this report a few moments ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TOM LEHMAN, REPORTER, WGAL-TV: Hey, Jessica. The winds have been picking up over the last few hours, but the temperatures have certainly been dropping as well. Right now, we are seeing just about any wet surface begin to freeze over, ice forming, especially after we saw a lot of rain and snow here in south central Pennsylvania over the last 48 hours. And you can also see the wind is blowing trees right now. This is certainly an issue, especially for anybody who is driving and might find themselves coming across garbage cans or other debate getting pushed into the roads by these heavy wind gusts. To try to show you how hard these winds are gusting, if you look in the distance, you can see a banner above the street. That banner is beginning to get pulled off its bearings. Certainly a concern for any drivers that are going to be coming through here. And, again, the wind and the cold, these are conditions that have been worsening over the last few hours here in Harrisburg, Certainly a concern for anybody who is walking around, also for people who are driving. Especially as the day continues to develop, a freeze up could potentially cause a lot of issues for drivers around here. And, again, the temperatures are already cold. They are continuing to get colder. This windchill also a major issue as well -- Jessica? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

If you look at the weather maps this afternoon, it basically encompasses most of eastern Canada, eastern half, or maybe two-thirds of the United States. With the circulation all the way down into the Gulf of Mexico and parts of Florida. It is a large and dangerous storm system. The Arctic air mass advertised well in advance. The Prediction Center's outlooks over two weeks ago, indicating for the potential for it to spread across the United States right around Christmastime right on schedule. The low-pressure system associated with the cyclone is also very intense and was forecast very well and well in advance, indicating blizzard conditions from the plains to the northeast and that's what we're seeing unfold.",

They're not seeing much in the way of severe weather associated with this system. But almost everywhere else you look, there's some extreme weather going on. Even in the Pacific Northwest, there's a lot of icing going on. Some real problems out there in the Portland area. I do think that we are probably close to the peak of this storm. However, the impacts are going to last several days. Especially for parts of western New York, we're looking at three to four feet of lake-effect snow. Blizzard conditions will not end any time soon. The cold will begin to let up across parts of the south right after Christmas day. It looks like as we go into the beginning of next week thing also warm up across areas that are currently seeing freezing temperatures.",

But Miguel has been turned away at the border several times and says he doesn't want to go through that process anymore.

Right now, there are six Republicans who are voting in the affirmative. Less than, of course, other votes that if their Republican leadership had gotten behind it. In short, its passage. But this bill was almost three months overdue and was supposed to have funded the government by September 30th. They couldn't reach that deadline. So they punted it and punt it again and cut a massive deal unveiled a couple of days ago, and now jamming it through Congress to get it on Joe Biden's desk. But do have the votes to do that.

CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich is joining us now with details. Vanessa, how is it impacting last-minute deliveries? A lot of people wait to the last second and do the overnight shipping. VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS &amp; POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely. If you procrastinated on ordering your Christmas gifts and expected them today or tomorrow, they are likely going to be delayed. And that is because every major U.S. shipper is reporting impacts from this storm. So the U.S. Postal Service is saying that they've had to close temporarily 89 locations, mainly in South Dakota, North Dakota, Nebraska, Minnesota, and Iowa. FedEx is reporting major impacts to their hubs in Memphis and Indianapolis. UPS says they're having impacts because of the storm in Kentucky and Illinois. And Amazon is temporarily closing down some sites in impacted areas, which we could assume is probably in the Midwest. One thing that these shipping companies are asking you to do is to be patient because they are trying to get everyone their Christmas gifts in time, but the main concern is for their employees' safety. So really patience is key here. You're going to get your gifts, just maybe not in time for Christmas unfortunately -- Jess?",
