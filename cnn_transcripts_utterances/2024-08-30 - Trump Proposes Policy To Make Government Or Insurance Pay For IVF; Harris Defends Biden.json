It's about getting as many votes as possible in a place like Pennsylvania where the race is a tossup too close. And when it comes to that, that means, in terms of messaging for voters to go out and vote any way that they can, the reason why I bring that up is because just up here on this jumbotron that you can't see me above here a short while ago, it's on a rotation, at what point it was telling those here in the arena, here at the first summit arena, to vote any way you can. And that means, voting absentee, that means mail in voting as well.And as you'll recall, it wasn't that long ago that the former President said himself, he had expressed opposition to mail in voting in that interview that he did with Dr. Phil saying that mail in ballots should not be allowed.

I'm old enough to remember when he said on a key Sunday morning show at the turn of the century, he is 100% pro-choice on abortion.Ever since then, we know what he's done and why he's done it. I think it's fair to say it's not on the basis of principle, but that's true for a lot of politicians on a lot of issues. This is really a major problem for Donald Trump and for the Republicans. They got what they want. The dog caught the mailman. And now, just doesn't know what to do with it. And they're finally at that stage.

The question is, what kind of intensity of support? Now, in places where it is threatened where IVF is threatened, I would think the intensity would be there. But it can't substitute for the more general question of reproductive rights.So the Republicans are trying to clear away that one piece of the abortion dilemma that they're facing. That may help them to some degree, but it doesn't get rid of the bigger problem, which is focused on the turning over of Roe v.

The economy had crashed. In large part, all of that because of mismanagement by Donald Trump, of that crisis. When we came in, our highest priority was to do what we could to rescue America. And today, we know that we have inflation at under 3%. A lot of our policies have led to the reality that America recovered faster than any wealthy nation around the world.

Finding the economy is the top issue for voters and that Trump wins on the issue 53 to 45. What more needs to be done to alleviate voter concerns?REP. ROBERT GARCIA (D-CA): Sure, I think -- first, I think some of those same polls are also showing that Vice President Harris is actually leading in vast majority of those states. And so her numbers are actually increasing as she's solidifying her support. And so I think what voters are saying is, one, the economy, of course, is important -- and the economy is important. And I think that obviously, she's addressing that. I think her home ownership proposal, I think, is part of that. But I also I think voters are saying that overall, they trust the Vice President to move the economy forward and not take us back. And I want to just go back to something the Vice President just said in your clip. She came into office with President Biden during the height of the pandemic, the single largest casualty of life. We lost 1.3 million Americans. The economy had crashed. So that recovery has taken time. There's still more work to do, but we don't want to go back to the chaos and mismanagement of Donald Trump.

She made very clear years ago during the 2020 election and a little before that, she made clear that she supports fracking as a way of energy production in this country. So I don't think that's an issue anymore. People can have different perspectives, change their perspectives over time, but some -- but her values have always been consistent.

Wade backwards and eliminated that right for women.And so he has bragged openly about how he supports the decision and what the court did. And so it is comical that Donald Trump would talk about women's reproductive health in any way that is serious when it is he who has lauded the Supreme Court for their actions, for what is happening right now across the country that is moving us backwards. His own party has come out strongly against IVF. He is basically going around the country now trying to play cleanup for a mess that he created, and, by the way, has continued to stand by every single day. And so Donald Trump is a liar and a conman. We know this already. His actions should speak for his record, and that is that, he has moved our reproductive rights for people in this country, women in this country, backwards. And Kamala Harris, of course, is going around the country fighting for a woman's access to abortion and IVF. And that, we'll continue to see throughout the campaign.",

As vice president, nobody in the country fought harder for reproductive rights before the road decision and after than Vice President Kamala Harris. And so we're going to continue to see this be a central issue of the campaign.
