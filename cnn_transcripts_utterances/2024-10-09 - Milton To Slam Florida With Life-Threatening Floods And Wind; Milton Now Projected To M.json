We just got a new forecast from the National Hurricane Center, and it is projected to make landfall just south of Sarasota, Florida. It's currently packing winds of 145 miles per hour.At this hour, the outer bands are already wreaking havoc on millions, producing large and dangerous tornadoes like this one in Broward County this morning. These tornadoes are expected to continue throughout the day. The storm is rapidly changing, and this is important. It makes it unclear exactly which part of Florida will be hit the hardest. And officials are warning conditions will be, quote, unsurvivable, and the window to evacuate is about to close. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): You still have time to evacuate. Time is running out. If you make that decision now, I think you'll be glad you did.",

We are on South Shore Drive here in Sarasota. A kind resident was willing to loan us his backyard. We're keeping an eye on his boat for now.He's not sure if it's still going to be here when he gets back, because they are expecting a 10 to 15 -- potentially a 10 to 15-foot storm surge here, which is about double the size of the storm surge that we saw for Hurricane Helene here in this area. And you can see here all along the water. There are a bunch of homes. They're boarded up. They have their hurricane shutters up, or they have plywood on their windows. That's because most people were smart enough to evacuate this area. They did heed the warnings. If you drive around Sarasota, it is real quiet, pretty much like a ghost town. We spoke to one woman who told us how she was going to ride out the storm on the ninth floor of a condo building in downtown Sarasota. This is after her husband rode out Hurricane Helene in their home on one of the barrier islands off Sarasota, Siesta Key. You can't get to those barrier islands right now, and you can't get off those barrier islands right now because they closed the bridge. But she did tell me how her husband got up to five feet of water. It was up to his chest in the home. He had to swim to safety in the dark of night to higher ground in order to survive that storm. So, it has been quite an experience for people, which is why the mayor of Sarasota told me that her greatest concern is the storm surge. She's also worried that people did not evacuate the barrier island. She said that people need to have at least a week's worth of water, a week's worth of food. She's very concerned that the storm will be so bad, Dana, that the first responders won't be able to get to those people who need them most. So, we will continue to watch the conditions as they deteriorate here, Dana.",

I think the storm surge now, here we're looking at a 12-foot storm surge. 140 mile an hour winds and the winds are dangerous. The fast-rising water is very dangerous. Some of the barrier islands here in Sarasota and south of Sarasota, our homes and buildings can be swept right off the foundation with those winds and that high water.

Then this evening, around 5:30, the president will deliver remarks on the response and preparations for Hurricane Milton, as that storm is barreling ever closer to Florida's west coast. It comes at a time when the administration has been working to preposition resources in Florida in anticipation of this storm, that includes FEMA and Coast Guard swift water rescue teams, which also can bring with-it high-water rescue vehicles and other airlifting materials to try to get to people in need in those communities. They are also sending in power teams, as there could be widespread power outages after the storm. There's other things like debris removal that they're focused on, as well as pre-positioning and being ready to deploy up to 20 million meals and 40 million liters of water. It comes at a time when the administration is also battling misinformation about the federal government's response. That is something that President Biden has said is a key concern for him. But at this time, they are trying to stress to those on the ground in Florida that they need to listen to those local warnings, heed these warnings as they are expecting. This could have very devastating consequences on the state of Florida when Hurricane Milton hits and in the aftermath.",

And I think that where Priscilla was talking about how it's informing some of the strategy is important, but it's also important to remember the polling from back in 2016.Obviously, there was a very big issue with polling back, they're not capturing that would be Trump voter, whether they were not picking up the phone or they had a general distrust of pollsters. And while some of that still exists, pollsters have tried to recalibrate the data. But this time eight years ago, Hillary Clinton was up by 12 points over Donald Trump. She had 50 percent, Trump had about 38 percent. And so, when you look at these polls that showed that Harris and Trump are still within the margin of error, and you compare it to 2016, that right there is one of the main reasons why you have that anxiety. And then there's the other fact that she wasn't battle tested in the primary. She was asked about this on 60 minutes. But it's still a source of contention or consternation rather, within the campaign. Because while they have a massive polling team that's conducting their own internal numbers, they don't have exit polling from the primaries, which is really voters explaining the rationale behind real activity. Not this is how I'm likely to vote. This is what I'm thinking right now. It's -- I went to the ballot -- (CROSSTALK)",
