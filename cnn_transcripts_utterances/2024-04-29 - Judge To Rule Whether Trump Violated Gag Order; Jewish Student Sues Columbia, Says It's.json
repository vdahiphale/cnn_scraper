So, it'll be interesting to see when the judge chooses to determine whether or not he is in violation. But in the meantime, it does seem to be having somewhat of an impact on Donald Trump. He is getting -- he is de-escalating his rhetoric in his comments. So, it is having an impact one way or another.",

I think Trump has successfully framed this to enough of his electorate, as you know, an unfair targeting of him that you know, these intermediary steps probably will not have a big impact. And as I said, you know, the Supreme Court seems determined to protect him from a trial before the election on the most important allegations to voters. And that's why I think the impact of this case will be less from the specifics, then from in effect that generic, which is are -- if he is convicted, are Americans willing to make a convicted felon their president? There's polling that suggests there is resistance to that idea, but we'd have to see when -- if and when we get there.",

Columbia University, as you know, has been the epicenter of the nationwide college protests over the Israel-Hamas war and the civilian casualties in Gaza. Let's go back to CNN's Omar Jimenez.

      "sentences": "Yes, Wolf. We're following a lot of developments. For one, an anonymous Jewish student has now filed a lawsuit against Columbia University alleging that it is now a campus not safe for Jewish students in particular. Saying \"It has become a place that is too dangerous for Colombia's Jewish students to receive the education they were promised.\" Now in particular, it takes issue with the university's decision to go to a hybrid learning model last week, as they said that safety was a number one priority, and amid the encampment-led pro-Palestinian protests that we have seen on campus for almost two weeks straight now.Now, all of that comes as the university is now setting a 2:00 p.m. Eastern deadline today for students to leave the encampment or face suspension, at the very least, ineligibility to finish the semester in good standing. And as the university announced that, student protesters are now rallying folks at least on campus to show up beforehand and to not leave what -- by that deadline. So, we're going to continue to monitor how that plays out as we get, you know, in the next few hours now. At this point, negotiations between student protesters and the university had stalled as we found out this morning. And, of course, that's significant because with graduation in a little bit over two weeks from now, it really has put the university in a position where they are saying definitively, they will have a commencement, implying that they plan to have this encampment resolved in some way. We do not know which way or what that resolvement -- resolution will look like. But we are at least starting to see the beginning portions of it now, Wolf.",

And that was one of the things that the student protesters had been asking for as well as part of that divestment to essentially sever at the very least decreased ties with partner universities in Israel that have partner programs back and forth there.So, with the university making this commitment, they will not divest from Israel, essentially putting a stamp on where the negotiations have finished or at the very least stalled from the university's standpoint that does not appear to be going away. But obviously, it puts the students in a position to either clear the encampment, face suspension, or we will see what comes after that, Wolf.",

We need to make sure that more trucks are able to flow in. This should be a very simple solution. If Israel allows other entry points, all of this time, we can bring enough trucks to make sure that everybody is fed, that everybody has medicine, that everybody has access to water. World Central Kitchen obviously, we have 64 kitchens with community organizations plus one more on our own. We have a plan to build a total of a hundred kitchens all the way to the North. But in order to fulfill all the food needs that those kitchens need to keep making sure that every kitchen is a hub to feed the people surrounding that kitchen, we need a constant flow of food, constant flow of water. And this unfortunately is not happening. Sundays has been the case that no track has reached into Gaza and that puts us behind. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
