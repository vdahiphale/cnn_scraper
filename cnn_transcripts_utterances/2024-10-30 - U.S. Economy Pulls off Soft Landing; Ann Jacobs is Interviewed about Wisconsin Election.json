Trump posting on his Truth Social this morning, Pennsylvania is cheating and getting caught at large scale levels rarely seen before. That is despite officials in Lancaster and York County saying they're still looking into potential issues with voter registration applications, and they were the ones that caught it, as they normally would. County and state officials are trying to reassure voters this will be a free and fair election.Joining us now is the chair of the Wisconsin Elections Commission, Ann Jacobs. Thank you so much for being here this morning. I know this is an extremely busy time for you and the staff there. I do want to ask you what you are hearing, what accusations of potential voter fraud are already coming in to you and how are you combating it?",

And some of them are just really bizarre conspiracy theories. One of my favorites was that in 2020 there was a secret room in the elections offices where an unknown man was sleeping under the desk but printing 60,000 ballots. That's one of my favorites. Here in Wisconsin, because we process our absentee ballots, because some communities process their absentee ballots at a central location, those numbers won't be reported until very late on election night or early the next morning. And some folks are claiming that's a sign of fraud when actually it's just a sign of how we do things here.",

So, when folks in Wisconsin go to vote early, they're actually filling out an absentee ballot at their clerk's office, and it goes directly to the clerk. As a result of that amazing turnout, it looks like we're going to have a lot of absentee ballots to count on election night. I suspect it will not take quite as long as 2020 because we don't have some of the Covid concerns that we did have then. However, I would expect that you're probably not going to see final tallies coming out of Wisconsin until very early in the morning on November 6th.",

He won it in 2016, but he lost it in 2020.The guardrails we have in place is repeating to the voters out there that we know what the process is going to look like on Election Day. We know about the time when results are going to come in. So, rather than indulging in fantasies about bamboo ballots or Italian thermostats controlling our elections, they can go to our state elections website and look up the FAQs we have on some of those topics.

But it's getting a lot of attention, these statues here in the nation's capital, just a week out from Election Day.So, the one you're seeing on your screen, that was the first statue that suddenly appeared last week. This bronze replica of Nancy Pelosi's desk on the National Mall, right by the Capitol. And you can see on it there that basketball-sized - I'm going to call it a swirl, John. A basketball-sized swirl on it. And there's a plaque at the base of it that says, quote, \"this memorial honors the brave men and women who broke into the United States Capitol on January 6th to loot, urinate and defecate throughout those hallowed halls in order to overturn an election. President Trump celebrates these heroes of January 6th as unbelievable patriots and warriors. This monument stands as a testament to their daring sacrifice and lasting legacy.\" If it's not clear, it's a sarcastic message, poking fun at the former president. So then on Monday, another statue pops up. This one at Freedom Plaza across town, right by the White House. And that, as you can see, is of a tiki torch. It is titled \"The Donald J. Trump Enduring Flame.\" And there's a plaque on that one that says, \"this monument pays tribute to President Donald Trump and the, quote, very fine people he boldly stood to defend when they marched in Charlottesville, Virginia. While many have called them white supremacists and neo-Nazis, President Trump's voice rang out above the rest to remind all that they were, quote, treated absolutely unfairly.\" And, John, a lot of people - we were there yesterday, crowds of people taking photos, getting a lot of enjoyment out of it. The tongue-in- cheek messages really resonating with people as we approach Election Day. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
