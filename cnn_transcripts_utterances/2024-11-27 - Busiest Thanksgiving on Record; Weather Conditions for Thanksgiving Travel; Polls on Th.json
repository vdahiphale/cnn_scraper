When you consider that this is the busiest holiday travel on record, that is the holy grail of holiday travel. Here at O'Hare alone and at Midway, those are the two Chicago area airports, there are going to be at least a million and a half people pouring through these two airports over this holiday weekend. Today is going to be busy. Sunday is going to be the busiest day. They're thinking 254,000 people coming through O'Hare alone. So, when you take all of that into context and you consider the weather pattern today is good, the cancellations are pretty minimal, this is an absolutely perfect, perfect holiday travel weekend. We talked to a couple of the folks out here, John, just to get a sense of how they're thinking, how they're feeling about everything and their tips for getting through this very busy holiday weekend.

This is - this is a perfect example of the skies right now over the busiest airport hub in America, Atlanta Hartsfield Jackson Airport. This is downtown and midtown Atlanta. I snapped this picture actually just about 20 minutes ago. But you can see all the contrails of the various jets flying overhead. It's busy out there. People are traveling. Very active. And we've got green across the board. That means - green means go, right? West Coast to East Coast. The only roadblock is this storm system that's developing and deepening across the nation's midsection, particularly into Colorado. It's brought some hefty snowfall totals that have brought snow to the foothills and into the mountains, and even Denver International Airport reporting some snowfall. But it's quickly winding down there. But where it goes from here is what is so incredibly important. So, a snapshot of what's happening now. The eastern seaboard, no problems in terms of the weather. But let's fast forward another 12 to 24 hours when things change drastically. What a difference a day makes. Hope you're ready to settle in with a gravy and your relatives because we've got rain in the forecast for this Thanksgiving along the coastal cities. But snowfall for the inland communities of northern New England. So, plan accordingly. This will usher in the coldest air of the season. And these lakes, they're still warm for this time of year. So, cold air over warm water means lake effect snow machine kicks into high gear later this week. Check this out. The tail end of the storm system has the potential for some stronger storms. Heads up Birmingham today. Atlanta tomorrow. As you're settling down for that Thanksgiving feast, you could see some stronger thunderstorms roll through. And in terms of how much snow we can expect across the Hudson Valley into the higher elevations of New England, anywhere from four to eight inches of snow in this forecast. Winter storm watches already posted for this area. Hey, John, I hope you're prepared. Rain on Thursday for your Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade special. But I know you can handle it.

These companies, Ford, Stellantis, General Motors, all import car parts and cars fully assembled from Mexico, Canada and China. And that is why a 25 percent tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico and a 10 percent tax on imports from China would have a significant effect on car prices. So, for viewers at home, if you own a Tesla Model 3, a Ford F-150, which is America's most popular car, parts of your car are made in Mexico. Also, fully assembled cars from Mexico are coming across. The Chevy Blazer, Chevy Silverado. So, all of these cars are really, really reliant on trade from Canada and Mexico. And why is that? Is because it's simply cheaper to make these cars and parts in those countries. Wages are much lower and currently there are no tariffs in place. We have free trade with Canada and Mexico. That's something that President Trump actually negotiated under USMCA. So, folks at home might be saying, well, why don't we just move production to the U.S. if it's ultimately going to be more expensive to make these cars in Canada and Mexico? Well, we simply don't have the capacity for that. Also, remember, labor here in the U.S. is much more expensive. Right now the U.S. is trying to stand up 16 semiconductor facilities. The only problem with that is it takes three to five years to get those going. And, ultimately the U.S. - the big three automakers have not commented on these tariffs. I imagine they're watching them very closely. But, John, the markets have responded to these tariffs. All of the auto stocks were down yesterday, including General Motors, down about 9 percent, because investors are nervous. What is this going to mean for these companies. Ultimately, this could push more pressure onto the used car market if new cars end up costing more. We saw used cars very, very expensive over the pandemic. That could soon happen again if these tariffs take effect. Obviously, that's inflation. Something that Americans don't want to deal with.

Was he talking about the fact that she wanted to build three million new homes with housing tax credits, or was he talking about the child tax credit or the earned income tax credit? I mean I - the economic policies that she laid out were - were numerous. And she was the one who actually put forth policy plans. She put forth policy plans for African American males. She put forth policy plans for Hispanic voters.So, I mean, I find it really troubling when people want to have a policy discussion. The fact is, more people know what was in Drake's lawsuit against UMG, and they've actually studied that more than they studied Kamala Harris' policy proposals on social media. So, I don't really want to hear a conversation about she should have put forth more economic policy proposals when that was not the issue in this race at all.",

Do you think the gains, the support that Donald Trump saw among young men just kind of to this conversation, do you think it was Democrats lost them, lost young men, didn't speak to something, or Donald Trump and Republicans did speak to something? LANCE TROVER, FORMER SPOKESPERSON, DOUG BURGUM 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: I think it's pretty simple. I think that - let's be honest, I don't think Kamala Harris was that great of a candidate. I think - I don't think she had an ability to connect with people the way Donald Trump has an ability. Love him or hate him, he speaks normally. He's not a robotic politician. Whether you like or dislike what he says, he speaks normally. And, yes, but it wasn't just men who went to his side. It was African Americans. It was Latinos. He spoke to a broad swath of this country because he speaks normally, and he articulated a vision for this country and moving forward. And I just don't think we saw that out of Kamala Harris.",
