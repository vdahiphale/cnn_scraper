This despite back-to-back name fumbles last night, President Biden introducing Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and calling him president Putin. The president did catch himself and correct himself. But then he referred to Vice President Trump when referring to Vice President Kamala Harris. The presser was generally notable for the president's knowledge of foreign policy and also continued stumbles, and perhaps most glaringly apparent denial about the state of his campaign. And while last night's Q&amp;A with the press was far from a debate like disaster that would finally put an end to his campaign, this claim, when asked about Vice President Harris, stuck out.

He is expected to spend a little over three hours in the state making his case to voters. And tonight, Jake, we are learning some new details from inside that private call President Biden had with members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Our colleague, Annie Grayer, reporting that one of the lawmakers on that call, Congressman Mike Levin, directly told President Biden he needed to step aside in this race. It's believed that -- or at least as far as we know, that is the first time a sitting lawmaker has said that directly to President Biden. Now, a source who was briefed on the call said the president responded by saying that he knows that he needs to get out there in front of people, does show that he is moving well and healthy and a short while ago, campaigns communications director Michael Tyler told reporters that he -- they are aware of the anxiety within the Democratic Party, that is why President Biden will be engaging with lawmakers, with voters, trying to make his case that he is up for a second term.",

So going above it is a good thing. Were urging allies to get to that 2 percent and go beyond that. We will carry out a strategic review referencing your point about the number of troops. Because it'll be a strategic review looking at the capabilities we have, looking at the risks that were facing and assessing strategically what we need to do and defense. The reason were doing that now is because there's as you will appreciate, quite a lot of information not available to the opposition, only available to the government of the day. That's quite right. I don't grumble about that. So we're currently strategic review. We're absolutely committed to the 2.5 percent within our fiscal rules, and we'll set a roadmap for getting there. But I'm not going to do is set arbitrary targets because I think that's unserious. And we're very serious about that. 2.5 percent. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

I said no were going to do it in one parliamentary term, but we got to be ruthless. We've got to be steely. Were going to change the labor party, got to turn it inside out, and make sure that it's a part of that always says country first and party second.Now, true it is that the government of the last 14 years has been falling apart. But we've seen plenty of examples in history where a conservative government has been failing, and yet, a Labour government hasn't been elected. And it was only by changing the Labour Party, that we were able to persuade the electorate to elect us into govern. And with a very powerful and strong mandate, we won in parts of the country we've never won in before, places that had a conservative MP for 100 years. Now, in relation to the second part of your question on the economy, it has been broken. We haven't had economic growth for 14 years. We've had a low growth, high tax doom loop, if you like. We're going to break that, but we're going to break that with economic growth. And that's why already our chancellors been out days after the election, taking tough decisions on planning, on infrastructure, setting up the sort of bodies, the national wealth fund that we will need, the investment partnerships that we will pursue to get that economic growth because we do want our public services to run properly, our NHS, our health service is on its knees. We intend to fix that, but our number one mission, if you like, the driving purpose of this government is going to be economic growth measured in living standards raised and people feeling better off.
