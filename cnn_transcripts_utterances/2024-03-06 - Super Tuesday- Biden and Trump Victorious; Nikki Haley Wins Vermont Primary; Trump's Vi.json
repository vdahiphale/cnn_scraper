The race for the White House is inching closer to a rematch between Democrat Joe Biden and Republican Donald Trump. Yes. Here are the latest states' reporting results. In delegate-rich California, CNN projects a win for Trump. There you go. So too for Biden.But a small prize on a big night for Nikki Haley. Trump's only still standing challenger. CNN projects she will win Vermont's Republican primary, where 17 delegates were at stake. Despite that win, Trump is establishing a commanding lead in the delegate count over Haley. A short time ago, Trump delivered a confusing victory speech where he criticized President Biden and his immigration policies. He also lied about his own four years in office. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: They call it Super Tuesday for a reason. This is a big one. And they tell me the pundits, and otherwise that there's never been one like this, there's never been anything so conclusive. This was an amazing, an amazing night, an amazing day. It's been an incredible period of time in our country's history. It's been sad in so many ways, but I think it's going to be inspiring because we're going to do something that, frankly, nobody's been able to do for a long time. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The next couple of weeks, you should expect them to expand out their campaign operations in places like Michigan, Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Nevada, states that they believe are high- priority battleground states. Now, we've seen a lot of polling that shows Donald Trump ahead in some of these states, but they are not taking any of this for granted. They do not believe that every single poll is completely accurate. They believe that every vote is going to count and that any kind of rematch with President Joe Biden is going to be incredibly close. So that's why you're seeing them start to build out this operation now. They also know that their candidate is incredibly polarizing, so that's something they have to work on. Now, one of the things that I've been told by a senior advisor they were willing to look into tonight is looking at some of the data sets and seeing how it could shape some of their strategy in these battleground states, particularly when you're looking at states like Virginia, not quite a battleground state that more leans blue, but states like North Carolina, which, again, leans a little bit red, but is still considered a purple or battleground state. The other part of what you noticed tonight from Donald Trump was the fact that he stayed on message for Donald Trump. This is what his campaign advisors and what his allies want him to continue to do. Not mentioning Nikki Haley, not going off into any rabbit holes, but instead focusing on immigration, the economy, and the general election. He even talked about unifying the party. Now, of course, Donald Trump does not have a good track record when it comes to unifying the Republican Party. However, this is exactly what his campaign, his allies want him to continue to do as they head into November.",

But, you know, Trump is hoping for it to start this general election now. But, you know, let's see. It's you know, he's got -- he still has a little bit of a base problem.

And so that's going to be something that the Biden campaign is certainly going to be focusing on as they start to put together their coalition.I know that everyone is talking about the bad poll numbers for Joe Biden. But let's remember that all of the energy and all of the mobilization up until now has been on the Republican side because they're the ones who have had this crazy primary. Let's also remember that the polls aren't necessarily always right. At this moment in 2020, I just pulled up a New York Times headline that said Joe Biden supporters are not enthusiastic. He could very well lose in November in 2020. And let's remember that the New York Times, also the same poll that is now showing Donald Trump ahead, was the one who was predicting this huge red wave in 2022. So, things change pretty quickly. A lot of times what people tell pollsters is not actually how they vote. I think what the biggest thing and indication of Democratic enthusiasm and how they actually see this election panning out in terms of the big stark contrast between somebody like Joe Biden and Donald Trump is the massive amount of money that the Joe Biden campaign has been able to pull in, $132 million, John. That is a record amount of money for a president going into his re- election campaign at this moment in time, while the Donald Trump campaign and the Republicans are sucking wind. Then you have the special elections where Democrats have been massively overperforming. Those are two indications that are a lot more real and a lot more substantive than anonymous polls.",

Well, he's winning over slivers of a little bit more of the support that he's gotten before, which is significant and something that the Biden campaign should certainly worry about. And they are. And they're focusing on trying to make sure that that doesn't happen, which is why you just heard President Biden saying, saying what he said. But, John, I think it's really important to point out that moving into this election, this is exactly what the contrast is going to be.And I think one of the biggest points that the Biden campaign needs to continue to make is to make sure that the American electorate is not sleepwalking into this dictatorship, using Liz Cheney's famous words, because it is easy to forget what somebody did four years ago because people are so into their everyday lives, of course, as they should be. And so, this campaign, the Biden campaign, has got to be in the business of every day reminding voters what a Donald Trump presidency was and, importantly, John, what a Donald Trump presidency would be if he is allowed to get anywhere near the Oval Office again. One of the gifts I think that Donald Trump has given us, the Democrats, is that he has not been shy about saying what he would do with another presidency. He would put together mass deportation camps, deport the 12 million undocumented immigrants. He's already said that he would let Putin do whatever he wanted to our NATO allies if, you know, dare they not pay what they need to pay into NATO. This should bring shivers down the backs of all Americans and, frankly, everyone around the world. And that kind of contrast between somebody who has been steady, who has brought back the economy, who has been decent, who has focused on making sure that Americans have what they need not just to survive but to succeed versus somebody who is going to bring back chaos, criminality, confusion, cruelty. That's the contrast I think that's going to win Joe Biden the day in November.",

Two key Russian military commanders, both functioning in the Black Sea area, issued arrest warrants by the International Criminal Court. Two of them both accused of being involved in attacks on civilian infrastructure, and essentially the damage that has caused to the civilian population, essentially killing innocent civilians here.The warrant points to two individuals, Admiral Viktor Sokolov and another man, Lieutenant General Sergei Kobelyush, both of whom were key commanders in the Black Sea. The warrant suggests during the last couple of years, while much munitions fired against civilian areas were initially originating from the Black Sea, the warrants have been used to kill innocent civilians. The Black Sea fleet itself, though, targeted by Ukraine over the past hours. The Ukrainian intelligence service suggested they managed to take out a patrol ship called the Sergei Kotov that cost $65 million, they said. Another example of how Ukraine has begun to project its force into areas that Moscow would normally have considered to be its safe territory. These outlying suggestions of Ukrainian strategic success. It comes at a time of extraordinary trouble for Ukraine here near the Eastern Front where I'm standing. You can hear the distant rumble of explosions far away from me. Really, Ukraine is struggling to hold the defensive line. It said it would be able to maintain after it pulled out of the town of Avdiivka about two weekends ago. Avdiivka had been fought over for months, and Ukraine said that it had voluntarily pulled back. It gave up a number of villages in its retreat, and it said it would hold another three villages. Those villages themselves under significant Russian repeated persistent assault. Russia was able to throw extraordinary resources at these particular objectives, and Ukraine, I think, on the best of days, struggling to suggest that it has that fight calmed entirely. It's significant because if we do see Russia continue to put pressure on Ukrainian front lines around me here, there are minimal signs that there is another back defensive line prepared for Ukraine to be able to hold. And so we are dealing with a very complex time for Ukraine at this moment. They're able to project success in the Black Sea, yes. They even suggested in the recent days they hit a bridge 500 miles inside Russia. President Volodymyr Zelensky said they took 15 fighter jets out of the sky in February alone. They are doing things that nobody felt they could do at the start of the war. But the one thing they're not able to do right now is hold key parts of the Donbass front line because they haven't got the munitions they need from the West. And that is because of the holdup in Republican-held Congress. No sign of that changing at all. And we hear from Ukrainian fighters here on the front line here that is simply a matter of life and death until that changes. And already the resurgence of Russia is changing the front line calculus daily. Nick Payton-Walsh, CNN, eastern Ukraine. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

CORREA-CABRERA: Well, Donald Trump is, of course, not telling the truth. Fake news, and the thing is that he's benefiting from the politics of fear. And Republicans are repeating this narrative of the politics of fear. They're benefiting from that. That has become very important, because it has been, you know, the -- the, the discourse has been amplified by a lot of protagonists (ph) that they all have made this conscious effort to present this situation. The politics of fear work in this country. And Democrats will be in the defensive, not in the offense. And everybody is going to be targeted towards the same direction in the end, even though nobody is talking about the truth. Nobody is, you know, solving the situation in the United States, and nobody is going to solve this equation. The immigration system in the United States is broken. The asylum system is broken. We're not dealing with the root causes of this problem. We're not fixing this problem.

In fact, the opposite is true.One study from Stanford, which was updated in January, found immigrants are 60 percent less likely to be incarcerated than all U.S.-born men; 30 percent less likely to be incarcerated relative to white U.S.-born men. Princeton a few years earlier: \"We observed considerably lower felony arrest rates among undocumented immigrants compared to legal immigrants and native-born U.S. citizens and find no evidence that undocumented criminality has increased in recent years.\" Utah State University concluded back in 2019, \"a legalization program for undocumented immigrants reduces crime rates. A large-scale legalization program, which is not currently under serious consideration, has more potential to improve public safety and security than several other policies that have recently been proposed or implemented.\" So in other words, everything Donald Trump is proposing to solve, what is for the most part, a non-existent problem, could actually potentially create that problem and make it a very real issue. CORREA-CABRERA: With regards to security, it's again, the politics of fear. Immigrants don't bring crimes to the United States. It's just a spectacle. It's a border spectacle, an immigration spectacle, and it just, you know, appears in electoral times. It's just to win voters. There are problems. To have a system that works for everyone -- for the United States, for immigrants -- there are jobs available in the United States. Somebody has to perform those jobs, and those jobs there are no legal pathways to -- for these migrants to occupy these jobs. You're going to have a number of people with -- being in the United States irregularly, illegally. You're not going to have control. You're going to create problems. You're not going to solve the situation that will -- that helps the United States, which is fixing the immigration system that is broken, and the asylum system that's not working for those that really need to receive protection. So generating other problems. But with regard to security, immigrants don't bring insecurity to the United States. It's -- it's a fact. Data show it. And it's just like fake news.

Kristie Lu Stout live in Hong Kong with more details about this year's annual gathering. You know, they're crucial every year, but then they kind of like -- thes day to go through the mechanism, the motions. So I guess, you know, when we talk about that economic growth level of 5 percent, they make the announcement. Do they have a plan to get there? KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR/CORRESPONDENT: That is the key question, and that is what is weighing on the minds of investors and on the markets. In fact, like the price of oil fell nearly 1 percent on Tuesday with China's very ambitious growth target top of mind. That's been weighing on sentiment. Given how China is the world's largest oil importer. And yes, it set that ambitious growth target of around 5 percent as it seeks to transform its growth model. As we heard from the Chinese premier, the Chinese government said that it will stabilize and expand consumption. It will diffuse property risks. It will cut wasteful spending by local governments, et cetera. But no major stimulus measures were announced. And analysts fear that China may have a plan, or rather, China may have a target, but doesn't have a plan here. [00:45:06] In fact, this is one analyst that UBS says. I'll just bring it up for you. He says, quote, \"The growth target is OK, but the missing part is how they want to achieve that. What sort of stimulus is unclear for now,\" unquote. Now, we've learned that the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, he just met with local officials from Jiangsu (ph) province, who are there for the National People's Congress in Beijing. And he reiterated China's plan to transform the economy. But he also said this. Let's bring it up. This -- words from Xi Jinping that just came out in state media today. He said, \"Developing new quality productive forces\" -- that's a new buzzword -- \"new quality productive forces does not mean neglecting or abandoning traditional industries. It is necessary to prevent a headlong rush into projects and the formation of industry bubbles,\" unquote. Xi wants to avoid bubbles. You know, that would mean excess capacity. That would mean wasted investment. But investors, what they want is a clear economic roadmap from China. China is, of course, the world's second largest economy. It is under immense pressure. There's the property crisis. There's weak consumer spending, deflation, high youth unemployment. The list goes on and on. Now we may hear more details this afternoon, about 3 p.m. local time in Beijing at a press conference. Some senior officials are going to be there, including the central bank governor, along with China's commerce minister, finance minister, its top securities regulator. And we're waiting to see if we're going to get any details from that event. Back to you.",

The Germans, for their part, say that the conversation did deal with Taurus missile, and then it dealt with the specs of the Taurus missile and how many of those missiles would be needed to destroy the Kerch Bridge. Obviously, the Germans saying that they did not plan to attack the Kerch Bridge. All this, of course, comes as Germany has been talking about possibly giving these Taurus cruise missiles to the Ukrainians.",
