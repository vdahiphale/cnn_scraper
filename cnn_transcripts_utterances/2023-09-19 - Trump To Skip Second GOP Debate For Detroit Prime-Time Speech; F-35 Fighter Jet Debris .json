      "sentences": "Well, just like the first GOP debate, former President Trump plans to skip the second one, too. It's scheduled for next Wednesday at the Reagan Presidential Library in California. Instead, Trump plans to head to Detroit to give a prime- time speech to more than 500 workers, including current and former members of the auto workers union. Of course, it's the union currently on strike.We're also learning this morning the Trump campaign has produced a radio ad that will begin running today in Detroit and Toledo, Ohio to align the former president with those autoworkers. The campaign is also considering the possibility of having Trump make an appearance at the picket line. Joining us now is the writer of \"Very Serious\" newsletter, Josh Barro. And CNN political commentator and former special adviser to President Obama, Van Jones. Van, I'm fascinated by the economic elements of what's going on between the Big Three and the UAW right now. But I think the political elements are enormous and that is rank and file union workers have not been as aligned with Democrats since the emergence of Trump as they traditionally have been. And this is a moment that creates potentially an opportunity.",

We are told the pilot was able to eject safely and taken to a medical facility.But somehow, the military struggled to find the actual jet, even going as far as asking the public for help. Congresswoman Nancy Mace said what many were thinking. Quote, \"How the hell do you lose an F-35? How is there not a tracking device? And we're asking the public to what -- find a jet and turn it in?

One of those outposts is in the Central African Republic.

Less than one month after their boss Yevgeny Prigozhin was killed in a plane crash, mass mercenaries still guard the president and cut an intimidating figure on the streets of the capital. Faces covered, as Wagner protocol dictates, they are unapproachable and untouchable. These are the first images of Wagner fighters in the country since Prigozhin's death. WARD (on camera):  It's clear they still are very much a presence here in Bangui. WARD (voice-over):  That presence runs deep. The markets are full of cheap sachets of vodka and beer made by a Wagner-owned company. The locals seem to like it. WARD (on camera):  (Speaking foreign language). They say they don't drink French beer, only Russian beer. WARD (voice-over):  We've come back to the center of Prigozhin's empire in Africa right as his death raises questions for the regimes he protected and the mercenaries whose loyalty he inspired. Our last visit was in Wagner's early days here -- run like the mafia, providing guns and fighters, and propaganda in return for gold, diamonds, and timber, using intimidation and brutality along the way. WARD (on camera):  That car full of Russians has been following us for quite some time. We don't know why. We don't know what they want.

Those who remain, including his top lieutenants, have agreed to work for the Russian Ministry of Defense. Fighters have already been pulled back from front line outposts to population centers in an effort to cut costs, the source says. What's less clear is what becomes of Wagner's civilian presence here. This is one of the last places that Prigozhin was seen alive during his final tour across Africa. It's called the Russian Cultural Center, only it has no connection to Russia's official cultural agency and was run until recently by Prigozhin's closest associate here.
