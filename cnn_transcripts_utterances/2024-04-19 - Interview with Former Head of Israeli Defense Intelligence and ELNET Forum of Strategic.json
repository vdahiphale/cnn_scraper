I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Well, it has been a busy 24 hours. Just before sunrise in Iran, Israel struck back, targeting a military air base in Isfahan, a follow through on its vow to retaliate against Tehran for attacking Israel over the weekend. Iran, you may recall, fired missiles and drones at Israeli soil after an Israeli strike in Syria killed several Iranian commanders. This is a tit for tat that is the region on edge. But as the United States and Europe push to deescalate, there are signs that both countries are trying to not let this fight spiral out of control. Let's now get to Tel Aviv to our first guest, retired Israeli General Amos Yadlin, the former head of the Israeli Defense Intelligence. General, welcome to the program. It is good to see you. So, for days leading up to this counterstrike from the Israelis, world leaders had been urging Israel to show restraint, to be smart, to quote a foreign minister of the U.K., David Cameron, in their response and to be measured. Given everything that we know about what took place overnight, is that what Israel did in your view?",

The Israelis, like Israelis, found an innovative course of action. What the Iranians have done with 300 projectiles, missiles and cruise missiles and drones, it seems that according to the report, Israel has done it with single, maybe two, maybe three missiles that basically hit Isfahan Air Force Air Base. And the air defense in the base, which is a unique capability and then -- and damage the Iranian air defense more than the Iranian were able to hit Nevatim Air Force Airbase in Israel. So, retaliation, yes. Escalation, no. And I hope now the two sides will climb down from the tree and will scale down the tension in the Middle East.",

Israel trying to bring back the rules of the game. And if you pay attention, Iranian militia in Syria were attacked tonight as well. Saying Israel will keep the freedom of attacking Iranians that support all the terror organization around it and try to have Hezbollah 2.0 in Syria. This is going to continue in spite of Iran devastating intention to hit Israel and we should not judge them by the results that are really not impressive.

We seeing in the Middle East today the global fight between the Russia and China and Iran, which are in the axis of evil and the U.S., Europe, Israel, Saudi Arabia, UAE, who are on the other side.

And from all reports, that seemed to have been based on a miscalculation on Israel's part following its targeted strike, which they haven't taken credit, but it's largely believed to be Israel on April 1st, going after the IRGC members and leaders in Syria. Given that miscalculation -- and obviously we know that there are many lessons to be learned in investigations to be launched following the tragedy of October 7th and how that was missed.

You should bring very carefully and very modestly an assessment on the intentions of the enemy. Unlike the capabilities of the enemies that if you have good sources, you are 100 percent -- can be 100 percent right. On the intentions, you have to be very careful because intentions may be changed in the future. So, can you really know what the intention of the supreme leader of Iran? Not really. Because of the fake news that Israel attacked a diplomatic embassy he -- the supreme leader has wrong information. And he knew the general that was assassinated there. And this led him, I think, to the decision to attack Israel. This not always can be seen in the intelligence. What is important, and what the difference between the 7th of October and the 14th of April, that even in the first one, Israel was not ready operationally. In the second one, even if there was a misanalysis of the future, Israel was ready, ready with the best air defense in the world with a coalition to achieve an unprecedented achievement of stopping most of the projectiles to a level that Iran haven't caused any significant damage, any damage at all to airplanes or to airplanes, even though they fire so many ballistic missiles.",

So, earlier this week, before Israel's attack last night, you wrote in \"The New York Times\" that, \"The best way for Washington to limit the expansion of this conflict is to signal clearly its intention to support an Israeli counter attack. It's the recurring military paradox to contain a war. A belligerent sometimes needs to threaten its expansion. Iran's internal situation, its memory about past U.S. military action, and a conspiratorial worldview all support this strategy.\" Thus far, we haven't seen the U.S. take this strategy. We haven't heard from President Biden. Not sure we will on this specific issue. We did hear from Secretary of State Blinken. And here's what he said today at the G7 in Italy about the overnight attack. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  The United States has not been involved in any offensive operations.

It began to support ceasefire resolutions. It began calling for restraint. And, essentially, you began to see the differences between the two states magnify. As I think we said in \"The New York Times,\" that is a wrong approach in terms of impressing your adversaries. Since October the 6th, two of America's adversaries in the region, two of Israel's adversaries in the region, Iran and Hamas, have behaved in an unprecedented way. And too often we're explaining their behavior as opposed to trying to predict it. So, we have to reconceptualize some of our assumptions regarding how reckless some of the Israeli and American adversaries are, and the perception of difference between the two powers only instigates further boldness on their part and recklessness as we had just seen.",

In the past, Israelis haveessentially targeted Iranian military officials and even scientific officials within Iran itself. And the Iranians have responded in a manner that they had before, trying to rely on proxies and even trying to perhaps target Israeli diplomatic compounds outside Israel, obviously. So, to do what they did, which, as you suggest, they hadn't done in 45 years. That's just more than General Zahedi getting killed, that's essentially trying to signal a number of things. First of all, signal to Israel and the United States that there's a possibility of a regional war unless there's some kind of a ceasefire or somehow the Israeli military operations cease in Gaza. Second of all, they were obviously trying to send signal to their proxies. Namely that they're willing to support them in a brazen manner, irrespective of the cost. So, there was some measure of trying to establish their credibility with both Hamas and Hezbollah, particularly Hamas that has been trying to instigate a greater degree of Iranian involvement in this war with Israel.",

We don't know the full scope of it because this new elite that's beginningto assume positions of power tend to come from the security services, from religious conservative centers. We don't know that much about them. This is not to suggest that the old elite was predictable. All the more reasons why it's important to impress the new elite, who are apparently more reckless than their predecessors, about the reality of American power. The American power is something that the Iranians respect. Latent American power. By the way, irrespective of the incumbent administration. And that is something that should have been enforced more resolutely, particularly given the fact that you've seen some sort of a generational shift to Iran. There's a new generation of Iranian leaders coming to power, and they have essentially reached the age of maturity at the time of the post 9/11 wars where the United States became entangled in the Middle East, where you have almost a bipartisan desire to dispense with the Middle East heritage -- inheritance, and essentially talk about forever wars. So, they have come to power with the perception, not that American power has waned, but the American will to enforce its interests in the Middle East have attenuated with the experiences that it has -- had in Iraq and Afghanistan.",

The nuclear installations are deeply buried underground, particularly in Fordow andeven in the town's enrichment facility, so they're not above surface installations that can be so easily targeted. They require specialized munitions. And also, the Iranian nuclear infrastructure is vast and dispersed. So, it's not going to be disabled with a single strike. What the Israelis demonstrated, though, that they can effectively penetrate into Iranian airspace. They may have scored a symbolic victory in that sense. But Israeli response reflected the fact that, it seems to me, there's always been two schools of thought in Israel. One has been that Israeli security can best be achieved by being close with the United States and essentially accepting American mandates, even when they question those mandates. And the second school of thought that suggests that Israelis can best ensure their security, by a time violating and disagreeing with those mandates. It seems to me the former school has prevailed in this case and the Israelis abided by the American injunction to deescalate the crisis.",

Someof them start to be quickly preparing for a forcible adoption, in the Russian adoptive families, and this is important to mention that according to Russian legislation, adoptive family can change not just the name, but place and date of birth. And why I emphasize on this because among these children are children with parents, with parents who were arrested by Russia, and they also are preparing for forcible adoption. And this is a very cynical situation because I can't understand what in the hearts and minds of these people, because how it can be that your child is -- have to be forced -- forcible adopt.",

And we, for 10 years, documented how these words implicated in horrible practice when Russian troops deliberately exterminate active local people, how Russian troops deliberately destroyed Ukrainian cultural heritage. And now, when they took our children and send them to Russia, it's also this part of this genocidal policy because they want to bring these children up as Russians and eliminate their identity.",
