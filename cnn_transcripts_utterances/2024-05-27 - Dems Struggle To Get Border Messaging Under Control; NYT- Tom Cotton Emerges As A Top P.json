To rebut him in saying -- that is, Robert Costello was the legal adviser to Michael Cohen and spent a lot of time with him. And there are indications in that relationship that Michael Cohen said two things. Number one: I have nothing on Donald Trump. And number two: I acted on my own. They probably shouldn't have done that -- that is, the defense. They did and I think they suffered for it. However, preceding that, you had a dud for the prosecutors and that was Michael Cohen being caught in what I believe to be a significant lie in that he said that he was speaking to the president about the deal. And by the way, it was a 96-second phone call. And by the way, in the lead-up to that phone call, he was talking about a 14-year-old who was harassing him and that he needed the Secret Service to help.

Reigning National League MVP Ronald Acuna Jr. is going to miss the rest of the season after tearing his ACL in the first inning against the Pirates. Acuna was trying to steal third when it happened, and he just went down. The Braves star -- he tore his ACL in his other knee during the 2021 season. Atlanta went on to win the World Series after that happened. All right -- and finally, the Tarp Monster claiming another victim during a rain delay during the Reds-Dodgers game in Cincinnati. So, a member of the grounds crew trapped while they were covering the infield. And you can see her there trying to crawl her way out. She did get out of there, Jessica, and I bet she was exhausted. Got a nice hug, though, there. I'll tell you what. That would be one of my worst fears if I was on a grounds crew because I'm quite claustrophobic --",
