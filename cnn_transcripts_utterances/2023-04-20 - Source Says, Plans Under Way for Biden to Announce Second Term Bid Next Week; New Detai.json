      "sentences": "Well, Alex, we have known for several months that President Biden was planning on running for re-election, but they have not named a timeline. It was unclear when that announcement would actually be made. We now know there are plans underway inside the White House amongst Biden's close advisers to announce as soon as next week on Tuesday via campaign- style video.Now, keep in mind, over the course of the last several months, the behind the scenes effort to build the infrastructure of the campaign to get things ready to go for that re-election effort has been very much underway in a very intensive manner. The president, the first lady have also been significantly engaged in that process throughout. But the timing of that announcement, which the president said late last year would come very soon in the New Year, seemed to continue to slip and be pushed, that may be nearing an end. Now, officials, people familiar with the matter cautioned that there is no final decision yet, the timing could slip, but the importance of the anniversary, the four-year anniversary of Biden's announcement in 2019 that he was going to run for president and what he has done over that period of time, both in that campaign and his first two-plus years in office is something that the president, we're told, is quite fond of. It also comes just a few days before top White House officials are expected to welcome top donors to President Biden to Washington, D.C. for a multiday conference, kind of laying the groundwork for what's to come. So, this was expected. The president week in Ireland made clear that he had made the decision, that the decision and the announcement we're coming relatively soon. Now, even though things are not totally finalized, Alex, it looks like that maybe as soon as early next week on Tuesday.",

They don't see any significant real, primary challenges on the Democratic side of things. They believe fundraising will be there whenever they decide to launch.And in the meantime, there has been a pretty, I think, visceral battle between the top two Republican candidates. They obviously have very real legislative agenda and battles and divided government on Capitol Hill with the president's day job here. So, the urgency of trying to launch, to try and either close out potential competitors, or trying to lay the groundwork for a general election battle, that's still more than a year away, just simply wasn't there. However, the connectivity to that four-year anniversary, the reality that he's clearly planning to run again and wants to start getting things off the ground seems to be driving towards the possibility of this Tuesday announcement. So, we'll see, but, very clearly, the plans are underway, Alex.",

These are all basically campaign stops in disguise.So, I don't think a whole lot is going to change for President Biden. What I do think this allows him to do in some ways is more directly respond to the Republican opposition in more explicitly political terms and it might be that we will see more of a rhetorical change than we will see anything changing in terms of the president's schedule, or even how the White House operates. And, of course, the campaign apparatus has been churning along basically behind the scenes all along, so that will only continue and it will only accelerate. We may also start to see, I think, more of a push to get Democrats to really vocalize unity. Behind President Biden because I think the White House and the president's campaign will want to show that this is not going to be a kind of Democratic primary situation that this is an incumbent president running for reelection as the leader of his party.",

What I think you will see now most significantly and in the most immediate future is a big ramp up in the president's fundraising. I do not anticipate that you are going to see Joe Biden try to mix it up with Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis every single day now. I don't have a sense at all that that's their desire. They're still going to maintain that he's got a day job here. And if they've been looking at the Obama -- obviously, there are a lot of similar people working on this -- but that Obama model for in 2011, he started his account pretty much around the same time here. He did a ton of fundraising in that year before the re-election. And it was not until they were turning the corner from the year out into the actual election calendar year that you saw the Obama team sort of move from the rose garden to the campaign trail.

I think what they point to is not that much different than what the president has pointed to when he is asked this question, which is watch him work, watch him operate, that should answer your questions.And I think more importantly in their minds, while they understand that this is an issue out there, they don't believe that this is a deciding issue. They don't believe that this is the critical issue. What they believe instead will matter most are the legislative accomplishments of his first two years, and to Ron's point, who he's running against in the contrast that they're able to create on that front. Look, it's a reality. There's nothing they can do to escape the fact that he is 80 years old and he's the oldest president in history. They don't necessarily try and dodge that fact. Instead they try and talk about what he's accomplished up to this point. And I think you know if you want to think about the last several months building to this point, and why everybody inside the west wing has been very cognizant of the fact that this was going to happen at some point soon, just go back to the state of the union and the kind of the build through, trying to thread together the very significant legislative accomplishments and what that's producing out in the country right now, with the idea that, as he said over and over and over again in that state of the union address, finish the job. They feel like there's more work to do with, the president does as well and that's going to be the message that they're bringing to the table with all of the very critical political issues that David was pointing out where they feel like, at least based on what they're seeing their polling and where they think the president is in his positions, they have a political advantage no matter who they run against.",

So, I do think that that's kind of always been part of his story, and, of course, it will only accelerate.But one of the challenges for people on the Republican side running against Biden and certainly the challenges that his Democratic opponents faced back in 2020 was that, in a lot of ways, it has been enough for Biden to be kind of not terribly popular. It has not been enough for even his approval ratings to be in the low 40s. I mean, look at the 2022 election, where Democrats outperformed even with a president who was very unpopular and an economy that voters believed was heading in the wrong direction. None of that really was in and of itself enough to turn voters totally away from the Democratic Party's message. And so it needs to be at least that and then something else as well, and that's actually been one of the things that Biden has been able to succeed on. Voters don't have to absolutely love him in order to be willing to vote for him, and I do think that that's part of the reality that this campaign is going to be fought on. There's no expectation among Biden's advisers that suddenly he will become extraordinarily popular or suddenly, his age is not going to be a factor. That's part of it, and they're just hoping that voters will factor that in along with other things, especially who he is running against, as they make a decision about who they're going to vote for in the presidential.",

Ron DeSantis signing the six-week ban and Florida last week is a perfect example of that, Alex.But we shouldn't mistake this as anything but a likely close election. I just want to remind people here, Joe Biden won the presidency by about a total of 44,000 votes across three states. I mean, this -- he had a very big popular vote victory, but the Electoral College, there is no doubt that this is still going to be a re-election campaign that is not likely to be one that's completely out of hand and seen as a fait accompli, that somehow his re-election is guaranteed.

They have also accomplished a number of other things.I think that for Trump, you are going to see him described President Biden's term as, you know, being poorly waged. I think that he is going to hope that there is -- you know, there are other aspects in life in America that he can point to, such as saying that, you know, the economy was better under him. I think that, you know, right now we'll see how that plays out. But I also think you are looking at two people who are, you know, 75 years-plus, Biden is older than Trump, but not by much. The voters in this country, as you point out, have not felt great about their choices, not just the last election, but in 2016 as well, and yet they have gotten these elections uglier and uglier, and that is really largely a product of how Donald Trump wages politics.

Now, we know this AR-15 that was used was purchased about a week before the shooting and all he would really need to do for Kentucky laws fill out an ATF form and go through a records check to show that he wasn't a convicted felon.And we've reached out to the family attorney on this, and they haven't responded to this latest reporting. But we do know from the family that he is someone who struggled with mental health issues. It was something they have said they were actively addressing. It's part of why the family says they are testing his body for CTE in that some of the symptoms associated with CTE include impaired judgment, impulse control issues and sometimes suicidal behavior, though it's not limited to that. And we do know that he had had many concussions in the past, some as early as middle school, according to the family as well. But, again, these notes, offering at least part of the motivation. This obviously, you don't have to say, is an extreme implementation of any motivation there. Police have not released officially any motivation that they have found in regards to their motivation, but these notes again providing some clue.
