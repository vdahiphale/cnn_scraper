He faces a federal charge of bank fraud after allegedly stealing more than $16 million from Ohtani. A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's Office says Mizuhara will not be asked to enter a plea during that hearing.

One thing to keep in mind, this is the first time that we have seen an ex- president on a criminal trial. However, it's not the first time Donald Trump has been in court, right? He's been in and out of the courtroom for the last year or so.So police have been able to look back at those times -- to the civil fraud trial, to the defamation trial -- and sort of take notes on how to handle security then, and then sort of to make changes, basically, ahead of this major trial, which is expected to last six to eight weeks. So they've been having roundtables about this and discussions about this for the last couple of months. But as police told me, all the toys are going to be out for this major event, again, that's going to last for several weeks in downtown Manhattan. We're talking about drones, bomb-sniffing dogs, barricades which are going to create frozen drones around that courthouse, and mobile units, of course, as Donald Trump is brought in and out of the courthouse where he is expected to stay at Trump Tower. So the units are going to obviously help him be transported every single day down to the courthouse. And they're going to have a lot to handle. They have to deal with the media presence. They have to handle any protesters or supporters. Any threats that might come in. Of course, we know from law enforcement there have been more threats when Donald Trump has been in court, whether it be against judges or district attorneys, or anyone else. So, here's how police say they're going to handle that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

His idol of lawyers if Roy Cohn, the disgraced late lawyer from the '70s and '80s. He thought lawyers don't take notes because those can be used against your client. We heard about this during the Mueller probe. He was saying oh, real lawyers don't take notes.Actually, real lawyers do take notes and it's those notes -- the contemporaneous voice recordings that Evan Corcoran did that are being used against Donald Trump in the Mar-a-Lago case, particularly on the obstruction angle, to show intent. So if Donald Trump is finally pushing him aside, that shows they expect that their efforts to get his testimony suppressed are likely going to fail. That if this eventually does make it to trial that Corcoran's testimony is going to be very critical and very damaging, and they're going to try to make this sort of a separation between themselves and Corcoran going forward. They're going to try to downplay what Corcoran wrote down and what he recalled, and sort of say oh, you misunderstood the boss.",

That's weren't necessarily using those words, but sort of expressing that kind of skepticism it sounded like he was coached.And certainly, they came back to it later on where he admitted to moving certain things and that he had more knowledge than he had originally admitted to. And that played a key role in him getting hit in this indictment on the obstruction angle. Now, what he and De Oliveira are trying to do certainly was within their right to do. They're trying to argue they didn't have the requisite knowledge, the indictment is too vague, et cetera, et cetera. These are very standard pretrial motions from a defense attorney that you would expect to see. I don't anticipate it will be enough, even with Judge Cannon, to get it thrown out.

There is an algae called Gambierdiscus, which really takes off when the water is warm and that creates various amounts of neurotoxins, which can be really harmful to fish and also to humans.

There was one major change to this bill that would change the reauthorization timeframe from five years to two years. That is something that conservatives say is a big win for Donald Trump. He, of course, had that tweet just a couple of days ago saying that he wanted to get rid of FISA, ordering members to \"kill FISA.\" That is the question this morning.

Because this has nothing to do with helping constituents. This has nothing to do with keeping the Republican Party functional and in order, and doing their jobs.This is a campaign stop. He is participating in a stunt for Donald Trump to help Trump spread his conspiracy theories about elections, to kiss his ring -- and as you noted, most importantly, to keep his job. There is nothing serious about this effort. This is yet another attempt by Trump to use Republican leadership and Republican loyalty to him to help him spread his conspiracy theories.
