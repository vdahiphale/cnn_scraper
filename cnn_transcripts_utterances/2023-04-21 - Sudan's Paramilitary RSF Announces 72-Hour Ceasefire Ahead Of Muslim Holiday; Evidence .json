For part of the 50 mile race earlier this month, Joasia Zakrzewski rode in a car. The 47-year-old says she told race marshals that she did and she was pulling out, and but they unexpectedly urged her to keep going.Zakrzewski described it as a miscommunication somehow, as she says she continued the race in a non competitive way. But she does admit that when she accepted that third place trophy, it was probably a bit of a mistake. How about that? The family of seven-time Formula 1 champion Michael Schumacher planning legal action after a German magazine published fake quotes attributed to the F1 legend but which were actually created by artificial intelligence.

But what appears to be an exclusive interview with Michael Schumacher, the first since his ski accident in December 2013 is anything but. In fact, even if you get to the tease article on page eight, you find the headline, \"My life has changed completely\" followed by quotes attributed to the Formula 1 champion, talking about his medical condition and his family life since his brain injury. It's only toward the end of the article that you discover that the interview is fake, responses were generated by artificial intelligence. The Schumacher family say they are planning to take legal action against Funke Media Group, the German publisher of the magazine and a spokesperson for that company has declined to comment. This fake interview has caused particular upset considering both Michael Schumacher's condition following his ski accident, but also his wife's very clear message in a Netflix documentary, which broadcast two years ago in which she said, it is very important to me that he can continue to enjoy his private life as much as possible. Michael always protected us. So now we are protecting Michael. Anna Stewart, CNN -- London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

But I think what we're going to move to is almost a verification process where something gets verified so that you know that it's real, almost like Twitter was doing for a while without that blue checkmark, which has you know, since coming under its own controversy. But there are applications out there right now, like one called Zero GPT, that can actually sense that you know, the text based AI that something hasn't been written by a human being. And so every day, a new solution is coming out to detect whether these things are real or not, and every organization that you can imagine, science organizations, media and entertainment organizations are all looking at this and trying to figure out how are they going to manage it?

Warehouses and storage facilities brimming with artifacts are currently open to visitors. These former shops and market stalls have been converted into temporary museum space to hold the leftover artifacts that didn't quite fit into a new museum that opened in 2021. Until the end of July eight visitors at a time can reserve a special tour guided by an archaeologist who will let them hold these important historical finds, many of which have not been on display in 30 years. In this way, the people have direct contact with the ancient culture and materials, archaeologist Roberto L. Terry (ph) said. After that, their fate is unknown. The popular pieces will upgrade to the museum and the rest will go back to collecting dust in the warehouse. Alfonsina Russo, the director of the Colosseum Archaeological Park, says she hopes the project gives people a better understanding of daily life in ancient Rome. These artifacts tell the story of daily life, how they carried out activities and above all, to bring these objects that would otherwise have remained hidden in our warehouses. She also hopes other historical sites open up their warehouses to let people see all history has to offer and to bring the past into focus. Barbie Latza Nadeau, CNN -- Rome. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
