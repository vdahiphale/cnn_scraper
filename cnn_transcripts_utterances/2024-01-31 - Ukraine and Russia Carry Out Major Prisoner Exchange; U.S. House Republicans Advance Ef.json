Thousands of displaced Palestinians in Gaza seek shelter at a hospital in Khan Yunis as the IDF conducts large operations nearby. Well, that coming up. Plus U.S. President Joe Biden says he has decided how to respond to what was a deadly attack in Jordan. And Ukraine and Russia exchange hundreds of prisoners one week after a Russian military plane crashed. And there's more thrills at the Africa Cup of South Africa oust Morocco in the latest shock result. And the markets in New York, at least will open it in about 30 minutes from now midway of course through the European market. And this is the situation the Dow futures slightly higher, NASDAQ for the tech stocks of course off by some 1 percent. The S&amp;P future is down by some half of 1 percent. More on that why the markets are doing what they are doing what we can expect at the bottom of the hour on the Opening Bell. We're living in constant fear and anxiety. That is how the Palestine Red Crescent is describing what it calls the precarious situation around a hospital in the Khan Yunis. Thousands of displaced Gazan residents, mostly women and children have been sheltering on the grounds of Al Amal Hospital, which the Red Crescent says is now occupied by Israeli tanks. Well, the group reports intense ongoing Israeli military activity in the area. You can see on the map here where that is. Israel's military says its forces are not operating inside the hospital and are working with its staff to make sure it has adequate fuel and electricity. Well, the World Health Organization says the team was able to deliver essential supplies to NASA Hospital in Khan Yunis, which you see here. But the W.H.O. director says that delays are only adding to the misery with people in during what he calls hellish conditions, including severe hunger. Jeremy Diamond is with me this hour from Tel Aviv. And Jeremy, I think it is important to establish what we know about the situation around these hospitals. Is it clear at this point?",

It is clear that the Israeli military has been carrying out this major offensive in the western part of Khan Yunis for about a week now. And that those operations have been happening in very close proximity to several of that city's hospitals. Palestine Red Crescent Society and hospital officials do say that Israeli tanks entered the hospital's front yard last night. And they say that those Israeli forces fired live ammunition as well as smoke grenades. One hospital official is telling CNN that people were being directed to evacuate at gunpoint. The Israeli military for its part says that it quote, did not operate inside Al Amal Hospital or request its evacuation. And as you mentioned, they have said that they have been closely coordinating with the hospital to ensure that it has sufficient fuel and electricity to continue its operations. But the Israeli military has been surrounding that hospital for days already. And we know that in addition to the patients and staffs there, about 8000 people are estimated to be sheltering displaced Palestinians, estimated to be sheltering on the grounds of that hospital. And today the Palestine Red Crescent Society says that those individuals are living in constant fear and anxiety from that Israeli military activity. Now at Al Nasr Hospital which has also seen airstrikes and shelling in it's very near vicinity. The World Health Organization was finally able to deliver essential medical supplies they say for about thousand patients. The World Health Organization has issued several warnings about the fighting nearby. Now a lot of these areas the Israeli military has urged people to evacuate, but with Israeli military vehicles and firing nearby as well as the reports of the Israeli military firing upon several people over the last month who were carrying white flags evacuating these situations can be much, much harder than it actually may appear.

But we do know fromseveral U.S. officials, including John Kirby, who is the Spokesperson for the National Security Council, as well as Secretary of State Antony Blinken, that this is likely to be a multi-level or multifaceted and potentially multi-day response. John Kirby said yesterday, quote, not a single action, but multiple actions over time, is what the U.S. is anticipating at this point as a response. And this is important because they need to figure out a way to deter these Iran backed militant groups from continuing their attacks on U.S. forces without actually sparking that broader regional war. And particularly a direct war with Iran that President Biden and other officials have said. The U.S. just does not want to get embroiled in at this point. And so the question now is, what is this response going to look like? It could be, you know, strikes on Iran backed militias in Iraq and Syria, as the U.S. has done in the past. It could be an offensive cyberattack that tries to cripple Iranian and Iran backed militia's infrastructure. It could be a combination of those that could also involve the striking of U.S. of Iranian naval assets in the Red Sea. There are many options that President Biden has at this moment. But you know, the big question here is, what is that line that perhaps the U.S. should not, cannot cross to avoid sparking this broader war with Iran itself, Becky?",

Amid concerns about this sort of widening conflict, the families of the six remaining American hostages in Gaza met with White House officials on Tuesday night who updated them on the ongoing negotiations.

The Ukrainians are saying that for their side 207 Ukrainian prisoners were released. There's already some video that has come out of some of these Ukrainians now on Ukrainian territory, obviously very, very happy to be back home. The Ukrainians are also offering a bit of a breakdown saying that 95 of them were representatives of the Armed Forces, 56 National Guardsmen, also border guards, members and soldiers of the territorial defense. And one of the things that are really remarkable is some of the defenders or some of the soldiers that were released today; they were taken captive in the very early stages of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Some of them were defending Mariupol; some of them were on Snake Island, which of course, was taken very early on by the Russians. The Russians, for their part have not put up anything official yet. But we are hearing from some channels in Russia though, is that apparently around 200 possibly 196 Russian troops were also released. But of course, the other thing that's very remarkable, Becky about this exchange that took place is that it's happening only a week after an Il-76 transport plane of the Russian Federation crashed in or approaching the City of Belgrade. And of course, the Russians had a blame that on the Ukrainian saying the Ukrainian shot down the plane. And the Russians had also said that onboard that plane were actually 65 Ukrainian POWs who were killed. Now the Ukrainians of course, have cast doubt on that. They said that so far, the Russians have not produced any evidence that there were actually POWs on that plane. They certainly haven't showed any bodies in that crash site or anywhere afterwards. So the Ukrainians are saying they want an international investigation. But the Russians had said that the future of prisoner exchanges was very much in doubt that it was unclear. But today, we've obviously seen that these prisoner exchanges are continuing. The Ukrainian saying this was the 50th exchange of prisoners, obviously very important for them to get these 270 back on Ukrainian soil, Becky.",

And despite the fact that you just had that massive controversy going on about that plane crash that took place, certainly the Russians were very angry about that, that the behind the scenes negotiations do continue. And it was quite interesting, because the head of hostage negotiations for the Ukrainians, he came out, and he congratulated some top members of Ukraine's military and political apparatus. Among them, the Chief of the Military Intelligence Service, Kyrylo Budanov, who, of course, is one of the arch nemeses that have the Russians in all that. And the Russians believe behind some of the attacks that have been happening on Russian territory. Also Andriy Yermak, of course, one of the top officials here close to President Zelenskyy as well. So it certainly seems as though behind the scenes, those negotiations are still continuing, even though things are ramping up on the battlefield. And the Russians, certainly right now trying to gain territory, especially in the east of the country. At the same time, these exchanges are still taking place. And those exchanges are extremely important for the Ukrainians to get some of their service members back home, very important here in Ukrainian society.

The Federal Reserve widelyexpected to hold interest rates steady later today, but investors will be listening for the U.S. Central Bank's policy statement. That is because they are searching for clues on whether a rate cut could come as early as March. And when you look at these markets, I think it's important to suggest. I'm Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi; you're watching \"Connect the World\", that a lot of inaction I think is what we are looking at here. That's how we can read these markets today. The NASDAQ is frankly suffering a slight slide after a pretty robust run. The Dow trading slightly higher, those investors who are on rate watch will may have taken that latest employment cost index, which is out today, which was slower than expected as an indication, the Fed might just be ready to slicer the top of those interest rates. So we will wait for that decision. And indeed, what the Fed actually says about where it's at. You can bet investors will be listening to every word from U.S. Fed Chief Jerome Powell later today. Then when he holds a news conference, after the Fed announcement, they are going to try and get any sort of sense about rate cuts that might come in the spring. It's important to note that the U.S. economy is in good shape. So fed watchers figure there might not be any urgency for trimming rates. It's one of these decisions, which is a tough one. Nobody wants to be a central banker. In this market plenty of urgency today for parents though waiting to hear what five of the biggest tech CEOs could say about online child exploitation. A U.S. Senate hearing on Capitol Hill is set to kick off at the top of this hour. And the Heads of Meta, TikTok, Discord, Snapchat and X formerly known as Twitter are expected to be in the hot seat coming for a grilling possibly.

And so I think the big question going into today is, will we see more of the same these splashy sound bites especially in an election year? Or will there be real pushes for real change? There are reasons to believe that today's hearing will be different among them. You have a few more serious legislative proposals on the table. You have the Kids Online Safety Act, which Snap CEO Evan Spiegel has already said he plans to endorse. And I think we'll see these other CEOs facing pressure to endorse that bill as well. There's also a new proposal that would crack down on AI generated non- consensual sexual imagery, which of course we know Popstar Taylor Swift was the latest victim of just last week. And so, I think we'll see a lot of discussion of these potential legislative proposals that could hold these platforms accountable. Many people say these platforms should no longer be trusted to self- regulate. From the CEOs, I think we'll hear them touting a lot of these existing youth safety measures that they have, including parental oversight tools that give parents some ways to monitor their young people's use of social media. But a lot of critics of these platforms say that those measures don't go far enough and that they put too much onus on parents, and in some cases on teens themselves to be really monitoring their own experience on these platforms.

So after this gap of a year and a half, both sides were finally sitting down again, each sending an interagency delegation to discuss this issue that is near and dear to the heart of many U.S. officials and politicians. Because of that tremendous human toll, the opioid crisis has taken on American society with hundreds of thousands of Americans killed by opioid overdose in the past few years. I remember talking to members of the first Senate delegation to visit China. And years just a few months ago, almost every senator had a personal tragedy to share when it comes to fentanyl deaths, not only involving their constituents, but sometimes their family friends. One senator told me she actually personally clear her case with President Xi Jinping, and asking for his help to stem the flow of this potent and deadly synthetic drug to the U.S. from China, which the U.S. has long said is the primary source. Now Beijing, of course, has long denied that and often are pointing finger at Washington blaming the U.S. drugs culture and lacks law enforcement and of course, years of geopolitical tensions didn't help. But despite all these disagreements, both sides seem to agree. This is something now they can work together. And according to the U.S. Embassy, both sides discussed the need to further coordinating law enforcement actions targeting the misuse of precursor chemicals, but also the financing of transporter criminal organizations and also discussing the importance of regularly sharing information on multiple fronts. And of course, they have daunting tasks ahead of them. Our own investigations have revealed how sophisticated and nimbo some Chinese operators are when it comes to tweaking the chemical formulas to evade the law, but also popping up under different names after being shut down.
