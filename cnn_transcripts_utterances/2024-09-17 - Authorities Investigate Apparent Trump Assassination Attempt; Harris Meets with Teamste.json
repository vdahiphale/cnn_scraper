The Vice President telling Teamsters she's going to continue fighting for union workers like them every day and touted being part of the most pro-union administration in history. She accused former President Donald Trump of appointing union busters to the National Labor Relations Board, making it harder for workers to organize. She cast the deciding vote for the Butch Lewis Act in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan, which the campaign says saved over a million pensions. And out on the campaign trail, the Vice President and Democrats routinely pledging to work with Congress to pass the PRO Act, which they say will end union busting. Now, after holding roundtables with all the presidential candidates, the International Brotherhood of the Teamsters could reach an endorsement decision as soon as Wednesday. Most major unions have already endorsed the Vice President, including the United Auto Workers and the AFL-CIO. Eva McKend, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
