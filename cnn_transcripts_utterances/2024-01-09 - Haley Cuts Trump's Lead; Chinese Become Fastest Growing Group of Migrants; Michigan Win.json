But it's a candidate - it's a - it's a campaign where number two really, really matters. Why? Because of the instability and the chaos of the former president of the United States.So, we have somebody like Nikki Haley, who's coming out here, who knows that there is a good chance that she's going to come in number two no matter what she does, but saying, look, if I come in second, that's fine because I provide a stable, right, alternative to the current - to the former president of the United States. With me you'll have -- and it's actually very similar to the argument that Joe Biden made, which is, you will have a stable, normal, boring presidency. I will not offer you criminal trials. I will not say anything outrageous. I won't be picking fights with random celebrities and things like that. I will just be your president of the United States. And I think what's really important to remember is that irrespective of, you know, what's going on with independents, although I think they matter, is that moderate and liberal Republicans actually want that. So, Nikki Haley is offering them an alternative in a way that is surpassing Ron DeSantis in really incredible ways. And the truth is, you know, stranger things have happened.

You make him watch this whole thing.Hot off the presses, \"Detroit Press,\" \"hail yes, Michigan are your national champions.\" Let's get you your highlights Philly boy. Big names in attendance. Michael Jordan, Derek Jeter and Travis Scott. That's about $3 billion net worth all in one box. And Michigan's offensive line, they were money too, pummeling Washington. Donovan Edwards running through the Huskies like a bowling ball through a wet paper bag. Ninety-three yards, two huge touchdowns, all in the first half. Says he plays for his mom, who he lost to cancer when he was a young kid. Seventeen to 10 Michigan at the half. In the second, Michigan's number one ranked defense was balling. Intercepting Heisman candidate Michael Penix two times. The first was on the very first play of the half. And then it was Michigan's star running back Blake Corum finishing them, running for two touchdowns of his own. Michigan are your college football playoff national champs, not Ohio State. And 34-13 is your final. We caught up with the champs after the game. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
