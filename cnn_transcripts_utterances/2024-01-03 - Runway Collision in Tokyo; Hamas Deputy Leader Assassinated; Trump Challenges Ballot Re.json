Israel assassinates the deputy political leader of Hamas and warns others will be next. And 500 Russian airstrikes in just days leaves Ukraine pleading for international help.Almost 24 hours after a fiery collision at an airport in Tokyo, investigators are trying to piece together how two planes, one a small Coast Guard turboprop, the other a commercial airliner, ended up on the same runway. New images shows the burnt-out wreckage of the Japan Airlines Airbus A350. Incredibly, all 367 passengers and 12 crew on board escaped, a few suffering minor injuries. But five crew members on the Coast Guard plane were killed in the collision. A Coast Guard captain is in a critical condition. Japan Airlines has released audio from the cockpit crew, reading back clearance for landing instructions from the tower. French authorities and advisers from Airbus will be joining the investigation. The Coast Guard plane was part of relief efforts after Monday's earthquake was set to deliver supplies to the quake zone. More details now from CNN's senior international correspondent, Will Ripley. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A Japan Airlines jet touches down in Tokyo. The cabin calmed until passengers look out the windows. We saw fire coming out of the engines, and I found it strange, Satoshi Yamake (ph) tells CNN. Within seconds, black smoke billowing through the aircraft. The Airbus A350-900, packed with nearly 400 passengers and crew, including parents with young children. He says some passengers were scared, especially the kids and women. The scene outside, even scarier. People on other planes captured the chaos.",

They were told not to open the rear doors for the evacuation, because there may have been flames coming from the engines going backwards. So quite often, you only use the front doors on the aircraft, and that's what they did.But I've done these exercises. I mean, if you look at the -- there's the -- there's the famous A380 exercise where you see everybody standing ready to jump off the plane. I've actually done one of these exercises and the flight crew or the cabin crew sit there. And as soon as you're ready to evacuate the aircraft, they shout, come forward, come forward, stay down, stay down, come forward, keep moving. I mean, it's a real shout, sometimes with a megaphone right the way down the aircraft. And what you're aiming to do, of course, is stop people from picking up, never mind their passport. I mean, some people take it, although you shouldn't have your shoes off at landing, should always be wearing your shoes at landing. And it's quite an achievement to get it done in an orderly fashion when people are on the verge of panic and the flight and the crew themselves are frightened. Meantime, this investigation now it's underway in how this actually happened. It's focusing in part on human error, possibly caused by. Miscommunication between either the airliner and the tower or the Coast Guard plane and the tower. Japan Airlines issued this statement. According to interviews with the operating crew, they acknowledged and repeated the landing permission from air traffic control and then proceeded with the approach and landing procedures. To be fair, the investigation has only just started. But is it too early to make what seems to be a very obvious assumption here?",

But what will you do if a piece of tape comes up that shows the Dash 8 told to take the runway and prepare to take off and hold? Prepare for takeoff. Or some version thereof where the Dash has misheard or the air traffic controller has given a mishear. Look, we know the fault lies at that end of the runway.

You can split hairs over this, but that's essentially what we're talking about here right now.And it seems that they're happening with increasing frequency in the United States. The Wall Street Journal reported last May about a spate of runway near misses casting shadows over summer travel. Senior aviation officials were so concerned in the U.S. they met last year to discuss a string of serious incidents at airports across the country. So it seems that air travel is now at this point where the skies have never actually been safer. But once you're on the ground, that's when you're most at risk.",

So, if it did kill Salah al-Arouri, then it would have simply been making good on its threats. Now, Israel's official line is no comment, resorting to its oft-used tactic of strategic ambiguity. But Danny Danon, a former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations and a close ally of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, may have given the game away.He wrote on X, formerly Twitter, I congratulate the IDF, the Shin Bet, the Mossad and the security services for the targeted killing of Hamas leader Salah al-Arouri in Beirut. Everyone involved in the massacre of October the 7th needs to know that we will get them and close accounts with them. Now, the IDF itself says that it is in a state of high alert. It may have been calculating, if it did it, that by taking out a Hamas leader in Beirut rather than a Hezbollah leader, that the Iranian-backed militia that has been skirmishing with Israel on the northern border may not see this as a cause for escalation. And that the war that isn't a war that's been ongoing on the northern border between Israel and Lebanon will continue in its current state and won't turn into all-out war.

Harvard University President Claudine Gay's tenure, just six months long, was mired in controversy. The weight of multiple allegations of plagiarism following a poor performance in a Capitol Hill hearing about anti-Semitism, resulting in her resignation. In a letter to the Harvard community, Gay wrote that her exit came with a heavy heart. It has become clear that it is in the best interests of Harvard for me to resign so that our community can navigate this moment of extraordinary challenge with a focus on the institution rather than any individual. Harvard announced that Alan M. Garber, who currently serves as provost at the university, will step in as interim president while acknowledging Gay's commitment to the school. It is with that overarching consideration in mind that we have accepted Gay's resignation, the Harvard leadership wrote, adding, we do so with sorrow. Conservative media had been unearthing multiple examples of plagiarism in Gay's past works, including an entire paragraph being lifted almost verbatim in her 1997 PhD dissertation without citation.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HANAKO MONTGOMERY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's been more than a day since the powerful quake. But for Minae and her mother, the impact still very fresh. MINAE AKIYAMA, EARTHQUAKE SURVIVOR (through translator): Thinking about it now still makes me tremble. My heart was pounding. My mind went blank. We just scrambled, things like our wallets, and ran outside. MONTGOMERY (voice-over): Minae was visiting her family for New Year's, when the quake struck. Her mother's house now unlivable because of the powerful impact. The pair, luckily, able to escape unharmed. But with the constant aftershocks, they're still far from safe. AKIYAMA (through translator): I feel like even now the building is shaking. Whenever an aftershock happens, I think of the main quake, and my body trembles. MONTGOMERY (voice-over): But it's not just the tremors people here have to worry about. Other than a roof, there's little else. MONTGOMERY: There is no heating right now, so people are sleeping on mats. They're using thick blankets to stay warm. There's also no running water, so the Japanese Self-Defense Forces are just outside this building, handing out water to locals. MONTGOMERY (voice-over): This water, a lifeline for dozens here and thousands across the region, left without supply or simply without homes after Monday's powerful quake. The devastation difficult to comprehend at night but clearly visible from the sky. In Wajima, the shock flipping multi-story buildings on their side, and razing entire blocks to the ground. Tsunami waves forcing large vessels onto the shore and fires adding to the destruction. Amid it all, authorities desperately searching for the dozens still trapped beneath the rubble. YOSHIMASA HAYASHI, JAPANESE CHIEF CABINET SECRETARY (through translator): Prime Minister Kishida instructed us to once again put lives first, understand the situation of the damages, and make an utmost effort to save people in emergency rescue operations. MONTGOMERY (voice-over): Urgent efforts slowed down by the devastating impact, the quake destroying access to the most impacted zones and making these already remote areas nearly impossible to reach. Hanako Montgomery, CNN, Nanao. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
