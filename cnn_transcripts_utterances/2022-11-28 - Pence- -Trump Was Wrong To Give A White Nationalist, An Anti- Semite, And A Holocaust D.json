And, Donald Trump, of course, is now running for a third time. Missing from the condemnations is Senate Minority Leader, Mitch McConnell, at least so far. He reportedly said he'll have his normal question-and-answer period, tomorrow, with reporters, who can ask him then, about it. Also the man, who hopes to soon be the next Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy. Earlier this year, just days after two members of McCarthy's Conference appeared, at a Conference, founded by this same white supremacist, Trump dined with, McCarthy condemned Nick Fuentes, and anyone who would associate with him. Quoting McCarthy, in his comments, to CNN, at the time, \"There's no place in our party for any of this.\" That was then. McCarthy has yet to comment on Trump's dinner with Nick Fuentes, this time. I'm joined now by two CNN Political Commentators. Bakari Sellers, a former Democratic lawmaker, in South Carolina. He's also the Author of the children's book, \"Who Are Your People?\" And Scott Jennings, a former Special Assistant to President George W. Bush., and longtime political adviser, to Senator Mitch McConnell. Scott, we have heard some Republicans come out. We heard the former Vice President. We've heard some governors, some senators. But one person we haven't heard from yet is the guy who wants to be Speaker of the House. He wants to be the top Republican in the country. Where's Kevin McCarthy? Why is he silent on this? SCOTT JENNINGS, FORMER SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Yes, I mean, he's juggling a complicated deck over there. And, I guess, I'm mixing metaphors. He's juggling a complicated set of bowling pins over there, in his quest to become Speaker. And my suspicion is he's taking the temperature of his Conference. And probably we'll, I'm guessing, we'll hear from him, and McConnell, by the way, as well, after they have a chance to talk to their members. That's the one thing about these guys in leadership is they do tend to take the temperature of the people that they represent, before they make comments. But I think the correct answer, for any Republican leader, or a rank- and-file or whoever is very clear. This was a terrible decision. This was wrong. And, as a political matter, we're going to have a year and a half of this crap. And if we nominate Trump, then we're going to have four months, five more months of it. And then we're going to expect the American people to make him president again? It's not going to be. And so, I think there's a moral answer, which is clear, there's a political answer, which is clear. And the number of Republicans, who have stepped out tonight, and said the President was wrong -- former President was wrong, to me, is heartening, and shows he's losing his grip on the party.",

One of the things that Donald Trump takes away from that is we are not able to have those conversations. That's not my problem, though. That's the Republican Party's problem.

And what we understand from the source is that there is a large number of security forces, from the Regime that are present, in Qatar, right now. They're collecting information, and they're monitoring members of the team. According to the source, dozens of IRGC members are monitoring the players, who are not allowed to mingle, with anyone, outside the squad, or any foreigners.

JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INTELLIGENCE ANALYST, FORMER NYPD DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF INTELLIGENCE &amp; COUNTERTERRORISM: Well, I think you have a case, where they come in, and they see, here is a number of victims. Here's a bunch of phone calls that were made, in the early morning hours. Here's an ex-boyfriend, and you know what they're calling a crime of passion. And then after a little investigation, they find out, OK, that guy's got an alibi. That's not the -- not going to be the killer. There's a mystery man by a food truck. He's identified. He's eliminated. There's a guy, who drives them home, his alibi checks out. And all of this is backed up by technology and other evidence. And then you find yourself, a couple of weeks into it, really starting at the beginning. So, as you point out, what police don't have is a suspect, who's identified, with a clear motive. What they don't have is a murder weapon. What they do have is 113 pieces of physical evidence, 4,000 crime scene photos, and 488 tips, in terms of video and technology that's been submitted. But you can also see they're taking a real step back. If you look at the area that they've blocked out and said, \"We want to collect all video from this area,\" that's an area bounded by everything, surrounding the crime scene. And why are they doing that now? They said, \"Even if there's nothing on the video, we want to get the Ring doorbell cameras. We want to get the security cameras from the businesses. We want to get everything.\" Because, if that video gets erased between one day, or 181 days, from when it's recorded, there may be something useful on it that they may find out about later. So they really are vacuuming all that up.",

      "sentences": "I think when you look at the FBI, and as a former Assistant Director of the FBI, I know that when the FBI comes into one of these cases, it's not to take over the case. It's not to big-foot the investigators, and say, \"This is a federal matter.\" It's to bring the kinds of resources that the FBI can bring, to assist local law enforcement.And, in this case John, that would be CAST, the Cellular Analysis Support Team. They can tell you what phones were pinging in the area, at 3, in the morning, and which of those phones were pinging at the same club that two of the victims were at, beforehand. They can do analysis of where those phones went. And that could become a useful factor. There's also the Behavioral Science people or as we call them, the profilers, who can look at the crime scene, and tell you about offender characteristics, by how the killing was done. There's also, of course, the ViCAP system, which can tell them, was there four other people or two other people or three other people murdered using the same MO, four states away, two years ago, and can connect those dots. So, the FBI can bring a lot in terms of support, to the Moscow Police Department, and the state police. And Governor Brad Little has pushed a million dollars, from Idaho, to the state police, to cover additional patrols, overtime hotel rooms, for troopers, who have been shipped up there, to cover the Police Department, while they focus on the murder. It's a real team effort.",

The U.N. says the humanitarian situation is dire and critical, although electricity supply is gradually being restored.One photographer captured just how ominous the situation is, at a children's hospital, in Kherson. He says some nurses are working 48- to 72-hour shifts, often using the light from a lamp or flashlights. Nurses are caring for orphan babies, and children, almost completely in the dark. And, in this photo, a doctor tends to a 4-day old baby, under the light of just a desk lamp that's in the children's ICU. Meantime, over the weekend, the head of Ukraine's nuclear agency provider said Russian forces may be planning to leave the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. That's Europe's largest nuclear power facility. It provided up to 20 percent of the country's electricity before the invasion. Joining me now, in the City of Zaporizhzhia, is CNN's Sam Kiley. And Sam, I want to talk about the nuclear power plant, in just a moment. But first, the situation in that hospital, in Kherson, it seems dire. And Russia has continued to strike at the city, which they recently pulled out of. What's the status?",

      "sentences": "Well, ironically, the situation is dire at the hospital, in terms of the power supply. But it's better than it was a few days ago, because in fact, Kherson has nearly got 20 percent power restored to it. Because, the Russians not only destroyed the local power station, but also destroyed the lines connecting it, to the rest of the country's network.The network, as you rightly pointed out there that itself has been under pressure, nationwide, right across the country, as a result of what the Ukrainian government, John, says have been seven different waves of attacks by predominantly cruise missiles, fired by Russia. In just, in the last 24 hours, President Zelenskyy has been warning his population, to heed air raid sirens, because as far as Ukraine is concerned, they have Intelligence that there is likely to be another wave of attacks, against the power infrastructure.

      "sentences": "And what about the power plant, the nuclear power plant? Who is in control of it? How much longer will the Russians stay? What do we actually know for sure? KILEYThey have been lately the head of the Ukrainian nuclear industry, who's in touch with people, in the neighboring town, has suggested, although provided very little evidence for, the suggestion that the Russians may be preparing to withdraw. But he admits that it doesn't appear to be particularly imminent. I think this would probably be seen as part of the ongoing psychological warfare to go alongside the hot war. Because, the nuclear power plant, as you rightly point out, provides, at its peak, 20 percent of the generating capacity, for the whole Ukrainian electrical industry, an industry that the Russians have been trying to systematically destroy. So they're very unlikely to give that up. On top of that, John, it's a very important location, in terms of, if the Russians pulled out, the Ukrainians would move back in. That would give them a bridgehead, on the other side of the Dnipro River, to continue their campaign, which in all probability they're likely to do, over the next few weeks, perhaps in the Zaporizhzhia front line, which really has been frozen, for the last six months. So, the status of the nuclear power station, remains extremely tenuous though, with the U.N. observers still there, regularly reporting that they see the evidence of shelling, and the results of shelling, which both the Ukrainians and the Russians blame each other for, in that very, very tense and dangerous location.

And this is what they want to do.If they can put unbearable pressure, on these Ukrainian forces, before they can bring the other forces, back from Kherson, to bear? If they can cause the Ukrainians to blink, to request a ceasefire, to ask for a breathing spell? Putin wins. So, he's got a place, where the Ukrainians do have to hold. They are dug in.

But there's a lot of paved roads there now. So yes, it's a problem for off-road maneuver.But the other thing we saw, at least last winter? And I watched the temperature on December, January and February. The ground never really froze well, especially in the southern area. You might have a day or two below freezing. You'd have 35-degree, 40-degree weather. You'd have snow mixed with rain. So, it wasn't like the hard freezes of 40 years ago, 50 years ago, where the temperature was 20 degrees and below for weeks on end. That could happen this winter. But it certainly didn't happen last year. If it does, then yes, there'll be a lot of opportunity, for widespread maneuver, if the Russians have the forces to do it.",
