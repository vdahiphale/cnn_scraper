He's here to answer that question, alongside former Republican presidential candidate, and Trump's Ambassador to Russia, Jon Huntsman. Plus, the top progressive, in the House -- the top Democrat in the House, I should note, is now apologizing, after calling Israel, a racist state, as the bipartisan backlash, on Capitol Hill, is only growing. And also, my exclusive sit-down, with Georgia's GOP governor, Brian Kemp. He famously withstood Trump's 2020 pressure campaign. Will he support him, if he's the Republican nominee? I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Senator Joe Manchin has a long history of keeping his Democratic Party guessing. But tonight, he's creating a new stir, after speaking at a Town Hall, in the critical early primary state of New Hampshire. This was, on behalf of No Labels, which is a non-profit group that is considering, running a third-party candidate, in the 2024 presidential election. Critics say it's a spoiler that could pull moderate votes, from President Biden, and instead give Trump, the keys to the White House, once again. But the Group says that they are not thinking that far ahead, right now. Instead arguing that America deserves a better choice, than Donald Trump, or Joe Biden. As for Senator Manchin, he's not ruling out a third-party run, but also says don't call him a spoiler either. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JOE MANCHIN (D-WV): I've never been in any race I've ever spoiled. I've been in races to win. And if I get in a race, I'm going to win. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, this commonsense roadmap is not something that we just got out, and made up. This is a reflection of where the American people are. So, that's number one. Number two, No Labels is undertaking this pretty unprecedented and audacious approach, to getting on every state's ballot, which I don't think has ever been done before, by an outside group. It's long. It's tedious. It's expensive. And so, you'll have, in a sense, a delivery system, should the political, the mainstream political system produce the same results, in 2024, as it did in 2020, in which case, three-fourths of the American voters have said \"No, not again. We want an option.\" And if I had $1 for every person who stopped me to say, \"Why is it that we never have an option outside of just the mainstream party results?\" Well, this is providing, for the first time, the American people, a potential option, with a delivery system that actually will connect with every state in America.",

And both parties think they have to retreat. That's not where the American people are. And if they can see this movement, where people said, \"Wait a minute. We want commonsense solutions to commonsense problems that we have every day?\" They won't talk about the immigration problems that we have, having an immigration policy that absolutely shuts down the border, makes it secured, and then having a pathway with worker visas, so we have more good workers, in our country, and make states responsible. A debt that's out of control, and inflation? We have streets that aren't safe today. People are scared. And your schools become a killing field.

But the very fact that we're having a conversation about minimizing or limiting people's choices, and participation, in the greatest democracy that ever was is a little disconcerting. So, having lived in places, like China and Russia, where people have no choice, where there is no talk, about expanding access, to the ballot box, where there is no right to assemble, and express your feelings, in a free and open fashion? These are the traditions that we cherish in this country. And when people start talking about, \"Well, you've got to limit this or that because the outcomes might be A, B, or C,\" is just very anti- American. And it just doesn't resonate with me. And I don't think it resonates with a lot of people. But it's pre-season, in politics. There's a lot of hyperbole, about what is going on here, and about what it all might mean.

And this emerged -- this country emerged from that. So, it was a painful thing to say, and, I think, a thoughtless thing to say. Doesn't undercut the fact that the issue needs to be thought through. The President obviously has concerns about it, because he is promoting, still promoting a two-state solution. But I will say this. Even as we're having this discussion? There are hundreds of thousands of people, in the streets of a pretty vibrant democracy, in Israel, to protest what Netanyahu wants to do, in terms of the judiciary, there, and undermining the rule of law. And that, to me, speaks to the vibrancy of -- those people want fair treatment of minorities, in that country, and so on. So, I think there's more nuance to this issue than she recognized.",
