I'll ask former Defense Secretary Mark Esper for his take on why Reed was in Ukraine more than a year after his hard-won release from Kremlin custody.Also tonight, new questions about Special Counsel Jack Smith's grand jury schedule as a potential third indictment of Donald Trump looms. We'll explore why there are indications the panel did not meet today as had been widely expected. And a fresh sign of the struggles for Ron DeSantis and his presidential bid. The Republican drastically cutting his campaign staff as he aims for a reset and some traction against Trump. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. Our top story tonight, a former American prisoner of Russia wounded on the battlefield in Ukraine. Let's go right to CNN's Alex Marquardt. He is in the Ukraine war zone for us. He's got more on the revelations about Marine veteran Trevor Reed. What are you learning, Alex? ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, let's start with what we do know because there's lots that we're still trying to figure out. Now what we do know is that former Marine Trevor Reed was fighting here in Ukraine. He was injured while he was fighting. We're told that he was then taken to the capital Kyiv for his first medical treatment before he was sent then to Germany. We understand that an NGO which has not yet been identified helped Trevor Reed get to Germany where he is now being treated at the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center. That is a U.S. medical military facility near Ramstein Air Base. He is still there currently being treated. But big questions still remain, Wolf, where he was when he got injured, how he got injured specifically, how long he had been fighting in Ukraine, and who he was fighting with. So those questions still remain, Wolf. We have to remind our viewers that Trevor Reed was held in Russia for some three years before being exchanged for a Russian prisoner. According to the Biden administration, he was being wrongfully detained. He was then returned to the U.S. last year, 2022. We are now told the Biden administration is aware that Reed was fighting in Ukraine, and that he was injured -- Wolf.",

And they are reiterating that no U.S. citizen should travel to Ukraine at all, let alone to participate in the fighting.Now this is of course kind of an awkward situation for the Biden administration because, as Alex mentioned, Trevor Reed was secured, his release was secured by the U.S. in a prisoner swap back in April of 2022 where the U.S. traded a convicted drug smuggler, Russian drug smuggler for Trevor Reed's release. And they are still negotiating the release of multiple Americans who have been detained in Russia, including the \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter Evan Gershkovich as Paul Whelan, who is also a former Marine. Now the State Department today in a briefing, a spokesperson reiterated that Trevor Reed was acting in his private capacity. He is a former Marine, but he was not doing anything on behalf of the United States, and of course reemphasized that no U.S. citizen should travel there at all. Here's what he said.

Because it raises the value, right?It gives Putin leverage to do -- to swap for some other type of Russian of greater value. It also could put pressure on Moscow from the far right in that country who might say, look, we swapped an American. And clearly, you know, he is an agent of the United States government. That's why I think Washington is trying so hard to make clear that he was over there on his own accord, as a private citizen, and not in any type of relationship with the United States government in doing so.",

They damaged this one. It was able to make it back to the airfield. But I think this is a routine, a pattern that's going to continue, if not escalate. And I think it requires a response.I mean, we recall what happened earlier this year I think in March when Russian aircraft forced away the Reaper drone in the Black Sea. It caused some harm. It went down. And what didn't get attention after the fact was that the Pentagon put out orders to pour our surveillance flights I think 50 miles away from where they were flying which I imagine probably hurt our ability to conduct surveillance and reconnaissance in those things. And, look, I suppose Moscow saw that there was benefit from doing that and we backed off and maybe they're trying to do the same here, which is why again I think we need to push back on this. I argued at the time that maybe we have to put fighter caps up there as well to protect these aircraft to signal to the Russians that we're not going to be pushed around in Syria or anywhere else.

And as part of that, we expect the judge to set a date for when the sentencing will move ahead. Prosecutors as part of this deal are going to be asking for probation. But again it's ultimately up to the judge to decide what the sentence should be in this case. And as you may imagine, there is plenty of political fanfare around this. Republicans in the House of Representatives have been very interested in Hunter Biden, the Biden family's business dealings, as well as this investigation. And the chairman, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee even wrote to the judge in this case today saying as part of this plea deal, you should consider what we've heard from IRS whistleblowers, these allegations that there was some political interference as part of this case. Of course, we've heard many denials about this from the White House as well as from David Weiss, the U.S. attorney who has debunked a number of the claims from the whistleblowers and even said he's willing to come to Congress and testify in the next couple of months to set the record straight.

Last night we obtained many of them. We had a chance to read over them. And Wolf, I can say there isn't a lot of there-there. There's absolutely no evidence of fraud. It looks like they had just started their investigation. It hadn't really yielded much.

There is precious little -- they have to make a decision about whether they want to move forward with any impeachment proceeding as the speaker himself has threatened to impeach the Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas as well as Merrick Garland, the attorney general. But the recognition is that simply it will not be enough time politically and otherwise to try to move on multiple impeachments. So they're increasingly setting their sights on Joe Biden himself. This after allegations that Joe Biden was involved with Hunter Biden's business dealings, and allegations from an FBI informant that have been unverified but such that Joe Biden was involved in some sort of bribery scheme with a foreign national back at a time when Biden was vice president. Now the White House has denied those unfair allegations. And I asked the speaker himself whether or not Republicans have corroborated Joe Biden's ties to Hunter Biden's business dealings. And he indicated that it would be up to an impeachment inquiry to determine whether or not they can get this information, which is why he believes that may be the right course of action.

And now it's like we'll impeach, details to be determined. To quote the great Logan Roy, these are not serious people. But it is serious what they're doing and it is seriously damaging to our democracy.",

But what McCarthy and Republicans are doing is they're following the evidence and the information. And what they're seeing is the story has changed.For years, President Biden and his administration has said he has absolutely no knowledge of Hunter's foreign business dealings. Well, yesterday, the story is that he was not in business with Hunter. That's a different story. That's singing from a different playbook. And this comes on the heels of we're going to get information next week from one of Hunter's business partners, Devin Archer, who has, from what I understand from people in the House, information that completely contradicts the president's denials of involvement with Hunter's business. And this is going to paint a new picture and this is certainly going to put the president in a different light. And I think they're waiting, they're being very cautious and they're following the information as this comes forward.",

Hank Gathers, back in March of 1990, dying on the basketball court at Loyola Marymount in Los Angeles. He played his freshman year at USC as well. And that one was so tragic now, 33 years ago, but still very much front and center. The difference there is no one was able to revive Hank Gathers.And in this case, as we know from Damar Hamlin, which was just six and a half months ago, as, of course, the NFL, the Buffalo Bills, a very scary and awful scene that so many people saw on national television. He not only was revived, he was out of the hospital within a few weeks. And he is back and is apparently okay and able to play football again. And so the advances in medicine and I think also, Wolf, the advances in the general public understanding defibrillators, the fact that you have to be able to learn CPR to be able to revive someone, especially in youth sports, it's not just about the professionals or even college players like Bronny, but it's also about kids playing all kinds of sports. And that conversation, as you know, well, has only enhanced over the last, well, several years, but certainly in the last six months since Damar Hamlin. And we don't know, but it may well be that that intensity of knowledge and concern may have helped in this case. Again, we don't know that but it's certainly possible that that is the case as well.",

Now, this rule that is in question here, it disqualifies most people from applying for asylum if they didn't cross the border legally and with an appointment. So, anyone who crosses illegally or anyone who presents at a port of entry without an appointment would be disqualified from applying for asylum or if they are unable to prove that they sought legal protections in another country before arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border. And this policy, Wolf, has indeed seen border crossing numbers plummet in the last several months it has been in effect. And this was the Biden administration's response to the end of that COVID-era Title 42, which we know was a crucial authority that the Biden administration was using at the border. Now, this judge said that had previously ruled against a similar Trump administration-era policy. He said last week in oral arguments that he saw these two policies as very similar. The Biden administration, of course, disagrees. But the question is, if this stay is not extended, what that will mean for border crossing numbers, because, again, this policy has been central to keeping those numbers down so far. But, again, many more challenges facing this law both on the right and the left. Wolf?",
