There is a deal out there for you. More than $13 billion could be spent today. Sara is out shopping. I'm John Berman with Kate Bolduan. This is CNN News Central. This morning, new fallout from President Biden's decision to do something he had said he would never do, pardon his son, Hunter. President-elect Trump is weighing in, as are Republican lawmakers and Democrats. This has the potential to affect the confirmations of Trump nominees and possible pardons for January 6th criminals. Hunter was due to be sentenced this month. Now, he will not, nor can he be prosecuted for any other possible federal crimes possibly committed in a ten-year period. His father wrote, in trying to break Hunter, they have tried to break me. No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter's case can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son, and that is wrong. Now, we are waiting to hear from the president this morning on this. He is traveling to Angola in Africa. CNN's Arlette Saenz is already there. Arlette, what's the White House saying about this?",

      "sentences": "Well, John, President Biden said that he is issuing a full and unconditional pardon of his son, Hunter Biden, a stunning reversal, given the fact that President Biden and his senior team had said for months that he would not make this move. President Biden said he ultimately made this decision as a father, but he also firmly believes that Hunter Biden was maligned by Republican and that the charges against him were politically motivated.In a statement released late Sunday night before he departed for Angola, the president wrote, quote, I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice. And once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further. I hope Americans will understand why a father and a president would come to this decision. Now, this statement in no way references the fact that the president had repeatedly said he would not pardon his son, Hunter, who had been charged and found guilty relating to some gun charges and was also facing tax charges as well. But take a listen to President Biden's denials that he would pardon his son, Hunter, both before and after that felony gun conviction in the state of Delaware. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He had reached this decision over the weekend as he had huddled with his family in Nantucket, Massachusetts. I'm told that the president had started to tell his senior team on Saturday evening that he planned to issue this pardon and directed them to start preparing to release it on Sunday evening. But for President Biden, this is certainly something that he has wrestled with at a long time on both a political and a personal level, and this will go down as a key piece of his legacy going forward, as he issued this pardon of his son.",

Both men now seeming to agree the Justice Department has been politicized and that definitely is not lost on the president-elect, Donald Trump, quickly trying to equate the Hunter Biden pardon to those convicted of crimes from the January 6th riots.CNN's Alayna Treene is in West Palm Beach, Florida, for us this morning tracking all of it. And, Alayna, what are you hearing from Trump's team about all of this today?",

      "sentences": "Well Kate, as you mentioned, Donald Trump moved quickly to kind of capitalize on this moment and use it as, you know, an opportunity to say, well, what about the January 6th people who were convicted for their crimes on January 6th. And it really is going to, I think, raise expectations for what Donald Trump will do with that promise that he had made repeatedly on the campaign trail to pardon those who were convicted for crimes for their role that day.I'm going to read for you what he said. He wrote, quote, does the parting gift given by Joe to Hunter include the Jan. 6 hostages who have now been imprisoned for years, such an abuse and miscarriage of justice. Now, again, he mentioned the word hostages. That is a term Donald Trump used repeatedly as well on the campaign trail when describing those who were convicted for committing crimes for the January 6 Capitol attack. But one thing that's been very interesting, Kate, is that I know many of Donald Trump supporters have really anticipated and expected him to follow through on that pledge and to, in some cases, grant maximum clemency to even those who have committed, you know -- excuse me, who have committed some of the most violent crimes on that day. But ever since the election, Donald Trump has not spoken about this. And I've asked his team about this, the transition team, and they haven't really given me any indication that they were moving forward and working on this right now. They said that that's something that will be discussed later down the line once Donald Trump were to be sworn in. So, I think this is kind of providing an opening now to reopen those discussions and really shining a light on what Donald Trump will do. Now, I will also argue that you know, we've seen a lot of Republicans use what happened with Hunter Biden and the pardon that Biden has given him to really argue that it's the current sitting president who is the one who has weaponized the Department of Justice, not the former president. And this could also give them an opening to kind of more so embrace Kash Patel, someone who has really argued that he wants to reform the FBI and the Justice Department because of these types of things.

Well, there's no question, and I know from my conversations with Trump's team and those working on this, is that he will likely have a very contentious and uphill Senate confirmation battle. I was actually talking to the team about this specifically, and they said, you know, Donald Trump in recent days was actually wavering between two people. He knew that he wanted to remove Christopher Wray from being FBI director and install someone else, but he was wavering between Kash Patel and attorney general -- Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey.Some people close to the president had argued that, you know, they were skeptical of Patel given the controversy surrounding him and also the expectations that he would have a tough time going through his Senate confirmation process. But there's also the people that Donald Trump views as closest to him, the people he trusts the most that were really pushing Patel on him, including his sons, Eric and Donald Trump Jr., as well as Stephen Miller, the incoming deputy chief of staff, and so all to say there were questions before he had selected Patel. But Donald Trump I was told really wanted someone who would be his legal pit bull, someone who would try to root out the bias that he sees as permeating the bureau for the last several years. Kate?",

We'll show you. As much as 20 inches of snow piled up in Buffalo, New York, as the Bills are taking on the 49ers. You can see, obviously, the Bills won. Bill's head coach and quarterback made snow angels after their win last night, because they also couldn't feel their appendages after playing in that for hours.

So, this is the nature of lake-effect snowfall.So, we time lapsed and kind of sped up the radar over the past weekend, and you can see these bands that set up with the wind that came right over the warm lake waters and how localized that snow banding is. But where those bands set up, that's where we get the heaviest of snowfall just south of Buffalo. This is incredible, Buffalo Airport, one inch, Orchard Park about ten miles to the south, over two feet. So, yes, that is incredible. And you don't want to be traveling along Interstate 90. That's where they had stalled out vehicles, Interstate 81 over eastern sections just downwind of Lake Ontario. There is still more snow to come as we continue with this northwesterly wind across portions of the Great Lakes with another storm system approaching by the second half of this week.
