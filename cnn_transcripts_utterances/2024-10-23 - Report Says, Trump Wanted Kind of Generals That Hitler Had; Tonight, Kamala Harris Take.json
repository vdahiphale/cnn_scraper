What we are learning about her closing argument in battleground Pennsylvania.Plus, more than 23 million Americans have already voted. We've got new CNN reporting this morning, and the surprising headline about early voting. And later, the issue everyone says that they care about the most, the economy. We will fact-check each candidate's tax plans and what that will mean for your wallet. Good morning. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington. All right, but we begin with shocking and disturbing revelations about former President Donald Trump and a new piece in The Atlantic. Trump's former White House chief of staff, retired Marine Corps General John Kelly, confirms Trump said he wants his military commanders to be like, quote, German generals. To that, Kelly apparently replied to the president at that time, do you mean the Kaisers generals? Surely you can't mean Hitler's generals. And to that, Trump said, yes, yes, Hitler's generals. General Kelly is also sounding the alarm about Trump to The New York Times, telling the paper his former boss meets the definition of a, quote, fascist. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Certainly the former president is in the far right area, he's certainly an authoritarian, admires people who are dictators. He has said that. So, he certainly falls into the into the general definition of a fascist, for sure.(END VIDEO CLIP) ACOSTA:  Now, this is not a one-off. General Kelly is just one in a growing list of former Trump officials who are speaking out in the strongest terms against the former president. Trump's vice president, Mike Pence, said, it should come as no surprise that I will not be endorsing Donald Trump this year. Former chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Mark Milley, quote, Trump is fascist to the core and the most dangerous person to this country. And Trump's former defense secretary, Mark Esper, called Trump a, quote, threat to democracy. And another revelation from The Atlantic, the magazine says Trump told the family of service member Vanessa Guillen, who was bludgeoned to death with a hammer, that he would pay for her funeral. But when Trump found out it would cost $60,000, he reportedly said, quote, it doesn't cost $60,000 bucks to bury an effing Mexican. The Trump campaign is denying both of these exchanges, calling the reporting absolutely false and an outrageous lie. I want to discuss all of this doubt with Khizr Khan. He is a gold star father who lost his son, Army Captain Humayun Khan, while he was deployed in Iraq. He is supporting Vice President Harris in this election. Khizr Khan, it's good to see you again. I really appreciate it. What's your reaction to this latest reporting and what retired General John Kelly is saying about the former president, that he, at one point, expressed that he wanted to have Hitler's generals?",

He's standing in that Section 60. Look at the disgraceful behavior of Donald Trump. He says, I wonder what is in it for them, asking as if service means nothing to him. And then again on 24 August this year, standing in Arlington Cemetery at the grave of our heroes with the families, the most honorable family of our heroes that have given their all standing in Arlington Cemetery.

Congressman, I want to talk about the town hall, I do want to talk about the issue of immigration in just a moment, but, first, your reaction to this new reporting in The Atlantic citing two sources who heard then-President Trump saying he needed to have generals like Adolf Hitler had and also General Kelly's comments to The New York Times confirming much of this. How concerned are you by these comments? REP. JOAQUIN CASTRO (D-TX):  I mean, those comments are the most alarming that you can get about a prospective presidential candidate. You think about it, General Milley, now General Kelly and other generals have said that they consider Donald Trump a fascist, that he fits the definition of a fascist. And some of these folks are people that worked right alongside him or under him in his administration. And so, you know, that is essentially sounding a huge alarm for the American people about what kind of president Donald Trump would be.",

In the last administration, he chose people who, some of them, ultimately stood up to him and tried to buck some of the unconstitutional things that he was trying to do.This time, I think they're all going to be like Stephen Miller. They're all going to be extreme far right people who not only will do whatever he says, but they in fact are as extreme as he is.

And so she's talked about an opportunity economy that's built around well-paying jobs, strong schools and universities, a strong healthcare system where people can get covered and they don't have to have diabetes or some other illness and suffer with it.

It should be a big red flag, not only for Latinos, but for all Americans, that this man could become president within a matter of a few weeks.I think that what we have to be careful about with Donald Trump is that he has taken on this kind of vibe of counterculture. So, he's come to represent for some folks, basically sticking the finger at the system. And there are a lot of folks that feel left out by the system, disadvantaged by the system. And so some folks have tended to gravitate to this guy that seems to be against the system as well. But, remember, this is a guy who has done nothing for working class people, has been hostile to unions, for example, has complained about having to pay overtime to people. This is somebody who doesn't want to help out those who are drowning with student debt. You know, he criticized Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for relieving students of student debt. So, this isn't somebody who's trying to create opportunity for Latino families or any family, any American families, except for the very oligarchy of people, the very top billionaire class of people that he pals around with, and that's who Donald Trump is. So, he's not counterculture at all. He, in fact, is a very creation of a system that has benefited very wealthy folks in this country for quite some time.",

I mean, you know, involved in our -- you know, in supporting the American economy in all sorts of different ways and what effect is that going to have? And to be honest with you, you can go and check out the interview. There wasn't a very substantial answer about that. And so I think people do have to really think about this when we're talking deportation. Of course, there needs to be a stick and not just a carrot.
