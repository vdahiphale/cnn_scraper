Russian state media released footage of Kim Jong-un's private armored train rolling up to the railway station in the city of come some loss on Komsomolsk-on-Amur, where he's reportedly touring an aircraft plant. Kim is expected to visit several military related sites following his high stakes summit with the Russian president amid Midwestern concerns about a possible arms agreement. The Kremlin has confirmed the two leaders will meet again in Pyongyang but did not reveal when. We're also hearing some of the gifts they exchanged during their talks on Wednesday were locally made firearms. Well looming large over this closely watch summit is China. CNN's Paula Hancocks explains. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It is Kim Jong-un's first known trip outside of North Korea in more than four years. Not to China, the country that's propped his country up for decades, but Russia, historically North Korea's second-closest ally. ANDREI LANKOV, PROFESSOR, KOOKMIN UNIVERSITY: He is basically hedging against possible change in Chinese position. China might make a deal behind his back with the Americans. China might get in serious economic trouble. HANCOCKS (voice-over): Beijing has said the Putin-Kim meeting is a matter for those two countries, but in recent years has made a clear move towards Russia as relations with the United States worsen. Xi Jinping has met Vladimir Putin 40 times in 10 years. That's according to U.S. think tank CSIS, in bilateral and multilateral settings. The Kremlin says another meeting is upcoming. While China is not believed to have provided arms to Russia, an unclassified report by U.S. intelligence says it has given technology that is helping Moscow in its war on Ukraine. Xi's no-show at the recent G20 in India also points to his diplomatic priorities.",

We do begin tonight with Rugby World Cup action from France where the host nation taken to the field of play looking to make it back to back wins against South American opponents Uruguay.The tournament resuming after three rest days and resuming I will say under very somber circumstances indeed, in Lille on Thursday night. These the heavy poignant scenes then ahead of kickoff ahead of the national anthems of both countries. Both teams coming together in a moment of silence here and indeed solidarity for victims of the Libya floods and Morocco earthquake. Really such a devastating heartbreaking loss of life we have witnessed in both of those countries over the course of the last few days. Tournament organizers as well rugby saying the global rugby family standing in solidarity with the people of Libya and Morocco at this extremely difficult time. As for the united self, the two countries going head to head at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy in Lille on Thursday. Amazing opening here from Uruguay after fantastic buildup, Nicolas Freitas going over in the corner of a South American country with a first try of the match. Now the French really stung into action. And it would be a blur fly half Antoine Hastoy respond in style for the World Cup host, France, 13 points to five ahead at the break. Uruguay fighting valiantly though. And their wonderful spirit is rewarded when Baltazar Amaya showing terrific skill and composure, powering his way over the line for a superb try and a successful conversion. All of a sudden, it was a one point game France 13 to 12, a slender advantage. What a game we had though. Moments later though, France right back at their opponents Felipe Etcheverry kicking the clearance right into his own teammate, that bounces kind for Peato Mauvaka he goes over for a really important try to give his team some breathing room. And just for good measure the host ceiling it, I want a special moment here for 20-year-old Louis Bielle-Biarrey, his first ever World Cup try, a moment the youngster will say that for a long time to come. France win it in the end 27 points to 12. Great performance though I will say by the Uruguayans. All right, Friday action at the Rugby World Cup seeing three time World Champs New Zealand looking to get back to winning ways after losing that superb tournament opener against the French in Paris the. All Blacks facing Namibia into loser on Friday, looking to try and study the ship not just after that loss to the French, but also remember their heaviest ever defeat in test play which came at the hands recently of South Africa in their final warm up game. By the way that defeated France the first time the All Blacks had ever lost the World Cup pool game. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
