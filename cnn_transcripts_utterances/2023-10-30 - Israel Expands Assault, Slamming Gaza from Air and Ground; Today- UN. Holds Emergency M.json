In Gaza, fireball after fireball, the result of airstrikes pounding the Gaza Strip. Israeli troops also on the ground in Gaza now. The Israeli military says it has killed dozens of what it termed Hamas terrorists overnight.The Israeli military has started a new phase of war, sending more ground troops into Gaza. They are targeting Hamas's complex tunnel system where more than 200 hostages are believed to be kept. According to the Palestinian health ministry in Gaza the death toll in Gaza has reached nearly 8,000 people since the war broke out. We also should mention that save the children says more children have been killed in Gaza in these past three weeks than globally over a four- year period. Today, U.N. security officials say they will hold an emergency meeting as the White House now warns of an elevated risk of war spreading in the Middle East. Right now, 59 aid trucks are waiting to cross into Gaza from the Rafah Border, from Egypt. President Biden is urging for more assistance as International Red Cross officials call the humanitarian crisis in Gaza right now a catastrophic failing. But we begin first with the ground incursion. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is in Sderot for us, just about a mile from the Gaza border. Jeremy, tell us what you're seeing and what you're hearing today.",

On the Gaza Strip, there is still a desperate fight for survival, the humanitarian crisis is there now urgent and there are more and more people who desperately need aid in Gaza. In Gaza, there is new information being reported from the charity organization Save the Children who, as we mentioned, say that more children have been killed in Gaza during this short period of war than globally over just a four-year period. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz is in London looking at the critical situation and the emergency U.N. meeting that is happening. Salma, the call for a pause in fighting a ceasefire, if you will, will be at the forefront of the discussions in just a few hours but there has been already a vote where most nations did vote for a ceasefire but 14 did not.

There is absolutely, Sara, a global outcry against that crisis that is spiraling out of control.I know some of the latest images that came out of Gaza are just a sign of how desperate it is. The U.N. says one of its warehouses, people went inside trying to grab basic survival supplies. They say those 2 million people, half of them children, trapped, sealed into the Gaza Strip, are now facing starvation on top of facing the bombardment and the siege, of course, that has been in place now for three weeks. You mentioned that very important vote last week in the U.N. General Assembly. Overwhelmingly, U.N. nations voting for a humanitarian truce. That is nonbinding. Now, the UAE is calling for another U.N. Security Council meeting today at 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time. The hope is to pass a binding resolution that would require Israel to pause. But there is no sign of that, of course, happening at all on the ground. Prime Minister Netanyahu so far undeterred, in fact, only intensifying these attacks, warning this is just the beginning. And, again, speaking on those civilians trapped inside that enclave, desperate to find refuge, desperate to find help, desperate for some safety. I want to bring you some images from Al Quds Hospital, if we can roll those, this is one of the hospitals in Gaza City, one of two major hospitals in Gaza City. They say they've received multiple evacuation orders, Sara, to leave that hospital, but just imagine trying to evacuate patients, wounded people, elderly, pregnant, children, while bombs rain down, while artillery is fired, somehow to the south of the Gaza Strip where there is no safety there as well. And these hospitals are not just medical centers anymore, Sara. Some 1,400 people are estimated to be sheltering in that hospital because they believe it's the only place where they might get a bit of safety and even that is not guaranteed. Again, Save the Children calling these grave violations of epic proportions.",

They're going to fight this unconventionally in a conventional manner, whereas Hamas thought that Israel would come in heavy, come in hard, chase them down tunnels, all these traps that have been set. From my indication so far as I'm watching this, they're being slow and very deliberate, knowing full well that the center of gravity for the military is Gaza City.",

It's certainly something that has law enforcement officials all across this state and really across the country concerned about this. You know, whether these signs were missed, whether more aggressive action should have been taken by the local sheriff's office where the shooter lived.So what we've learned is that when the National Guard became concerned about information that they had received about the shooter, they notified the local sheriff's office in Sagadahoc County. This is -- Joe Merry is the sheriff there, they called his office and he dispatched one of his sergeants to investigate. And over the course of several days, they did investigate. They want to his home. Initially, he wasn't there, but there's new information indicating that he may have been at the home and, in fact, the sergeant from the sheriff's office was at the home, thought he heard him inside, but was concerned about him being inside and his own safety, the sheriff sergeant's own safety, that he called another unit in, but then he didn't really do anything. You know, he got information that the shooter may have been armed at that time, so he was raising all sorts of questions about his own safety, and then it's not very clear what happens after that and how much more investigating authorities did. What the sheriff has said to \"The Associated Press\" and \"The New York Times\" is that he issued an alert on the man, but we don't know what that alert entailed. We know that there was a missing persons report filed by the sheriff's office, but beyond that we don't know. So, obviously, this is raising all sorts of questions because there were signs, law enforcement had information that he was potentially threatening a mass shooting, there were warning signs everywhere from the national guard to family members. Why this wasn't further investigated is now a big question and obviously for the families, you know, hearing this information will be very, very troubling.
