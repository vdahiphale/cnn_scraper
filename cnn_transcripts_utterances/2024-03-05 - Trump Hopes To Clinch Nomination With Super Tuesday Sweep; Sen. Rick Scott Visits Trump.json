It's great to have you. The biggest voting day of the 2024 presidential primary is here. Pretty soon voters are going to be voting in 15 states. They head to the polls this morning with more than one-third of all the delegates up for grabs. Donald Trump hoping to sweep Nikki Haley out of the race following a favorable decision from the Supreme Court. The justices ruling unanimously states like Colorado cannot kick him off the ballot. Trump urging the high court to also help him out with a favorable ruling on presidential immunity. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  When you make a decision you don't want to have your opposing party, or opponent, or even somebody that just thinks you're wrong bring a criminal suit against you or any kind of a suit when you leave office. I have that right now at a level that nobody's ever seen before. I have rogue prosecutors and I have rogue judges. I have judges that are out of control and it's a very unfair thing for me.

You have Alvin Bragg, which I think most Republicans feel that this is kind of the weakest of the cases brought against Donald Trump with the hush money up in New York State. It allows Trump -- I think what he's tried to do is try to just glom them all together. And so, he can portray a win in this as leading to a win in immunity or with the January 6 trial, which obviously isn't the case.

He's been basically antagonizing Mitch McConnell, which very few people were willing to do for many, many years. But suddenly, here he was willing to kind of stick thorns in McConnell's side.

So whoever emerges out of that top fight can't get that second role. I think what Rick Scott likely is doing is making a bet that the Senate with Mitch McConnell gone will turn into a little bit more like House leadership where he can be that kind of antagonizing force close to Trump. Whether he's president or not, there will still be a power base there and he can kind of chirp from the sidelines and play that person who is in Trump's ear who can be the Trump advocate in the Senate.

I think of this in two ways.First of all, I think for Nikki Haley, it's difficult to see a place for her in today's Republican Party, which is essentially the party of Trump. It is the America First party. So even if Trump were to be elected again, four years from now we see it as the America First party. It seems like Nikki Haley has essentially been pushed out of that mold. Now, at the other end of this, I think there's also the question of what is her end game. Is she thinking of 2028? Is she thinking of something this year after the primaries? Would she do some sort of a third party? It's hard to see how she would do a third-party win at this point, logistically. Remember, RFK Jr. is still trying to get on the ballot in a number of these states. So it's going to be difficult. And also, look, if she were to go that -- you know, that direction and not honor the RNC pledge, it's hard to see how she would be forgiven in the Republican Party and do any future run.

So there's a real wild card. We hear a lot about the DNC pushing back against him. I think you're also hearing the RNC very much changing their tone because he is such a wild card going forward.
