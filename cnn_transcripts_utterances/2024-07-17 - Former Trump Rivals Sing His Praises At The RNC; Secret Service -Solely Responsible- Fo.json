The Secret Service director telling CNN that the agency was \"solely responsible\" -- OK -- for implementing security at the Trump rally that turned deadly over the weekend. This comes just days after she told ABC News, \"There was local police in that building. There was local police in that area that were responsible for the outer perimeter of the building.\" The building she refers to there is the one where the gunman who attempted to assassinate Donald Trump fired from. Now, Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle clarifying those comments. She told CNN this. \"What I was trying to stress was that we just divided up areas of responsibility and they provided support to those areas of responsibility.\" I have been sort of trying to parse exactly how the Secret Service director has been dealing with this because yesterday, it was really a -- it seemed like a very specific pass the buck situation to the local police in a relatively small town, right? This was not -- they were not working with, like, the New York City police department here.

But he understood it to guarantee the people's right to overthrow their government, which is inconsistent with law and order. I mean, that's a really thoughtful analysis. And so, he -- that's why I think he struck me as somebody who might have a real role to play in changing Republican politics in the 2000s and 2010s from being sort of an obstructionist party of no culturally or aggressive party, quite candidly, to being some kind of a party in the future.
