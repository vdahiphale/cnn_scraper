We start to take note of the votes against Jim Jordan. Remember he can only afford three House Republicans voting against him. We have a few in the beads that we're going to keep an eye on.The next one that we're going to keep an eye on is Vern Buchanan of Florida. He voted for Jordan yesterday, but he slip, he might peel away. Also, Ken Buck of Colorado. So those are the ones that we're keeping an eye on in the bees. We anticipate that Congressman Jordan will not be able to get the 217 votes he needs today. So, it's 217 or 216, David Chalian, that we need today 217 -- -",

The next one that we're going to be paying attention to is Vern Buchanan, which comes in a few votes, again Vern Buchanan of Florida voted for Jordan yesterday.But we anticipate that there are going to be a few Republicans who voted for Jordan yesterday in a show of spirit. But now are going to start voting against him that he's going to start to lose votes in this second ballot. So, let's listen in Buchanan and Buck are the next two that were really have our ears peeled. ears peeled for. Let's listen in that.",

And then we have Vern Buchanan of Florida voting for Byron Donalds, his follow Floridian, and then Ken Buck of Colorado voting again for Tom Emmer. That is three no votes. He lost a vote there because Vern Buchanan voted for Jim Jordan yesterday.So again, this is as of now worse for him than it was yesterday. He could still pick up votes. It's possible that people who voted against him yesterday will vote for him. And again, you know, none of these votes are final until the gavel comes down. People change their votes, even after they have voted no, they might change to yes. After they vote, yes, they might change to no. But as of right now, if I were Jim Jordan, I would be feeling worse. But the next names we're going to be looking for in the seas were in the crustiest right now are Chavez-DeRemer from Oregon, she voted for McCarthy yesterday. She's in a Biden district of Republican in a Biden district. Lot of Republicans in Biden districts think that Jordan is just a little too toxic for her -- for their voters. And then, so let's listen in to see what Congressman Chavez-DeRemer has to say.",

But as of right now, if I were Jim Jordan, he is doing worse than he did yesterday.We'll be looking next, Congressman D'Esposito of New York, and Congressman Diaz-Balart. But Kasie Hunt, once again, I'm kind of confused as to why Congressman Jim Jordan yesterday and then again today felt the need to call this vote, given that he did not have the 217 votes sewn up. And yet, I guess in some sort of show of force, which force that he did not have, he decided that he wanted to force the issue.",

He had spent years fundraising for people, recruiting people to run for Congress, negotiating with people, putting people on committees.And there was a sense of loyalty to McCarthy that wasn't strong enough the second time. But there was that sense that he could go many rounds and eventually wear people down. With Jordan, it worked in the other direction. I mean, we have Vern Buchanan of Florida, which is a flip from Tuesday. And you're going to see more flips, I think, from people who feel that, you know, if he's going to lose, I'm not going to be with him and take that political risk, particularly if you're among those more moderate Republicans. I mean, yesterday, he lost a half dozen of them. We'll see if he loses more today.",

And what is noteworthy is that, you know, when you look back at the only other time that we've covered anything close to this, which is in January, when Kevin McCarthy did this 15 times. He didn't go down. He didn't get worse. He got better or he stayed the same. And that is certainly not where Jim Jordan is right now.So, what is happening on the House floor right now, as the reality is there, Jim Jordan will not become speaker in this vote. It is what's next. And we had been talking earlier about these very real conversations going on about giving Patrick McHenry who was the temporary speaker, more power. And as these conversations have become more and more public, I am told that the opposition, particularly from the right inside the conference has become more loud, stronger. And I had just one text from somebody who wants this to happen eventually, who said we should be cautious. Because the quote was timing is everything in politics. And forgive me, I'm outside the Capitol, there's obviously law enforcement going behind me. But the timing is everything in politics. And the timing may not be right yet, for that to happen. And the reason is because the House Republicans are quite split on this, because Republicans in order to give Patrick McHenry more power in order to get the basic business and functions of the government done. They'll need Democratic support. And that is a very divisive notion inside the House Republican Conference.",

To have to run it, is not something that a lot of Republicans in the House or a lot of Republican voters want to have happen. But that's where the eight people who overthrew Kevin McCarthy have put the Republican Party, a majority party in numbers, but not a majority party in function.And so, functionally, right now, because of the close nature of the House and these eight people, it's hard to argue that the Republicans have a functioning majority. And so, if you're a Republican voter out there a donor, or you know, somebody who just wants to see Republicans do well. You have to be incredibly disappointed. But that's what it might come to now, the larger American people may look at this and say, well, maybe they should work together a little bit. And, you know, if you just watched us on television today, for the second straight day, saying that they just sit around and say each other's names all day. What are they going to do something for me? And so, I think it's in everyone's best interest to get a resolution of some kind.",
