Are we the exceptional and indispensable beacon for the world, or are we and our fellow Americans, angry, depressed, pessimistic, fearful? Are we beaten down by inflation and the presence of millions of migrants who poured across our southern border? These two visions of America, one bright, one dark, are increasingly the proxies for the two candidates, Vice President Kamala Harris, former President Donald Trump. You might think that voters would gravitate toward the glass half full. After all, it worked for Ronald Reagan in 1984. The uplifting Morning in America commercial still a benchmark against which others are judged. Barack Obama, he embraced the brand of hope. Bill Clinton, literally the man from Hope, Hope, Arkansas that is called Vice President Harris, a president of joy in his speech at the DNC. And then there was Oprah.

But the other effect that you see, I think, is he's just muddied all the waters totally so that even normal voters have kind of become pessimistic about whoever the next president is and whatever they're going to do. I was talking to a guy that runs a barber shop yesterday and he did -- he voted Trump '16, Biden '20, and he's trying to figure out what to do this time. And he was telling me he's 60-40 Trump. And it was all premised on the fact that he doesn't think either of them, they're going to get anything done, but he's like, look, I know what I'm getting with Trump.Like, I know where inflation was back then. I know what I paid in taxes and what I earned in my shop, and then I can compare that to Biden, when I kind of did worse, and so I'm leaning back toward Trump. But the interesting thing about that to me was Trump hasn't really closed the deal with him either. So while Trump's running around talking about cats and dogs like he's leaving this guy open for us to pick off if Harris runs her campaign right in the last three weeks.",

She obviously -- you know, she's not from here, and she, you know, she had a misstep on fracking when she ran for president the first time, came out against that big issue, particularly in Western Pennsylvania. And I think that, you know, she's had to better define herself, and she is still defining herself and making some adjustments. So I think she still has a bit of growth potential left.You know, obviously, we're running out of time, but this has been a very abbreviated campaign, and so people are still trying to get to know her. So, she has the growth potential. Trump ceiling is where it is about 47 percent maybe 48 percent. You know, she can probably do a little bit better, but that remains to be seen at this point.",

So like your viewers might not know, in 2022 we got more Democratic votes out of Allegheny County, where I live, out here in western Pennsylvania, than we got out of Philadelphia for the first time in history, even though Philly has like 400,000 more people. And so all I can say is, in the last two to four years, I've been asking everyone smart that I know in Philadelphia, have you got a handle on this problem, and are we fixing it? And I have not heard a convincing answer to that question yet. So I don't know what it's going to be that allows us to turn that around and get more turnout on that side of the state. I will say in Allegheny County here, which includes Pittsburgh, you know, we've been increasing our vote share every time. So I think we're -- we have a handle on it out here. It's a little smaller, a little easier to manage, but Philadelphia is an issue for us.",

Early estimates place property damage in the billions. Communities in the Tampa Bay area now grappling with water shutoffs, power outages, entire neighborhoods still under water.The costs of these storms keep rising, with early assessments for Helene, pointing to a staggering 47.5 billion in property damage, up to 30 billion in uninsured flood losses. In fact, new home buyers can now view climate risk data on platforms like Zillow, highlighting how crucial this issue has become for everyone, whether fleeing storms or planning their next move. But these aren't just isolated events. As we witness more frequent and intense hurricanes like Milton and Helene, the larger story emerges about how Americans are adjusting to a world where climate disasters are becoming the new normal. In fact, an article in \"The New York Times\" this week explored the unsettling trends of climate driven migration, predicting that millions of Americans may soon relocate, not just from flood prone coastal areas, but from regions hit hardest by extreme heat and storms and sea level rise. It's already happening. According to research from First Street, over 3.2 million people have moved out of vulnerable areas like Miami and Galveston, and 7.5 million people are expected to leave current and emerging climate abandonment areas over the next 30 years. For a deeper dive into how these climate crises are transforming our landscapes and our lives, let me turn to the man behind many of these findings, Jeremy Porter, the head of Climate Implications Research at First Street. Jeremy, thank you so much for being here. So are we at a point now where, if you're looking for a home, you say, well, how are the schools? What's the crime rate like? How are the taxes? And, oh, by the way, how much extreme weather am I going to face? DR. JEREMY PORTER, HEAD OF CLIMATE IMPLICATIONS RESEARCH, FIRST STREET: Yes, well, first, thanks for having me on. But I want to say that we are at that point. I think we're at the critical inflection point where, for decades, we've been seeing increases in the frequency and severity of weather disasters and climate events. One of the biggest problems around that exposure, though, is we haven't seen awareness increase around, you know, where, where these climate events likely to occur? How are people going to be impacted? And I think as you start to see data like ours on Zillow, on Realtor, on Redfin, all of a sudden, people at a critical point when they're buying a home, have access to an additional data point around climate so they have the information around the school quality, as you mentioned, the walkability, but now you can also start to understand what's my risk today from climate and how is that going to change it to the future. Remember, these are generally 30 year mortgages, and people are thinking about that into the future. So understanding climate risk and how that's changing is paramount to make it a smart decision.",

And we're already seeing that in historic trends where the movement from north to south has essentially gone flat.

Iran fears Israel will target its nuclear sites and oil facilities, prompting the U.S. to press Israel for a proportional response.U.S.-Israel relations, they become strained as Israel has increasingly disregarded U.S. calls for restraint. Like its recent unilateral assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. With Iran's proxy. Hezbollah weakened the U.S. Gulf allies like the UAE, calling for American intervention. The region teeters on the edge of escalation. Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states have warned they will not allow Israel to use their airspace, amplifying concerns over a potential regional war that could spike global oil prices. To discuss this urgent threat, retired U.S. Navy Admiral James Stavridis. He spent more than 30 years in the Navy, rising to become the supreme allied commander of NATO. He has just authored a great novel. It is called \"The Restless Wave,\" hit the shelves. It's a captivating read that follows a young naval officer as he faces the bloody first years of World War II. Admiral, great to have you here. What will be the U.S. role, if and when Israel responds to Iran? ADMIRAL JAMES STAVRIDIS (RET.), FORMER SUPREME ALLIED COMMANDER OF NATO: First point, I think, Iran has awoken and smelled the T in the Middle East, which is to say they're realizing the reach, and the power, and the authority of Israel. The unbroken string of success over the last couple of months by Israel against the terrorists, Hamas and Hezbollah, quite striking, that's penetrated. And as a result, Iran is pedaling furiously to try and restrain Israel. This gets us to the U.S. role. I think the U.S. will try and ensure Israel doesn't strike major civilian targets, doesn't strike the nuclear sites, doesn't strike the energy. So, first role for the U.S. is discussions about what to do. And then secondly, where I think you're going with a question, Michael, we almost certainly will be providing intelligence, cyber security, overwatch. Our aircraft carriers will be in the region as backup. But I think in the end this strike is going to be conducted by Israel for Israelis.",
