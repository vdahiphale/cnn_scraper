This exit coming just days after a bombshell CNN report uncovered racist, sexually graphic, and lewd comments made by Robinson on a porn Web site years ago.Robinson writing in a statement tonight, quote, \"I appreciate the efforts of these team members who have made the difficult choice to step away from the campaign, and I wish them well in their future endeavors. I look forward to announcing new staff roles in the coming days.\" CNN KFile senior editor Andrew Kaczynski, who broke this story, is joining us now with more details.

It's unclear where this is going to leave Robinson. We're just a month away almost from the election and now he essentially has almost no senior campaign staff. Now we did speak to Robinson ahead of our story on Thursday where he denied all of the allegations in them. Take a listen to a little bit of what he told CNN. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. GOV. MARK ROBINSON (R), NORTH CAROLINA GUBERNATORIAL NOMINEE: This is not anything that is characteristic of me nor has it ever been. I'm not going to get into the minutiae of how someone might have manufactured these salacious tabloid lies but I can tell you this. There's been over $1 million spent on me through AI.

He left biographical details on that forum, showing it was him. We saw that he got the same e-mail that he used on that forum along with his real name, which he used, he used elsewhere.

So likely setting up another fight right before the holidays, but after the presidential election.In that letter, Johnson said, quote, \"Our legislation will be very narrow, bare-bones CR including only the extensions that are absolutely necessary. While this is not the solution any of us prefer it is the most prudent path forward under the present circumstances.\" Now, we know that it does include some funding for the Secret Service. That has been a big topic on Capitol Hill following those two apparent assassination attempts against former president Donald Trump. This bill comes after, like you said, some failed attempts and Democrats are accusing Johnson of wasting time by bringing a bill last week that was opposed by most Democrats and several Republicans. He leads with a very narrow majority. But this time around they are praising bipartisan negotiations. In fact, Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said that it is free of cuts and poison pills, and Hakeem Jeffries, the minority leader in the House, he said that he thinks that there is a path forward. So a lot of hope as they go into Monday that they can at least kick the can down the road, but a few more hurdles until it arrives here on the president's desk -- Jessica.",

Good evening to both of you. Thanks for being here with us. General Hertling, let's start first with you, just taking this week as a whole. I want to know your thoughts about Israel's approach to this conflict with Hezbollah. LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, they've used electronic capabilities to set off the communication devices within the Hezbollah military wing of the terrorist organization. I talked to our colleague Jim Sciutto on Thursday about this, saying that that attack on first the beepers and then the walkie-talkies was likely meant to disrupt and cause churn within Hezbollah. And sure enough, it likely did because Israel was able to take some of the intelligence from that churn and target the following days and the missile strikes. So what you see now, in my view, and I'm sure Aaron has a view on this, too, there's a lot of churn in that terrorist organization. Ben Wedeman's report was interesting, but I'd suggest that Hezbollah is not going to be able to conduct many operations. They did do a strike, as he said, this morning with several missiles, longer range missiles in Haifa, but I don't think they're going to be able to sustain a whole lot more the kinds of strikes Hezbollah has been conducting with 30 to 50 missiles a day coming across the border prior to this. So I think we're going to see a slowing of Hezbollah's actions, but a continuation of Israel's actions.",

      "speaker": "HERTLING",
      "sentences": "Yes, it's a great question, Jessica, because this brings the scope out a little bit further. I think Israel wants to finish the fight against Hamas in Gaza. They have plans that are rumbling a little bit within the Israeli Defense Ministry as well as the government about what to do next. And there are some really -- well, let's just say bold plans being generated within the Israeli Defense Force.So that's why I think, you know, the Israeli ministers have said we are looking to escalate in order to de-escalate. They needed to strike the second front, which is Hezbollah, to keep them at bay. And I agree completely with Aaron, the fact that Hezbollah will strike only if they know they can gain a victory and they can't right now. But at the same time, Israel has to be very careful about continuing to open both of those fronts, both in the north and in the south, and potentially even some other actors from Syria, Yemen, Iraq, and other places attacking into Israel. So Israel obviously lives in a bad neighborhood. They want to tamp down things as best they can while continuing to defeat Hamas in Gaza, potentially getting the hostages back before anyone in Israel wants a second front war with Hezbollah. So that's why they're trying to tamp them down and from a military perspective.",

This is a massive Israeli counterresponse.I do worry about one thing, though, Jessica, and that is Israelis have demonstrated incredible tactical brilliance and maybe tactics ultimately is in fact the road to a strategy. But if you take a look at this situation now, there is no prospects of a ceasefire in Gaza. Prime minister of Israel today informed the Knesset committee that he believes out of 101 hostages that Hamas holds half of them are dead. Hamas is going to continue to survive as an insurgency. And in Lebanon, the Israelis face a strategic quandary. What to do about the 70,000 Israelis who are dislocated from their homes in northern Israel and Hezbollah has effectively created a security zone inside of Israel. A no-go zone where people cannot go and return to their homes. That's a real problem because those people cannot go back unless there is real assurance through Israeli military dominance that Hezbollah will not launch incursions as Hamas did on October 7th, with their elite Radwan Forces. So that's a problem. Mirroring the tactics to the ultimate strategy, and again, it's hard to believe October 7th is the first -- first anniversary, the first marking of this war, extraordinary.",

Harris now leading Trump by five points in a new national poll from NBC News, 49 percent to Trump's 44 percent.Now that is the lowest level of support seen in any poll for the former president since Harris entered the race in late July. And a new polling average conducted by CNN shows the same theme that we've been seeing. No clear leader, Harris and Trump deadlocked in this race well within the margin of error. And again, that's a national poll. Trump continuing to lead when it comes to issues like inflation and the economy. And this just into CNN, Vice President Harris saying she will be laying out her economic vision during a speech this week. So let's talk to some experts to break this all down. Democratic pollster and CEO of the TARA Group, Tom Bonier, and Republican pollster and CEO of Wallin Opinion Research, Justin Wallin. So good to have both of you here. There's a lot of numbers to chew on, but, Tom, I want to start first with the economy. What we were just talking about. The vice president going to do yet another big speech on the economy.

And as Tom mentioned, and as you mentioned, first and foremost, it's the economy. And I think that both of them, if there to really prosecute their case, they need to establish a gap here and neither of them really have. I mean, I think Harris has done an incredible job curating her brand up until now, and if she wishes to create a sort of a gap to be honest, a numerical gap, that's actually a statistical gap, she's going to really need to elucidate some of these items and Trump hasn't done a better job either.

And so, seeing Vice President Harris entering as a new candidate, as a young and energetic candidate, then also seeing the contrast that we saw a couple of weeks ago in the debate, I think is driving those favorabilities, in terms of what it means for the race. While those new voter registrations are probably the most impactful part of this because we know that people who registered to vote for the first time, they voted a much higher rate in the subsequent election. Our numbers show over 83 percent turnout from new registrants in 2020. That excitement and enthusiasm, and those favorable numbers that you're seeing are likely to be adding just more turnout for her base, which this close of an election can make the difference.",

He has a huge following on X and on other social media platforms where he is pushing a really pro-Russia, pro-China -- it's a pretty wild propaganda. I asked him to explain to me a bit why he has such an embrace of these countries and what is MAGA communism? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) O'SULLIVAN (on camera):You can't genuinely say that people in Russia and people in China have more liberties than people in the United States?",

(END VIDEO CLIP) O'SULLIVAN: Yes, as you heard there, Jackson's free speech has been attacked. He says because he's been banned from a dating site. But look, Jess, what we're really getting into with this is, people might find it difficult to figure out how can somebody go from the very far left to seemingly the very far-right in such a small period of time. And look, it is a phenomenon that's really happening there online. You actually see a lot of former Fox News and other very hard right influencers and presenters who now have their shows, own shows on social media platforms, teaming up with people who but traditionally be seen as being on the very far left. So, this is actually a pretty deliberate strategy that is happening on the part that we actually know it's also being pushed specifically by countries like Russia where it is trying to tap into the feelings, that the disillusionment that a lot of young Americans, especially young American men have with the political process here and really kind of pulling them into this world of propaganda and conspiracy theories.",
