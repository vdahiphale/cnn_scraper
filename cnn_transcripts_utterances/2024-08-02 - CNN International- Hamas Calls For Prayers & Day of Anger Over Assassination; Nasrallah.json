An Israeli drone strike killed Fuad Shukr Tuesday evening in Beirut. He was the most senior military leader of the group to be assassinated by Israel since hostilities broke out in October.

Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh, it had gone too far. You don't realize the red lines you've crossed and what kind of aggression you've undertaken, he said. You don't know where you're heading. After the speech, thousands paraded through Beirut's southern suburbs, some carrying the red flag of revenge.

But, I did take a few moments and asked Paul Whelan a few questions, including asking him to describe this moment, because we're all watching it. We're all watching this amazing video of their encounter with family, and he says that it was not real to him, like, nothing felt real to him until he was flying over Great Britain and he looked down and saw British soil and that that's when it hit him. He, of course, is also a British citizen. And he says, at that point, he knew he was coming home. And you've witnessed that marvelous welcome that he described as a great homecoming. The President of the United States, Joe Biden, was waiting for him, embraced him, so was Vice President Kamala Harris, and of course his sister. He described how nice it was to hug a sister for the very first time in years. And he also took a moment to criticize the Russian government. Take a listen.

That is significantly less than what had been anticipated. 175,000 had been anticipated. A lot of questions about what this means in terms of the health of the U.S. economy, what this means in terms of the potential for a September rate cut.

The movie could end in a recession or it could end in a soft landing. Both possibilities are still out there. And we knew all along, Fed Chair Jerome Powell, he warned that hiking interest rates to the magnitude that they had to do to fight inflation was always going to cause pain in the jobs market. And the surprising thing was that the pain had been relatively minimal up to this point, right? The jobs market had been so resilient.And so, if we look back and say that 4.3 percent unemployment is the worst of it, well, I think that would end up being fantastic news. We just don't know yet. And there are a lot of moving pieces. You mentioned the tech part of it. The NASDAQ is down almost three. Intel alone has lost more than a quarter of its value today. The chipmaker announced job cuts, a dividend haul, worse than expected earnings. And so, that is part of the story to hear, is investors are digesting some disappointing earnings. They're trying to make sense of what's going on in the AI boom, and what the Fed is going to do next and how they're going to respond here. So, there is a lot of moving pieces.

We haven't seen that, according to the polling data at least, when it comes to J.D. Vance. And when Donald Trump picked J.D. Vance, this was not an 'expand the tent' pick. This was not a choice intended necessarily to expand the electoral map and to compete in states where Donald Trump might otherwise not be able to compete.Now, some Republicans do tell me that they think J.D. Vance can be helpful in some of the Rust Belt states, which I think is definitely valid. But, a lot of the rationale behind Donald Trump's pick of J.D. Vance was that they have a good relationship, number one, but number two, he is a loyalist to Donald Trump, right? In 2016, Donald Trump picking Mike Pence, that was a pick intended to not only expand the tent, but also to reassure Republicans and independent voters who were on the fence about Donald Trump in terms of voting for him in 2016.

So, if you have travel plans to Florida, double check those plans because things are changing and evolving quite rapidly, especially if you're in southwest Florida, Naples, Fort Myers to Tampa, even Miami. This is the area, not inclusive of Miami, by the way, but that shading of yellow, that's a tropical storm watch. The blue is tropical storm warning. So, basically, Naples south. And then again a tropical storm watch, meaning conditions are favorable for tropical storm activity and tropical storm gusts within the next 48 hours northward towards Tampa Bay.Here is that tropical disturbance that Zain mentioned just a moment ago. It's traversing basically the spine of Cuba right now, the mountainous terrain here. So, there is a lot of disorganization. But, it is going to get its act together once it finally decides to exit the nation of Cuba and enter the Florida straits. There is a lot of warm water, record-high temperatures on the ocean surface right here, even below the surface as well. So, that should give it some opportunity to strengthen. And you can see the first track from the National Hurricane Center. It shows an intensifying tropical storm, as it makes landfall sometime midday on Sunday over the western central portions of Florida, traverses the Florida peninsula and then reemergence into the Atlantic Ocean by early parts of next week. Where it goes from there? Still a little bit uncertain. Could it strengthen? Yeah. There is a lot of warm water over there as well. So, something we're going to monitor very closely. Nonetheless, it will likely become Tropical Storm Debby, as it approaches Florida here this weekend. Here is the spaghetti models. This is the various forecast track possibilities. That's why you see the cone basically into Central Florida. And here is the evolution with one particular model kind of timing it out for you Sunday midday. You can see more or less an approaching landfalling storm, and then into the Atlantic. This is where it skirts the coastal areas of the Carolinas and that'll bring heavy rainfall and the potential for localized flash flooding and even tropical storm force or stronger wind gusts. Now, Zain talked about how oppressive he'd spend in New York to D.C. Yeah, it's going to continue today, 130 million Americans with these heat alerts. But, this is very interesting. According to Climate Central, nearly half of the U.S. population today is experiencing heat that is made more likely by climate change. So, that includes much of the Intermountain West and the East Coast as well. And you can see why with temperatures like this. You factor in the humidity, Zain. You know what it's all about. It is just downright hot.",
