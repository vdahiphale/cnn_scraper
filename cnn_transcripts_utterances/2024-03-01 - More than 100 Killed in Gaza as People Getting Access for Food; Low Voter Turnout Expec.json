Police are already out in force near the church in Moscow where his funeral service is scheduled. The Church of the Icon of Mother of God is located not far from the cemetery where Navalny will be later laid to rest.Navalny's camp is not sure what will happen when the proceedings get underway. His widow is concerned people who show up could end up behind bars, just like hundreds of others at makeshift memorials for him in recent days. Navalny's aides say someone has been working behind the scenes to sabotage the services. For more, Sebastian Shukla joins us from Berlin. So, Seb, what are we expecting in the hours ahead? SEBASTIAN SHUKLA, CNN PRODUCER: Well, Kim, it's been 14 days exactly since Alexei Navalny died in his Arctic penal colony in the Yamal- Nenets region, right in Russia's far north. And since that moment, problems have surrounded the family and his team about even getting their hands on Alexei Navalny's body to even get to the point of being able to bury him. We will remember that his mother, Lyudmila Navalnaya, went to the city of Salahard, where Navalny's body was in the morgue after he died. And she came across various difficulties trying to get the body back into her possession. She said that she wasn't able to see the body, that the authorities were blackmailing her with pressure on how the body would be able to be transported and even what a ceremonial funeral may look like. Since that moment, though, she was able to get the body back into her possession. And the Navalny's team began the process of starting the funeral procession and what the process might look like. We know today that he will be, the ceremony will start at around 6 a.m. Eastern time, 2 p.m. Moscow time. And it will happen at that church, which you mentioned, and then will be followed by a procession of around 30 minutes to the Berezovsky cemetery in the region, an area where Alexei Navalny used to live. But the big issue surrounding this, an unknown question, and we were just seeing those live pictures from the church itself, is the security presence on the ground and what that may look like in terms of numbers of people and mourners coming to pay their last respects to Alexei Navalny. His team have made it known in recent days that they would like people to come out, whether they knew Alexei or they met Alexei personally, or they just know of Navalny from his video messages and his investigations exposing the corruption at the heart of the Kremlin to come and pay their final respects. But, Kim, before the funeral takes place, we have already seen in the days after Alexei Navalny died, detentions and arrests for people just coming to lay a flower at a memorial. This wasn't even a place that was a representative of Alexei Navalny. So the situation where he may finally be laid to rest could well see some detentions and arrests and -- and potentially a real flashpoint, Kim.",

He's a senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Thanks so much for joining us here again. So we're hearing of a heavy police presence, warnings of pro-government agents, agent provocateurs, I guess. What are you expecting to see unfold in the hours ahead? [03:04:57] NIGEL GOULD-DAVIES, SR. FELLOW, INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR STRATEGIC STUDIES: Yes, well, as your correspondent was saying just a moment ago, this has in effect been a macabre game of cat-and-mouse ever since Navalny died or was killed a couple of weeks ago. And the authorities in various ways have made it as difficult and as threatening as possible for anyone to express public sympathy for Navalny. So I think we can expect a very strong police presence, intimidation of those who wish to attend. There are reports that potentially only Navalny's relatives might be allowed to attend. We know there have been several hundred arrests in many cities across Russia of those who demonstrated against Navalny's death. So the authorities sort of realize that they cannot entirely deny Navalny a funeral, but they are going to make it as difficult and as threatening as possible for anyone who actually wishes to attend it or express support for it.",

And it is a measure of how much Russia has changed even then that these funeral arrangements are being handled in a totally different way. As you say, Nemtsov's funeral was a substantial public occasion. There was an open coffin and a very long line of supporters. It took many hours for them to file past. Lots of prominent opposition figures were able to attend and to give speeches. Bizarrely, you might think in retrospect today, Putin even sent a representative to that funeral. So the fact that the Kremlin is at its most grudging, reluctant and repressive in respect of today's arrangements suggests how much more nervous, vindictive and frankly repressive it's become.",

You know, in the context of all of this, of what we're seeing here, is that just symbolic or could that actually help at all, do you think?GOULD-DAVIES: Symbols matter. There is a limit, of course, to what the European Parliament can do in practice in supporting Russia's opposition. Although there are various forms of resources and other means of support that European and other countries can offer to help keep this flame alive in exceptionally dark times. But it is important, even these words are important. It's important for Russians who take a different view from the authorities about so much that's going on at the moment. It's important, I think, for them to understand that there is another way of thinking about everything that's going on in Russia, that they have sympathy and support from others. Again, these are dark times. We've been here before. In Soviet times, we know that the dissident movement took real comfort from the fact that there were supporters abroad that were able and willing in various ways to offer the sympathy and in the limited but real ways that they could to help that. So, no, these things do matter. It's important that they be backed up by concrete measures of support there.",

Dignity and death does not exist here. A day that started with hope of aid finally reaching this neighborhood of Gaza City ended in carnage. Details of what happened and when they happened are contested. Eyewitnesses say Israeli tanks escorting humanitarian aid trucks opened fire. One journalist tells CNN some were shot, but most of the casualties were from the following panic, a stampede and aid trucks running over desperate residents as they fled. This woman says our children are dying of hunger. They went to get a bag of flour to feed the children. Some were run over. Others were shot. The Israeli military, however, says there were two incidents. The first, where residents rushed the trucks and a deadly stampede ensued. The second, when the Israeli military fired on a group of Palestinians who they claim posed a threat and did not move away from their military position, came afterwards. LT. COL. PETER LERNER (RES.), ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES SPOKESPERSON: We are operating in order to maintain operational activity in combat, our combat on one hand and maintain the ongoing flow of humanitarian goods, humanitarian supplies on the other. HANCOCKS (voice-over): What cannot be disputed is the sheer desperation of people here. Aid rarely reaches northern Gaza. Fighting is never far away. This man says of the body he is cradling, he just went to get a bit of bread. A bag of flour for his family, displaced at a school in Jabalia camp. U.N. agencies warn of famine, saying this is the worst level of child malnutrition anywhere in the world.

The facts, as far as we know them, are that this aid convoy carrying Egyptian aid, about 30 trucks in this convoy heading towards Gaza City, to the western part of Gaza City, where aid is desperately needed and where it's been struggling to get through to that crowds of people surrounded these trucks to desperately try to get hold of flour or any other goods that they were carrying.And that there was a stampede and that in that stampede, people were crushed. Trucks tried to get away in the panic. Some of them ran over some of the Palestinians and some of them rammed into other trucks, which led to further casualties. Now, we heard from eyewitnesses and local officials in the Hamas-run enclave saying that it was Israeli fire that prompted this stampede. This is something that Israel is denying. It says that the stampede happened and it fired warning shots to try to disperse the crowd. Furthermore, the Palestinians that it killed, around about 10 or so that it killed with live fire, were because of a potential threat that it perceived when that group of people approached one of their tanks.

But of course, there is now the very real danger.

You're absolutely spot on.Nonetheless, as the occupying force, there is still a legal responsibility to ensure safety whichever way it comes through. But much more aid. We have been crying out for that. We are getting in a fraction of the food, the medicines or the water that people need and utilize those different points, meaning you would get aid to those people much more quickly. Wouldn't have to drive up all the way through Gaza past hundreds of thousands of equally desperate people. So those two things are not difficult. They all would under an umbrella of a ceasefire. We would be able to flood the Gaza Strip. And I think that's an important thing to remember.

That's something that he said once again today after he cast his ballots. He took a short moment to speak to the press that was there. A lot of people that we've been speaking to on the streets, Kim, there's very little enthusiasm that we're seeing for a lot of the politicians that are up on the ballot. There's some people that we've been speaking to who say that they do not plan to vote. There's others who are saying that they do believe that these elections are still very important for the country and that they will go out and vote. I think one of the things that we've seen in the latest polls that were released, official polls here before this election, is that they believe around 43 percent of people might go cast their ballots. And as you've already mentioned, that is pretty low participation in these elections. One of the things that we have to keep in mind, though, is that usually the parliamentary elections here in this country get lower voter turnout than the presidential election. So that's certainly something that's not unheard of. At the same time, they do expect that participation is going to be fairly low. And one of the things that we've seen, we speak to people as a lot of people believe that politicians need to do more to listen to the folks here. A lot of people have been complaining about their economic situation. Obviously, some of that has been induced by the very heavy sanctions that the U.S. and allies have put on Iran. But a lot of people also believe that some of the problems that they have here are homegrown and they do want their politicians to take those on. Now, the big question is, do they believe that the people who are up for election for this parliament and you just mentioned that it's over 15,000 who are eligible to run for the 290 seats. Do they believe that those politicians are the ones who are going to be able to make that happen? It certainly does not appear to us as though there's a great deal of enthusiasm for this election. However, there are also people that we've been speaking to who say, look, they believe that it's their duty to go vote, that it's still important to go vote here in this region.

PUTIN (through translator): We remember the fate of those who once sent their contingents to the territory of our country.

The former KGB colonel is assured of victory, but the Kremlin has still mounted a major publicity campaign ahead of the vote. Putin's speech was shown in movie theaters, put up on billboards.",
