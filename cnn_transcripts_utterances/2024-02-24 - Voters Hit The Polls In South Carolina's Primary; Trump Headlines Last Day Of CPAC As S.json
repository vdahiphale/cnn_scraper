I'm Fredricka Whitfield, and we're watching two major stories unfolding at this hour.A solemn moment for Ukraine, which today marks two years since the start of Russia's brutal invasion. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy meeting with other world leaders today in Kyiv, and in an emotional message to his countrymen, Zelenskyy urged hope in the face of Russia's relentless aggression. Ukraine is in desperate need of artillery, ammunition, and supplies to keep up its fight. The recent retreat from Avdiivka shining new light on the country's urgent need for international help. We're also watching a pivotal moment in this country on the presidential campaign trail. Republican voters in South Carolina are voting today in a critical primary election. Former President Trump speaking right now at CPAC in Maryland. He's heading to the Palmetto State where he will watch the results come in later on. His sole remaining primary challenger, Nikki Haley, casts her ballot in the state. She once led as governor, and now she's hoping voters there provide a boost to her presidential aspirations. We've got team coverage of the GOP primary in South Carolina. Several CNN correspondents are scattered around the Palmetto State on this key election day. Let's begin our coverage with Boris Sanchez in Rock Hill, South Carolina. Boris, the polls will be open for about, what, four more hours or so? What has the turnout been like?",

      "sentences": "Fred, it's been steady for a Saturday. Obviously, they've had two weeks of early voting, so it's mostly last- minute voters coming in right now. This primary today is going to be a big test for former governor Nikki Haley. She has actually done well in this area historically in her two gubernatorial races in this Rock Hill area. Compare that to how Donald Trump has done here, though, every race that Donald Trump has run in his political life in South Carolina, he has won pretty handily and by large numbers in this county, in York County.I'm going to step aside to give you a view of what is happening right now and how this process works. You have voters come in. They hand over their IDs. They register to vote. They get their ballots then they walk over to the voting booths. I had an election worker describe them as very, very expensive and large pencils because the votes aren't actually tabulated or taken inside of there. They just mark the ballot as you just see that young lady holding there. As soon as the ballots are cast, they walk over to the tabulation machine over to our right. They insert them there. That's where all the counting happens. By the time that the precinct, that the polling location closes at 7:00 p.m. tonight, information from that machine is gathered, it gets sent to a central office. That's where all the votes are tabulated. And that is where we find out the final numbers. So far, as you've noted, Fred, Donald Trump has maintained a sizable lead in polling, roughly 30 points or so. I've spoken to sources close to the Trump campaign who are very confident going into tonight, and not just about South Carolina but about the race wholly. I spoke to one source earlier who said that for Nikki Haley, there's not very many states that she can point to and say that she has a great chance of winning. So this will be a big test for her moving forward, even though she says she's going to stay in the race until every vote is tabulated -- Fred.",

This has been a very active polling location with tons of people who have been lining up all day and waiting to cast their vote. But, look, this is a big day for the former Trump campaign as well as Nikki Haley.And it's really the state where Donald Trump believes that he will be able to deliver the final blow to Nikki Haley's campaign, even though she has insisted that she plans to stay in the race through Super Tuesday. And he is continuing to lead her by 30 points in the polls. Adding to that confidence that Boris mentioned, they're very confident about his performance here. Now I do just want to give you some insight into Mount Pleasant. This is a county where they actually did not vote for Donald Trump. Donald Trump had won South Carolina in the past two general elections, but this is one of the counties in the state that did not favor him. And so because of that, we actually heard a lot of voters saying that they voted for Nikki Haley. Some were registered Republicans who said that they really voted for her as a vote against Donald Trump. But we did also hear from a lot of Republicans who did have a lot of support for Donald Trump, including one voter. His name was David Alfred and he said the reason he so strongly wanted to come out here today and make sure he voted for Trump was because he wants to go with someone that works. He wanted to vote for a businessman and not a politician. And so we've really had a variety of opinions at this polling location. And we'll see how that plays out later today when polls close at 7:00 p.m. -- Fred.",

A glass eye from the siege of Azovstal, gratitude from surviving Russian prisons, courage from battling in the summer counteroffensive, and now exhaustion from fighting in Kherson in a daring advance across the river the Russia claimed it ended this week. Two years ago, he remembered shock at Russia's brutal attack but also Ukraine's bold defense. OLEKSANDRE, 36TH MARINE BRIGADE (through text translation): I personally didn't believe it but I imagined something could happen.

All right, Nick Paton Walsh in Ukraine, thank you.For more on this war, let's turn now to CNN military analyst and retired U.S. Air Force Colonel Cedrick Leighton. Colonel, good to see you. I mean, that is just astounding, isn't it? I mean you just saw there the resolve shown by so many Ukrainian soldiers, but realistically, you know, how long can Ukraine, you know, spurn Russia's advance, I mean, giving the shrinking supply of artillery, ammunition, even though Europeans are now committing more? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, Fredricka. It really depends on how quickly the European aid can materialize in Ukraine and how quickly the U.S. can resume aid because we're going to have to do that. You know, the European aid by itself is not going to be sufficient. And that's I think the whole tragedy of this situation. Not that the aid from the U.S. or from West could have stopped what happened to Oleksandre, the soldier in Nick Paton Walsh's piece in Mariupol, for example, but what it could do is it could prevent other troops in Ukraine from being captured or being killed or being wounded, and that's the key thing here. Ukraine has basically become the buffer sticking between NATO Europe and Russia, and it is also protecting us here in the United States.

And as we see on this map here, there is really that key element where it's kind of a picket point between those two areas. It is of course also fairly close to that land bridge that runs from Donetsk down toward Crimea. And that is really the critical thing because what the Ukrainians wanted to do was to cut that land bridge.That's going to be a really hard thing to do right now and they're going to have to rethink how they're going to do something like this, or even if they're going to do something like that in the near term. So the goal of cutting the land bridge to kind of cut off Crimea from the rest of Russia or Russian occupied territory, that's going to be something that they're going to probably have to put into a basket of future events. So that will mean that there's a more defensive posture for the Ukrainian forces, at least with the usual medium term and that of course means a different kind of warfare and that could mean a lot of attrition. And if they're not careful a lot more troops than are captured by the Russians like those 200 in Avdiivka.",

I imagine they're trying to get things in order here. This is literally close to half a billion dollars that is owed amongst these two judgments. A very substantial amount of money by anybody's imagine, no matter how rich you are.You know, regarding the fraud case, the attorney general's case that was brought, essentially what Trump and his team were doing is suggesting there is some issue with the judge, you know, that was, you know, handed down by the judge, that there were some concerns they had with it. There was one small issue that there was an agreement ultimately with the attorney general to correct. But otherwise Trump's team is given an opportunity to identify any issues or problems with the judgement by the judge. They were not able to do so, and so they're going to have to go forward and appeal. And in the meantime, they are going to have to try to post a bond if they don't want interest to continue to accrue to the tune of $100,000 plus per day.",

On his end, on Trump's end, I imagine he doesn't, you know, he said he actually has that level of liquidity, in other words half a billion dollars in cash sitting around. Yes, he could potentially just put that up but most likely what he's going to be trying to do is either, you know, I would imagine he's going to try to get a bond which would be a fairly common thing to do under the circumstance.But that would require an underwriter to come in, look at his properties, assess the value of those properties, which by the way was the central issue on that fraud trial because there was allegations that he, you know, inflated, falsely inflated the value of properties, there need to be a determination of what incumbrances are on those properties, and what his ownership share is. You know, and obviously because he's under a lot of pressure, you know, Trump is going to have to pay a substantial fee in order to get that liquidity now. In other words, to get that money out of the properties that he has.",

You look at the oral argument, it went in Trump's favor. He may even get some votes from the Democratic appointed justices on that case. I think it doesn't look nearly as positive for him on the immunity front.I would not be surprised if that ruling comes out first because in the ballot case, you have to have a kind of full judicial opinion there. You know, there's really a consideration of whether or not a stay should be granted. And then ultimately there may be some briefing on both sides, on Trump's side and the prosecution, the special counsel's office, regarding whether the Supreme Court should even take that case. The Supreme Court could just decide without issuing an opinion not to take that case up which would obviously get things moving on the January 6th matter. [15:55:00] WHITFIELD: All right.
