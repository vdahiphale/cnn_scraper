And we start in Ukraine, because the Russian-occupied city of Kherson is tense. That is according to Ukrainian officials who say there are now more Russian soldiers on the streets than civilians. They're awaiting the arrival of Ukrainian forces whose counteroffensive has been slowed a bit due to mud and bad weather. Ukrainian forces are digging trenches and fighting off Russian attacks as they prepare for a long, heavy battle for Kherson. Ukrainian officials say Russia sent up 1,000 mobilized troops to the west bank of the Dnipro River to try to defend that city. And I want to get straight to Nic Robertson who joins us this evening in Kyiv. And Nic, we knew that the bad weather and the mud would be a problem on the frontlines. It's something you told us roughly this time yesterday. But just how worried are Ukrainian officials about this tense situation in Kherson?",

Elon Musk has completedhis $44 billion takeover of Twitter, marking the new era by firing the CEO and two other top executives before the dust had even settled. He tweeted, \"the bird is freed\", as you can see there. Apparent referencing his attempt to dial back some limits on controversial content. Critics fear hate speech and misinformation could surge. But Musk vows he will not allow Twitter to become a free-for-all hellscape, something he's also said as well. Just hours after Musk declared \"the bird is freed\", you saw there, he got a rather sharp reminder from overseas. A European commissioner tweeted back, as you can see there, \"in Europe, the bird will fly by our rules\". We're now joined by Nicholas Thompson; CEO of \"The Atlantic\" and former editor-in-chief of \"Wired\". Nicholas, great to have you on the show, thank you very much for taking time to speak to us. Look, already, it's clear that we're seeing quite upheaval at the headquarters with these staff reductions. What do these top level changes though mean for the company, and perhaps where Musk wants to take it?",

What one would love would be if he can be smarter than everybody else who has tackled this problem and find a better way to trade those things off. If he can figure out a way to allow real people to say things and have healthy conversations while removing the bots, the disinformation campaigns and all of that.

Scenes of chaos in the Kurdish city of Mahabad, as Iran's security forces intensify an already brutal and deadly crackdown on protesters. Hengaw, a human rights group based in Norway says at least four people were killed on Thursday after security forces opened fire on protesters. Thousands gathered at a demonstration ignited by the killing of Ismail Mauludi, a protester who was shot dead by Security Forces, according to Amnesty International. Now, reports of so-called war weapons being used by Special Forces stationed on rooftops of local government buildings, prompting an outcry from human rights groups. Amnesty saying on Thursday Iran's security forces are unlawfully using firearms against thousands in Mahabad. Iran's authorities must immediately reign in the security forces. The regime, however, says police forces moved in when protesters targeted government buildings after Mauludi's burial ceremony while state media has claimed without evidence that protesters were acting under the instruction of a separatist terrorist organization. But the incident follows a weeks-long campaign of state sanctioned violence against peaceful protesters, one which has already claimed the lives of at least 250 people according to the United Nations.

Gun ownership, who can own them, and why people need them, has become an election issue. And it's the President himself, Jair Bolsonaro, who wants more Brazilians to bear arms, has loosened strict gun ownership laws and made promises of more gun rights to come.

(END VIDEO CLIP) NEWTON (voice-over): To be clear, Lula has never said he will restrict the media, guns, or religious freedom, which brings us to the issue of misinformation as presidential supporters at this rally claim Lula will separate Brazilians from their Creator.

Brian, great to have you on the show. Look, it looks like it's going to be highly divisive election, as Paula just laid out there, between these two political titans.

I wouldn't personally bet a whole lot of money on either candidate winning right now, although Lula does still seem to be the favorite. No one knows what's really in the minds of this very small percentage of undecided voters at this stage. It might be anywhere between two and maybe ten percent of the electorate that could still change their mind.

And this rhetoric had faded a bit over the last couple of weeks, as Bolsonaro did better in the first round than anyone really expected. But now, as some of the momentum maybe starts to shift back toward Lula, they're sounding worried again. And so this rhetoric of casting doubt on the electoral system, but also saying that the election is rigged, that they have the judiciary and the media and others so firmly stacked against them, that they never stood a fair chance, again, all of this in their view, this rhetoric is bubbling up again, the open question is, what kind of effect will it have will Bolsonaro, if he loses, will he just cry fraud? Or is there some risk that some of the institutions in Brazil like the military might go with him? I think that risk is low. But it is real.
