I think that the two of them seem like they've sort of separated from Tim Scott, Vivek, and Chris Christie. And so, that's probably where more of the fireworks will be. Some of the others will look to try to engage more in the debate.But I think that, you know, as time goes on, President Trump's decision to avoid the debates, I think, is unfortunate for voters, but I think politically it continues to make it look like the rest of the debates are somewhat of an undercard. And so, I think that's probably played to his benefit thus far.",

But at the same time, how do you end up getting traction if you don't? And so, I think it is certainly is a challenge. I do think, you know, something that we discussed some -- last time, Kate, is I still think there's this conventional wisdom that says what we need to do is to get down to one candidate to go mano a mano against Trump.But I think that that conventional wisdom isn't true in this case. I think as more and more candidates drop out, it creates a bigger inevitability that Trump will be the nominee. And this simplistic notion that says, well, there's a Trump vote and anti-Trump vote, I don't think it really applies. I think a lot of the polling shows at candidly for DeSantis, if he were to ever drop out, a lot of his vote would go back to Trump. And so, the notion that there's this -- a lot of this pressure that says candidates need to drop out and donors want candidates to drop out so we can figure out who to solidify against, I think doesn't really apply in this year's election because I think more and more it probably benefits Trump as the field narrows.",

Of course, a phrase used by Hamas in calling for the end of the Jewish state. She has defended those remarks.
