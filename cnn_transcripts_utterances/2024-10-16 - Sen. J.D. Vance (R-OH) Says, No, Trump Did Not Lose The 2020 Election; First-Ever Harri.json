It's Vance's most direct statement embracing false claims about the 2020 results since he became Trump's running mate.Also breaking, Kamala Harris is ramping up her warning that Trump is a danger to democracy backed up by dozens of Republicans in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, this as the vice president ventures into a Trump friendly arena with her first ever interview on Fox News.

There are Republicans and there are independents out there that a comment like J.D.

There's a way to pivot away from it. He just kind of keeps going back to it. I'm seeing more and more of this.
