She said there were drugs there, cocaine, there was alcohol, that he started to kiss her. And she consented to that she liked him. she even alleges in the complaint she might spend the night.But then she saw him starting have sex, violent sex with another woman at the party and his hotel room. She left to go to apparently another room. He found her, brought her back and she said it was absolutely violent, she alleges in this civil complaint. And, remember, this is monetary damages, it's not a criminal case. But Axl Rose, his attorney released a statement, and we want to say, simply put, this incident never happened. Though is it doesn't deny the possibility of a fan photo taken in passing, Mr. Rose has no recollection of ever meeting or speaking to the plaintiff and has never heard about these fictional allegations prior to today. And she also is famous. She was Penthouse pet of the year in 1983 and wrote a book in 2014.",

He's an Israeli-American IDF soldier. He is being held hostage in Gaza by Hamas right now. And he's someone who grew up in New York. His son grew up in New York.

And the other aspect of this that is also incredibly significant when you look at what is happening to people in Gaza and the desperately needed aid that so many of the civilians there need is the humanitarian aid that is expected to be part of this deal. That has not gone into Gaza yet as a result of the delay. There is no pause in fighting yet, no release of hostages, and no surge of humanitarian aid. CNN's Eleni Giokos is in Cairo for us covering this where, of course, we know a lot of trucks are preparing, Eleni, to go in in that Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza, where we've seen so many of those trucks going in.

And it's going to enter into force starting tomorrow. So, that's from the Egyptian side. So, this is when we're expecting the aid trucks to finally enter Gaza. You know, over the past few days, we've been speaking to the Egyptians in terms of how much aid has actually entered the Gaza Strip. And while it's thousands of tons of medical aid, of food, as well as water, it is just a trickle. We have heard time and time again from the U.N. and from other international agencies that it is not enough to cope with the needs on the ground. And we've heard some of the harrowing stories from hospitals where they've run out of anesthesia for surgeries, for amputations. I mean, it's really hair-raising stuff.

But if it is in the agreement, they are willing to step in and help.They have also categorically stated they haven't been part of any negotiation, but they have been assisting the hostages that were released to evacuate out of Gaza. So, that is their role. But what is really interesting here is that this would be a real big breakthrough because this is the first time that the Red Cross would have access to the hostages that have been trapped inside of Gaza, understanding their states, whether they need any healthcare, any intervention. And that would be a big part of this conversation. But really interesting to know that the Red Cross doesn't have this information right now. And frankly, the aid organizations have also said that they're not really sure about how the aid is going to be brought into Gaza, what those safe passages are going to look like to deploy that aid.
