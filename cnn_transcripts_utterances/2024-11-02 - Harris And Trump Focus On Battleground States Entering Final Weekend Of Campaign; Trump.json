They were trying to come here to try to drive out early voters to take some of the pressure off of that November 5th election day of get those votes out. Both sides that I have spoken to have said there's a little bit of a lack of transparency in the state, particularly of Wisconsin, but they're not sure what's going to happen. It was so close the last time around. They are both working as fast as they can and as hard as they can to try and drive out voters because as we have repeatedly reported, this election is going to be determined in the margins and they need every single vote they can get.

But certainly Pennsylvania is such a critical battleground where Biden still enjoys some popularity, particularly among blue collar voters and also older voters. And it is a place where the race is so deadlocked. The latest polling puts both Trump and Harris at about 48 percent apiece. So the Harris campaign lately has been really expressing some optimism.

He's going to be early in North Carolina, go to Salem, Virginia and then back to North Carolina.But let's also not forget that Virginia, especially Salem, where he's going, is just about half an hour from Blacksburg, West Virginia. That's clearly a state that has a super active Senate race in which Donald Trump has endorsed a candidate. But also that's one of those areas where he expects to do well. And in these moments where these candidates go to these non- battleground states, sometimes what they're looking for is a lot of media attention, which we're talking about it. So he's going to get that. But also being in close proximity to a state that very much supports him as well as a one -- as one where he's really trying to campaign heavily, that battleground of North Carolina, that gives Donald Trump the ability to potentially bring together a lot of people in an area that's not densely populated.

But it is a little different than having someone like Barack Obama or Michelle Obama or even Bill Clinton who have all been campaigning for Harris. And there's a little bit less of a concern, I think, among the Harris supporters and campaign officials that there's going to be a gaffe moment, that there's going to be something that slips up and then takes over the next news cycle or two when we only have less than a handful of days until Election Day itself. So it could be a great moment. He loves Pennsylvania. He clearly comes from there. As you note, he has spent a heck of a lot of time there during his time also in the White House.

If he wins the Oval Office, those experts say they don't expect Trump to be sentenced for four years, if at all. The reason is Trump's attorneys will likely ask judges to stay step in to stop the sentencing of the future president just weeks before he would assume office. It starts one week after election day on November 12th. The judge overseeing the New York case will rule on Trump's motion to throw out his conviction based on the Supreme Court's decision on presidential immunity. If Trump wins, then the case is over. But if he loses his attorneys are expected to launch several legal challenges and race to courthouses to ask judges to delay the sentencing. They're expected to challenge the immunity decision, potentially taking it to the Supreme Court, and likely argue that a state court judge could sentence a president elect. One lawyer said winning the election is Trump's get out of jail free card. But nothing here is certain. There is no legal playbook for this unprecedented moment in American history. Amara, Victor.

Now, Democrats are saying that a lot of -- as a result, a lot of Republicans who normally would vote on election day voted early so that this great turnout, although it's good that people are voting, it doesn't necessarily mean Trump is banking more votes this -- just that he's banking more votes early --",

Some of these areas where you see the red, portions of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Texas and Missouri, you're talking 6 to 10 inches of rain before that system finally exits the area. So, here's a look at today, a lot of those storms and, yes, even some strong to severe thunderstorms across Texas and Oklahoma today before that continues to spread eastward into portions of Arkansas, Missouri, as we head into Sunday. And then Monday, we start to see more of the focus shift into the Midwest, so by the time we get into election day, the real focus for all of the rain is going to stretch from Michigan all the way back down to the Gulf Coast.

Now, Israel is bracing itself for what could happen. We have heard from one senior Israeli Intelligence official, a former official that it could be in the form of a response from Iraq this time around. It could be malicious that are based in Iraq and are funded and equipped by Iran that could take the lead in some kind of retaliation. We've heard from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu though, saying that Israel has proved that it can reach anywhere it wants to within Iran. So, at the same time is waiting for this potential retaliation, we are seeing the rhetoric being quite vocal on both sides. And of course, what's different at this point is the fact that this is clearly no longer a shadow war, the fact that Israel admitted to its -- what it did, its launches against the defense mechanisms in Iran just a week ago. That's the first time that Israel has admitted striking on Iranian soil. So, that's not long as we all know to the U.S. election if this high-ranking source is accurate, this retaliation could be imminent. Victor --",
