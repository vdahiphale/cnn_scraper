      "sentences": "Good evening, everyone. I'm Abby Phillip and this is CNN TONIGHT. We are now just hours away from a historic moment in America. Tomorrow afternoon, former President Donald Trump will be arraigned at a federal courthouse in Miami on 37 counts of alleged mishandling of classified documents.It is the first time a former commander-in-chief of the United States will be placed under arrest and face federal charges, but it is the second time for Donald Trump, and he will be arrested about two months after he was briefly taken into custody in April to face state charges in New York. So, tonight, the magistrate judge who will preside over this arraignment tomorrow calling the proceedings -- and I quote -- \"genuinely historic and of huge importance.\" And as we go live here, this is where Trump is huddling with his supporters at his Doral golf club in Miami just a short distance from the courthouse where we can report he spent the day interviewing some lawyers and trying to bring aboard new individuals on to his team. CNN got this exclusive video of his arrival where he appeared to be in a relaxed mood, greeting well-wishers, even smiling and posing for photographs. But, first, I want to turn to our crime and justice reporter, Shimon Prokupecz, who has been at this courthouse in Miami, looking at the security situation as it has been unfolding. Shimon, what are you hearing about the plans for what will happen outside of that courtroom tomorrow?",

They actually have control over the property, the perimeter, all the security on the outside.And then, Federal Protective Services, the FPS, which you can see here, they're out here now, Abby, here with one of the canine dogs. We're seeing them out and about here tonight. They are the ones that are responsible for protecting the federal property where we are standing. They're out here. We are seeing a number of them out here tonight, certainly more than we saw last night. And they've come from all different parts of the country. I was just talking to one who came here from Atlanta. So, they've surge resources in here. The issue, as you can see, around me here, there is not a whole lot of security at the moment. There are not a lot of barricades. You're seeing yellow tape, kind of all around here. That is really the extent of the security that we're seeing. I asked the Miami City Police chief about this today because there are concerns from people in the area, from people who live here, and people who work here. What will the security be like? He said there's nothing to fear. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PROKUPECZ (on camera): We've been hearing from people in the building around that area, they're concerned that there is no hardening around the area, the perimeter, and that people can just freely come and go. There is yellow tape right now that's been placed. Will that change because there is a lot of concern that people may try to storm that building or try to enter some of that area? I mean, are you going to harden that area?",

You know, the police chief told us that they're prepared from anywhere from 5,000 to 50,000 here showing up. One of the things that they're doing here also, Abby, it's important to note, is that we're not going to see the former president coming here like we saw in New York City. They're expecting to take him underground and take him out that same way so they feel that they can secure him.

But, you know, to echo all of these points, you know, it underscores a much broader point for those of us who have spent a lot of time around federal courts that yes, they're protected, you got to go to magnetometer (ph) and son on, but judges don't receive a ton of protection.

So, there was already a little bit of trepidation among our traditional allies about Trump.I think that this -- you know, as David said, how we handle this will have a lot of impact on how this will reverberate. If we handle it well, it is well, okay, we've kind of got that under control, we knew what this was like, and, okay, it is not unexpected but the system is working.

This is reinforcing the concept that no one is above the law.The second element of it, I think, that is really important is those allies who are looking at how the intelligence was treated have got to be wondering why it is that they're sharing a lot of intelligence with the United States and what -- how they are going to protect the intelligence we share with them. And if the U.S. is only as strong as its allies, then intelligence sharing got to go on. That got to mean that the government is going to have to establish a system of new rules here.",

But here she is today. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY, FORMER SOUTH CAROLINA GOVERNOR, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If this indictment is true, if what it says is actually the case, President Trump was incredibly reckless with our national security. It is reckless, it is frustrating, and it causes problems. You know, we are looking now, this is the second indictment, we are looking at possibly a third indictment. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I don't think the FBI put together and mishandled what they typed in on the transcript.And so, the other thing is, is this all of the information that the FBI and DOJ have access to? I think it is probably unlikely. You have a better perspective on what else may come out. So, unfortunately, this is -- this comes down to leadership. This comes down to character. And what do you want in a president? Do you want somebody who lies to you? Do you want somebody who tells the truth? Do you want somebody who spits in the face of men and women who are putting themselves in harm's way in order to keep us safe? These are the questions that we are going to have to ask ourselves. Hopefully and I do believe the voters of the Republican Party are going to recognize that and realize that Donald Trump has too much baggage. If we elect Donald Trump, then we are willingly giving the 2024 election to Joe Biden.",

This is about what we know about Donald Trump. We wouldn't be here. We would not be in this situation if he would have given the documents back when he asked. And that is ultimately the problem.

Maybe we will vote for that person.(END VIDEO CLIP) PHILLIP: So, Trump and his team -- I mean, look, nobody is thrilled about being indicted, but I think their view is an indictment hardens the resolve of people like that woman. KRISTEN SOLTIS-ANDERSON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: In the polls that I see, it is between 20 and 30 percent generally say they are with Trump no matter what. They are the he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and they would stick with him crew. That is within the republican primary electorate. There is another really large chunk and that is -- the more interesting one to me is the one that says we like Donald Trump but we are open to other options. And what is going to be fascinating to watch is to what extent does this indictment push any of those folks firmly into Donald Trump's camp where they say, you know what, I am not considering anyone else anymore, I just want Donald Trump. Or does it make them go, you know what, let's really keep my mind open, let's keep our options open because it is not a good look to have our nominee be someone who could potentially be in prison. And so, I think for the Republican Party, having more and more candidates who actually do take a swing at Donald Trump a little bit, you know, up until this point, so many of these candidates have said the only way to win this game is not to play, don't even -- pretend like Donald Trump doesn't exist. You are starting to see whether it is, what we just heard from Will Hurd, what we heard from Chris Christie earlier tonight in the town hall, what we even heard a little bit from Nikki Haley earlier today, Republicans beginning to say, hey, maybe it is time to take a few swings at Donald Trump.",
