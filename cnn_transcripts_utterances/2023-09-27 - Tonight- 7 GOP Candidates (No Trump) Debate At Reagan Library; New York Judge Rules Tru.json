Just a few seconds shy of 5Seven candidates, not named Donald Trump, will take the stage in Simi Valley, California at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. It is a storied venue that celebrates a man venerated -- all by enshrined, really, by Republicans for decades. The man who told Gorbachev to \"tear down this wall.\" A man who now finds his brand of muscular American politics and statecraft distinctly -- well, over, passe, old- fashioned. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Yesterday, reporters asked me if I thought President Putin was smart. I said, of course, he's smart, to which I was greeted with oh, that's such a terrible thing to say. I like to tell that, yes, he's smart. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And some of his rivals have started to take him on more directly than they did earlier this year. But is that really too little too late for them? Joining us now, CNN's Alayna Treene. Alayna, I'm so grateful to have you this morning. Let's start by talking about this debate, big-picture. We have seen candidates like Ron DeSantis, for example, take on Donald Trump in ways that he wasn't willing to at the beginning of the campaign. What do you think we're going to see from him and from others tonight, and does it matter since Trump's not going to be there? ALAYNA TREENE, CNN POLITICAL REPORTER (via Webex by Cisco):  Right. Well, great to be here with you, Kasie. And I do think you're going to see a lot of these candidates directly attack Donald Trump. Of course, at the first debate, very few questions were about the former president and many of the candidates were still skeptical of going after the former president -- attacking him -- because they're afraid of alienating the GOP base. But you have seen in recent weeks a lot of these candidates -- Ron DeSantis, but also former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Sen. Tim Scott -- starting to take on Donald Trump directly. And listen, you're totally right. I think this debate is going to be missing the frontrunner star power just like we saw with the first debate in August. But it's going to be deeply consequential for a lot of these candidates, particularly as a lot of Republican voters, as well as these big donors, are really looking at who is going to be the Republican candidate that they're going to coalesce around to be the Trump alternative. And for months now, that has been Ron DeSantis -- but in recent weeks, he has been faltering in the polls. And you have seen people like Nikki Haley beginning to gain ground, particularly in the early states. And that's another big thing that is weighing on these candidates' minds -- the timing of this debate. One, they want to impress donors, impress voters, see a fresh --",

I mean, I remember 2020 was an odd campaign because of COVID. But back in 2016, I spent a ton of time in union halls in -- Macomb County is usually the classic example. It's outside Detroit. Sometimes I was there covering Republican candidates, but sometimes I would cover Bernie Sanders. And a lot of voters there would tell me hey, yeah, I really like Bernie Sanders but if he's not going to get the nomination I want to vote for Donald Trump.

A New York judge fines Donald Trump and his adult sons liable for fraud, canceling the Trump Organization's business certificates, saying that they lied repeatedly about their net worth and assets to banks and insurers for years. It is a key ruling that comes before the state attorney general's $250 million fraud lawsuit against Trump goes to trial.Let's bring in criminal defense attorney and former federal prosecutor, Katie Cherkasky. Katie, thank you so much for being with us to help us understand this. So this judge made a very unusual decision in this and I think people who are watching this closely didn't expect the judge to go as far as he did with this ruling. Can you explain to us what happened because there is still going to be a trial but this ruling was a choice. Why? KATIE CHERKASKY, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR (via Skype):  Yes, it is very interesting. And this ruling that essentially found the judge determining that the Trump Organization and the defendants that are named in that lawsuit committed fraud in their business filings as a matter of law. So the filing was really a pretrial request by both the Trump Organization and by Letitia James and the attorney general's office to determine some issues before trial that wouldn't have to go before the finder of fact. One of those issues, according to the judge, was whether the Trump Organization and the defendants had committed fraud in their filings as a matter of law, meaning that there was nothing for any sort of finder of fact at a trial to determine. So even though the case is still scheduled to go to trial, that issue has been established by the judge. So essentially, Trump and the other defendants cannot relitigate whether there were fraudulent filings. And so, of course, that is being appealed but that is a very significant finding pretrial in this case.",

He was known as \"Mr. Oriole\" spending his entire 23-year Major League career in Baltimore and helping the team win two World Series rings. Robinson considered one of the greatest third basemen ever. He was an 18-time All-Star and won the AL MVP back in 1964. The Orioles did hold a moment of silence before their 1-0 win over the Nationals last night. Brooks Robinson was 86 years old.",
