She is very circumspect, I think, is probably the diplomatic way to say it about the kinds of endorsements that other people are getting. I mean, you heard she was quite disappointed when it came to Tim Scott.But if I may, one moment that I thought was interesting in our discussion right now was that, you know, she has been on the trail talking about Donald Trump and Joe Biden being bad for America for lots of reasons. The primary reason that she's giving is because of their age and their -- what she says is a declining mental acuity. And just now, just more broadly when I asked about whether they are equally bad, we eventually got around to her answer being yes. She does think that they are equally bad which is an interesting answer, a noteworthy answer especially, Fred, given the fact that she didn't directly say that she would not support the pledge that she signed way back when to support the nominee which I understand. I've asked a lot of candidates hypotheticals and if they're still in the race they don't want to go there on that necessarily especially with someone like her who just landed strictly and squarely in a one-on-one race with Donald Trump. But that was not something that she directly answered on the Trump and Biden being equally bad. She did answer it and she said yes.",

Ron DeSantis' suspension of his campaign comes just two days before the first in the nation primary in New Hampshire, and it now leaves two candidates in the running for the GOP nomination, former president Donald J. Trump and former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, now going toe-to-toe to represent the Republican Party in November.Let's bring in our full political team to break all of this down and find out the reasons behind DeSantis' decision. We know we heard his recording there and he says that he did not see a clear path forward. But Jessica Dean, Steve Contorno both have been following the campaign of Ron DeSantis from start to finish. Now, so, Jessica, you first. Why is it he did not see a clear path to the nomination?",

They would move their team there and they would really drill down that they would hope to beat Nikki Haley there. But it just simply did not seem to be that the donors would be there with him. And of course to keep going you have to have money to stay in. Now I'm told, Fredricka, we heard in that video that you played, he did say that he will be supporting former president Trump and that he will -- he pledged to support whoever the nominee is, I am told that at this point, and this can always change, but today, right now, there are no plans for DeSantis to appear with Trump on the campaign trail in New Hampshire at this moment. Now we might see them together down the road somewhere, but at this point in time there are no plans for anything like that. I am also told that Governor DeSantis is at home in Florida, that he had made this decision, you know, earlier today after really kind of talking with his closest adviser, his wife, but also those around him, and just decided that this was just not -- this could not sustain and could not continue, that he can focus on being in Florida and governing there -- Fredricka.",

And clearly, you know, he is a Republican who came up thanks to Trump's endorsements and getting back into Trump's good graces is a calculation that they're making will be important to his brand.But what's interesting is that sources tell me and Kristen Holmes that DeSantis' team, his campaign nor DeSantis himself had actually talked to anyone in the Trump campaign or Trump in advance to tell them that this endorsement was coming. They saw DeSantis getting out of the race today as a likely outcome based off of all of the reasons we've talked about, but they were surprised to hear DeSantis come out and endorse him. But there's a lot of history between DeSantis and Trump, and not just between DeSantis and Trump, the individuals, but also their staffs and DeSantis and Trump staff went -- DeSantis was a candidate for governor in 2018 he needed Trump's support, and Trump's endorsement proved big for him in getting him the nomination in Florida. After that he was in a tight race for the general election, and Trump actually loaned him a bunch of top political advisers and operatives in Florida to help get him over the finish line. Well, he had a pretty nasty break-up with that crew of people and a lot of those people are now working for Donald Trump including Susie Wiles, one of his top political operatives, earlier today when words started to circulate that DeSantis might be dropping out, she had a very interesting tweet. It was two words. \"Bye-bye.\"",

There were people who wanted him to come out of the gate throwing hay makers at Trump and responding to all the attacks that Trump was throwing at him. Instead they kind of did this half attempt at going at Trump. It was often shrouded in sort of this soft language and it was almost too cute by half.And instead of knocking down Trump at all and instead made him look to many supporters like someone who wasn't ready to go toe to toe with the biggest Republican in their party, and it raised a lot of questions about whether he was ready to step into the arena with someone like a Joe Biden. So, you know, many of these candidates in this race have struggled with this question of how to deal with Donald Trump. You just heard Dana and Nikki Haley go back and forth on that a little bit, but in the case of DeSantis, it's particularly interesting because he was such a vociferous supporter of Donald Trump in the past. He had that ad in 2018 with him and his children building the wall, reading the \"Art of the Deal\" to his kids, and he had really come up through the political party as a rising star because of Trump. So breaking himself off from Trump was always going to be difficult and that is something that they repeatedly struggled with all throughout this campaign.",

Now Haley, for her matter, didn't know that this was coming. DeSantis didn't call her and give her a head's up. She told Dana Bash that. She also defended herself against his allegations that she's essentially in the pocket of corporate America, saying that that's not true and really going after the political elite. She said that they're coming together against the people. It's a really stinging rebuke of those politicians who have been signing up, standing up behind former president Trump and, you know, even lawmakers from her own state here in New Hampshire campaigning with Trump while she is barnstorming the state, going to events, trying to get every vote she can in what is a critical state for her given the new CNN poll which shows her 11 points behind the former president, trying to do as well as she can here.
