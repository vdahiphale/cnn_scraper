Wade if Democrats take control of Congress. We also heard him mention of Jeffrey Epstein during that press briefing. We didn't hear a lot in the vein of support for Joe Biden personally, not a lot of boasting about his abilities. I believe Chair Aguilar said we'll see what Biden does on these campaign stops. He did acknowledge, we've heard a lot of things, theories and cases about the top of the ticket.

KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: -- working around the clock for the past two days to ensure Texas has the resources and tools needed to respond to Beryl and keep Americans safe. Officials from the U.S. Coast Guard and FEMA have been on the ground and senior White House officials have been in constant contact with their counterparts. While the storm has passed, our greatest concern right now is power outages and extreme heat. So we want to encourage residents to remain vigilant as temperatures rise, especially older adults and those with underlying health conditions. Fortunately, 800,000 have had power restored overnight. And we expect another one million to have their power restored today. The federal government has also offered generators to help reduce the impact of the power outages. The president continues to take decisive action to help the people of Texas recover. And he looks forward to working with the state to get more critical resources to the people that need them. I also want to share one additional scheduling item with all of you as well at the top. In addition to many NATO meetings, we announced yesterday on Thursday afternoon, President Biden will meet with President Zelenskyy of Ukraine to discuss our unwavering support for Ukraine as it continues to defend itself from Russian aggression. That meeting will be at 1:30 p.m. at the convention center, which, as you all know, is where the NATO sessions are being held. And it will well take place just before the NATO Ukraine Council meeting. This will be the third meeting between both presidents in recent weeks following their sit-down in France, and also a sit down at the G-7 in Italy. And it will further demonstrate the strength of the partnership between our countries. And finally, just a personal note here. I want to say a few words about Sam Michel here, who served as acting deputy press secretary for the part of the -- for a good part of this year. We're sad that today is, indeed, his last day, but we are so grateful for his service. And he has been an incredible colleague. He is - we're lucky to have him on our team, on our press team. His sharpness, his ability to stay calm under pressure, and his strategic thinking has been a real asset to us all. Sam, you will be greatly missed. Thank you so much for being on the team and stepping in when -- stepping in when we really needed you. OK. All right, Seung Min?",

Yesterday, a lot of the things that I said right here in this briefing -- I know you we're not in the briefing room -- I actually -- in the letter. It was in the letter. It was being incorrectly assumed and insinuated that the president had seen Dr. Cannard more than three times. I said that it was only three times that the president has seen a neurologist. I didn't confirm the name. But I did say it was only three times. It was being incorrectly assumed and insinuated that the president was being treated for Parkinsons. I said right here that the president was not being treated for Parkinsons. I actually went a step further and said he wasn't taking medication for Parkinsons. I said that right here. It was also being assumed and insinuated that Dr. Cannard was someone who only worked on Parkinsons when, in fact, he's a general neurologist. That was something that Dr. O'Connor was actually able to confirm that he was a general neurologist. And, in fact, a general neurologist. And we also wanted to set the -- we just wanted to set the record straight. And so it is important -- we believe it is important to all of you.

We respect their view. But I also want to say there's a long -- also a long list of congressional members who have been very clear and in support of this president. Whether it's the CDC, who gave a full -- full support, the Congressional Black Caucus for folks who are watching and are not sure what CBC is. They were very much supportive. They said we think that -- this is Representative Joyce Beatty, to be clear -- We think that the call went extremely well. The president was very responsive. Representative Troy Carter, who's also a member of the CBC, he was elated to hear directly from the president and that he is all in. And we are all in with him. You heard from -- we've got a Congressional Hispanic Caucus. They put out a statement in full support of this president. And there are others. And so, look, he is going to focus on continuing to work on behalf of the American people, continuing to build on an unprecedented record that he's been able to get done, with many of these congressional members that he's proud to be -- to have worked with.
