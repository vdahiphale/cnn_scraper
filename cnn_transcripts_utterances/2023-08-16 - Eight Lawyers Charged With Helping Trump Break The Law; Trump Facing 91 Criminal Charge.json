I'm Rosemary Church, and This is CNN NEWSROOM.Just ahead, former U.S. President Donald Trump is promising a \"major news conference\" next week about the 2020 election in Georgia, just days before he is due to surrender on charges stemming from his attempts to overturn that vote. Ukraine says Russia is using foreign ships in the latest drones fired at civilian targets. And Madonna reschedules her celebration to a dates that had been postponed after a health scare earlier this month. Well, the countdown is on for Donald Trump, who has less than 10 days to turn himself into Georgia authorities. The former president received a historic fourth indictment on Monday. He's been charged with 13 counts in a case alleging he and 18 others, scheme to subvert Georgia's 2020 presidential election results. According to the Fulton County sheriff, Trump is expected to turn himself in at the county jail. In the meantime, he has announced a \"major news conference\" coming next Monday, about his false claims that there was widespread fraud in Georgia during the presidential elections. Trump's former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows has wasted no time, attempting to have the Georgia case move to federal court. According to new court filings. Meadows argues he is entitled to federal immunity since the Georgia charges stem from his time serving the sitting president. Well, among the 19 defendants charged in the Georgia election case, are eight lawyers who either worked for or were somehow connected to Donald Trump. CNN's Jessica Schneider has more on how those who took an oath to uphold the law could potentially be found guilty of breaking it. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, charging 19 people for crimes in the alleged criminal enterprise to overturn the 2020 election. And eight of them are lawyers, professionally obligated to follow the law, but now accused of breaking it. Already, at least one, is now claiming the D.A. is criminalizing the practice of law.",

And that's what's confounding, not just about this case, but the three that came before it is we don't really have a playbook for how this plays out with an American president. And Donald Trump is going to try to use that to his legal advantage, but also to his political advantage. So, he is going to try to convince the courts to give him special treatment, because it's exceptional and historical precedent. And he's also going to try to convince voters in the GOP base and across the country, that these are political charges, and not based on facts. I think he's going to have a hard time doing that with the broader public. But so far, it looks like that's resonating with Republican voters.",

I mean, their evidence is damning, and it's based off of testimony that they've received over many, many months, from officials at all levels of government.But what's really crucial here, Rosemary, is that the vast majority of the prosecutors, witnesses are Republicans. They are people who served within the Republican Party, people who are elected Republican leaders, people within the president's own administration, and in the U.S. Senate that are Republicans. And that's what I think is going to be really difficult for Donald Trump, especially, if this case moves into a trial that as we know, in Georgia is likely to be televised. As you're going to see, like you did with the January 6 hearings, a parade of Republican officials saying that the president of the United States was trying to get them to do something that at best was corrupt, and at worst was criminal. And so, I think this shotgun approach with the vast array of charges that could be applicable gives the prosecutor likely more opportunity to make some of those charges stick. But more importantly than that, it seems very consistent with the reality, which is that a great number of violations of the law occurred in the course of this effort to overturn the election.",

And he wins the race? And that's very viable. I mean, at this point, the betting markets still have him at a 30 percent chance of winning the presidency in 2024, then, we are in a likely moment of constitutional crisis, if somewhere in that window he's convicted, in what you know, rightfully, Rosemary is a potentially pardon proof case.

We saw on Tuesday, devastating attacks on the western city of Lviv.Missile attacks, being targeted, according to the Russian Defense Ministry at Ukrainian military infrastructure. But of course, we know that there were civilians injured in those attacks, according to the Ukrainian authorities. But what has emerged from these attacks, according to those Ukrainian authorities, is that they believe they found 30 foreign chips within these missiles, which they say were manufactured in Russia this year. Now, at this stage, the Ukrainian authorities are working, they say, with their international partners to gather more information around these chips, to find out where specifically they weren't manufactured. But the message from the Ukrainian authorities is that this is a clear signal that restrictions needs to be strengthened. They want sanctions against Russia and against Russia's partners to be strengthened by the international communities in order to prevent the manufacturing, and of course, the sending of these crucial components of these missiles to the Russian Armed Forces, to prevent these missiles from being manufactured in Russia. They say they were manufactured in April of this year. So, not too long ago. But, of course, we're also learning about the Russian manufacturing of drones and their military capabilities on that front. Over the last few weeks, we've seen the use of drones, particularly, Iranian made Shahed drones used by the Russian Armed Forces to devastating effect on Ukrainian territory. And just in the last hour, we've had an intelligence update from the U.K. Ministry of Defense. I can read you just a little bit about that update. They say Russia has almost certainly started to deploy domestically produced one way attack on crude aerial vehicles, or in other words, drones. And that this indigenous manufacturing of these drones will allow Russia to establish a more reliable source of these drones. We've seen them, of course, relying heavily on those Iranian made Shahed drones in the past. Well, this will certainly up their capabilities, according to the U.K. Ministry of Defense. Now, we are real concern for Ukraine as this counter offensive continues. We heard yesterday from the Ukrainian deputy defense minister saying that this is going to be a long fight, calling on the Ukrainian civilians, warning Ukraine this will be a long fight ahead that they must be prepared for.",

Now, it has to be pointed out this is not coming directly from Travis King, it is coming from North Korean state media. And a U.S. defense official says that they have no way of verifying these statements that are allegedly from King. But their focus remains making sure that they can bring him home safely. Now, we have heard through a family spokesperson from his mother, saying that she is asking Pyongyang to treat him humanely. And she's also asking for a phone call with her son. Now, looking at past precedents, that's unlikely. This is not the way that North Korea generally behaves, when it comes to U.S. detainees on their soil.
