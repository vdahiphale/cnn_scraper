As you can see there, that's incoming been told an outgoing fire, as you can see flares there. This is Gaza. And it comes, as what, 11:00 just now, just turned 11:00. And this airstrikes, of course, we've seen there in a densely, very densely populated part of the Gaza Strip, but Netanyahu in the last 24 hours vowing to avenge the hundreds of Israeli lives lost with ferocious firepower. We are now seeing in the last moments, incoming and outgoing fire, of course. And it comes after Israeli's government formally declared war on Hamas. Fighting in Israel is raging one day after the Palestinian militant group reached the border from Gaza in a surprise attack. More than 600 people are dead, thousands are wounded. Hamas has taken unknown number of people captive. And we're now hearing, we've heard in the last hour in fact, that Islamic Jihad is holding at least 30 captives from Saturday's assault. An official tells CNN he expects the death toll in Israel to rise considerably. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And of course, when you have the consideration of hostages and trying to potentially rescue them, Israel doesn't take hostages lightly. I mean, we saw with Gilad Shalit, who was abducted in 2006 and held captive for several years, that Israel traded something like 1,000 Palestinian prisoners just for one single soldier. This situation, this isn't a soldier who was on active duty like Gilad Shalit, these were civilians who were in their homes, these are children, these are toddlers, these are elderly in wheelchairs.This is a totally different situation, a totally different equation. And mister -- Benjamin Netanyahu, as we said before, likes to call himself Mr. Security, but he's usually very careful when it comes to military operations. But he will not have a choice here.

This is why they're supporting Hamas so heavily. And this is why they're encouraging them to attack Israel. They want to undermine the Saudi American deal that is now being contemplated, that is supposed to strengthen the moderate access, the partners of democracies. Obviously, if Hamas and Hezbollah will be strengthened, it will be bad for the west cause and for the free world cause. Also, in the Ukraine, Iran is a partner and supplies Russia with ammunition.

We -- among the decisions we know from the Israeli government and from the cabinet to stop supply of electricity fuel and goods to Gaza.

Security Council has been holding emergency closed door meetings right now as it attempts to find a way to stop the bloodshed in Israel and Gaza. Israel's U.N. ambassador showed a photo of a grandmother, you can see there, being taken captive by Hamas militants before he walked into the Security Council meeting and laid out the scale of the crisis.

And I don't think that the ambassador, the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations is over exaggerating there. We're talking about more than 600 dead so far in Israel. Just to put that into context, that's already around about a quarter of the casualties that Israel suffered in the Yom Kippur War almost 50 years ago to the day. And of course, we're talking about a population of just over 9 million.So everybody kind of knows someone in Israel or know someone who knows someone who has either had someone injured or a relative who's been kidnapped or taken hostage or has somehow been directly impacted by what we've been seeing over the past 36 hours. And I think, as the chief of the general staff in Israel said, now is the time for war. I don't think that the diplomacy for all of the good intentions of some people at the U.N. Security Council is really going to stick right now, certainly not when Israel is determined to hit back at Hamas. But as we heard from our previous guests, of course, it's a very complicated situation both militarily and politically, because you do have those hostages, dozens of them, inside the Gaza Strip who were taken there forcibly by Hamas militants from Israel inside the Gaza Strip. If Israel goes in with some kind of ground incursion, as may well be the case, then there's always the potential for more Israeli soldiers perhaps to be taken hostage, in addition to the civilians, of course, who have been taken by Hamas militants and the danger for more civilian casualties on the Palestinian side as well. But of course, politically, this government has burnished its security credentials. It will live and die by the security provides to Israel, and clearly it has not provided that. So we may see political moves, perhaps for a government of national unity, the emergency government which opposition leaders have suggested, but only under certain conditions, Isa.",

Israel doesn't seem to have a firm number on how many hostages there are, so that number could very well rise. The internal memo reviewed by CNN also makes reference to Americans who are missing and could very well be hostages. And that raises the question also, of course, if they are live hostages or if they have been killed.So, again, that number of at least three appears very much expected to rise. There is a very large population of American citizens in Israel, many of them dual citizens, American, Israeli. It is one of the largest American communities overseas in the entire world. So, that number, again, very much expected to rise. But it's not just American that we've seen. From other CNN reporting we've seen that Mexico and Brazil also worried about their own citizens who potentially have been either taken hostage or killed in this attack. The number still rising at this point of those killed. And again, the number unclear on hostages. ECU (ph) pointed out that Palestinian Islamic Jihad claims 30 hostages. It's worth pointing out that Islamic Jihad is a much smaller organization than Hamas, a fraction of the size. So, potentially, Hamas has many more than that.",

A capability that has shown multiple times over the course of the past 42 hours or so that it can overwhelm Israel's Iron Dome aerial defense system as it has done and may very well be doing again. As I was looking at my phone here before I came on with you, I saw the red alerts coming up in the warning that Hamas may be targeting Ben Gurion Airport. The airport itself has Iron Dome interceptors around it to keep it safe. But again, the question, can they simply overwhelm it as they have before?And it's a tactic we have seen them try out and trial, and it looks like very much improve over the course of the past several years. Iron Dome is a very capable system, but it is a quality system, not a quantity system. And Hamas has shown its ability to simply overwhelm it with batches of rocket fire that are simply too many in number for Iron Dome to intercept. The question then, where does it get through? Does it hit an open field, as many of them do? These are largely unguided rockets, even if they are short range, medium range, long range rockets.
