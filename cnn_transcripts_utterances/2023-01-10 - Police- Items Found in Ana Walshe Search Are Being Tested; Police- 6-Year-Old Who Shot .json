Then today, the D.A.'s office put out a statement giving us an update in terms of what investigators have found there, saying they found a number of items which, quote, \"are subject to processing and testing to determine if they are of evidentiary value to this investigation.\" So that clearly means that investigators now have something in their hands that they're going to be testing. We're going to have to see what those items are and how it's related to the case. Also, as you may have heard, this investigation taking somewhat of a gruesome turn when more details were released about what investigators have found so far. Investigators telling CNN that Brian Walshe, in the days after his wife disappeared, conducted some sort of an Internet search where he was searching for how to dispose of a 115-pound body. And in addition to that, how to dismember a body. Again, very gruesome details we have to tell you about here. We heard more of them yesterday during Brian Walshe's court proceeding, where investigators, prosecutors laid out what investigators actually found at the home here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Talking to investigators, talking to the family trying to determine that answer. But another is, whether this mother could be charged definitively for this incident.

That the 6-year-old brought the mother's firearm to school in a backpack. He was able to get that into his backpack and bring it to school and get it in undetected. There were several rounds of ammunition in the backpack -- I mean, in the gun when it was fired according to police. The police also say there was no physical struggle or fight before the shooting. The teacher was providing class instruction when the shot was fired. Police are working with the school to see if there are any past behavioral issues with the child. I asked the police chief yesterday about that question. And he did not answer it at the time. Investigators also want to speak to children, other kids at the school who witnessed the shooting. And I can also tell you, there are a few people being hailed as heroes today. One is, of course, the teacher who was shot, Abby Zwerner. The police chief said she made sure everybody got out of the class when the shot was fired. And there was another school employee who came into the class at the time and restrained the child. The child struck that employee but the employee was able to restrain the child until police got there. That employee also being hailed as a hero this afternoon -- Abby?",

There could be some relief on the way for millions of Americans who are paying off their student loans. There's a new proposal from the Biden administration that would lower federal student loan payments but there's a catch. CNN's Sunlen Serfaty is with me now to explain.

And that potentially mean a lot of people have their monthly plan lowered or potentially wiped out, put on pause for a moment. Now, parts of this proposal would higher the income threshold for repayment. Right now, it's $24,000. That would be increased to $30,600 per year. People who are not making that amount would have their loan payments put on pause. For those making above the income threshold, there still could be some savings, too. Undergraduate borrowers would be capped at 5 percent of the income. That's half of the current 10 percent. Also the Department of Education could potentially stop charging unpaid monthly interest and would shorten the time it takes for some smaller loans to be forgiven. And this would apply potentially to current and future borrowers as well. Now, it's important to note here, Abby, that this is all just in the planning stage. This is just a proposal for a regulatory change. If that is adopted, potentially later this year, then these changes could take place. But senior administration officials told reporters last night, as of now, they have no specific timeline for when these changes could happen.",

Seattle public schools are now suing the parent companies of Facebook, TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram and YouTube because they claim that these platforms are hurting kids' mental health and making it harder for teachers to do their jobs.CNN's Donie O'Sullivan is joining us now. Donie, it's very interesting. There's no question it's harder to be a teenager these days because of social media. But what does the lawsuit actually say about how these companies, according to the Seattle public schools, are claiming that they are responsible for this crisis? DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Abby. Yes, this is a fascinating lawsuit. And, you know, it very well may not be successful. But what I think it does is really put this on a national agenda, have this extremely important conversation. And also, of course, we might learn a lot through the discovery process. And I want to show you what the lawsuit, part of it says. It says, \"This mental health crisis is no accident. It is the results of the defendants'\" -- in this case, the social media platforms -- \"deliberate choices and affirmative actions to design and market their social media platforms to attract youth.\" And it's not just talking about the content that is on these platforms and the stuff you see there but also just how these platforms are designed. I mean, you know, I think we all know how addictive in nature Instagram, TikTok, these platforms can be. And you know, even as adults, we don't always necessarily feel great after we find ourselves doom scrolling and seeing how great a time people are having on social media -- Abby?",

And, you know, a lot of parents think, OK, there's some teenagers out there, they're accessing porn online, MAYBE watching it, but certainly not my teen.

It is notable that just 27 percent believe that these -- this pornography accurately portrays the real -- the way most people have sex. if you think about this, of the ones who are watching porn intentionally, six in 10 almost, 59 percent say they're watching porn at least once a week. So that 27 percent number is interesting in the sense that not very many people -- these teens think that these are accurate portrayals of how people get together. But the ones who watch the most porn, those who watch three or more days out of the last seven days, they have -- 80 percent of those have been exposed to violence, rape, choking, inflicting pain on others. And those kids are much more likely to think most people would like to be hit during sex and that it's safe and OK to put your hands around someone's throat during sex.
