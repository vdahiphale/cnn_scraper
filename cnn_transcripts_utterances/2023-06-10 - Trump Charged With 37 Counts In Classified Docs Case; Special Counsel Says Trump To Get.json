      "sentences": "Rorschach test unsealed. I'm Michael Smerconish in Philadelphia. Look, no matter how expected it might have been, it was nevertheless stunning to see it splashed all across front pay in America. Donald Trump indicted again. But will the new 37 count indictment land with Republican voters, the same as the existing case of falsifying business records? Or as Peter Baker put it in \"The New York Times,\" Republican voters may not care if their leader slips money to a porn star to keep quiet, but will they be indifferent about impeding authorities seeking to recover clandestine materials? That's today's poll question, which I'll share in just a moment. It may depend upon responses by Trump's GOP opponents. Most were quick to weigh in before the indictment was unsealed.Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, he tweeted, the weaponization of federal law enforcement represents a mortal threat to a free society. Mike Pence used the same word while calling for the unsealing of the indictment, the American people should be able to judge for themselves whether this is just the latest incident of weaponization and politicization at the Justice Department or if it's something different, he said. Ditto for South Carolina Senator Tim Scott on the weaponization charge, Vivek Ramaswamy, he went a step further, committing to pardoning Trump immediately upon his own swearing in. Chris Christie kept his powder dry initially saying, we don't get our news from Truth Social, Trump's account. Let's see what the facts are when any possible indictment is released. Only former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson called for Trump to withdraw from the race. The Trump defending reactions, they're curious. We're coming from individuals who decided to enter a nomination battle against a former president who remains immensely popular with the party base. As I've argued here and on Sirius XM radio, the only reason they're running against someone whose policies they largely approve of and who has 50 percent of the vote, is because this is what they expected would happen, that his campaign would be threatened by the weight of various criminal investigations and indictments. So they're actually trying to exploit something they believe or at least say is illegitimate. Not that I'm totally unsympathetic with some of the talking points. The Hunter-Biden prosecution has been underway since December of 2020. That's nearly four years. It's inexcusable that such an uncomplicated case is still unresolved. And it's true that legacy media show zero appetite to pursue questions about possible financial entanglements between Hunter and the President. House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer is currently looking at the claim of an FBI informant that the head of Burisma paid both Hunter and then vice president, 5 million each. The president flatly says that's malarkey. Equally fair to ask why Secretary Clinton was unpunished for what FBI Director James Comey once described as extremely careless handling of very sensitive, highly classified information. But none of that excuses Trump for taking and withholding government property, nor treating it with what looks like brazen carelessness. The indictment says that Trump retained documents so sensitive that some required special handling. These documents were related to national defense. They were classified at the highest levels. One of them includes a top secret marking, it's dated June of 2020, quote, concerning nuclear capabilities of a foreign country. Photographs included in the indictment showed boxes stored in a bathroom, a shower, a ballroom, all at Mar-a-Lago. One photo was a Rorschach test. To some, it was the epitome of lax handling of government property, but to the former president, it was something else. The box on the floor, which was open, said Trump, who opened it, clearly shows there were no documents, but rather newspapers, personal pictures, et cetera, witch hunt. Two questions linger why did he take the materials to begin with? And why didn't he hand them back when requested, like Biden and Pence apparently did? As to the first, \"The Washington Post\" reported in November of last year that federal agents and prosecutors believe Trump's motive for taking and keeping materials was largely due to his ego and his desire to hold the materials as trophies or mementos, not to excuse it. But he's always been an ephemera guy who was noted to keep newspaper mentions and other chachkas stacked high in his Trump Tower office. Maybe the bigger mystery remains why, when asked, he didn't return them, instead essentially inviting a federal magistrate judge to authorize a search warrant of Mar-a-Lago. Were they of such personal or professional value to Trump, or was it indicative of a pugilist personality? I don't want anybody looking through my boxes, he reportedly said. It's too soon to know for sure how this all plays out, legally or politically. Trump's GOP support remains steady even after New York's hush money indictment. And in some ways, it's only gotten stronger. [09:05:16] Trump was polling at 43 percent in February before Alvin Bragg introduced his charges. And now, just a few months later, his support has bumped to one. The Stormy Daniels case provoked a media narrative implying voters don't care about the former president's legal woes, at least when it comes to sex. But maybe voters have their own ideas for what constitutes a serious crime. Data suggests this classified documents indictment could be far more problematic for the former president. An NPR/PBS/Maris poll finds 70 percent of voters do not want Trump to be president again if he's charged in a classified documents indictment. The polling seems to suggest viewers view these two indictments in separate categories, and that's what the crowded GOP field is counting on, even as they lamb base the Justice Department for the latest charges. Which leads me to this week's poll question at smerconish.com, did Donald Trump's indictment in the classified documents case just guarantee him the Republican nomination? Joining me now to discuss is Erick Erickson. He's a conservative talk radio host and political commentator, and Aaron Blake, senior political reporter for The Washington Post. Eric, let me begin with you. Before the unsealing of the indictment, you said you thought this would elevate him. I'm going to give you the chance to reconsider now that it's been published, and I'm sure you've read it.",

However, it provides greater ammunition, I think, for all the other Republicans to say when you read the indictment, it actually is one of the stupidest things you will ever read. Not the indictment itself, but the actions of the former president. I mean the man has been -- the Democrats have been after him for six years. They've impeached him twice. They indicted him in New York. They've been saying they were going to get him.When a grand jury asked you to hand over documents and you instead asked your lawyers to hide them and the lawyers admit you did this, that's pretty stupid. It gives an opening for the other Republicans to say, we've always said he has no impulse control, and here's the outcome. The other side of this is --",

I think what you see with the history of Donald Trump and these controversies is that no Republican wants to be the first to leap. They want to leave it to somebody else. And what often happens in that case is that nobody ultimately leaps. Nobody goes there because they know over the course of many controversies that the people who decide to take that leap see their careers torpedoed. I think we do have something of a potentially different case here in that we are going to see a series of revelations. We now have at least one Republican presidential candidate in, Chris Christie, who seems as though he is going to take this argument to Trump. I think if you look closely at Mike Pence's comments about this, he's leaving open the idea that maybe he's going to argue this stuff is pretty bad ultimately, so we're going to have to see how this plays out.But there's no question that they are treating this very gingerly right now and basically hoping that somebody else does the work for them.",

      "sentences": "Yes. So I think it's first, it's worth noting there was a recent poll from YouGov that showed it actually asked about several different controversies that Trump is facing where he could face some kind of charges, 52 percent regarded the Manhattan indictment, the conduct described there as being a serious crime. That 52 percent went up to 65 percent for retaining classified documents and obstructing efforts to return them.So it's not the only poll to suggest that people regard this conduct as being more significant. I think if you also look at the build up to the Manhattan indictment, there was a sense, according to some polls, that people thought this was politically motivated, that there was some politics behind this, a Democratic prosecutor bringing these charges. There was a Quinnipiac poll that showed two to one Americans thought that there was a political role involved in those charges. So I think it's clear that we have a situation in which people regard these charges as more serious. I think the question from there is how much it is proven in their mind that is something that we're going to find out in the coming months. It could be a while for that. And then how much this actually pulls people who might be geared towards Donald Trump on a more partisan basis, how much it might actually pull them away from him. Not so much in the Republican primary, where it looks like there's a very limited impact, but in the general election, where he needs to count on those votes. But at the same time, Erick, you believe there's a prospect, depending upon perception, that maybe even some Republicans who don't like Donald Trump will feel some sense of sympathy toward him and come to his side. At least that's what you wrote in part before the unsealing.",

If he were found not guilty, there would be sympathy towards him. If not, I don't think so. I also do think the one thing I've learned about the President's base and the Republican primary in the last few years is you sometimes have to let this stuff marinate. The initial reaction, and then what comes from it afterwards changes as people hear more about it.The initial reaction is, circle the wagons. This is political. They have no charges. Look at Hillary Clinton. And then after, it's marinated on and they think, well, wait a second, it was Donald Trump's administration that didn't prosecute Hillary Clinton. And these documents are pretty important documents. You will see people's minds change. You'll see him go up and down. In fact, we're already seeing this in some polling in Iowa, New Hampshire, while he's still in the majority. His numbers have been trending down pretty steadily for the last several weeks.",

I know we see Garland and Jack Smith as these sort of non-political icons, but they're aware of public perception.

It's supposed to be hands off, but at a certain point, the Special Counsel has to run a potential indictment or decision not to indict that absolutely by law has to go to the Attorney General, who then has to defer, not automatically, but has to generally defer towards what the Special Counsel wants. So we know for sure that Jack Smith recommended an indictment, and we know for sure that Merrick Garland approved it.And I agree with you.

It was unthinkable to me, this traditional prosecutor, and now they're there all the time, and they should be. They're evidence. Why not? It's such an interesting Rorschach test, but I'm not really buying the well, they're just newspaper side.Yes, they are just newspapers, but the fact that some or perhaps many of the documents were innocuous or souvenirs fine, that doesn't undermine the fact that even a small portion of them were decidedly not. And the indictment lays out the high level of sensitivity of those documents. So it doesn't much matter to me if the sensitive documents are all alone in one folder or are surrounded by tchotchkes, to use your excellent phrase from earlier.

Jack Smith was just saying the thing that all good prosecutors are trained to say. You are sort of trained from day one. If a judge said to me today, you have to go to trial tomorrow at 9Really who governs when trial happens is, A, the judge, but with more deference towards the defendant, because the defendant's the one with constitutional rights, with the ability to bring motions, with the need to prepare his defense, to do his own investigation. The defense is just starting their investigation, theoretically, on the day they get the indictment. So Jack Smith is just saying, we're ready to go as soon as possible.

D.C., Donald Trump got 5 percent, just over 5 percent of the vote in 2020, meaning about 95 percent of the people who would have been in that jury pool in D.C. voted against him. Of course, Trump won Florida in 2020. Most of the southern counties where this is going to draw its jury pool from, he won at least 40 percent.So you're looking at a very different jury pool. And people will say, well, jurors are instructed. They're selected. They're sort of vetted out. And they're told, don't bring your political views into the courtroom, nonsense. I've tried enough cases. Jurors are human beings, and especially in Donald Trump. I'm not saying it's impossible that somebody who likes Trump votes to convict him or vice versa, but man, oh, man, do you want to be in front of a jury that doesn't like the guy? And let me say, I give DOJ credit here. They did the right thing legally, because they definitely have proper venue down in Florida, where Mar-a-Lago is.
