If you're just joining us, here are some of today's top stories.Well, France is organizing flights for vulnerable nationals who want to leave Haiti. It comes as a U.S. State Department has evacuated more than 230 people looking to flee the recent gang violence in Haiti's capital Port-au-Prince. Evacuations of U.S. citizens are also happening through state-coordinated efforts. Ireland is again poised to get its youngest ever Prime Minister. The ruling party has named Higher Education Minister Simon Harris as its new leader. The 37-year-old Harris would succeed Leo Varadkar, who surprisingly resigned last week citing personal and political reasons. Hindus are celebrating the Festival of Colors in India and Pakistan, known as Holi. It marks the beginning of spring and celebrates the victory of good over evil. Some communities begin the festivities the night before by lighting bonfires, followed by singing religious songs and drenching each other in colored powder and buckets of water on the day of Holi. Assistance for Ukraine has been blocked in the U.S. Congress for weeks, but it may become a bargaining chip for House Democrats. On Friday, Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene filed a motion to oust fellow Republican Mike Johnson from his role as House Speaker. Democrats now say they might come to his rescue if he helps pass Ukraine aid. CNN's Manu Raju has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "House Democrats are considering saving Mike Johnson from a threat from his speakership after Marjorie Taylor Greene announced on Friday that she would try to make Mike Johnson the second speaker ever to be ousted by his own colleagues.The first speaker happened last fall. Kevin McCarthy was booted in the aftermath of a right-wing revolt. That was a little bit different at that time. Democrats all voted to oust him along with eight Republicans. Kevin McCarthy was pushed out of the speakership. There was 22 days of chaos. Johnson came in. Now he's facing a similar threat after he agreed with Democrats on a bill to keep the government open through September. Now, the question will be how Democrats handle this because many of them are indicating that they are willing to save him. Why? Because of Ukraine aid being stalled in the House. Many of them say if Johnson were to outline a path to getting Ukraine aid approved, then that would change their calculus and perhaps they would vote to save him. REP. ABIGAIL SPANBERGER (D-VA): If he does the responsible thing, which is allowing members of Congress to vote on a bill that will pass and that is in our national security interests, and then subsequent to that a non-serious actor who doesn't want to govern brings a motion to vacate, yes, I would motion to table in that circumstance. REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): I will make common cause with anybody who will stand up for the people of Ukraine, anybody who will get desperately needed humanitarian assistance to Gaza, and anybody who will work for a two-state solution.",

Now, the House is in recess for the next two weeks. She told me that she is not certain about her timing yet. But when she comes back, that could change. She could move to the floor, start the process, which would be two days before they would actually cast that critical vote.The first vote is expected to be a motion to table or kill this resolution on a procedural matter -- procedural grounds. That is one that the Democrats are considering doing, essentially voting to kill the resolution from going forward. But their demands are pretty clear, move on Ukraine aid, and if there's a path that they believe Ukraine aid can become law, perhaps Johnson can stay in the job. Manu Raju, CNN, Washington.

They say they hit two Russian naval vessels, a communications center and several other facilities in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol.Officials in Nigeria say at least 137 schoolchildren kidnapped from Kaduna earlier this month have been rescued. The Nigerian military says they were rescued early Sunday morning. Nearly 300 were initially reported as being held captive. But the Nigerian government insists that all of the children are now safe. The state's governor says he met with families of the children and the students will be hosted at an official dinner on Monday. But added that one teacher had died after developing complications while in captivity. Well, joining us now is CNN's David McKenzie, who's following the story from Johannesburg. David, tell us, what is the latest on the kidnapped schoolchildren and have all of them been released as the government claims?",

Perhaps as much as 100 miles from where they were taken after school assembly in a terrifying circumstances of gunmen driving motorcycles, heavily armed, killing at least one person who's trying to protect the kids and then taking them away in what has become an all too frequent occurrence in that part of Nigeria. The parents, of course, are very relieved.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JIBRIL, GWADABE-KURIGA, KURIGA COMMUNITY SPOKESPERSON: When we had the -- our children are back. We're happy, people are happy, you know, you're bleating what all you wait to see the to see our children, but we believe they are back since government cannot tell us lies. They have informed us that children are now they are taking care of them so that, you know, they have to go under some treatment before they hand over to us. (END VIDEO CLIP) MCKENZIE: Well, if you see these images, these are the children after they have been released, that they were shown to the governor who's taking credit for the rescue in this case. They haven't been given back to the parents at this stage, we believe. And of course, while the government takes credit for these kind of rescue operations, we did speak to family members who said they were contacted by the so-called bandits who are asking for more than $600,000 in ransom money. There's no indication one way or the other whether a ransom was paid. But this is the trend in Nigeria, Anna, over many years now. There have been children, often at least 1400 of them, according to some estimates, kidnapped in various parts of Nigeria in the northwest. It is often for ransom and a sense of lawlessness and an inability of the government and successive presidents to, in fact, protect its most vulnerable citizens from these bandits. And so the government can take some credit for getting the children back, but they certainly aren't able to prevent them at this stage from being taken -- Anna.",

Thank you.Well, most of us can't imagine our lives without electronic devices and not just screens, we also rely on larger items like refrigerators and air conditioners. According to a new joint report from the United Nations Institute for Training and Research and the International Telecommunications Union, the world is now producing a record amount of electronic waste or e- waste, and it's putting lives at risk. Kim Brunhuber has our report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KIM BRUNHUBER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): These men in Ghana are rummaging through discarded electronics. Using screwdrivers and pliers, they break down computers and cell phones for any parts they can salvage. But this is just one electronic wasteland. An alarming new U.N. report says that since 2010, the amount of global e-waste has grown five times faster than it can be collected and recycled. According to the study, a record 62 million metric tons of e-waste was produced in 2022. That's an increase of 82 percent from 2010. And the world is on track to generate a whopping 82 million tons of e-waste in 2030. One U.N. researcher says that we're losing the battle against e- waste and the wealthy are mostly to blame. KEES BALDE, SR. SCIENTIFIC U.N. INSTITUTE FOR TRAINING AND RESEARCH: Well, the richer you are, the more you consume, well, the more products you are buying on the battery and the plug, and the more e- waste you are generating. [04:40:00] BRUNHUBER (voice-over): What's more, e-waste recycling only produces one percent of the rare earth elements needed to meet the current demand, which leaves the world highly dependent on just a few countries where rare earths are mined, including countries in Africa. The continent generates the lowest amount of e-waste, but recycling rates there are below one percent. A high-level official with the International Telecommunication Union says it's up to the manufacturers to make a difference by giving devices a longer life cycle.",

How can we get that going? How can we get it going a few more years? BRUNHUBER (voice-over): But such efforts won't do enough to address the rapidly growing mountains of e-waste, especially as society grows more dependent on tech devices which are linked to the Internet. Despite the dire forecast, the report says there's still time to introduce infrastructure to process e-waste more efficiently, driving up demand for recycled materials and increasing recycling rates overall.
