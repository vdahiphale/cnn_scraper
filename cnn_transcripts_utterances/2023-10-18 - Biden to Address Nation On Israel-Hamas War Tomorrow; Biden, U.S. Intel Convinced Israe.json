      "sentences": "In a region known to be a powder keg, there are serious concerns that a fuse has been activated as a war of bloodshed and a war of misinformation intensifies. That's tonight on Newsnight.And good evening. I'm Abby Phillip. President Biden is scheduled to address the nation tomorrow night to discuss the conflict between Israel and Hamas that is quickly expanding. Now, the primetime address signals that Biden wants the country to be prepared for what could be a pivotal moment for the world. It also signals his confidence that Israel is not responsible for that deadly attack on a hospital in Gaza. And so far, there is good reason for him to be. As misinformation runs rampant, here is what we know so far. U.S. intelligence believes that Israel was not responsible based on missile activity, the type of explosion that they've seen, the damage and also images of the aftermath. Now, Israel has also purported to have audio of Hamas discussing an errant missile. Meantime, the Palestinians and Hamas have not provided any specific evidence that it was an Israeli strike. Instead, Hamas is offering up conspiracies and, predictably, anti-Israel rhetoric. But the question is, does proof matter to an Arab world already distrustful of the west? And will that distrust fuel even more violence? I want to start now with CNN's Kaitlan Collins, who is on the ground in Tel Aviv. Kaitlan, President Biden is now making it very clear that he believes that, according to U.S. intelligence, Israel's version of events here, when it comes to this hospital blast, what can you tell us about how he got to that point?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Abby. It really just showcases why it's so important at a critical moment like this when there are things happening so quickly on the ground in places like here in Tel Aviv, but also closer to the border here in Israel to double check that information.And that is something, a message that really complicated President Biden's trip here today, as he was set to take off from Washington before he came here. That was as the White House was issuing a statement saying they were concerned about the loss of life, but they did not say who they believe in this situation. Was it the Israelis who were denying it? Was it the Palestinian authorities and what they were saying about who they believed was responsible, which, of course, was Israel? But when President Biden got here today, it was one of the first things that he said. It wasn't a very forceful statement initially. He said to Prime Minister Netanyahu that they believed it was the other team who was responsible for that strike. But then later on, you heard President Biden saying in his final remarks here that they did believe it was an errant rocket that came from a terrorist group in Gaza. And that is what hit that hospital and caused that deadly blast. That, of course, despite whoever is responsible still had real life consequences for those civilians who we know have been living in dire conditions in Gaza before this war even happened. And so what we've heard from administration officials since then is that they did their own homework here. They're not just relying on Israeli denials or Israeli evidence. The Pentagon, the National Security Council, intelligence officials looked into this. They looked at open source reporting. They looked at intercepts. They looked at infrared activity. And that's how they made that determination, which they said pretty explicitly tonight that they did not believe Israel was responsible. But, of course, you're right, Abby, to note, this has set off a ton of protests here in the Middle East, in the area. And despite President Biden coming out and saying that, that hasn't really dampened that anger. That is something that all of these world leaders are dealing with as they try to move forward in this conflict.",

And I believe that that was the one that lost its engine and fell on close to the hospital, not on the hospital.So, this is part of the proof that the Israeli Defense Forces gave. They said, hey, this is something called a Q-36 radar. They used these radars to connect with the Iron Dome to shoot down rockets. So, when you see all these coming off of a missile site and one dropping over the top of a hospital, you can see where it was, truthfully, an accident, a missile that didn't go through to its final mission.",

LBJ went to South Vietnam twice in two years, followed by Nixon. Several presidents hit the Korean DMZ, including Carter and Reagan. Bush 41 spent Thanksgiving in Saudi Arabia during Desert Shield, and then later Somalia during a civil war. His successor went to Bosnia twice for peacekeeping missions. Bush 43 made at least six trips to war zones, mostly Iraq and Afghanistan, of course, the same for Obama, to those two nations at least four times.

And as far as I can tell, the weight of evidence very much is that this was not an Israeli airstrike. This was probably exactly what Mark Hertling said, a failed rocket launch. I think it would be very important in that situation to keep putting out more and more evidence as it accumulates more photographs. Perhaps there are remnants of the missile one can find or photograph, because I do think that pushing back against what appears to be a manufactured story or really more people conveniently believing the part of the truth they want to believe is part of what the problem here is. The United States and Israel should provide as much evidence as they can to break that narrative. Now, will it work? I don't know, but at least it will show a good faith effort. It will show, provide more evidence. The Israelis already have done some of that. The United States has done some of that. But, otherwise, I think it becomes one of these issues that, like so much of what we experienced today, one side has its truth and the other side has its truth.

After empowering the radical right, they just can't cobble together a governing coalition. And the problem predates Kevin McCarthy. Since 2010, every GOP speaker has been pushed out or jumped because they couldn't corral what John Boehner called knuckle-draggers and anarchists in their caucus.Steve Scalise dropped out after less than a day in the race, and the current candidate, Jim Jordan, is even less suited to uniting the caucus, let alone Congress. He's more extreme, with basically no legislative record and part of Trump's attempt to overturn the election. But there is a solution to this circular firing squad. Republicans should free themselves from the far right and put forward a candidate who could win just enough Democratic votes to become Speaker. The center needs to grow a spine. Look, I get it. Colleagues are always saying I'm trying to bring Aaron Sorkin scripts to life in a capital that's far closer to Game of Thrones. Fair enough. Cynicism passes for wisdom in Washington for a reason. But this is a rare opportunity to break the hyper-partisan doom loop, with a speaker who leads not based on ideological agreement, but trust and mutual respect. What a concept, right? Now maybe it's empowering interim speaker, Patrick McHenry, or Tom Cole of Oklahoma, Nebraska's Don Bacon, Wisconsin's Mike Gallagher, Steve Womack from Arkansas, or Texas' Mike McCaul, or even Liz Cheney. Look, I get that this is a long ball, but it's not Mission Impossible. In fact, it just might be the most practical path forward for the country. PHILLIP: John, you know, I admire your optimism. But you know what? One of those names that you put out there, Tom Cole, he voted for Jim Jordan today. What makes you think the Democrats are going to back any of these Republicans?",
