TheWomen's World Cup is underway and it's being held in the southern hemisphere for the first time. The two host nations already in action this Thursday, New Zealand stunning with a win over Norway in the opening match and Australia, also beating Ireland both matches, a moment of silence was observed too before kickoff after a shooting in New Zealand claimed two lives. Amanda Davies joins us now. Amanda, this is very exciting, not only an expansion, actually of the number of teams that are playing and therefore the number of women but I believe actually the prize money for winning this up 300 percent since the 2019 World Cup which pleases me greatly not there yet, but improving.",

And I was lucky enough to co-host the draw for this tournament back in October in Auckland. I was there on the stage alongside two time winner, Carle Lloyd and you couldn't help but get drawn along by the real buzz and momentum looking ahead to this tournament, which is set not only to be the biggest ever football Women's World Cup, but the biggest ever women's sporting event on the planet. And I think it's fair to say the opening day has been a real roller coaster of emotions. With that news emerging in the hours before the opening game in Auckland of the deadly shooting that had taken place in the center of Auckland taking the lives of two people putting a number of others in hospital. World football's governing body FIFA did release a statement having spoken to authorities and the police and the governmental officials in New Zealand confirming it was completely unrelated to the tournament but just really awful timing when the momentum and the excitement had been building. So as you rightly said both the game in Auckland and Australia holding moments of silences ahead of the action kicking off. And you could see just what this moment meant for both of these two sides. New Zealand is a team who had never before won a match at a women's world cup. 15 matches they had played 15 matches they had failed to win. And then in their 16th they finally got that victory on home soil Eden Park such an iconic sporting victory. Ali Riley the captain, who is playing in her fifth world cup who has represented her nation across the world playing domestic football. She was overcome with emotion in the end saying she has done it. This is the statement that they really wanted to make and they're hoping that this will be a real platform to bounce from as the tournament goes on. And then it was over to Australia. Australia with the really bad news announced just an hour before kickoff just at full time with New Zealand's victory over Norway. That their talismanic Captain Australia's all-time record goal scorer Sam Kerr had been ruled out not only of this their opening match against the Republic of Ireland but also their second match against Nigeria having suffered a calf injury in training on match day minus one yesterday as people are away from football knowing. That was could have been a really telling blow but Samko -- Samko she was there on the sidelines, cheering her side on it was Steph Catley the person who took over their captain's armband for this one who ultimately scored the goal that made the difference. So both of the host nations off to a winning start and if today's football is anything to go by, we really are set for a pretty special month of action of course all roads leading to that final in Sydney, Australia on August 20th Julia.",

But the big question going into this report was these price cuts that the company has been making in recent months, due to increased competition over EVs? And the question has been how is that going to weigh on the company's results? The company reported better than expected increase in profits earnings of $3.1 billion, up 20 percent year-over-year. But as you said, that profit margin is lower 18.2 percent, which is lower than the 25 percent that the company reported a year ago. And so I think you're starting to see those price cuts weigh on the company's earnings.

Well, we're learning that on Monday at Incheon Airport, about 90 minutes' drive from where I'm standing right now. He was supposed to get on an American Airlines flight to Dallas.

Now where he is now after being in North Korean custody for Wednesday and now Thursday? Still an open question because the North Koreans have not released any information publicly.

We're only halfway through the year and already extreme floods in places like India, wildfires in Canada,Switzerland and Greece and tornadoes in the United States have not only put lives at risk, but have also meant heartbreaking scenes like this when property owners returned to survey the damage and then calculate the cost to rebuild. And that's where insurance plays a vital role. According to the Swiss Re Institute, their research arm of the insurance giant global economic losses tied to natural disasters reached $270 billion last year, of which less than half was covered by insurance and it's not just the extreme weather that matters. Rising inflation also means that the cost of fix the damage has soared too. Two years ago as well Swiss warned that with no action to redress climate change, the impact of global warming could slice a massive 18 percent off the global economy by 2050. And some countries in Southeast Asia could lose half of their GDP by mid-century. Joining us now is Jerome Haegeli; he's the Group's Chief Economist at the Swiss Re Institute.

It means also higher costs of replacing goods or replacing physical goods, but also of costs of physical losses. So that's why it's really important to act and keep obviously the risks on the check by various means.

You pay a premium, and then if something goes wrong, you'regiven them the cash back to rebuild your life in whatever ways required. But if events like we're seeing happen regularly enough. We start talking about things being predictable on an annual basis then insurance is surely no longer the right product, because it's predictable, rather than unexpected. I know you're an economist rather than a scientist, but are we getting to the point where you have to go back and look at the sort of risk pricing models that you're using and say, some of these events sort of fall into a different category?",

And there, we need to have clarity as well. When I think about building zones don't build where you're always going to be exposed, right to two floats, or to the weekend. So that's point number one, and yes the risk of climate change that needs to have a price and talking as an economist, I think what we need to do is need to internalize the costs of climate change, because it's an externality, which has great effects in terms of the environment in terms of also our well-being. But it also will have great effects, its significant effects on regions on the global economy. And if you don't act today, and now the costs are just going to increase. The flip side is I think that's also an important point to make is that if you invest into adaptation, to mitigate the effects of climate change. You also do something very much not just for the environment, but also for economic growth. And I very much believe that once you get inflation shock, under control, and price stability is also super important, because lower prices will also make it cheaper to fight climate change. And they should also allow for more investments into sustainable infrastructure, for example, and as a growth is a great growth, multiplier doom.",

Every entrepreneur is going to have good days and bad days. Some bad days are going to be extremely challenging. They're probably going to you know, give up, again, no different any other country, but here's particularly difficult. OPPMANN (voice over): Particularly difficult because for decades following the 1959 revolution, all private enterprise was banned in Cuba. Cubans were required to work for the state, then following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Official prohibitions on self-employment slowly began to ease. OPPMANN (on camera): The first entrepreneurs in a generation here face a unique problem. There are no businesses schools, scarce knowledge that can be passed down about self-employment. Cuba's budding capitalists have had to learn by doing. OPPMANN (voice over): Juan Carlos Blaine is turned a side business selling hamburgers into a restaurant franchise, a small supermarket and logistics company. Altogether, he says he employs more than 60 people attending the business boot camp, he says helped him to identify areas of future growth. We've done courses on E-commerce marketing, risk capital private financing, he says. They're very current things very modern and things that we can use a lot. Even though the U.S. government says it wants to help Cuban entrepreneurs, U.S. economic sanctions intended to impact the Cuban government also hurt business people here. Making it all but impossible for them to access the U.S. banking system or receive financing. The U.S.'s top diplomat in Havana says the Biden administration is studying if sanctions can be eased for Cuban entrepreneurs. BENJAMIN ZIFF, CHARGE D'AFFAIRES AT U.S. EMBASSY IN HAVANA: -- there's a shortage of food, there's a shortage of gas, shortage of water. The Cuban state economy is no longer able to provide for its people. And the answer to that is not a necessary evil private sector it is more better, more empowered private sector. OPPMANN (voice over): So far, the U.S. Embassy in Havana says about 200 entrepreneurs have taken this boot camp and the hope is that they can move beyond the decades of hostility between the U.S. and Cuba to not only transform their lives, but their country.
