But some Iranian Kurdish women are fighting back, saying that they are ready to die for their rights.CNN's Nima Elbagir met some of them training for the battle across that border in Iraqi Kurdistan. She has their story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  In a remote area in Northern Iraq's Kurdish region, an all-female fighting unit belonging to the armed Kurdish Iranian opposition party pack continues to train. These women have been pulled back from the frontline. For the last three weeks the area they patrolled in the north east of Iraq has been hit by shells sent from across border by Iran. This unit is part of a larger fighting force. For every single one of these women, this war is personal. Ressan (ph), not her real name, crossed the border with the help of smugglers just over a week ago. The city of Sanandaj, which she calls home, is in Iran's Kurdish majority western region, and in recent weeks has been likened to a war zone, according to its residents, as protests have erupted here, and across Iran, after the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian. Ressan (ph), just a teenager, joined these protests.",

It's found a way to international the pain that the people in those streets are managing to inflict on it. And so they're asking why the U.S. isn't calling for some kind of a no-fly zone, some kind of a sterile space, some kind of acknowledgment by the regime that it needs to open up the safe corridors to allow people to travel to inside Iraqi Kurdistan. That is their obligation under international law and it is an obligation that they are currently refusing to meet, Bianna.",
