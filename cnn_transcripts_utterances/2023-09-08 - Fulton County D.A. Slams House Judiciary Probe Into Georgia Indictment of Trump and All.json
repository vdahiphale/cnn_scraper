And so one of the things that I know is going to present itself certainly in the coming months, Kate, is that federal prosecutors are going to want to see some of the work that went into this investigation, into the Fani Willis investigation, in part, because, you know, they're getting ready for their own trial. There might be additional defendants that might be named by Jack Smith's investigation in the coming weeks. And so one of the, one of the things that I'm looking for when we see this is to see whether there's anybody here or there's anything here that, you know, might be of interest to others that are doing some of this similar investigations. Again, the feds are doing one, doing their own, but also some of the investigators in some of the other states that are looking at various efforts to overturn the election results in those states. Again, some of that stuff could be indicative from what we see the Georgia grand jury produced in their work.",

And so we do not see this often. You see it in some administrative types investigations, but this is different.I think probably in addition to the number of defendants or the recommendations for indictment, what may be troubling and what may, at the end of the day, provide good fodder for defense attorneys will be whether or not the judge releases those portions of the report where the grand jurors, special grand jurors found some of the witnesses to not be credible. That really, I think, may pose a problem when we talk about influence and potential jurors in the criminal trial. I mean, what's it like to have a judicial body already determining that you're not telling the truth? So, this could be a problem as it goes down the road. It's subject right now to some motions that are pending in Fulton County and it'll be interesting to see how they play out.

And it won't take a rocket scientist to sort of ferret through who those people may be.And so the defense bar will be digging into that. They'll be digging into background. They'll be figuring out who said what, who may have a deal. Nothing stops them from going to, once they determine who those individuals may be or if they're named, going straight to them and saying, hey, what, we want to talk to you about the case. And you'll find out pretty quick if they clam up or send you to their lawyer what their intentions may be, as far as cooperation with the state. But, again, this is not normal in a criminal case in Georgia, especially in a superior court case. We do not have investigative grand jury powers for regular criminal grand jury.

There is a motion pending from the two of the defendants right now as it relates to the releasing this report. So, I think you may hear something about it. I think if there's information in it that tends to be prejudicial or, in some way, unfairly frame a particular defendant, you may hear a motion from them as well that will be filed.

That is her message. That comes after the Congressman wrote to Willis telling her, you did not bring charges until two and a half years later, at a time when the campaign for the Republican presidential nomination was in full swing.

Unclear whether or not Jordan would take steps to try to subpoena Fani Willis or subpoena documents. That certainly is something that under their purview they could do. We'll see. The House returns back into session next week. That will be one of the issues that they will be dealing with in the weeks going forward.But Fani Willis made clear, in her view, that what Jordan was doing, she said, was unconstitutional. She said that it would step on states' rights. She said that they had no business, in Fani Willis' view of obstructing an ongoing criminal investigation. She said Donald Trump, just because he's a political candidate, is not above the law. And she rejected the contention that because these charges were brought in the midst of the election season, that that was the intent, saying that this was a long investigation and the charges were brought because of the fact that the investigation had concluded. She went on to say this in her very blistering response to the House Judiciary Committee chairman. She said, your job description as a legislator does not include criminal law enforcement nor does it include supervising a specific criminal trial because you believe that doing so will promote your partisan political objectives. Now, Fani Willis is-- the Judiciary Committee is trying to figure out whether or not she, in any way, coordinated with the Justice Department, Jack Smith's office, of course, who has brought separate charges in separate cases on the federal level against the former president. She went on to say that her office did receive about $12 million in federal grants, but saying that those are for other issues, such as fighting crime on the streets, dealing with sexual assault, going after people who are accused of sexual assault and the like, and warning them not to try to get rid of those federal funds. But as you can see here, this fight between the two sides intensifying. We'll see if the Judiciary Committee chairman decides to push back or decides to move on.",

Some of them line up exactly with what the district attorney and her team ended up deciding that they had enough evidence to be able to bring.And one of the things that's interesting is there is a Section 7 of the report where they mention-- they say with respect to the national effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election focus on efforts in Georgia, Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia, the grand jury recommends that the D.A. seek indictments of the following persons. And one of the names that stands out immediately here, obviously, beyond Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman, Kenneth Cheseboro, people who are-- and the former president, Donald Trump. We also see the name number 11 listed here, Lindsey Graham, who is sitting senator, who is still the senator, obviously from South Carolina, who was very much involved in some of the efforts to talk to Georgia officials, trying to find ways for them to say that there was fraud in the election. One of the things right off the bat that the grand jury finds, one of their initial findings, is that there was no widespread fraud in the state of Georgia in the 2020 elections. So, one of the names, again, sticking out here in one of the recommendations. Again, this is under Section 7 of the report, page 6, you see the list of names. Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman, Kenneth Chesebro, all of them charged, Donald Trump, Cleta Mitchell, a former lawyer who was involved with the former president, she is on this list, Jenna Ellis, of course, she has already been charged, Mark Meadows, also who has been charged, David Shafer has been charged, Ray Smith, Lynn Wood, someone who was not charged in the end, Lindsey Graham and Sidney Powell, they list a total of 30 people who they believe should have been charged. This is the special purpose grand jury that they believe should have been charged as part of the national scheme by the former president and some of his allies to overturn the election results. Again, what the grand jury was saying is that this was beyond just the state of Georgia. This was an effort that went to all these other states, including Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia, according to the special purpose grand jury. We're still going through this document. But, again, one of the first initial things that sticks out is some of the names that you see here. They listed 30 names to be charged here. We only know of 19, of course, that have been charged. And we have to read through to see why they made that decision, what's the purpose of what they believe were those findings. Kate? BOLDUAN:  Absolutely. I'm going to give you time to continue reading through this. I'm looking through this as well. But as importantly, one of the big questions has been, is the number in this full report different than the number of people that Fani Willis eventually indicted? And the answer is yes, John. They recommend 30 names here to face charges. We know that is 11 more than the 19 that Fani Willis is now seeking to prosecute.",

The special grand jury report also recommended charges against then Georgia Senators Kelly Loeffler and then Georgia Senator David Perdue.Michael Moore, attorney, is back with us right now. Michael, again, we all need to read much more closely what went into this report, why specifically they thought they should bring charges against Lindsey Graham. We know Lindsey Graham did make a phone call to Georgia, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. But until we know firmly why they wanted to charge, let me ask you the difficulty in bringing charges for something like this against a sitting U.S. Senator and two former U.S. Senators.

And I asked that she brought charges against 90 people. That's a lot, but it's not 30, and it's not against sitting U.S. Senators.

Once you use the word RICO, you've basically woven one of the biggest fishing nets you can weave, and you're just trying to catch as many fish as you can catch.And that's why RICO is such a powerful tool for prosecutors because it allows them to basically dirty up everybody else with the other people's conduct. And so I don't see that the 19 would make me think she's tried to narrow the case. I really think at the end of the day, she probably looked at it, making some decisions about is this going to be even more labeled a case of politics or is it going to be labeled a case of actually some criminal conduct? And had she included the two highest ranking federal officials in the state at the time in the indictment, at some point, sort of the stench of politics can come over the entire criminal case. Certainly, that's some of what the defense is trying to do now. But it would have added to that had she included two senators that she may not have had enough information about. And so you'll recall the call that Lindsey Graham made to the secretary as he tried to talk about, can you do something with the votes? And where are the votes? And his explanations have maybe answered some of that question and what he was calling about, how he was calling for the Senate and everything. But that, to me, that's a case she just had to use her own discretion on. I don't know what information she may have had available to on Purdue and Loeffler. And, again, without seeing sort of the -- we're not seeing the engine of what went on in the special purpose grand jury, we're just able to see the exterior of the car. So, we don't know kind of what made it run. We're not able to see the specific allegations, statements, comments, testimony of these witnesses. We're just able to see sort of the finished product in looking at it, and then we know which part she decided she was going to take. So, that's kind of what we know at this point. BERMAN:  And again, just to be clear, as we are looking through this and reading it, it now is becoming clear they recommended charges against 39 people. Not 30, 39, which would be 20 more than they ultimately did bring charges against. Michael Moore, please stand by. We're going to continue to read through this.

Now, when this all happened back in 2020, I actually had a conversation with Lindsey Graham about all of this, and he denied that he tried to pressure or strong arm Brad Raffensperger in any way. He simply said he was trying to ask about the mail-in voting system in Georgia, the signature verification system.
