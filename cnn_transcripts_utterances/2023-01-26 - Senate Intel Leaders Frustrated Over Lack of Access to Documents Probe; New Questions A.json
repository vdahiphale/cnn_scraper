If you are just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top stories.Officials in Memphis will soon release the police body cam footage of the arrest of Tyre Nichols who died several days after a traffic stop. His family is demanding answers after seeing the footage earlier this week. Preliminary autopsy reports say Nichols allegedly died from excessive bleeding caused by a severe beating. President Biden has announced plans to send 31 Abram tanks to Ukraine to help defend their territory against Russia's invasion. Members of the Senate Intelligence Committee say they're frustrated by the lack of access to classified documents found in the possession of Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Democratic chairman Mark Warner says all things will be on the table to ensure the committee can carry out its oversight responsibilities, but Republican Tom Cotton took aim directly at the Biden administration. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TOM COTTON (R-AR): Congress has an absolute right to review these documents to form our own judgment and to make our own assessment of any potential risk to our national security. No one in Congress has received these documents, and whether it's blocking nominees or withholding budgetary fines, Congress will impose pain on the administration until they provide these documents, and that is -- that is coming from both parties.

We've learned that federal investigators were also prepared to seek a warrant if they did not get consent to search the Wilmington property. And they never had to raise that possibility in these discussions because they came to an agreement. About how the FBI would be allowed to search the house, they were given access and allowed to search the entire premises.But the Justice Department is aware that they need to treat this same case the same way they treat the Trump investigation. The facts are clearly different at this point, but as we heard the Attorney General say earlier this week, they're going to treat everyone equally. And look, there have been some officials inside the Justice Department who have been frustrated with certain decisions the Biden team has made weeks after the Justice Department told the Biden team, they would be reviewing this case. The president's team searched the Wilmington home but didn't tell the Justice Department. And only did so once they found classified material. A notification wasn't required but the lack of advance notice irritated some justice officials. And look, we've also heard concerns how the White House was not fully forthcoming. When the public first learned of the story, they confirmed the discovery of documents at the Penn Biden Center but they failed to mention classified documents had also been found in Wilmington. All of this helped to inform them form the decision to appoint a special counsel. And as we have previously reported, more searches are possible as this investigation continues.
