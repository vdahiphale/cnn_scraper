Could today be the day they hand up a new indictment against Donald Trump, this time for action surrounding January 6. We know that Trump received a target letter weeks ago. Now we know his legal team claims they were told an indictment is pending. We know it doesn't seem like the grand jury has much work left to do. CNN spotted the jurors entering court early this morning. So what will happen now? CNN's Senior Crime and Justice Reporter Katelyn Polantz is outside the court trying to discern any sign of actions.

But this is a different thing that we are talking about, and a very substantial one at that. It is a long investigation that this grand jury has been conducting with the assistance of the Special Counsel's Office, a specially appointed prosecutor by the Department of Justice, looking into Donald Trump, the Trump administration, and what happened politically after the 2020 election, when there were people around Donald Trump and Donald Trump himself, wanting to overturn the popular vote in various battleground states and block Congress from allowing the Joe Biden presidency to come into being. So now we are waiting, because Donald Trump did receive a target letter about two weeks ago, saying he was very likely to be charged. The grand jury heard from a few additional witnesses that we know of, and now they have convened again after Donald Trump's attorneys have met with the Special Counsel's office. It's quite clear charges are coming. They are here at the federal courthouse. And we could be seeing something emerge as early as today, even this morning, if possible. But we have a whole team here at the courthouse today, John, watching and waiting to see exactly what will be made public, because grand juries, they operate in secret. And not until they vote on and improve an indictment and the court system allows it to be released publicly does the Justice Department give it to the journalists so that we can see exactly what is said in that indictment. And we are really waiting to see what the Justice Department may have covered in this particular case.",

He's in Atlanta, and he was witnessed to some of the activities that happened in the State House related to Trump supporters, Republicans, who had been wanting to confirm Donald Trump as the winner of that state when he had not won the vote in that state. So the fake electors they gathered in the State House in December of 2020, George Chidi, this journalist, he had stumbled into their meeting, and then they kicked him out. And then eventually, they invited the press to come in and watch what they were doing.But because he had stumbled upon them meeting to talk about apparently casting electoral votes for Donald Trump wrongfully, he was subpoenaed to testify by the district Attorney, Fani Willis in Fulton County, Georgia, in a state investigation, so separate from the federal one we're also talking about today. And he now is receiving an additional subpoena to come back because there is a grand jury that is in session in August that could be looking at a possible indictment around that activity around Donald Trump and others' behavior in that state. And so he did say in a post on the Intercept, I am reviewing my legal options with retained counsel, but I expect to testify as before after receiving assurances that I will not be compelled to offer information outside of the narrow issue of election interference and my observations on December 14, 2020. We'll see how that all comes together and when a case may emerge there as well.",

HORWITZ, FORMER ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY, MANHATTAN DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE: Tic tac, the die is cast, they could very well be voting if there are no more witnesses. And I know there were some interviews and some documents that were collected last week, but it really seems that they're really down to the final strokes. And what's really unusual is we've now become accustomed to the bizarre becoming the usual, which is a former president having to surrender with the unsealing of an indictment.

Let me show you what the video shows. This was provided to us by the Ukrainians, and you can see the activity here firing rockets and whatnot toward that area. That is just one front in the counter offensive right now. And while that's happening, actually, the Ukrainians or somebody continues to target Moscow with drone attacks.The Ukrainians have not claimed responsibility for it yet, but we know for the third time in the last few weeks that there were attacks on buildings in Russia using drones. You can see some of the damage there. With us now, CNN Military Analyst, retired U.S. Army Major General James \"Spider\" Marks. Spider, let's just start with what we're looking at here in the screen right now. This damage, and I have to say, albeit fairly limited to these buildings in Moscow. How important are these attacks, whether they're coming from the Ukrainians directly or not? MAJ. GEN. JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, let's assume that they are coming from Ukraine, John. And then I would characterize these attacks in Moscow as frankly a waste of capacity and a waste of time. The most successful way that Ukraine is going to convince Putin that there are some off ramps other than what he is currently doing, is to continue the offensive that they have right now that's taking place in Ukraine and to kill as many Russian soldiers as possible. Not trying to be flippant, not trying to be hanging out there. Too grotesquely. What I'm telling you is. The best way to stop this is to achieve success in battle. That's the best strategy that's going to move this thing forward successfully for Ukraine. I think it's a fool's errand to be wasting drones capability, reconnaissance capacity and intellectual and physical energy at this point, going against indiscriminate targets in Moscow.",

Frankly, the only way to do that is to be able to do that through great intelligence, very precise long-range fires that get to the enemy's rear, so that the enemy, the Russians, cannot advance their forces into Ukraine any further.Over the course of the last four or five months, they've had a lot of time. The Russians have had a lot of time to dig in their positions, defensive positions are in depth, and it takes what is known as the advantage of three to one. The attacker needs to have an advantage of three personnel to one personnel in order to achieve some success. So the Ukrainians have to have great intelligence, figure out where the weak points are and then exploit those weak points. Hold them where they're strong and then exploit where they're weak. It's the old expression. Get them where they ain't, go where the Russians are not strong, where they're vulnerable, isolate them, and then that will allow you to achieve success.

And that's how we get into what happened yesterday behind closed doors. The House Oversight Committee, which is led by James Comer, heard from a witness named Devon Archer, who was a former business associate of Hunter Biden. And Republicans had hoped that Devon Archer could provide them sort of the smoking gun evidence that would link the President to his son's foreign business deals. That's been a really major focus of House Republican investigations. Democrats emerged making clear that Devon Archer did not offer that smoking gun evidence that Republicans had hoped for.
