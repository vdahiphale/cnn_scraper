I'm Jessica Dean in New York.And at any moment, former president Donald Trump will take the stage at Madison Square Garden in what feels very much like a second Republican national convention. We've already heard from his running mate, Senator J.D. Vance. We've heard from Tucker Carlson, Hulk Hogan, and Donald Trump Jr. And frankly, the overall tone so far has been dark and full of vitriol. Kristen Holmes is on the ground there. She joins us now with more. Kristen, you've covered Trump through this whole thing. What stands out to you so far?",

      "sentences": "Well, Jessica, as somebody who attends so many of these rallies, even I was surprised at how dark, as you noted, the rhetoric has been. A lot of it is even nativist and hateful.I just want to give you an example of some of what we have heard leading up to the former president who has not yet taken the stage. At one point, a speaker called Harris the anti-Christ and the devil. Another speaker called Puerto Rico a floating island of garbage. Another speaker referred to illegal aliens, excuse me, illegal immigrants as effing illegal. Someone called Hillary Clinton a sick bastard. And a lot of that's been nativist rhetoric. A lot of America is for Americans only. You just heard Howard Lutnick, who is the head of the transition, saying America First means American citizens employed first. This is what we are hearing to set up the former president. Remember this rally is really speaking as a turning point, not even turning point, but a setting off period for the final week of the campaign before the election. This is supposed to set the tone for what Donald Trump's closing message is going to be and likely it is going to follow suit here. And I will say this crowd is packed. I don't think there's an empty seat here. And they are loving the messaging that is coming out. Again, despite the fact that it is so dark, so divisive and at times so polarizing -- Jessica.",

There was a lot of nativist rhetoric talking about how America is for Americans only. We heard someone saying that America first, not American citizens getting jobs first and as you said, we heard those lines about effing illegals.We've heard someone saying that Hillary Clinton was a sick bastard, name calling to Kamala Harris, and that really important one that has received enormous amount of backlash from both Democrats and Republicans that Puerto Rico was literally an island of garbage. This has been some of the darkest rhetoric that I've ever heard at one of these Trump rallies. And the reason why it is so significant is that we are talking about a kickoff event to what is the end of the campaign, the final week before people hit the polls on Tuesday, November 5th and obviously as we knows some of the early voting has already started. This is what we've heard from Democrats pointing out this kind rhetoric hoping that it actually brings people out to vote for their side on the Republican side and this is again being received by this crowd very well. You can hear the people cheering, you can hear them cheering in the pre-program, but it gives you an idea of what the closing message is for Donald Trump. Now, you mentioned some of the things that he said. He did talk about the economy. He did talk about those tariffs, which of course we know there is enormous amount of pushback on whether or not they'll be successful, but it is clear that his closing message is really centered around immigration and this fear-based rhetoric. One of the other points I wanted to make, he again repeated this rhetoric that these South American countries, these other countries are opening their prisons and insane asylums. There is no evidence of that. We have asked the campaign for evidence of that. We have never gotten it on that front. We also, in addition to talking about Springfield as you rightly noted, saying that these that everyone dubbed, there was an illegal immigrant and they are not they are on the whole, mostly legal -- legally here in the country. He also talked about Venezuelan gangs taking over all of America, in particular, Aurora while there was an incident in aurora, Colorado, we have been told by multiple state officials, the governor there talking about how this was overblown, how it was one thing and that there was a fear mongering that was creating chaos within the state of Colorado. I was there when he visited and gave one of the darkest speeches I've ever heard on it immigration, just a few weeks ago. The other thing I wanted to point out, you mentioned that he claimed about the draft, but I want to go a step further on that hurricane relief because this is something he has really you have doubled down on. We have not heard from anyone in the state or local level including Republicans, that the federal response has been anything short of good. We obviously know that it is very hard. The recovery is very long. But the fact that Donald Trump actually said that in North Carolina, some people have not even seen aid workers. We know that FEMA has been on the ground and we also know that there have been other local, state and federal officials on the ground trying to help with the recovery there. He went on to say that the reason that FEMA didn't have any money to help with this disaster relief which they do, they are on the ground there, was because they had given it to migrants. One thing that we need to point out here, FEMA does have multiple pots of money. One of those pots of money is for disaster relief, there is another pot of money that goes to helping with migrant housing. This is a congressional allotment of money. They cannot use one or the other at this point. So the idea that they took money from one pot to give to another is just completely false. But generally, right now, I think the big overarching message as I've heard here on the ground, is that they believe that this fear-based and dark rhetoric around immigration is working for them. And I will tell you, Jessica, from being in this room, obviously, this is a sliver of the population. It's certainly working among his base.",
