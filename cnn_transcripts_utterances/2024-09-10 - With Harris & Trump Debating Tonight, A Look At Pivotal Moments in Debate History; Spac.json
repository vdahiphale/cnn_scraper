You may recall that the Alabama Republican issued a blanket hold well done promoting servicemembers last year over the Pentagon's abortion policy. This time, Tuberville is blocking Lieutenant General Ronald Clark from becoming the commanding general of the U.S. Army Pacific. Clark is currently a top aide to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. Tuberville's spokesperson says the Senator has concerns about Clark not immediately disclosing the hospitalization of Secretary Austin earlier this year. And a major moment for the battle over reproductive rights in Missouri. The state Supreme Court hearing oral arguments today over an appeal to keep a statewide constitutional amendment on the ballot. It's known as Amendment Three. An attorney says it would remove the state's ban on abortion on Friday. A circuit court ruled the amendment's ballot petition violated state law.
