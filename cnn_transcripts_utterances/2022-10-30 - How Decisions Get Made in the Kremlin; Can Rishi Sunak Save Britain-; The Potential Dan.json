I don't think it's infinite but it certainly gives the U.S. a much, much easier time of that. You're right, we got some big look at Bidenomics this week and the cover says that inflation isn't the only problem.Everyone is focused on inflation, and rightly so. And if Biden does badly in the midterms one reason will be that. But what's going on is a much, much broader activist, interventionist industrial policy. The combination of the CHIPS Act, the Infrastructure Act, the extraordinarily inaptly named Inflation Reduction Act, is a huge amount of subsidies. For two goals that in and of itself are sensible. One is to tackle climate change, the other is to have an approach towards an increasingly competitive and concerns about China. So those focuses are right. But it's ribboned with protectionism. Ribboned with buy America clauses. Ribboned with clauses about how all these benefits and subsidies are only for things produced here. And that protectionism, you know, you and I, Fareed, are probably one of the few -- some of the few free traders out there. But we really worry about that protectionism because we think it will make it a much less effective at achieving its goals of boosting climate change and indeed strengthening the U.S. economy. So in the short term, inflation is the big question around here. That's what everyone is focused on. But look under the hood. And the U.S. is in the midst of this really, really ambitious, activist industrial policy. And I'm not at all sure it's being designed in the way it's going to be good for the U.S. in the medium and long run.",

The worst results were in eighth grade math, where pre-pandemic about a third of students in the U.S. were proficient in math. So, that was pretty horrible.

What did happen during the pandemic, and you can't blame anyone, they didn't have a lot of time to plan this, is that the same traditional academic model where you have 20, 30 students in a classroom for the most part listening to lectures, that just got transferred to Zoom somewhat overnight where now students are sitting in -- on Zoom calls for four, five hours a day. And you can imagine those were very, very disengaging. And so what happened during the pandemic, it wasn't necessarily the technology it was just that -- it just became even more disengaging, a lot of kids just fell off of the radar and weren't able to engage in their education.On the other hand, you can do online learning. And when Khan Academy is used best it is used inside of a classroom with people next to each other. Students are able to work at their own pace on things that are relevant to them. The teacher is able to walk around and have more personal one-on-one interaction, actually more human-to-human interaction than they would get in a traditional lecture based classroom. The students are encouraged not to put their fingers on their lips but are actually encouraged to talk to each other and help each other. So it's not about online versus not online. It's about, are you leveraging human connection? Are there ways to engage students and have them work on what matters for them versus things that are less engaging?

And democracies do not long endure, as Lincoln would say, if we do not mutually respect the rules of the road. And we can argue about whether the constitution should do this or should do that.

They exalted property rights over individual rights and decided to secede from the union. Thereby, ending an experiment which however imperfect did create a world which gave us the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments, and ultimately an egalitarian future. This is not to lionize Abraham Lincoln at all. But he fundamentally believed that the Declaration of Independence had to be the national lodestar and that the application of the meaning of those words was, in fact, what the country was about. The White south decided, no, that all men were not created equal.
