John, given how quickly prosecutors came forward with charges here, within 24 hours, what does that tell you about the circumstances of the shooting? JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; INTELLIGENCE ANALYST: Well, I think what it tells us is that the video told the story. Which is, when you watch that video as a police professional, what you're asking yourself is, where is the attempt to deescalate the situation? Where is the attempt to slow down the action here? If anything, it seems that their encounter with -- with Melissa Ann Perez is speeding things up and increasing the intensity. The real -- the real wild card here is that there's two police officers there who get the call but they are accompanied by a sergeant. And it's really the supervisor's job, Jim, to take control of the thing and say, she's fled into the house, you know, we've displayed weapons, she has said \"shoot me.\" She's clearly mentally imbalanced, let's call in the crisis negotiation team, let's get containment.

And we heard President Biden today reaffirming that, saying that it is too early to know yet with any certainty where this is all going. So in the meantime the president has been focused on coordinating with U.S. allies ensuring, as he has throughout Russia's invasion of Ukraine, that there is a coordinated NATO approach to the conflict and to the unfolding events surrounding it. And the president also emphasized the fact that, as we heard very little from the White House this weekend, that was strategic, that was intentional, in part, because the U.S. didn't want to give the appearance that they were weighing in or influencing events on the ground. The president weighed in on that moments ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

As the secretary said, 16 months ago, the Russian Federal and Vladimir Putin envisioned that Russian forces would be taking Kyiv. Instead, over the weekend, we saw Russian forces taking a Russian Ministry of Defense office inside a Russian city. We saw the entire pretext of this war being questioned openly, something we have done, something our allies and partners have done, something that you have not seen inside the borders of Russia. In fact, you can be thrown in jail for taking that step as an ordinary citizen inside of Russia. We saw Yevgeny Prigozhin directly questioning not just the Ministry of Defense officials, as he's done for some time, but really directly challenging President Putin's leadership. Those are all significant steps and a significant change from what we've seen, certainly in the last 16 months, but over a number of years.

We continue to have intelligence-sharing training with the Ukrainians. We continue to have military channels, we have diplomatic channels that are open with Ukraine.
