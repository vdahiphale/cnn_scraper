A former art school instructor said that she knew Audrey Hale, the person that's been identified as the killer. Maria Colomy told CNN that she met Hale in 2017 at the Nossi College of Art and she said that for the last year, Hale had grieved online over the death of a girl she used to play basketball with. Colomy said it was around this time that Hale wanted to be referred to as he - him and to go by the name Aiden (ph).",

Again, that is something they say they do believe indicates that there's some form of weapons training that Hale had. We do know that according to police, he'll purchase at least seven weapons between October 2020 and June of 2022. Those weapons were purchased legally, Bianna? Boris?",

Certainly what we're seeing is a professional law enforcement organization, Nashville PD, very competent and we've witnessed that in the video. The FBI working in concert and this is what we should expect of our law enforcement professionals to put this together to tell the story of what had happened and what caused this.

Compare that to your sense of work in covering just the tragedy that unfolded not only in the shooting in Uvalde but the horrific response by police.SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN CRIME &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER: Yes. So in Uvalde, it started out as a textbook case, right? How you respond to active shooter situations. But what happened was when the officers felt that their lives were in danger, that gunfire was now coming at them from the shooter, they retreated. They went back and they never again would try to get in that classroom for another 77 minutes. So that is the one really big difference in all of this is that you see Nashville officers going towards the sound of gunfire. They know where it's coming from. They are moving in that direction and they go and they eliminate the shooter. There are significant differences and that the shooter in Uvalde was in a classroom that - here in Nashville, the shooter is in a hallway kind of vestibule area, okay. But the point is officers have to keep going and in Uvalde at some point they stopped. The other thing that I think is significant in what we're seeing in Nashville is how the school responded. The school administrators and the body camera footage that we see in the moments that officers arrived, they're out there. They're on the front line, assisting those officers, telling them where to go. In one of the pieces of video, you actually see a school administrator giving officers a key to get inside the school. None of that was done in Uvalde. There was no school administrator directing any of the officers. There was confusion, whether or not there were kids during the day when school is in session in Uvalde, they were confused over whether or not children were inside the classroom. And even when they were told by 911 calls that there were children inside. They still didn't take action and they waited for SWAT team. So those are really the big differences and that's why you're seeing the praise that you're - that the officers in Nashville are getting in the foot of police chief twice on the day this happened, came out and said we will never stop. We will keep moving in these situations to eliminate the threat because there was a lot of concern after Uvalde in law enforcement community that people were going to question how officers respond to these situations. There was a lot of worry. And clearly what's being demonstrated in Nashville is that the training works. You go after the shooter and you eliminate the shooter.",

So I think there was always some sense that he would have to testify in some way before a grand jury. That's why I think they're not coming out right now and saying we're going to appeal this.

Look like they're really bad on crime and that is simply using their absolute totals without factoring in their population. So it is true that Florida has, as former President Trump said, the third most reported murders, rapes and aggravated assault.What he didn't mention is that that is largely because Florida is the third largest, most populous state. And so if you look at per capita figures, which is by far, the fairer way to actually compare between states, Florida fares notably better. It's 25th worst on murder, so right in the middle, 33rd worst on reported rape, so better than the middle, and 23rd worst on aggravated assault. Again, right around the middle. So very important context that the former president is not mentioning here.",

The Trump first impeachment battle began in late 2019. So he could not possibly have seen him on TV, defending him on impeachment and then said what the heck, I'll endorse him for that reason.Now, it is possible that Trump is thinking of DeSantis defending him on the Mueller Russia probe in 2017. But Trump is the one who keeps raising Biden gaffes as if they're a sign of serious mental decline or something like that. So I think it's important to point out when Trump's own stories are similarly inaccurate.",

In March 2020, he ordered the closures of public beaches in Broward and Palm Beach counties, two populous counties, but he would not order a statewide closure. In fact, he was sued unsuccessfully for refusing to do a statewide closure.On the other beaches, he simply order that people limit their gatherings to no more than 10 people and stay six feet apart and we know that was in line with what then-President Trump and the Trump administration were urging people to do at the time.
