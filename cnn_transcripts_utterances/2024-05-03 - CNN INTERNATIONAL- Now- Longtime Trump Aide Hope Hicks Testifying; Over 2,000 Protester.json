We begin with crucial testimony in the criminal trial of former President Donald Trump. On the stand today, one of Trump's closest aides, a member of his campaign's inner circle, and that is Hope Hicks. She was Trump's campaign press secretary in 2016 and helped manage the crisis that was leaked -- the leak now infamous Access Hollywood tape, in which Trump bragged about assaulting women. Prosecutors say that political crisis motivated $130,000 payoff to Stormy Daniels. And that motive is at the center of their case. CNN's Katelyn Polantz has been following this on. Katelyn, this has been what the prosecution has been trying to establish that that the crisis following the Access Hollywood tape lead to a sense that, hey, we could lose this thing and affect the election so that when the Stormy Daniels allegation came up, that was the motive to then kill that story.",

They had to do something about it.Now, a little bit more of the context she's putting around this though, it's not just that she's corroborating that this was something of concern to the campaign. She's also some putting some context here about Michael Cohen that she was in touch with them. They were exchanging text messages in response to the \"The Wall Street Journal\" story coming out about Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels and Trump, and she says just a few minutes ago, I didn't know Michael to be an especially charitable or selfless person. So, it leaves the question for the jury why he'd give this $130,000.",

She knew what was going on with everything outside of him, making phone calls, checking with other people, doing the things, and then giving him information. [15:05:03] I thought what was funny was the idea that he didn't want \"The Wall Street Journal\" delivered to his front door the next day. He was almost like an eighth grader, doesn't want to take home his great -- his report card. What could possibly make him think, his wife wasn't going to find out about this?

That's all prosecutors need to establish.And this panic that we heard about through Hope Hicks today, I think goes along way in establishing that it wasn't just panic about the wife.

Administration officials say, I don't recall making those decisions. Does that work with juries as a way to remove a witness or do juries make their own judgment as to the credibility of the \"I don't recall\" answer. Well, absolutely, juries are making a credibility assessments from the minute that a witness takes the witness stand. And if jury start to believe that I don't recall is a way to be evasive, is a way to avoid the questions or is a way to again, avoid having to testify to something that you otherwise know that could be the harmful to one side or the other, they will punish a witness for that. They will make their own assumptions, and they will assess that persons credibility and maybe determined that the person is not being honest. And it has a lot to do, Jim, with how long ago did these incidents occur?

So we can expect Trump seemed to go after him pretty hard and we know Donald Trump hates my Cohen and wants his lawyers to annihilate him on the witness stand.Now, Michael Cohen is a lawyer himself.

And then many of these students waking up to news that some of their fellow students at other universities here in New York City also experienced similar operations, albeit scaled back considerably. For example, there was two operations this morning in which the NYPD was asked to assist in the first at New York University, the second at the New School, both of those in Manhattan and that yielded a total of about 57 people who were detained. NYU officials saying that the clearing of an encampment that was in place for about six days and only took a few minutes, and there was about a dozen people who were arrested. That's those people who refused to leave. And then at the New School, which is what were these aerial images are actually taken from, we understand standard about 40 people were detained there in a similar incident also for another encampment. It's still unclear whether or not these individuals that were detained today had direct links to each respective university. But then finally, Jim, we did learn a little bit more about the events from earlier this week when New York police officers made their way onto Columbia to dismantle the encampment and to detain various individuals that had occupied who had occupied and administration building there. We learned recently, according to authorities that 13 people who were found occupying that building did not have direct links to Columbia University. So again, everyday really bringing just a little bit more information in terms of some of those dramatic images that we also play out on Tuesday night.",

And then you also mentioned Brown, that's a really fascinating one as well, because the university now essentially agreeing to a vote that is scheduled to happen later this fall, as you point out, unclear exactly where it will go, but at least it open up at dialogue. So it perhaps, perhaps could serve as a model for other universities to attempt to build on but that, of course, just referring back to Columbia, there was, of course, that drastic escalation when you saw individuals occupy a building and that is what then triggered those wheels that were set in motion for that pretty extraordinary show of force that we saw play out earlier this week.",

Look, Jim, so much emphasis has been put in the last days and weeks on these protesters, the anti-Israeli protesters. I speak with students across the country, Jewish students who are really voiceless for the most part in these demonstrations, they are afraid to go on campus.

She really is.And what we saw when she was called to the stand this morning, Jim, the prosecution really establishing this relationship that she had with Donald Trump, how she started working at the Trump Organization. Once the campaign was launched, she moved over to the campaign. She, of course, was press secretary for the campaign in 2016. And then when we really got into the meat of what the prosecution wanted to get to this morning, and a lot of this started before the lunch break was about \"The Wall Street Journal\" contacting the campaign about a story they had about AMI and a catch and kill deal with Karen McDougal. So this set off a bit of a fire in the campaign. There was a lot of concern. There's a lot of talk about what those conversations patients were and how involved Donald Trump was in the statements and in wanting to know what those statements would be. At one point, Hope Hicks detailing a conversation that you have with David Pecker on a phone. She told Donald Trump about that conversation he wanted to hear it. They called david pecker back. He repeated this deal was nothing more than getting around the cover for a fitness deal nothing to see here, not a big deal. Well, then we learn later on about what happened. \"The Wall Street Journal\" had also noted that Stormy Daniels would be mentioned in this article that they were working on Donald Trump according to Hope Hicks, really wanted to know the context of how Stormy Daniels was going to be mentioned and wanted it to be clear there was no relationship there. When we return turn from lunch, the questioning continues from the prosecution. They're going in on Michael Cohen and how involved two was what did Hope Hicks know about that involvement? What did she know about some of these statements? As she finally learned about that payment, if she had said, it seemed a little out of character that this is something that he would do out of the goodness of his own heart, the prosecution had asked if that was how it worked, and then she talked about Donald Trump and what he had to say about it. And the prosecution ending just before a break when Hope Hicks became very motional and ended as Hope Hicks said, and I'm quoting here, it was Mr. Trump's opinion that it was better to be dealing with it now, talking about after the campaign with this story and that it would have been bad to have that story come out before the election. That is where we ended. Hope Hicks it become emotional on the stand at that point, the judge and the jury out of the room, they took a short break when she came back, we were onto cross-examination, which was much shorter this afternoon, talking about what her role was again, and Michael Cohen's role. The defense Emil Bove really trying to talk about what his role was in the campaign. She said he didn't have an official role. He was sort of inserting himself and that he went rogue at times, notably saying he liked to call himself a fixer or Mr. Fix It and it was only because he first broke it, but then he was able to fix it. They ended with the defense on this note and cross, Jim, saying that when they were talking about this story getting out, the fact that Donald Trump did not want Melania Trump to know, it was because he didn't want anyone in his family to be heard are embarrassed. He just wanted them to be proud of him. So you can see what each side was really hoping to set up as that final thought for the jury, things wrapping at 3:30, just about 12 minutes go. And as you noted, we could be hearing from the former president in just a couple of minutes.",

In other words, one, not to damage his campaign? But also to protect his family. Would that be sufficient to allow for conviction under these charges? And what they said was that if the attempt to prevent damage to his election campaign was a substantial motive, that would be enough, even if there were other motives at the same time which is notable.

She was nervous. She said she was nervous on the stand.And then even when that cross-examination started, our colleagues in the courtroom were saying she seemed even more tense, at that point, as his cross-examination had started. Remember she was coming back into the witness box after having left for a few moments, needed to compose herself because she had come very become very free emotional. She wasn't asked about that, when that cross-examination happened, but that was going to be very delicate regardless, because of how she was presenting herself and because she was talking very fairly glowingly about Donald Trump, about the time that she spent working with him. It didn't seem that she was a person on the witness stand, Jim, who had an ax to grind.",

You have to remember that just because he and Hope Hicks have not spoken to each other since January or around January of 2020, that doesn't mean that he's not still incredibly fond of her. You could even see the fact that he leaned over to talk to his lawyers when Hope Hicks said that she was stunned when she first learned about that Access Hollywood tape. That's not something he wants to hear from somebody that he used to be so incredibly close to.The other thing to note here is when I'm talking to the campaign, they're not talking about anything in terms of the substance of what Hope Hicks the saying, but they are talking about is just how hard it is for them to watch her up there. This is a person who does not like being in the spotlight, who does not like being questioned. She was ahead of the communications division for the White House at one point, but still didn't really like to be in the spotlight. And yet seeing her there, seeing her voice shake, that is something that had a lot of his closest allies feeling bad for this woman who was once an aid of Donald Trump's. And I think as Erica mentioned, both the prosecution and the defense got some of what they wanted out there, think they -- the defense I've been told wanted her to say something negative about Michael Cohen, obviously, to paint the fact that he was not actually part of the campaign that he was kind of always around, always under foot, which she did. But at the same time, she was still a very credible and coherent witness for the prosecution.",

Based on what both sides got out of this, the prosecution getting her to say yes, damage to the campaign was a motivator. The defense getting her to say, well, it was also a motivation that he didn't want his wife to know, did they both get something out of her -- with her testimony?",

The story coming out about \"Access Hollywood\", this is a woman that obviously didn't like being in a position of working for someone when all of these stories about affairs and interactions with women -- negative interactions were coming into the media. We saw that she testified when she was first got the notice from \"The Washington Post\" about the story of Stormy Daniels. She wrote an email saying denied, denied, denied. I think she truly believe that Donald Trump was telling the truth when he talked about his encounters with these various women.
