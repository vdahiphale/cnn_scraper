And so that is why the family is concerned about the legitimacy of that -- excuse me, Jim. And the days that Paul Whelan has missed calling home include notably Thanksgiving and his father's birthday, and that's highly abnormal because Paul Whelan normally talks to his family pretty much on a daily basis.

This was his response. He didn't even pretend that that wasn't there their intention. He said, \"We were bombing Nazis in Stalingrad, too.\" We heard this accusation of Russia calling Ukrainians Nazis even leading up to the war.

Then I go to the university and I see everyone is coming together, people are helping each other, you know, sharing stuff. Picking up each -- you know, like who doesn't have cars, they bring them.You know, they even have a little bit of firewood and things. You know, humans have lived through much -- in much worse conditions for most of the history. So we can get through this. I think it is important to love each other. And if we are open to each other, I think we'll get through this. And I think this is what's different here in Ukraine, because I also lived through the '90s when the Soviet Union collapsed. I just finished school, high school at that time. And let me tell you, it was tougher then because people were not as open, as warm, and as loving to each other.",

MYLOVANOVknow, our parents are the only generation who have lived in Ukraine without a war or major, you know, issues with Russia, something like that. A lot more. But how are students? You know, they need some sense of normalcy. And recently a student left a message on the white board in a shelter saying that I'm so happy I studied here because, you know, it is -- the only thing which keeps my life together, this routine classes, of exams, of problems, of (INAUDIBLE) hours, of instructors teaching them.
