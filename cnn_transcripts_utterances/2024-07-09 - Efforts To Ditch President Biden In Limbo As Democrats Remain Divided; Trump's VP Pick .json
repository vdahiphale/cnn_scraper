But what, 12 days now since the debate, the party does not seem to be fully and comprehensively convinced that Biden is capable of winning.Now, there was a bit of a shift today after Democrats met in private. And some who were previously skeptical, they came out and say that they are supporting Biden, and full-throatedly. But there are still some who appear to be on the fence. And according to sources, senators Jon Tester and Sherrod Brown and Michael Bennet told their colleagues today that they doubt that Biden can win. Now, Senator Bennet, well, he expanded on that tonight on CNN. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MICHAEL BENNET (D-CO): Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election and maybe win it by a landslide, and take with him the Senate and the House.

One of the reasons that Donald Trump doesn't want to do it now, he not only doesn't have to, but Joe Biden and Democrats are engaged in the sort of mutual self-destruction loop right now of just reinforcing negative stories about each other. You know, the Democrats who wanted him to resign, him digging in, causing them to want him to resign more or better said, leave the race. And Trump doesn't really want to step on those headlines. He prefers to let Joe Biden just sort of catch on fire, Democrats catch on fire, as he sits back and watches.",

It's either him or Doug Burgum. Kind of the insiders and the predictive betting markets are suggesting Rubio in third. But, you know, you never really know what Trump is going to do until he does or who he's going to choose until he announces who he chooses. One thing about Vance's beard is that it does make him look a little older and a little more rugged. Vance is 39 years old. He turns 40 next month. If chosen, if elected, he would be the third youngest vice president to serve in history. And Trump wants his vice president to at least sort of look the part, be a little more seasoned. Perhaps a bigger knock on Vance is that he has only been in politics, he has only been in the U.S. Senate for two years.",
