To Muslims, it is the site of the al-Aqsa mosque where Israeli police mounted a violent raid and beat congregants praying there last week, triggering the violence in the area. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz joins us live from Jerusalem. Good morning, Salma. The ban from the Netanyahu government came after Israeli soldiers killed two Palestinians in the West Bank on Tuesday. Do you think this -- will this ban help or exacerbate the tensions there?",

Muslims expected, based on traditions in the past, that the last 10 days those sacred grounds would be reserved for them to celebrate and observe the holy month of Ramadan.That's why my producer and I visited the place -- visited the site to learn more about how they revered al-Aqsa mosque and what it meant during these very sensitive times. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ABDELAZIZ (voice-over):  A delicate balance that governs and binds this holy site is under strain. My producer and I, both Muslim-born, were granted access to film at the al-Aqsa compound by the custodians of the site. Only Muslims are allowed to pray here under a long- running but unwritten status quo agreement that worshipers tell us is slowly being eroded. Non-Muslims can visit the complex only during certain hours. UM KAMAL AL-KURDI, MUSLIM WORSHIPER:  (Speaking foreign language).",

While we speak, a group of largely Jewish visitors passes by the mosque under police escort. The women demonstrate by reciting the Quran louder and louder.This mountaintop is revered by Jews, too. They call it Temple Mount. A growing movement of Jewish extremists is demanding to perform prayers here. That could upend the status quo. We witnessed at least two men praying as police stand by. ABDELAZIZ (on camera):  We've seen several small groups like this of non-Muslim worshipers passing through the complex as Muslims continue to pray inside the mosque. This is where the friction is. This is where the controversy lies. ABDELAZIZ (voice-over):  Jordan is the custodian of the grounds but that role is becoming increasingly symbolic, experts say, because it is Israel that controls the security checks at entry points and therefore, access. The director general of al-Aqsa sees the increasing visits of Jewish extremists under police escort as a provocation.",

Small groups of Jewish radicals sing \"The temple will be built,\" a reference to a far-right cringe call to build a third temple on the sacred grounds. Prime Minister Netanyahu insists he is committed to keeping the status quo. But under his government, the most far-right in Israel's history, extremists' voices are growing louder and stronger. All this makes an already extremely contentious place ever more of a tinderbox. One event here can and has sparked deadly cycles of violence across the region. Al-Aqsa is seen as a political symbol as well as a religious one by the Arab world. The complex lies in the heart of East Jerusalem, which most of the international community considers to be under Israeli occupation, but which Israel sees as part of its united capital.",

Pearson held that seat until last week when he was expelled by Republicans for joining a gun violence protest. President Biden kicking off his trip to Ireland with a speech at Ulster University in Belfast later this morning. He's expected to discuss young people's impact on high-tech innovation. CNN reporter Kevin Liptak is live in Belfast with the latest on the president's trip. Good morning, Kevin. Great to see you.

That was one of the key outcomes of the Good Friday Agreement but it's currently paralyzed over this dispute over Brexit trade rules. President Biden also plans to meet with leaders from the parties to try and cajole them back into a functioning government. President Biden had originally been invited to address that government. It's called Stormont. He declined the invitation and instead, he'll speak to students at Ulster University. And I think that choice of venue really is so symbolic. He wants to talk to students, many of whom may not have even been born in 1998 and have no direct memory of the troubles here in Northern Ireland. Talk to them not necessarily about this country's bloody and violent past but more about its potential and its future. And so that's really what President Biden wants to accomplish this morning.",

He'll do it again later in the week. He'll go to another county on the -- in the west of Ireland and explore that family roots as well.

Investors awaiting March's Consumer Price Index due in a few hours. The S&amp;P barely moved yesterday. The Nasdaq down. Consumer prices are forecast to cool both monthly and annually. That reading would mark nine months in a row of CPI inflation cooling. One window on inflation, gas prices up a penny overnight to $3.62 a gallon.
