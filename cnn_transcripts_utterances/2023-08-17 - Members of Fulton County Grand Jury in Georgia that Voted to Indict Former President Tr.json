He has made statements about the prosecutor in Washington, about the judge in Washington.So he has set the table for his supporters. So when a phone call comes into a federal judge, starting off with racist comments, hey, you stupid slave, n-word, threatening to kill her, saying if Donald Trump isn't president in 2024 we are coming for you, putting you on notice. This is part of these atmospherics that has the sheriff in Georgia, who is receiving his own threats, the D.A., the Manhattan D.A., increasing security details. The key here in this case is an example of the threat to the judge of the Washington case. But now let's look at the extent of the grand jurors. The key here is going after these people and showing there is a consequence for this. Georgia law, Title 16, Chapter 20 makes it a crime, punishable by 20 years, up to 20 years, to threaten a grand juror or a juror for any judgment or verdict. So, they are going to be very forward leaning in making sure that these threats come at a cost.",

Trump has attacked judges before. Trump's attacked prosecutors before. This is kind of the norm for him, and it's easy to ignore it or pass it off.And I think then you reach situations like this where you say, is this really problematic? Is this just somebody whose threat is empty, or is this really driving something that could bring a violence to some degree? LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  I think it is somebody that could bring violence, which is what we saw. On January 6th was one of the most -- it was one of the biggest examples of what happens when people take that rhetoric and decide to act, which is that they had heard in the lead up to January 6th lies about the election, that the presidency was being stolen. And then they decided to go there because the president encouraged him to go to the Capitol. And so we have seen the results of that. People died that day, officers died that day. One of Trump's supporters died that day. And just recently also, there was a man that was killed by FBI in Utah for threatening the life of President Biden as well as D.A. Alvin Bragg, as well as other elected officials. And laced in all of this is racism, as was pointed out. And Trump is very specific about the language that he uses when he talks about black jurists. He uses the word \"thugs\" repeatedly when he talks about black jurists. And that is a signal that he is sending to his base. I think we are beyond the point where we can look at those comments and those threatening comments from the former president and think that he isn't aware of who is reading them and who is watching them and the fact that extremism groups look at what he posts, and then they potentially act based on what he says.",

I want to get your take on this next reporting that we have, that attorneys representing the survivors and family members of last year's racist mass shooting at a Buffalo grocery store have now filed two lawsuits in New York's Erie County. Eighteen-year-old Payton Gendron was sentenced to life in prison earlier this year for killing 10 people at the Tops Market. That was in May of 2022. The defendants in the suit include the shooter's parents, gun companies, and several social media companies, including YouTube, Reddit, and Google.According to one those lawsuits, quote, \"Just as the shooters is being held to account criminally for his actions, the defendants named in this lawsuit much answer for their critical roles they played in facilitating this reprehensible mass shooting.\" CNN has reached out to all the companies as well as the attorneys for the shooter's parents. We have not heard back yet. Let me start with you, John Miller. This has been difficult, to say the least, to hold, especially companies and social media companies accountable. Is there any reason to believe on these grounds they might be successful in the effort?",

Payton Gendron was a high school student who lived 200 miles outside of Buffalo in a small town, the parents of two engineers who grew up in a family of brothers and sisters. But in COVID, he went down a deep dark place on the internet, became fixated on this racist propaganda.Here's the key -- in a message board at his high school, saying what are you looking to do after high school, what is the goal that you have. He says to commit a mass shooting, to commit a mass murder. This is flagged, the state police investigate. He is taken to a medical facility. He is evaluated. And he says I was just kidding. And from there, he's able to order a rifle, bulletproof vests, hundreds of rounds of ammunition.

Now, we don't know exactly where all of these trials will ultimately land on the calendar, but all of the different prosecutors that have brought cases against Donald Trump, they want to do it between January and May.They want to take him to trial at a moment that is also quite intense for the political calendar, especially when candidates are looking to get their party nominations. Donald Trump obviously seeking the Republican nomination. But, Poppy, one of the things we have heard so far and that we're watching to see if other cases will go the same route, is that the judge in the federal case against Donald Trump related to January 6 has made quite clear that criminal trials take precedence over politics. And so, the idea that Trump may need to try or he wants to try to hold off his trials and his court proceedings and the hearings before that, because he has other things to do as a candidate that might not hold a lot of sway in court. Very much so it won't do much with prosecutors, but then also it will ultimately be up to the judges on where all of these thing's land on the calendar. I'm watching that federal case related to January 6 quite closely. Because today, Trump's team is going to say when they want that trial to be, they'll put their arguments out and then the next eleven days, not only is he going to be arrested in Georgia in that case, the new case, the new indictment. But there will be hearings in other cases, including a hearing where they really get down to business about discussing when the trial will be in the federal case related to January 6. Yeah, Poppy?",
