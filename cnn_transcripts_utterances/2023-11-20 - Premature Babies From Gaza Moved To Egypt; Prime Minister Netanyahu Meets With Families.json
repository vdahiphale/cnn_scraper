Thank you so much, Nic.And tonight, more than two dozen newborns evacuated from Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza are now in Egypt receiving desperately needed treatment. CNN's Eleni Giokos has more on their escape from the war zone and their conditions now. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELENI GIOKOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Wheeled to safety as they make their way from chaos to calm, finally in Egypt. A race against time to get them out, but a delicate process to move them. The journey to bring them here, long and arduous. Cries for help from the war's tiniest victims. Their first stop, the Al-Helal Al-Emirati Hospital in Rafah -- 28 babies made the grueling journey from Gaza. Their condition, doctors say, delicate and difficult. MOHAMMAD SALAMAH, AL-HELAL AL-EMIRATI MATERNITY HOSPITA: We're conducting tests on all of those babies, and they were given fluids and needed medication according to their condition. For now, they are in a difficult, stable condition, but this condition might deteriorate. GIOKOS (voice-over): Now, the WHO says many of them are in critical condition and all are fighting infections. They've endured life- threatening ordeals trapped inside Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza city as the war raged around the hospital complex last week. Al-Shifa ran out of oxygen, clean water and fuel, moved by hand and laid on these beds, no incubators and placed next to hot water bottles to stay warm. Doctors say five of the babies didn't make it, conditions too harsh for such vulnerable patients. But ultimately, it was the war in and around Al-Shifa that made their evacuation complex and dangerous. The Egyptians, waiting for over a week at the border, disappointed day after day knowing that every minute counted. But the decision out of their hands to get these babies to safety. Only four mothers and six nurses accompanied the 28 babies. Lubna Al- Seikh (ph) describes her nightmare. UNKNOWN (through translation): During the siege there was no milk. Her condition worsened. She went back to zero and she relied solely on artificial oxygen. GIOKOS (voice-over): As for the others, it is unknown where their parents and family are. or if they're still alive. Now, in the hands of the Egyptians, their life's still fragile, their future forever defined by this war. (END VIDEOTAPE) GIOKOS (on camera): And Pamela, a war not of their making. You know, the mother we just heard from, she also said these are innocent babies and they are not to blame. And yet, they bear the brunt of the war. The most desperate need they had was oxygen and care. In any other situation, these would be the most vulnerable of patients. They would be looked after. But the conditions around Al-Shifa made it completely impossible. It was all about getting a route to safety from that hospital down to the Egyptian border. The Egyptians were waiting for 36 babies. Five of them lost their lives. Tragically, two of those died on the cusp of the evacuation on Saturday night, according to the World Health Organization. In terms of their status right now, they have been moved to hospitals around Egypt and the whole priority is to get them stable and healthy.",

Hamas demands that every day during the pause Israel will stop flying drones above Gaza for six hours every day. For now, Israel does not agree to six hours.

While Gantz thinks that's the release of the hostages is the top priority before the destruction of Hamas. And this might seem like a nuance, but when -- if Hamas will come back with the decision to go for a deal and it will not be exactly like the parameters Netanyahu wants, then we can see a real difficulty within the Israeli war cabinet to take a decision.",

With the multiple cases that he has, it's going to keep him off of the campaign trail in many court dates. I mean, some of these are actually going to line up right ahead of Super Tuesday.

In recent weeks, Marines have managed to cross this expanse of water using inflatable boats, establishing a tenuous foothold on the left bank of the river. Hey, am I in Vietnam, asked this soldier sarcastically rushing past tall grasses. A reference to another bloody conflict that ended before most of the soldiers were even born. According to Ukrainian armed forces, they've pushed back the Russians three to eight kilometers, two to five miles from the riverfront, making it difficult for the enemy to fire mortars to positions on the right bank. However, Russian drones artillery and aerial glided bombs are still landing and constantly. In exclusive access with drone pilot, Serhly, his night mission had just been aborted because the Russians had identified his units position on the right bank.

COREN (voice-over): The reason this left bank operation is so important for Ukraine is to open the road to Russian occupied Crimea and to protect the nearby city of Kherson. A year ago, the Russians withdrew from Kherson using the Dnipro River as a defendable natural barrier between the two sides. But in the last month, attacks on Kherson have intensified to the point where the region's military governor told me there was 700 incoming rounds in one day. This is revenge and now it's felt more, he says, because our soldiers are already on the left bank, and our civilians are feeling his revenge. Three hundred thousand residents used to live in Kherson, now less than a quarter remain, including 56-year-old, Inna. She cares for invalid mother and her four-year-old grandson. Twenty-four hours a day, it's scary. When it's quiet, it's even scarier than when there is shelling. She says she lived through eight months of Russian occupation and will endure this as well.

We spent 20 years, $3.5 trillion, over 6,000 American troops were killed, tens of thousands civilians died during our 20-year war on terror to destroy al-Qaeda and ISIS.And guess what, al-Qaeda and ISIS are not destroyed. In fact, in many places throughout the world, they continue to grow and expand. The lesson of that is that you cannot destroy terrorism with military means alone. The military can only shape and contain and set the conditions for what it must ultimately be a political and humanitarian resolution. That's why the protection of civilians in conflict zones everywhere but particularly in Gaza and this instance, has to be front and center, we have to make sure that everybody is doing everything possible to protect civilians, and that we actually create the conditions for ultimately, the Palestinian people to be safe and secure, and for the Israeli people to be safe and secure.",
