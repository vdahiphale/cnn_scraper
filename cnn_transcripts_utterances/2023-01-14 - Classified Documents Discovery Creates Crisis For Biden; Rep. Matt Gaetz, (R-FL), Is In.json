Part of the attraction was the unfettered access given to C-SPAN cameras to televise the proceedings and provide its feed to outlets, including CNN.Last week, I argued here that the American people deserve continued unfiltered access to the House Chamber. But as soon as Kevin McCarthy actually took the gavel back went the camera to its standard fixed position aimed at the Lectern. Those rules are set by the party that controls the House, except for special events like the election of a House Speaker. Well, Tuesday, the co-CEO of C-SPAN sent a letter to McCarthy seeking permission to operate its own independent cameras in the chamber, citing the positive public reaction and the transparency themes in McCarthy's own rules package. Among the congressmen who have voiced their agreement, my next guest, Matt Gaetz. You'll remember, during the speaker battle, the camera captured Gaetz having private conversations with a frustrated McCarthy, chatting with Democrats, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, we even saw as he was almost physically attacked by fellow Congressman Mike Rogers, who later apologized. So much lies ahead for the 118th Congress. I want these cameras to show it all, be it the looming debt limit standoff, the debates over investigations of the FBI and Hunter Biden, the battles over China and the origin of COVID-19, the blame game of the never ending border crisis. Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz joins me now. Congressman, thank you for coming back. Without C-SPAN -- it occurs to me that without C-SPAN cameras, we would not have seen you nearly attacked by Mike Rogers. Do you think that incident is an example of why some of your colleagues, they don't want full camera access? REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): No, I think that the reason people have opposed our effort to democratize viewing of the House floor is because in many of the debates no one's present, and they want to maintain the fiction that's actual legislating. And whenever there is sharp disagreement or discord or fiery debate on the floor or in committee, the camera always catches those moments. But there are also moments of great interpersonal warmth and collaboration and the forming of alliances that you might not normally see. Whether it's myself talking to Ilhan Omar about war powers or Pramila Jayapal about big tech regulation or discussing floor strategy with AOC. I think the American people would be able to humanize Congress more if they saw more of our human interactions and not just theater that's on display during much of the debate.",

There are times when the pressure cooker is on when we do yell and get heated, and that's OK among colleagues. What was different about this was just that it was caught on camera. So, you know, Mike and I are fine. We've worked together before, we will again in the future. But if we had more dynamic camera angles, then I think you'd see these flare ups and then the backslapping afterwards and the agreement, and the American people could see alliances form and dissolve in real time rather than just getting a more curated rendition of what happens.",

I'm a believer that transparency answers a lot of questions, and whether there's higher criminal acuity for some, lower criminal acuity for others, releasing that video will be important.Also, we already know from whistleblower interviews we've done that there were federal assets and agents that were on the ground that day to be able to observe their conduct, their potential coordination with one another, would be of great interest to many of us on the Judiciary Committee and I think many people throughout the country.",

And I think that's a red herring, and I think it's an argument made by the Department of Justice because they don't want to expose the extent to which there might have been federal assets or agents enhancing criminal acuity.

There's something called a discharge petition where if you get 218 signatures on something, it comes right to the floor. So, some of my conservative colleagues and I may be disappointed if you see moderate Republicans working with Democrats to get a clean vote on the debt limit.

I don't believe we should push this to the very end. I think we need to be laying out a plan now to get our fiscal House in order. But as you know, Michael, with interest rates rising, that changes the debt service obligations of the country. And it's one of the major drivers of our spending now, is servicing that debt so we have to be able to get it under control.

I had to publicly disclose the real property I sold to contribute to my own campaign when I was first elected in 2016, and we'll see how that process bears out.

That's not enforced.You don't have to show an I.D. You don't even need parental permission. You can just check a box or lie about your birthday and, boom, you have an Instagram account or a TikTok account. So that's a place to start because we have eight, nine, 10-year-old kids on these platforms that were not designed for children. They weren't even designed for teens. They were designed for adults. And because of brain development and anybody who has kids knows this, you know, there's a reason why we don't let eight-year-olds drive. There's a reason why you have to be 18 or 21 to buy cigarettes. Yet social media is almost completely unregulated. So parental permission would be another great step. Not being able to use social media during the nighttime hours would be another. We also have an epidemic of sleep deprivation among teens which very well might be one of the reasons why we have a mental health crisis because not sleeping enough is very, very strongly linked to depression, suicidal thoughts, self-harm, all of these issues we're seeing.",
