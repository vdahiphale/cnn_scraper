I'm Jake Tapper.This hour some eye popping numbers from a watchdog group keeping tabs on the U.S. Supreme Court suggesting Justice Clarence Thomas received $2 million in gifts for more than 100 entities, $2 million. Justice Thomas, not the only one racking up the numbers in this study. Plus the Biden Harris campaign making a play for anti-Trump Republicans such as the ones who keep turning out for Nikki Haley in Republican primaries. Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin of Virginia will be here on The Lead and we'll talk about that and much more. Plus new murder charges for the man accused of being the Gilgo Beach serial killer. The new evidence on a laptop that prosecutors say was his blueprint for serial killing. We start this hour with the 2024 lead. Let's play the music of election jam up. One week ago today Donald Trump was convicted of 34 felonies in the New York hush money cover up case that brought by the district attorney Alvin Bragg. Now former President Trump is just minutes from taking the stage in Phoenix. This is his first return to the campaign trail since that conviction. CNN's Kristen Holmes is traveling with the Trump campaign and is in Phoenix, thank God indoors, instead of in the 110 degree heat. Kristen, what is the Trump campaign saying is going to be the main theme of this event?",

And then this turns into a town hall. I don't expect this to be any kind of voters who are on the fence tripping Donald Trump up. This is a very favorable crowd and his turning point a group that is associated with Donald Trump and affiliated with Don Jr. as well. Now the themes of those short remarks are expected to focus on immigration. He's going to bash Biden's executive order, talk about what he did when he was in the office and how he's better to fix the immigration crisis if elected back into office. Now I will note, Donald Trump, one of his main issues other than the economy is expected to be immigration heading into November. So slight low when Biden issued that executive order. They want to continue to attack that order because they want to still be the fighting voice on immigration, something that we know from our polls, a lot of voters believe Donald Trump is stronger at. Now, whether or not he can actually stay on message remains to be seen. He's done a series of interviews over several days in which he was expected to talk about campaign promises what he was going to do, and instead he just attacked Joe Biden and the justice system.",

And as I said, I think when it comes to putting strength back into the White House, I think that Americans are tired of a weak Joe Biden, they're tired of a weak economy, they're tired of weak national security, they're tired of seeing a porous border, and even the actions this week from President Biden are too little too late.We've seen in almost the state of Virginia come across the border in the last three years. And we're all seeing every single state become a border states. And we have -- we've seen sexual assaults of young women by illegal immigrants. We've seen illegal immigrants try to crash the gates at Quantico. And we've seen fentanyl fly over the border and killing five Virginians a day on average.

I also believe that there are large numbers of Independents, who will in fact, choose Donald Trump over Joe Biden.And then finally, and I think this is really important. In Virginia, we have seen real success from common sense policies, literally growing jobs and standing up for law enforcement and, and standing for excellence and education. And we're seeing just tremendous results. And Virginians are now saying, wait a minute, common sense has a place. I like strong leadership, and I'm going to vote for Donald Trump. And I think this is what we're going to see all -- during the fall, particularly as the records of the two administrations are placed right next door to one another. And we can't forget the fact that that Trump did build a rip roaring economy, and it's the number one issue across voters right now is concerns about the economy. The second issue, of course, is concerns about the border. And these are two issues that I think Virginians and Americans are absolutely going to go with President Trump on.",

I did pledge to support and defend the Constitution. And we can do both of these. You know, Jake, in Obamacare and the Affordable Care Act, that's exactly what happened.

Yesterday, however, you said you're going to withdraw Virginia from participating in California's emission standards aimed to limit what's fueling the warming, you said that the move was about celebrating freedom. I understand wanting to have Virginia zone policy, not California has.But what are you going to do about climate change in your state?

And in fact, we are able now to choose to be subject to the federal mandates and the federal guidelines on emissions. Virginia, plus 37 other states are now subjected to the federal guidelines. And we made a decision that one having California with unelected bureaucrats mandate which car people can buy was wrong. But we also made a decision to protect people's pocketbooks and to give them the benefit of choosing which car they think is best for their needs.And Jake, the math here is really straightforward. It's really straightforward. EVs cost anywhere between 10,000 and $50,000 more than the comparison internal gas combustion engine and to force people. And that's what the California standards would do. Thirty-five percent of cars would have to be electric vehicles. And in Virginia right now, it's about 9 percent of cars are being purchased. That's upwards of $1.2 billion of economic penalty being placed on Virginians. And let me just make it clear. This is not a condemnation of electric vehicles. If you want to buy an electric vehicle, please do. And if you want to buy a hybrid, please do. And in fact, now that we will be subjected to the federal guidelines, innovation will have to take hold in order to drive much, much more stringent fuel economy standards. And I think America is up for this. The reality is that mandates are misguided. Let's trust innovation. And let's put that trust in the American consumer as opposed to mandating what people can and can't buy.",

Instead of just protecting life, you're being told you're taking away things from people.

Former President Donald Trump's son-in-law, who served as a senior adviser during the Trump years, recently entered into a contract with Serbia to develop a $500 million luxury hotel complex on the derelict site that included the former Serbian defense ministry in Belgrade, which was bombed by NATO forces in the year 1999. A bombing intended to bring an end to Serbia's systematic murder and rape and ethnic cleansing of Albanians under Serbia's notorious leader Slobodan Milosevic.Now part of this new hotel deal includes building a memorial, which Serbia's press release says is, quote, dedicated to all the victims of NATO aggression, unquote. However, we should note, Kushner's firm Affinity Partners provided the lead with part of their contract with Serbia. When it comes to the memorial, the part reviewed by The Lead does not expressly include the phrase NATO aggression. And there is no indication that they were involved in the wording that appeared in the Serbian government press release. Affinity Partners told The Lead that the project is intended to invest in the economic revitalization of Serbia, which is a war torn country. Now if the phrase NATO aggression from the Serbia press release, if that rings a bell, well, Russian leader Vladimir Putin frequently uses it as a rallying cry for his illegal war in Ukraine and any aggression he demonstrates towards the West. Joining us now former NATO Supreme Allied Commander, retired General Wesley Clark. So General, you were the supreme allied commander of NATO during the time of the bombing of the Serbian defense ministry in 1999. What's your take on this planned memorial being described as a, quote -- as a monument to the, quote, victims of NATO aggression? GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, I think it's great to invest in Serbia, no issue. But first of all, the building was empty when we struck it to the best of our knowledge. And it wasn't NATO aggression. It was -- this is was the culmination of a years' long diplomatic effort to persuade Serb dictator Slobodan Milosevic, not to go and kill his own citizens in the area of Serbia known as Kosovo. And he was doing it. He started it in 1998, murdering a family, killing 60 people, including women, children and babies in the judiciary (ph) family. He escalated it. We sent Richard Holbrooke and negotiate, Ambassador Crisco was there negotiating. I met three times with Milosevic. We -- the only thing we could think of is that if we look, we're going to warn you, please don't reinstitute. We just stopped the war in Bosnia. Don't start this all over again, in Europe.",

You don't have to give Putin away out. This is Putin's war of aggression.And if you tell the aggressor, exactly what you won't do, you have no deterrence. And so we're basically limiting what we're giving the Ukrainians, limiting what they can do with it, stretching it out, and they're fighting and dying. And they're fighting and dying, really, for the western values. I hope that we'll understand that you've got to have some ambiguity in this. The French move to put some trainers in there is exactly right, letting them shoot across the border, exactly right. It's Putin's problem if he gets into a confrontation. We also are a strong nation.

Afterwards, it was an altogether different story. Even to this day, the black soldiers were never given credit for their outstanding services beyond the call of duty.And there's another quote in the book, an anonymous black soldier who said, I'm an American Negro doing my part for the American government to make the world safe for a democracy I have never known.
