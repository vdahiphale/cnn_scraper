Police say that the man approached the woman, who appeared motionless early Sunday morning, and used a lighter to ignite her clothes, before then leaving the scene. Gloria Pazmino joins us now. Gloria, this was obviously a horrific crime discovered by police officers who were conducting a routine patrol at the subway station. What more have you learned?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Rahel, two important aspects of the story.The first is, as you mentioned, just the horrific nature of this crime, extremely graphic and just troubling in nature. We know that police tell us that this man you see on screen is believed to have approached a woman who appeared to be asleep on a train. This happened early morning in Brooklyn around 7:30 a.m. on Sunday, and they say that he approached her and used a lighter to ignite the clothes that she was wearing. She immediately caught fire and was quickly engulfed in flames. Now, there were patrol officers that were working in that station who saw the smoke and quickly responded, tried to put her out. Unfortunately, she could not be saved. But as they were responding to the scene, the man was actually seen on video sitting down on a bench. He had been sitting there essentially watching as this woman burned alive. Now, in the hectic first few minutes of their response, he got away, but they captured video and images of him. And so those two images played an extremely critical role in helping police arrest him several hours later. So, a combination of newly installed technology on the city's subway trains, which provided this image you're seeing now, as well as body- worn cameras that were worn by the officers on the platform that captured an image of his face. Now, as soon as these images went out to the media and social media, New Yorkers apparently were on the lookout, and they spotted him while he was riding the same train line. He was seen on an F train this time in Midtown Manhattan, very far from the scene. And that's where he was arrested. Take a listen to police commissioner Jessica Tisch talking about the crime and the arrest yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We don't know yet more details about his immigration status.We're also waiting to see what charges he is facing. And we're also waiting to learn more about the victim, Rahel. This is -- has been a very cold couple of days here in New York City. And the subway system is a place where people who are not housed usually take shelter during the very cold temperatures. Police believe that this woman was asleep inside that train when she was set on fire. So, another aspect of the story to consider, public safety on the transit system, something that's been very much a focus of law enforcement and public officials here in the city -- Rahel.",
