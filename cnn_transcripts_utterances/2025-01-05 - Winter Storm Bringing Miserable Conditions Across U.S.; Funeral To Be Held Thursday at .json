The first major winter storm of the season is bearing down on much of the United States, the latest on the conditions and when residents can expect the system to pass. Plus, we're learning more about the driver who exploded a Cybertruck in Las Vegas and the political grievances he held in the final days of his life. And while Donald Trump has already flexed his political muscles with House Republicans, we'll look at why passing his ambitious legislative plans may prove to be a challenge. I want to begin, though, with that powerful winter storm that's creating miserable and dangerous conditions across a wide swath of the U.S. and putting more than 70 million people there at risk. That includes nearly four million people in eastern Kansas now under blizzard warnings. In Colorado, travelers were also dealing with blizzard-like conditions. The storm is expected to bring heavy snow, hazardous ice, rain, and severe thunderstorms stretching more than 1,300 miles across the country. Governors in Kentucky and Virginia have already declared a state of emergency, while Maryland has declared a state of preparedness. Icy roads in Kansas created dangerous conditions. Even tractor trailers were slipping along the interstate. The Kansas City International Airport was closed for hours because of icy runways and icy taxiways. More than 550 flights in the U.S. have already been canceled for today, the bulk of those in Kansas City, St. Louis, and Chicago. Officials say travel will be hazardous as Kansas City and St. Louis will be hardest hit this morning. One Kansas State trooper had a simple message. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

There'll be a little bit of a break in the middle of the day, very heavy snow in the morning, and then possibly another round of heavy snow in the evening.

That was an improbable journey, one of many throughout his life.But certainly once the motorcade reached the Carter Center on Saturday evening for a private family service, Chip Carter spoke about how both of his parents, Jimmy Carter and Rosalynn Carter, and the work that they did for the world.

And while Republicans have a razor-thin majority in the House, in the Senate, Thune's pledge to protect the filibuster may pose challenges to Trump's ability to pass parts of his agenda.On Friday, at the start of the new two-year Congress, Thune spoke of his commitment to protecting the legislative filibuster in his opening remarks. He said it's important to, quote, \"Assure the Senate stays the Senate.\" During his first term, Trump had floated getting rid of the key rule, which requires 60 votes to close debate on a measure and is used as a tactic to delay voting. And the U.S. President-elect met with Italy's far-right Prime Minister on Saturday. Donald Trump welcomed Giorgia Meloni to his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. This is not the only meeting the two leaders have had recently. Last month, Meloni dined with Trump and billionaire Elon Musk in Paris during festivities to mark the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral. Meloni will meet with President Joe Biden when he's in Rome later this week. We are going to unpack all of that with Natasha Lindstaedt, who is a professor of government at the University of Essex here in the United Kingdom. She joins us now from Colchester. Natasha, there's so much to unpack here, but I do want to begin with that visit by Giorgia Meloni to Mar-a-Lago, because it certainly seems as though a lot of European leaders are trying to create ties with Donald Trump. But at the same time, it also seems as though he's meeting with European leaders who are similar inclined as himself. What do you make of it?",

And there's been definitely a rise of both leaders in the far-right, but also the parties on the far-right. We've seen this in not just Italy, but also Hungary, Austria, Slovakia, and so forth.And Trump and Elon Musk are forging closer ties. They share similar ideas on immigration or being anti-woke. And along these lines, they have been connecting. Now, in terms of the case of Meloni, she doesn't see Musk or Trump as a threat to her Italian policies that are based on making things in Italy and supporting Italian companies. And she's hoping that this relationship will only strengthen Italy. Now, as far as Trump is concerned, I think he tries to forge these types of relationships that the ultimate goal is really to weaken the European Union and possibly also NATO. He is an anti-internationalist. He is, you know, anti-globalization. And he's against these international institutions or these intergovernmental institutions as well. And so I think that's what's often driving these types of partnerships.",

But all of these, of course, extremely important topics for Europe.Do you get the sense that right now, European leaders are trying to sort of figure out what Donald Trump's presidency is going to mean for Europe, for the future in Europe, and certainly also for the conflict in Ukraine that is so important for the European leaders as well?",

What that is going to mean, what the difficulties are with that, what the possibilities are for that. And if you look at just some of the things that apparently are going to be in there, tax cuts or the extension of tax cuts, especially for wealthier people, the border and also energy as well.Where are the potential pitfalls and why do you think they're doing this? LINDSTEDT: Right, it's going to be a huge challenge to get this passed. I know the thinking behind it is that if they were to break it down into all these different separate bills, then that would also pose huge challenges as well because they'd have to negotiate in each bill with the Democrats. And with such a razor thin majority in the house, there's only really one defection that they can handle. This is a really different environment than when Trump entered the White House in 2017, when the Republicans had something like a 47-seat lead in the house. It's going to be very, very difficult to get anything passed without some cooperation of the Democrats. So at the very least, putting everything into one bill means this is going to take a very long time. It's going to be a lot of negotiation. And I think part of the problem is that they want huge spending cuts. They want a huge tax cut. And so in 2017, they were able to engineer a massive tax cut but that led to ballooning of the budget deficit by 4 trillion. And then they also at the same time want to spend all this money on immigration, on border security and on this deportation plan. All these things, managing all these things and trying to find some Democrats to get on board with this is going to be incredibly challenging.",

Police are now urging the country's acting president to order the security team to stand down and allow investigators to reach Yoon. Police also want the presidential security chief to appear for questioning next week. Yoon has been charged with abuse of power and leading a rebellion over a martial law he briefly imposed last month. The arrest warrant against him is valid until Monday, but it could be extended. In the midst of that political chaos, South Korea's acting president will hold talks with the country's key foreign ally in the coming hours. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is now on his way to Seoul. Officials say his goal is to reaffirm U.S. ties with South Korea, which hosts about 30,000 U.S. troops. Blinken will later head to Japan and France in what could be his last trip as the top U.S. diplomat. Now, for 100 years, The Great Gatsby has been a classic of American literature. Ahead, how the story of a glitzy millionaire and his doomed love affair has now become a Broadway musical. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",
