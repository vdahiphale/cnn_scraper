      "sentences": "Well, I think it certainly shows how important China is to Russia, just to have Vladimir Putin meet with China's top diplomat here in Moscow, and once again underscore how important those relations are, and, by the way, also say that Xi Jinping will be coming here to Moscow in the not too distant future to meet with Vladimir Putin.[10:05:14] We know that those two leaders obviously have had very, very close relations over the years that have only grown tighter, really as the U.S. has been putting more pressure on Russia, of course, also because of Russia's campaign there in Ukraine. But I think this once again underscores just how important especially for the Russians the relations with China are and, of course, at the same time you have a lot of issues right now between China and the United States. Obviously, not only because of that balloon that was shot down but also because the U.S., as we've been reporting, has seen some indications that China potentially is thinking about arming the Russians, about giving Russia military support and lethal aid for the war in Ukraine. Once again today at that meeting between Putin and Wang Yi, Wang Yi took a swipe at the Biden administration, said that the relations between Russia and China obviously are very close. He also said they are not directed against any third parties but they will also not be subject, as he put it, to interference from third parties, obviously very much talking or seemingly talking about the U.S. in that. I thought one of the things that was quite interesting, I was reading the readout of the meeting that came from the Chinese foreign ministry, and they said that China remains committed to finding a political solution for the war in Ukraine. And Vladimir Putin right after meeting Wang Yi actually went to a gigantic rally here in Moscow, obviously trying to rally support for Russia what they called their special military operation in Ukraine. So, that certainly was something that seemed very interesting. But, you know, it really is hard to overstate just how important China has become for Russia, obviously, with all of those sanctions levied against Russia from the U.S. and its allies. You can see it everywhere as far as where Russia's raw commodities are going, oil and gas but also other things, like, for instance, wood and timber. But you also see it quite frankly on the streets of Moscow as well with the amount of Chinese cars drastically going up and generally Chinese products also in stores as well, guys.",

He said the U.S. has options, and he did not specify what those options are. What do you believe those options are in actuality and what is necessary to respond if China makes its move? KENDALL-TAYLORThe United States has warned Beijing very clearly, and that's one of the reasons that Tony Blinken met with his counterpart there at the Munich Security Conference, was to communicate directly the cost that China would face for doing so. So, I think we'd be looking at things like secondary sanctions and other economic costs. But I think the thing that needs to be communicated to China, is it needs to come from also our European allies and partners. So, China continues to try to portray itself as a neutral party, that they're not backing Russia in its war with Ukraine, and that's in large part because they view that there haven't been any costs for their neutrality. And they're primarily interested in keeping Europe on the fence. And so if the Europeans could communicate, too, that there would be economic and diplomatic costs for that step, I think that would be even more impactful than some of these warnings from the United States.",
