We're looking at the road ahead for the former president and his campaign to return to the White House.Also, tonight, top Republicans are rushing to Trump's defense, with House Speaker Mike Johnson taking it to a whole new level, saying the U.S. Supreme Court should step in. All of this as the GOP standard bearer is facing new restrictions as a convicted felon. We'll take a closer look at what Trump can and can't do in the days, weeks, and possibly even years ahead. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in the Situation Room. Our top story tonight, Donald Trump defiant as he begins to fight his felony conviction in court and in the court of public opinion. CNN's Kristen Holmes is outside the Trump Tower in New York City where the former president spoke out and lashed out earlier today. Kristen, what did Trump say about the verdict? KRISTEN HOLMES CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, it was a lot of ranting, a lot of airing of grievances and a lot of what we've heard before essentially saying that this was election interference, that this was driven by Democrats. Of course, we know that this -- there's no evidence that this was driven by Joe Biden or Democrats or had anything to do with the election. It was brought by New York State, the case, of course. But that didn't stop them and it didn't stop his team from encouraging him to use this messaging. Take a listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It was a rigged trial. We wanted a venue change, where we could have a fair trial. We didn't get it. We wanted a judge change. We wanted to judge that wasn't conflicted. And obviously he didn't do that. There's nobody's ever seen anything like it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And of course, we cannot confirm those numbers until we see the FEC reports but they say the money is going to keep coming in.Now we also heard from Donald Trump's rival, President Joe Biden, who seemed to take on Donald Trump and his comments directly.

I was told that they were all here at Trump Tower earlier today to lend support to Donald Trump. None of them came to the press conference.

But as the gag order is still active, any potential gag order violations can be considered at sentencing.And today, during that press event that he held, this was something that everyone was looking for. And he did attack at least one person who was covered by the gag order. Let's take a listen to what he said about Michael Cohen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) D. TRUMP: Now, I'm not allowed to use his name because of the gag order. But you know, he's a sleazebag. Everybody knows that, took me a while to find out. But he was effective. He did work.

And just moments after Trump made those comments, Cohen came out and attacked him. So it's unclear if this will actually be considered a violation of the gag order, but notable that Trump did not violate the gag order in any other way that has been recognized and imposed for fines by the judge.

Now, if we look at the universe of cases of New York defendants convicted of the same crime here, falsification of business records, which is a Class E felony, it's the lowest in terms of seriousness A through E. The healthy majority, somewhere in the range of 70 percent to 90 percent of those defendants get non prison sentences. So that would mean probation, fines, potentially community service. However, there are arguments that I think we'll probably hear from the prosecutors about why Trump is different, why his conduct is more serious, that he has not shown remorse, that he chose to go to trial, that he has lashed out against the judge and others, it's going to come down to Judge Merchan's decision.One thing that's really important, even if he does get sentenced to prison, he will almost certainly be given bail pending appeal, meaning he wouldn't have to serve that sentence until his appeals are done, which would certainly be after the 2024 election.",

They want similarly situated people to be sentenced the same way and the potential for reoffending and rehabilitation. And as Elie said, 70 percent to 90 percent of these types of cases are non-incarceration. You have a 77-year-old defendant with no criminal record, very unlikely to reoffend in his lifetime.And when you factor into this, the lifetime secret service protection, it just may be onerous, even if it's a close call for Judge Merchan.

So, you know, I think it could potentially help him. But by the way, I don't think it's anything Donald Trump would ever want.

So let's just walk through real quickly the structure here, Donald Trump was just convicted in the New York State Trial Court, which may be somewhat confusingly, as called the New York Supreme Court.That's the bottom layer you see here. He has an automatic right to appeal to the middle layer, the New York appellate division. If he loses there, he can then ask the top court in the state of New York, which is called the New York court of appeals to take the case. They don't have to. When he's done with his New York appeals, then he can ask and only then can he ask the U.S. Supreme Court to take the case. And they don't have to take any case, either. It's up to them.

      "sentences": "Well, let's start with the first basic question here. Can Donald Trump be the president of the United States as a convicted felon? The simple truth is a constitutional he says a few things. Be a natural born citizen of the United States, that's a requirement. Be at least 35 years old. And you must be a resident of the U.S. for at least 14 years. Those are among the requirements for being president.It really says nothing about felons. And in truth, many legal analysts say even if you are a felon, you could literally win the office and serve as president from a jail cell if you had to. Can he vote? That's a different question. This is a little more complicated, that first one sort of a slam dunk. Yes, he can be president, little more complicated. Almost every state except for Vermont, Maine, and then D.C. as an area down here, almost all of them have some kind of restrictions on you if you have been convicted of a crime, if you are a felon in those states, some more, some a little bit less. But that is usually focused on whether or not you're actually in jail. And it's complicated further by the fact that Trump is a resident of Florida, where they say you have to serve all your time and pay all your fines before you can vote again. But he was convicted in New York where it's somewhat more lenient, and this is the state that would take precedent there. So although it's not entirely worked out, the general belief is that on balloting day, it's very likely that he will be able to cast his ballot. Wolf?",

There are some more places he visited so far in his campaign. Yes, he can travel, he can campaign, he can go to interviews, he can go to debates like CNN's debate that will be down near Georgia Tech here and Atlanta. And he even go traveled and golf if he wants to unless the Court tells him, he specifically cannot, that would be a different matter if they don't want him to do that.But beyond that, there are other restrictions for felons sometimes, some might lose their passport, might not be able to get mortgages from certain banks, might not be able to take part in certain government programs, especially involving money, not sit on a jury, own a gun. But I do want to point out we put this asterisk down here for a very big reason, this is a former president, a potential future president and that means virtually everything we've talked about here could be subject to change. Wolf? [17:45:14] BLITZER: Tom Foreman, excellent explanation. Thank you very much. Coming up, the presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin is standing by to join us live.

Never did it happen before this. Never did happen after this. I think the next step that I imagined the history books might say, is what happens in the appeals process. And if that appeals process claims that it was a fundamentally fair trial, and his conviction is not overturned, then the real step is what happens in public sentiment, what happens in the election? Will it be fought on a corrupt rule of law on the one hand, and a rule of law on the other, or we'll finally be able to just talk about what these candidates want to present as a vision for the future, and who they are as people.

The impeachment process was going forward. Senator Goldwater sign of the Republican Party, House Minority Leader, Senate Minority Leader, went to President Nixon and told him that he would be convicted and Republicans would be behind it if he did not resign, and he resigned.

And maybe when people digest what happened here, that a jury of 12 citizens in the way the jury trial system works, worked hard, listen to it, ask questions, and came to the conclusion that he deserved to be convicted. And if that settles into a certain percentage of the country, everything is so close that it could swing the election.If that happens, it'll be hard for me to imagine that we're still going to be arguing once again, OK. The last election they will claim was corrupt was not right. This election is not corrupt at a time we're going to get exhausted.

And it feels like there's no time left to really talk about climate change, or talk about gun safety or talk about a woman's right to choose. Those are the issues that really matter in the future.And I think he should focus on that, and just talk about the fact that we can't be caught up in another retribution grievances and go backward. We're already backsliding. And in order to go forward, he's got to be a fighter for going forward. I'm not sure he has to be a fighter against Trump per se, but a fighter against the whole idea that we keep going backward in time we keep claiming that elections are not right, that jury trials are not right.
