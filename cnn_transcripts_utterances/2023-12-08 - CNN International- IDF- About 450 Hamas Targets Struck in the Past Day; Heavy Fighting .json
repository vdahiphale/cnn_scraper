      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to \"CNN Newsroom.\" I'm Bianca Nobilo in for Max Foster in London.Just ahead. Israeli strikes pummel Gaza. The IDF says it has conducted its most extensive attacks since the fragile truce between Israel and Hamas ended a week ago. Plus, Russia fires a barrage of cruise missiles towards Ukraine's capital Kyiv and Eastern Ukraine after weeks of relative calm in the region. And then U.S. President Joe Biden's son Hunter faces new legal charges, this time for allegedly dodging more than $1 million in taxes. Israel is unleashing an intense bombardment on Gaza from the air, sea and ground. The IDF says about 450 targets were struck over the past day, the most in one day since the end of the truce one week ago. The fighting in Khan Yunis, Gaza's second largest city is particularly fierce. The IDF says its troops killed numerous terrorists in a two hour series of precision strikes. Disturbing images, meanwhile, have been posted to social media, showing a mass detention of men in Gaza by the Israeli military. Some of the images of the men kneeling, blindfolded and stripped to their underwear have been geo-located by CNN to Beit Lahia, north of Gaza City. The exact dates and circumstances of what happened are not clear. CNN's Alex Marquardt joins us now live from Tel Aviv. Alex, it seems that the military tempo has increased dramatically, the most number of strikes from air, land and sea since the truce ended a week ago. What do you think is behind this latest escalation and what the IDF think they're achieving? ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, Bianca, it is really part of this new phase that we saw start back up exactly a week ago when the pause ended and the release of hostages ended. So we have seen large numbers of bombardments. Numbers given to us pretty much every day by the IDF. This is the biggest number that we have seen in the past week, around 450 strikes carried out by Israeli planes, ships and ground forces. So that the fighting truly has returned in earnest. The Hamas controlled Ministry of Health and Gaza now saying that the death toll in Gaza since October 7th has gone past 17,000. And despite the fierce attacks by Israel, on various parts of the Gaza Strip, not just in the south, but in the north as well, we continue to get responses from Hamas, presumably and/or other militant groups. Just in the past few moments, Bianca, we have seen rockets fired -- a barrage of rockets fired from Gaza towards Tel Aviv. The sirens went off here in Tel Aviv. The Iron Dome intercepted, we believe, several of those rockets right above our heads. We heard the loud booms of those interceptions. The Israeli efforts though, Bianca, have really focused in the past few days on that city of Khan Yunis, the biggest in the southern part of the Gaza Strip, where Israeli officials do believe that some of Hamas' top leaders may be. That has fueled this humanitarian crisis that we've seen, because so many people from the northern part of the Strip who had been told to flee south went to Khan Yunis. They've now been told to go even farther south. Many hundreds of thousands have gone towards Rafah, that crossing with Egypt. We have seen chaotic and truly disturbing scenes in Khan Yunis of the dead and wounded being taken to hospitals, which are simply overflowing. The humanitarian situation growing increasingly dire, all across the Gaza Strip, Bianca.",

The UN says 69 trucks full of humanitarian supplies and 61,000 liters of fuel made it into Gaza from Egypt on Thursday. That is well below the daily average during the truce.The head of the UN Relief Agency is painting a bleak picture, saying its operation in southern Gaza is now barely functioning citizens. Larry Madowo is in Cairo and joins us now with more on the aid operations. Larry, this does seem to be a bleak picture. The largest amount of strikes since the breakdown of the truce a week ago, but a small relatively amount of aid coming in. But there are discussions about possibly opening up another crossing.",

Aid organizations are optimistic that that could really help alleviate the suffering you see on the Gaza Strip, especially in the southern Gaza Strip, which is where Israel is told the people to move to, as they were continuing this military operation in the north.You got to understand that right now the only way in and out of the Gaza Strip that is not controlled by Israel is through the Rafah crossing. This Rafah crossing was never meant to be a goods outlet. It is for pedestrians, but it's been turned since October 7 for a way for these humanitarian trucks to come in, for the injured to come out, for foreign nationals to come out. But it's not nearly enough. In fact, the UN the World Health Organization, other aid agencies say it any semblance of an aid operation is almost completely impossible right now using just the Rafah crossing. So 57,000 pounds of UN medical supplies and food and nutritional assistance is coming in from USAID from the Jordanian capital into El-Arish, that's in North Sinai here in Egypt, and that will be loaded onto trucks and taken to the Rafah crossing. There's a huge backlog there. That's part of the problem. The other bigger problem is just that there's so many people who have lost everything, who have nowhere to stay the southern Gaza Strip, such as this man who says 23 members of his family were killed, and he's out of options.

Should we die from hunger? As a sick person I need food. OK, fine, I lost my family, no problem. But what about the children we have here?

A visual say the air raid lasted about two hours, but all of the missiles headed to Kyiv were shot down. However, some homes were damaged by falling debris. Elsewhere, officials say missile attacks killed two people, one in Kharkiv region, where shelling damaged seven apartment buildings. Another person was killed when missiles struck the eastern city of Pavlohrad. The attacks come as the outlook for more U.S. aid hangs in the balance. [08:10:00] CNN's Nick Paton Walsh joins us now from Eastern Ukraine. Nick, Russian strikes have been occurring over the last few months even though the world's attention has, obviously shifted off the conflict there while Israel has been attacking Gaza. But why now? Why this moment to suddenly resume a barrage of cruise missiles on Ukraine? What's the thinking there?",

But it's taken a lot of attention now this first time in 79 days that cruise missiles have been launched.They formed the bulk of the onslaught beginning of last winter against key infrastructure targets across Ukraine. And it was in the dawn hours of this morning that 19 were launched. Ukraine says it took 15 of them out and the capital only experienced debris hitting it. Dnipropetrovsk one life was lost, four were injured. We've just come from Pavlohrad were eight people were injured as well. Other cases of isolated injury around the country. A low injury toll, a low death toll, but a deep concern here that this may mark the beginning of a new wave of cruise missile attacks. There were thoughts that perhaps Russia was running low on its supplies. It boasted it can make infinite numbers. We're going to see over that winter what its capacities truly are. But it really brings to focus the issue over United States aid here. The White House has made it clear that air defenses that Ukraine says shut down the vast majority of the missiles last night they could well be the first to suffer if funding does not come through. At the same time, it may also impact the 155 artillery shells that formed the bulk of Ukraine's ability to attack Russian forces or defend their areas of terrain as well. The last White House announcement of aid was $175 million, a lot to you and me but paltry compared to the billions who became accustomed to seeing over the last years or so almost every other week, unclear really we don't have good transparency as to when the money runs out. But it is a key moment for Ukraine, certainly. A helicopter pilot I was speaking to this morning said without U.S. aid, we simply can't do this. They will keep fighting, certainly, but they won't have the capacity they do now that has enabled them to hold back an invading force. Yes, some counter offensive did not achieve the results that billions of NATO dollars had hoped it necessarily would. But the arguments happening on the Hill in Washington, DC suggesting essentially that the U.S. doesn't want to get itself dragged into a larger conflict here. Well, misses the point entirely. It's an American aid that enables Ukraine to hold Russia back away from NATO's borders. And an entanglement there could very well drag the United States in wholesale into this war. So this debate over aid and the missile strikes last night, certainly bringing into focus globally, obviously to a war that occupies every daily moment of Ukrainians. Exactly how vital a moment this is both for the West to continue assisting Ukraine but also for the bleakness of the winter ahead here, Bianca.",

But what we're seeing is that there doesn't really seem to be any change in Israel's conduct of this military campaign. I spend every day here for hours looking at video of injured and dead civilians and it doesn't seem to be any different now than it was before. And the United States, as I said, there's perhaps verbal pressure, but in practical terms, they don't seem to be doing anything to restrain Israel at this point. They have the ability, certainly the United States is providing a vital supply of weapons and ammunition and intelligence. United States is flying, survey -- drone surveillance flights over Gaza. But none of that has been in any way impacted by the fact that, yes, Israel's words of restraining itself and avoiding civilian casualties are simply not reflected on the ground. Bianca.",
