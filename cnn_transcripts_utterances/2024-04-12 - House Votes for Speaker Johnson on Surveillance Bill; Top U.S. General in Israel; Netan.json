      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, President Reagan would not approve, no question about it. And Secretary Cohen, I do want to ask you, I do want to shift gears to the Middle East because sources tell CNN that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is convening his war cabinet right now to discuss readiness for a possible attack by Iran that potentially would be in retaliation for last week's strike on that Iranian consulate in Syria. What do you make of all of that? How destabilizing would that be if something like that were to come to pass?",

If you go back to the center of the web that has been woven, Iraq -- I'm sorry, Iran is in the very center. They are the spider. And you go out from that web, you see China, you see Russia, you see the Houthis, you see Syria, you see others in -- North Korea. They all focus on Iran.So, if there were to be a war between Israel and Iran, all of those countries in the region may very well be involved, not to mention those highly sophisticated forward-looking countries in the Gulf. They have everything to lose in terms of their countries as well. This is a big deal. This is very important that Bibi Netanyahu not do anything without consulting with the United States military, with our secretary of defense, with President Biden. Because we have a lot of skin in the game on this. It's not just Israel it's at stake. We have a lot of Americans in the region, thousands of them. And so, we have a say in this and should have a say in it. And I would hope that Bibi would listen to President Biden. Take care to help people who are starving. Don't make the United States a party to imposing famine on 30,000 people or killing 30,000 people. Make sure they are fed. Make sure that they take extra care in going after those targets that they have to go after. Hamas must be defeated, unless you defeat it in a way that doesn't kill thousands of innocent people.",

Here with us now to discuss is Democratic Congressman Jason Crow of Colorado who serves on the House Intelligence and Foreign Affairs Committees.Congressman, I do want to get to that, but just very quickly, your reaction to how the FISA legislation is making its way through the House. Are you confident that -- we were just talking to Lauren Fox a short while ago, it sounds as though there might be some alterations to FISA that could run into trouble in the Senate. Are you confident that this thing can get to the finish line? REP. JASON CROW (D-CO), INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE:  Well, I'm nervous, Jim. It's too close for comfort. I need to, you know, correct some misinformation here. This is a program that's fundamental to our national security. The bulk of our intelligence on foreign spies, on terrorist threats, on counternarcotics, on the fentanyl trade, most of this intelligence comes from FISA and from this program. This program is a lawful program, it's reviewed consistently by courts that have said it's lawful, it's compliant with the Constitution. Not reauthorizing it with the reforms that have been made would be devastating to our national security and the impacts and the risk to Americans would be felt almost immediately. So, we're working very hard to make sure that that does not happen, that we preserve this very essential national security tool.",

I recall when Kevin McCarthy made that pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago right after January 6th, resuscitated Donald Trump as, sort of, a political figure in this country after the shameful way that he left office.And here you have Mike Johnson going down there with Donald Trump very much almost in charge of the Republican House Conference. I guess arguably he is in charge of the Republican House Conference. What's your reaction to this visit today?",

Does he have to, sort of, pay this visit, kiss the ring in order to make those things happen in the House? Do you understand the visit from a political standpoint? Does it make political sense from that standpoint?",

I just simply -- I cannot understand that. I mean, Donald Trump is an extreme danger to our democracy. He is, in my view, an unstable man that poses a variety of dangers.So, I can't wrap my brain around having, you know, thinking like politically you have to go kiss someone's ring to get their support when Ukraine is starting to lose its war. When one of our largest intelligence tools is at great risk right now. When we're not able to govern on very simple things that the American people deserve us to govern on. I just can't wrap my brain around any of that. To be honest with you, we can and should do better.",

There's some reporting that Israel is bracing for that kind of attack. The White House says, it's watching it very closely. You're on the -- some very key committees up on Capitol Hill, Congressman. How worried are you about Iran striking at Israel in the coming days?",

You know, it -- just from a common-sense perspective, it would make sense that Iran would retaliate in some way for the strike last week. So, we're just being very vigilant about it. The administration is being very vigilant about it. This is a perfect example of, you know, feeling better that there are very serious, smart people that take this stuff seriously in the Pentagon, in the National Security Council, and certainly in the White House. And why leadership matters and why having people that understand these issues matters.But we're going to keep a close eye on it. And certainly, we'll defend Israel if there is a -- an attack. You know, and there's various ways of doing that. I'm not saying that we are going to get involved in the conflict. We have to prevent escalation, but certainly standing by Israel and providing the support that they would need to resist an attack, I think would be very important here.",

And despite disappointing inflation reports, Americans attitudes toward the economy are largely holding steady.CNN's Matt Egan joins us now. Matt, and it's an obscure sounding report, but any of these little tea leaves that come out about the economy these days, everybody's going and -- going through those numbers and pouring through them because folks want to know, is inflation coming down? How are people feeling about the economy because we're in this election year and it could really hinge on those issues?",

      "sentences": "Yes, absolutely, Jim. I mean, this is a measure of how Americans feel. So, we pay really close attention because there's big economic implications. Consumer spending is the biggest driver of growth. And obviously there are political implications as well. So, these new numbers show that consumer sentiment didn't move much, but it did dip slightly as April started off, going below 78 versus just over 79 in March. That was a little bit unexpected, and it does reflect lingering concerns with the cost of living, right? Housing, car insurance, energy is a big one. We know gas prices are starting to tick higher.Now, let's look at where the trend is for this figure. And this chart shows that back in 2020, consumer sentiment tumbled during COVID, and then it really plunged two years ago when inflation was on fire. And I think the good news is clearly sentiment has bounced back from two years ago, but I think the bad news here is that it's still well below pre-COVID levels. And so, if you're sitting in the White House, you really are hoping that those numbers improve more than they have, and it does seem as though sentiment, sort of like inflation, some of the progress there, has started to really stall out here.
