Prosecutors and Trump's defense attorneys will soon return to the Manhattan courtroom where Judge Juan Merchan will discuss the jury charging instructions with both the defense and the prosecution. These are instructions that will play a decisive role in how the jury is able to reach its verdict in the trial that has played out over the last five weeks. Earlier today the defense wrapped up its case with the final of just two witnesses they called to the stand. Attorney Robert Costello testifying for just over an hour today discussing his connections with former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and his efforts in 2018 to represent the prosecutor's star witness Michael Cohen.",

He's pleaded not guilty and he's denied any affair with Daniels. So jurors have been dismissed for the week. Closing arguments are expected to begin on Tuesday. CNN's Brynn Gingras is live outside of the courtroom for us. Brynn before we get to closing arguments a week from today another major moment of the trial is set to begin in just moments.

But jury instructions are an extremely important part of this process though they are very dense and defined in legalities and essentially what it is, is the lawyers negotiating with the judge about what he will say to the jurors when they are given the case after closing arguments next week. This will serve as a road map for the jurors as they basically figure out how to interpret the law and apply the law when it comes to these charges with all the witnesses and all the testimony that they have heard in the last four and a half five weeks or so. So it's a very important part although it is a very dense part so it'sgoing to take some time though it is expected to wrap up and this is done without the presence of the jurors. They actually went home earlier this morning. They were able to get home in time for lunch and like you said they will not be back here until next week when those closing arguments begin and the judge picking next week so that there will be basically a clear runway for these jurors to deliberate and decide the verdict in this historic case.",

I think one of the areas where I'm watching, it's really important, too, is what is going to be the other crime, right? One of the things that prosecutors have to show is that Donald Trump falsified business records or had them falsified to commit another crime. And this is a really unusual feature of this case, because ordinarily in the federal system, you have to lay it all out in the indictment. That's what an indictment is. You're notifying the defense with the charge here. Here they've just left it. Here we are. The evidence is closed. And all that the prosecution has said is some other crime TBD.

The problem is that the star defense witness had huge holes blown in his testimony with his own emails that undermine them. And unfortunately, for the defense, it's the last thing that the jury saw. They will have these five days rather than an embarrassing moment for the defense, being the last thing they saw, to be thinking about this Costello testimony.

Well, there was this moment in time when Michael Cohen said, I don't really have anything on Donald Trump. I did this on my own. That's in there. That's in there from emails. That's in there from other witness testimony. Cohen himself essentially admitted that there was a point in time when he was saying that. On the other hand, I just feel like Costello was such a distasteful witness that had his own credibility undermined. I would not-look, this is a long gap to go a week, essentially, between the end of evidence and closing arguments. I think it was the right move by the judge to push it all off till after Memorial Day. That's a long time. And we all remember from Psych 101, primacy and recency, right?

But there's a longer statute of limitations if you can make it a felony. And the way they make it a felony here is what we were just talking about. That other crime. What is the other crime that they falsified records to promote or to commit? So it's not your most straightforward charge. It's not like, well, I charge you, jury, on the elements of robbery here. The elements of even fraud can be straightforward. It's complicated, but it's been tested thus far in this court.

Because the fact that he wasn't continuously in in the state of New York during the period of the statute of limitations. Now, that's an open legal question or at least one that they'd fight about. I'm not saying it's a winner one way or the other, but it's just not, you know, it's something prosecutors might want to do. Now, to be clear, I don't prosecutors do not want to charge a misdemeanor here. This may come up in the jury instructions that perhaps they could also convict on a misdemeanor.

A lot of criticism of what Israelis view as this moral equivalency that they think the ICC is drawing between Israel and Hamas. We've heard the Israeli prime minister, as you just played that soundbite of him, speaking there, talking about how outraged he is and what a problem he sees this move by the ICC as being. But he's also responding to some of the specific charges, notably on the use of starvation as a weapon of war. The Israeli prime minister is talking about the tons of humanitarian aid that Israel has allowed into Gaza. But, of course, what he isn't talking about is the specific amounts of aid versus what humanitarian aid officials say is required. And multiple humanitarian aid agencies over the course of several months now have been arguing that the Israeli government is restricting the flow of aid into Gaza, not allowing enough aid in to meet the needs of the Palestinian people, calling that collective punishment. And that is indeed what the ICC's top prosecutor is picking up on here. Netanyahu also said that Khan is arguing that Israel doesn't have a right to self-defense. In his statement, Khan said that Israel does have a right to self-defense.
