I think for so many people in the, let's call it GOP establishment, not even never-Trumpers, but people who perhaps supported Donald Trump in the last even two election cycles who do not want to see him move forward as the nominee who really want a new chapter. It's been a question of who will they coalesce around? And in this case, this is a huge push for Nikki Haley to be that person. And that is what's so significant is that in that battle that, really, at this moment is between DeSantis and Haley. Haley really gets a big boost from this.",

Her relatives were released by Hamas on Friday and are telling her they had little food, little access to bathrooms and more. And then this from the head of the medical team helping the Hostages and Missing Family Forums telling CNN this morning what he has seen in evaluating 84-year-old Elma Avraham after she was released.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. HAGAL LEVINE, HEAD OF MEDICAL TEAM FOR HOSTAGES AND MISSING FAMILY FORUMS:  You can see on her body that she was dragged from a place to place, and that she was handcuffed that, you know, like she has chemical wounds from not treating basic needs, if you understand what I mean. So, you know, that's loss of basic dignity. That's immense suffering. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

There was one Emily Hand, who -- nine-year-old girl, the one with the curls, beautiful looking child who came back and thought she had been in captivity for a year. Cries herself to sleep. It can't be comforted. There are stories of a 12-year-old boy who was forced at gunpoint by Hamas to watch some of those horrific videos from the October 7th massacre. And when he complained about it, he was beaten.There are stories of the elderly women who were starved, right. They lost something like five to 15-kilo of their weight, that could be about 25 pounds. There wasn't enough food. Some of the women apparently were kept in cages, kept in the dark without access to bathrooms. This was nothing like what the Geneva Convention calls for in the treatment of captives. But let's remember, these weren't captives. Hamas took these people to cause Israel pain and to make our hearts break.",

Even after the release of what we've seen over the last four days and the 10 that are hopefully going to be coming home tonight. You still will have about 170 who are going to be held in captivity in the Gaza Strip by Hamas. So therefore, Israel has that interest to get back those people.You know, even the women and children, Kate, who have been brought back, there's many fathers and husbands who were left behind because Hamas is not willing to release any of those men. So, while we're all excited and happy to see these people come back with -- those families are still broken and are still being ripped apart. But I think that Israel has two interests here. One is to continue to weaken Hamas, to eliminate its capabilities, to remove it from power in Gaza, (INAUDIBLE) -- I listened to Bob Baer before, the former CIA operative, who spoke about how, yes, Hamas's leadership is still intact in Southern Gaza. They still have brigades down there, thousands of fighters, significant capabilities that continue to pose a threat to Israel. On the other hand, the other interest is to get back as many hostages. But at what point will Israel say, we've done enough with this break and this pause, we have to get back to the main objective? Which is denying Hamas the ability to ever again carry out such an attack against Israel.",

Not a good look for \"Sports Illustrated.\"The outlet's parent company, the Arena Group, they released a statement basically saying, we didn't actually do this ourselves, we purchased the content from a third party. And I'll read you part of the statement. It said -- they said, we have learned that the third party, AdVon Commerce, had writers use a pen or pseudonym in certain articles to protect author privacy, actions we don't condone. And we are removing the contents while our internal investigation continues and have since ended that partnership.
