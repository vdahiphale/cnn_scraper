And of course, at a time like this, with so much of the current politics and history and economy playing particularly in this country, there was a great deal of sensitivity to how this would go down.

It's going to be quite extraordinary with a Commonwealth upfront. But then all three other services represented all the way along it, a very complicated affair. And this is a four-ton carriage. It's extremely hard, it can only move at walking pace, it takes for Windsor grey horses, the King's own breed to take it along, and they're going to be towards the back.

I mean, Camilla, I mean, we were talking when we about how Charles wasn't necessarily smiling. I think he was pretty stressed at the beginning because of that timing issue. But then it became a solemn occasion for him a moment where he was appointed God's representative on earth. And you had the anointing, which was a private moment.
