      "sentences": "Yes, Becky, this meeting is hugely significant both for the United States and Japan because the two countriesright now are trying to express how their cooperation is deepening and strengthening. Especially right now as they share a common concern, which is China's increasing aggression in the Indo-Pacific region. During our interview with the Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida on Sunday, he expressed why Japan needed to accelerate its military buildup. The fastest acceleration and the biggest build-up we've seen since actually the end of World War II. He talked to us a little bit about some of the challenges that he thinks Japan is currently facing in the security sector. Give this a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FUMIO KISHIDA, JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  In our neighborhood, there are countries that are developing ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons and others that are building up their defense capabilities in an opaque way. Also, there is a unilateral attempt to change the status quo by force in both the East China Sea and South China Sea. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "So because Japan is facing these so-called geopolitical tensions, Kishida  really wants to strengthen his ties to the United Statesand increase its defense capabilities. According to one senior U.S. government official I spoke with, we can expect Kishida and Biden to announce a joint operations command in Japan, which is a move that the United States has long pursued. Right now, U.S. personnel, joint operations of U.S. Personnel in Japan are directed by INDOPACOM, which is, of course, headquartered in Hawaii. So experts tell me that this move would greatly streamline and help organize military operations in real time.",

It's the biggest festival we have in Washington, D.C. But those cherry blossoms were originally gifted by the government of Japan from Tokyo over 100 years ago. William Taft's wife and the governor of Tokyo at the time, their wife, came together. And those cherry blossoms have been a gift that keeps on giving. You see cherry blossoms ubiquitously, not just in the D.C. region but of course here in New York and Central Park. And you see them all over Japan, where people stop what they're doing, come underneath and celebrate for a couple of days as those cherry blossoms come together. So it really is important symbolically. And the fact that Kishida-san has brought those cherry blossoms back to Washington and really reaffirmed that relationship is symbolically very important",

I think the Biden administration's made it clear that they're going to be administration of continuity. Trump in many ways is coming back in a second term in a very different way. You'll remember that Donald Trump had one of the best relationships with any world leader, Shinzo Abe, who's no longer here. And in fact, the last official visit, a state visit of the type that took place with Japan, was nine years ago under Shinzo Abe. And Biden's predecessor in terms of Obama. So I think Japan has always done very well in navigating the personal relationships, because U.S.-Japan is so strong. But they are certainly here at what the price will be. Will Trump ask for higher prices? That's why you're going to see a lot of things coming out today about military defense and technology, space, areas that are bipartisan consensus, because Japan will transcend the partisan politics of the presidential election with certainly a lot of concern.",

Kishida declined to come comment. He said that he couldn't comment about another country's domestic policies. But he said that he hopes a U.S.-Japan alliance remains strong no matter which party was in power. And I think this really speaks to the larger theme here, of Japan just really emphasizing that it has one of the strongest ties with the United States. It really emphasizes also this sort of lattice-like structure that a lot of analysts are talking about, where Japan and the United States work together. But also it has allies, such as the Philippines, Australia, the U.K. And really it's just kind of strengthening these alliances in the Indo-Pacific region, where, again, it sees introns from, for instance, neighbors such as China and North Korea.",

Of course, Japan has been at the center of the alliance in the Indo-Pacific. That's the way that the president and the White House has viewed them. And this, of course, is very, very important, particularly as, amid the resurgence of China and trying to reinforce commitments, I mean, for example, you have Japan and the U.S. working on their defense posture and trying to tweak that, as well as listing over 70 deliverables. They really want to cover a lot of ground which just goes to show how important they are to this alliance. That goes for example, from, as I mentioned, changing the U.S. force structure in Japan in order to improve how Japanese and U.S. forces are integrated. And greater defense industrial cooperation, space collaboration -- that is expected to be among one of the topics that they discuss -- as well as artificial intelligence research initiatives. Now of course, even if they have a lot of common ground, there are always points of tension. And one of them has been the sale of U.S. steel to Japan. Now an official said that's not expected to be brought up very much. But it is just another example of where they may have some conflict or more to discuss on the economic front, Becky.",

You heard President Biden there talkabout the economic cooperation, the political cooperation and also thanking them for their work on defense policy. And that's important. Before the show, we didn't talk about this, but the experts I've talked to said that the war in Ukraine is expected to be at the forefront here. Of course, as Japan is just a very critical partner in the Indo-Pacific region, the conflicts abroad have been front and center. And especially the U.S. trying to reaffirm its leadership on the world stage, especially in a very tricky political moment here in the United States, where the U.S. is struggling to get that additional aid through Congress for Ukraine. And so this was something that, when I spoke to experts and officials ahead of this meeting, was really going to be a topic of discussion and one the president actually ticked through when he had his remarks there. And, of course, we know that they're going to talk about more than just that. And officials have previewed some of the deliverables that we anticipate when they head into that bilateral meeting after this ceremony, including, for example, again, that U.S. force structure in Japan as well as joint artificial intelligence initiatives and space collaboration. And, of course, another symbolic takeaway of all of this is those cherry blossom saplings here in Washington. There is work that is going to be done in the Tidal Basin that's going to lead to some of those cherry blossom trees having to be chopped down. And here, in a really symbolic gesture, Japan is going to offer more saplings.
