We know from polling that 54 percent of Americans want mass deportations. And - and based on the election, this is a mandate for Donald Trump. I think that there's been a great effort to demonize Stephen Miller, demonize Tom Homan, who's less familiar to the American people, but they're carrying out what is the president's agenda. I think on the foreign policy front, a lot of Republicans who are moderates, but also on the further right, are optimistic about Marco Rubio. He's been able to work with both sides but has been very hawkish, especially on Israel. So, it's not a good day to be a terrorist, that's for sure.",

We just didn't put forth policies, like family separation, that were designed to be cruel. That is what Donald Trump is showing, not just by endorsing a policy of mass deportations, but making Stephen Miller and Tom Homan, some of the first people that he actually announced. It was saying, we're going to lead with fear and cruelty rather than effectiveness.So, look, I think that you can find - Democrats could find common ground with Republicans in terms of policies that would actually crack down on, you know, illegal border crossings. But what they're not going to do is endorse policies that, again, are only meant to sort of, you know, to instill fear, to say that we're going to deport legal immigrants as well as illegal immigrants if they're part of the same family. They're not going to play into that fearmongering. So, the second that it sort of gets to that, I think you're going to see real Democratic opposition. BERMAN: I will say, the border crossings went down only at the end of the Biden administration when he implemented the executive order, after the bipartisan plan failed because Donald Trump, by and large, spiked it.",

And I think that would make sense. That's a way to make sure it's not taxpayer money. But it's also a way to make sure that Ukraine is not going to lose.

Here the Supreme Court has rejected Meadows' request to try to move his state-level criminal case in Georgia to federal court, where he had hoped to make some arguments related to immunity, to try to insulate himself from any criminal consequences.Now, the Supreme Court is rejecting this, so Meadows' case will go back to Georgia. Now, last year he was charged on racketeering and other charges tied to phone calls and meetings he had with President- elect Trump, in Trump's alleged efforts to subvert the 2020 election. Of course, Trump and 18 of his associates were charged in this sprawling RICO case brought by District Attorney Fani Willis. But the case is currently sort of in limbo as the judge overseeing this case contemplates whether Fani Willis should be disqualified because of her improper relationship with the special prosecutor who brought this case, Nathan Wade. Now, the judge will hear that case, the question of whether Fani Willis should be disqualified, on December 5th. And even if she is disqualified, it doesn't mean the case goes away, but it raises more questions about the viability of this prosecution when it comes to Trump's co-defendants. But when we're talking specifically about the president-elect, it is not expected that he will face trial in Georgia if this case survives while he is a sitting president. It is really the only one of his cases that will survive. But it's unclear if he'll ever face trial in Georgia. So, Mark Meadows, as of now, his case is going back to Georgia, and then we'll wait to see what the judge decides about whether Fani Willis will continue to oversee this case or if she will be disqualified. And the future of this case, for all of these defendants, really the ones who have not already entered pleas, Kate, still very uncertain.",

But I do think, you know, having covered Melania, that she is strictly used to adhere to protocol. That was sort of her thing was tradition and sort of respecting the values of the role and all its traditional aspects. So, it is fairly surprising that this is not a meeting that she wants to do or is jumping at. And listen, I also know, I covered Jill Biden too for a couple of years, I'm sure this was not an easy invitation for her to extend. But as you said, this is tradition. Now, typically, it's a former first lady showing the incoming first lady the ropes, and here's the East Wing, and here's how the staff works, et cetera. And, of course, Melania Trump has already done that and been there. So, there's not that need for it, if you will. But it is a sign to the rest of the country that things are healed, our democracy is moving forward. You know, if these two women can do it, so can anyone.

She invited Melania Trump to the White House. Melania went. They had their tea. Last time, last election, Melania Trump didn't invite Jill Biden because her husband had - was still contesting the actual presidential election, so she couldn't very well go around him and say, come on over and see the East Wing. But again, I think this is more Melania than Melania, you know, than most people would think. This is her personality. She is very protective of her husband.
