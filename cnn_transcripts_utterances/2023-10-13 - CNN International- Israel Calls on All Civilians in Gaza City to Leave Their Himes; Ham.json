Now we've spoken with a couple of IDF spokespeople already this morning, and this initial warning seemed to be suggesting the whole northern part of Gaza, so about 10 kilometers in the whole northern part. And then the spokesman seemed to be saying that actually it just applies to Gaza City. But even if it's not the full 1.1 million people that the United Nations says it is going to be effective, that has to evacuate south, it would still be around about 600,000 people -- the population of Gaza City. Which is almost a third of the entire population of the Gaza Strip, having to move south over the other side of Wadi Gaza and that to get out of harm's way. Because the IDF is saying clearly, you know, you we want, we don't -- we want to minimize civilian casualties, is what they're saying. So we want civilians to move out the way, and presumably once that happens, Israel's bombardment and the likelihood and the imminence of a ground invasion will draw now.",

And In terms of the Israeli hostages, we know that there are between 100 and 150 hostages being held by Hamas since they abducted them at the start of that attack on Saturday morning. Now, according to Hamas, they are now saying in the last few minutes that 13 hostages have been killed by Israel's own strikes on the Gaza Strip. Now we don't have independent verification of that clearly. And obviously, it's in Hamas's interests to either say, for psychological reasons or to imply that the deaths of these hostages is due to Israeli strikes. But that is what they are saying right now, and clearly this will add to the pain of the families of those people that have been abducted, who are just waiting for news on their loved ones.",

The IDF says that it will factor in to its calculations of strikes and the like, the fact that these people are going to be on the move.Now, I should also note that Hamas has said to residents of Gaza, don't pay any attention to what the Israelis are saying. Neither the statement nor, it seems, voice messages that have been voice notes that have been left on mobile phones of the residents of the Gaza Strip. One can only assume that residents will err on the side of caution and move to the south of where they are right now from Gaza City, in order to move out of harm's way and reduce the likelihood that they are added to those growing statistics of civilian casualties.",

Because there's been some cross communication about that.LT. COL. PETER LERNER, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES SPOKESPERSON: I'm not aware of any cross communication when I -- our announcement has been very clear that people in the north of the Gaza need to evacuate beyond the Nuseirat, the Gaza Wadi, for their own safety. The steps are in anticipation, like we ourselves evacuated the people from the southern communities, in the surrounding areas of the Gaza Strip. In order to keep people out of harms way, we're encouraging them to leave. And unfortunately what we have seen is Hamas is telling people, no stay and sacrifice yourself. The situation on the ground is as such, the military is expanding its operations in order to strike Hamas and prevent them from ever being able to attack us again. You know, we are still burying the people that were butchered by Hamas. There are about 200 burials, funerals a day and we are still burying them. And I can still say there are still bodies in the in the field itself, it means that we're having difficulty getting to because of the situation on the ground. So I would say, yes, people who have who care for their lives need to listen very carefully to what the IDF is saying.

The first and perhaps most important is as you said, as you asked Max for Peter Lerner to clarify, is it the northern part of the Gaza Strip or is it just Gaza City? As one of his colleagues had said earlier on CNN. And it's now clear that it is Gaza City residents. So we're talking around about 600,000 people. That's almost a third of the entire population of the Gaza Strip that the IDF is telling to evacuate in order to get out of harm's way. And so that they minimize the number of civilian casualties.Worth reiterating that Hamas has told residents of Gaza City to not pay any attention to these warnings or the warnings that they apparently are receiving on their mobile phones from the IDF to evacuate, to move out of harm's way. So that's the first thing. The second thing is, he said it may take longer. It may take longer than 24 hours. The clock started ticking at midnight local time. So we're talking 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time is when the clock started ticking. So it's supposed to expire at midnight tonight in Israel. It seems that there will be a little bit of wiggle room there, that there will be some flexibility as far as the Israelis go in allowing the people of Gaza City to vacate. And I suppose the other thing is that he stressed -- and this isn't something that was stressed earlier in the warning -- is that there will be no ceasefire. So although they said or his colleague said earlier, that they will factor into consideration that there are going to be large numbers of people evacuating Gaza City to get out of harms way. In other words, they're going to try and ensure that they are not targeted or not hit. At the same time, there will not be a ceasefire. Because according to Peter Lerner, the spokesperson for the IDF, they don't want to give Hamas militant a chance to regroup, to carry out further attacks. Whether it's rocket launches towards Israel or to do any other, you know, practice or any other attacks or planning any other attacks that they might be wanting to do?",

So, we came to stay with relatives here in Al-Shate, Nabil says. But the next morning, when we woke up to pray at dawn, the airstrike happened. There was no warning.
