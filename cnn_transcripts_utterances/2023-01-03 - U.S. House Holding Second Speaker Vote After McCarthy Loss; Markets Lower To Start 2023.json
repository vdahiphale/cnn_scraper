If you look at the Dow, we did have apocket of green in the morning, and then there was some economic numbers and other political factors and the market was down, slight recovery this afternoon, but it is all pretty miserable for the start of a rainy day in New York. The main events that is driving everything: Division and disarray in Washington. The U.S. Congress has failed to elect a Speaker on the initial ballot. It is the first time that's happened in a century. The FTX founder, Sam Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to fraud and conspiracy charges in a New York Court. And Shopify CEO is pulling the plug on its Reddit group meeting, and companies are likely to follow suit. We are live in New York, Tuesday, it is January 3rd. I'm Richard Quest, I mean business. Good evening. A once in a century defeat in the U.S. Congress is adding more uncertainty to the markets and puts the dysfunction of U.S. politics on full display. Right now, the House of Representatives is casting a second ballot to choose its Speaker. It is the first time since 1923 that the vote has not been resolved on the first go round. Republican Jim Jordan a short while ago took to the podium to nominate Kevin McCarthy, who was the Republican leading member of the House for the speakership. Now, this should have been a straightforward, here is the man, we've got the votes, elect him as Speaker. Jordan urged colleagues to come back to the party-fold and work together against the opposition, Democrat, policies. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): The differences between Joyce and Jordan or Biggs and Bacon, they pale in comparison to the differences between us and the left, which now unfortunately controls the other party. So, we had better -- we had better come together and fight for these key things, these three things. That's what the people want us to do, and I think Kevin McCarthy is the right guy to lead us. I really do, I wouldn't be standing up here giving this speech. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That is really the crux of the problem right now for Republicans. You have Jim Jordan, who went out there defending Kevin McCarthy, saying that he believed that Kevin McCarthy was the right guy for the job. And yet, what you have is members of the conservative Freedom Caucus voting around Jim Jordan who doesn't even want the job. It just shows you how quickly this has all devolved. We should also note that they can't move on to any other House business, Richard, until they have a Speaker. They can't have a rules package. They can't establish Committees. They can't ensure staff is paid until they have a Speaker of the House. So that shows you what a critical mess this is right now on the floor.",

They won the majority and they can't get out of the starting gate here. Failure to elect a Speaker means failure to get anything going, such as investigations or any legislation that you might want to move. The other problem with all this, as I see it, is that it really speaks to the fact that there is a handful of Republicans at the top rungs of this party who do not believe in majorities. The House is a majoritarian institution. Over 85 percent of Republicans in their conference want McCarthy, 51 percent of Americans want Republicans, Republicans won 222 seats. So you see the majorities here from McCarthy and his party, and there is like five to 20 people who think they and not the majority should rule the House, or at least plunge it into chaos.

But make no mistake, it really has been since Musk took over Twitter that Tesla's freefall has accelerated. Now, to be fair, Tesla is still posting strong levels of growth, 40 percent in growth for deliveries is phenomenal. It's just that growth is slowing, competition is increasing. Electric vehicles are no longer a niche market. All the major global auto manufacturers are getting into that market as well. So this is not a time for Elon Musk to be distracted.

The drop is due to one-off government energy subsidy informing energy prices. It's for that reason that economists are warning this downward trend may not last. Prices could go up again next month. With high inflation hitting economies around the world, the expectations of workers who is we could have more pay in their annual pay negotiations. \"The Wall Street Journal\" says that U.S. workers who stayed in their jobs, are now getting their best raises in decades. That is inflationary in its own right. Being driven by those switching jobs. You can see the yellow line, those have changed jobs, seeing wage gains of 7.7 percent. Those who stayed got 5.5 percent. Shouldn't be surprised, they were enticed with higher wages. But it's the biggest annual growth for a quarter of a century. And employers are prepared to offer bigger checks. Betsey Stevenson, the former U.S. Labor Department chief economist, now professor of public policy and economics at University of Michigan. Good to see you. This is fascinating. Two aspects; let's do the money side. First we have had this ongoing battle with governments and central banks saying, don't pay to much and workers saying, we need more money. BETSEY STEVENSON, FORMER U.S. LABOR DEPARTMENT CHIEF ECONOMIST: I think what you are hearing is central banks want to make sure that we are not seeing wage increases driving further inflation. Because then it won't be doing any good. I don't think governments and central banks are saying we don't want to see workers getting a better share of the pie but what they are saying is, we want to make sure that we don't see inflation starting to spiral through so everybody pays more for anything. That is kind of a mess. And what that can come from is, if you don't have enough workers, there are four businesses and there is only one worker available, getting a bidding war with each other, it's just inflationary.",

I do think if you lookaround the globe, what you see is very tight labor markets in a large number of countries. So the question then is, if businesses are trying to hire and there are workers available then what are they going to do? And what we don't want to see is them just outbidding each other, trying to hire the same set of workers. So hopefully, if these wage increases can entice some more people back into the labor market and can expand the number of people available for jobs, then that can be quite helpful. And if prices start coming down for other reasons, workers can catch up without necessarily triggering another set of inflationary increases.",

What we are seeing in particular in the U.S. is older workers not coming back. There may be some of that going on in other countries. We also know that immigration really slowed in a way that means that people are not working where they may have been working, if we hadn't had COVID-19. And so it could be a misallocation of workers around the globe. I think that process is still starting to unfold.

One of the things that probably helped cause inflation but also helped prevent a number ofcountries from going into recession already is the fact that people really cut back their spending in 2020 and even a bit in 2021, until they had built up a lot of savings. And what happened is late in 2021 and 2022, they started spending down that savings. But now, people are seeing the excess they accumulated is starting to disappear. And people are starting to cut back their spending even more. Cutting back spending will put downward pressure on prices. And what we want is for them to hit the sweet spot, which is cutting back spending enough that price increases slow without triggering a recession. This is delicate balance.
