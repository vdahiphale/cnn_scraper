There will not be people like John on Kelly around him to try and control his worst impulses. Instead, he would be able to be a Fascist, as his own chief of staff described.

In 2019, Republicans in the state of Georgia passed a repressive abortion ban that recently led to the death of Amber Thurman because her health care was criminalized by George Republicans.I think young people know what's at stake. And a, you know, woman born today in Georgia has less rights than a woman born before Donald Trump and Brian Kemp's repressive abortion ban. I think that's important. Also, I really appreciate Kamala Harris' message about an opportunity economy, allowing young people to buy a home, investing in small businesses and startups. And also, you know, I hope to be a parent someday. I am just 22, but I think it's very important that we invest in families and parenthood. And she is trying to make it easier -- easier for Americans to live that American dream by having a family buying a home and creating an opportunity that works for -- an opportunity economy that works for everybody, including the next-generation. Another big piece of that is climate change. Because if we don't fight back against climate change and build a greener economy, we're going to be dealing with the terrible effects of climate change in our everyday lives.

Times\" in 2018, stepped in and said they would not be publishing any endorsement. This, despite the fact that paper has endorsed in other races this year. It's just for president they weren't going to endorse. I want to read you part of her resignation letter that was obtained by the \"Columbia Journalism Review.\" She says, \"In these dangerous times, staying silent isn't just indifference. It is complicity. I'm standing up by stepping down from the editorial board. Please accept this as my formal resignation, effective immediately\". She also gave an interview to the \"Columbia Journalism Review,\" in which she said that they had spent several editorials talking about why former President Donald Trump is unfit, that he is dangerous. And so this editorial would not be coming out of left field. Now, we're getting an explanation from the owner, which I do want to post to show what he posted this online. He said, \"The editorial board was provided the opportunity to draft a factual analysis of all the positive and negative policies by each candidate during their tenures at the White House.\" And he also talked about how this could have the effect they have on the nation. In the next four years. He says, \"In this way, with this clear and non-partisan information side-by-side, our readers could decide who would be worthy of being president.\" Except, again, it's not like the editorial board had not been writing several editorials about these two candidates and what they would do in office. But now it's also turned into a Trump attack. Donald Trump has now used this in an email fundraiser for trying to say even her own California newspaper would not endorse her. And this is having further effects. We've heard now of subscribers canceling, including some celebrities. This is California. Mark Hamill himself has said he had canceled his subscription over this.",
