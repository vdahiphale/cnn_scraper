He will deliver the keynote address at the Conservative Political Action Conference just outside of Washington, D.C. Trump is joined by other Republicans eyeing the White House in 2024 but make no mistake the CPAC gathering has become MAGA country. And the man who tried to overturn the election results in 2020 appears to be his party's frontrunner according to recent polls. Let's discuss this with CNN's Kristen Holmes. She joins me now from CPAC. Kristen, what's the latest? What do you think we're going to hear from the former president in this address?",

And we're told that he's not going to go after Florida Governor Ron DeSantis by name but he is going to contrast some of his policies particularly when it comes to Social Security and Medicare.However, I do want to note, you are absolutely right. This event has become MAGA country. Everyone here is incredibly Trump focused. And even the branding around this event seems to be all about MAGA and all about Trump. That being said, that means that Trump is probably going to feed off of the audience here. I mean, it is a very receptive audience. And so we are already getting warnings from advisers that we're not exactly sure if he's going to end up riffing or not because of the fact that this is such a receptive audience. It's something to keep in touch -- to keep an eye on. Now the other thing I want to point out here is that this has really become a who's who of MAGA world. We saw Don Jr., Kimberly Guilfoyle. Almost every speaker here is somebody who supports Trump in to 2024, who wants him to be president again. Now we did hear from two other major potential 2024 contenders, Nikki Haley and Mike Pompeo. But both of their speeches really fell on to a kind of lackluster response. There was a tepid applause and even afterwards Haley was heckled outside of this room. So it goes to show you again just the deepening divide in the Republican Party and also the setting up of what is expected to be by many an incredibly ugly primary -- Jim.",

This room remained with lots of empty seats.It was actually out in the hallways where you saw this kind of Trump celebrity culture. People trying to take pictures with Steve Bannon or Matt Gaetz or Marjorie Taylor Greene. But for the speeches themselves, it has been a relatively smaller crowd. Today it does look as though they're going to fill this ballroom. There are already almost more seats that have been filled the entire time here. We also know there's a pre-reception with hundreds of people in it that will be coming here later. So again, they are expected to fill all of the seats here today which, as you said, is very important to the former president. It would be embarrassing given the way that this has become Trump- centric if he wasn't able to fill these seats and if he doesn't win that straw poll that they're expecting to announce soon.",

Sources say Trump is asking a federal court to block Pence's testimony on executive privilege grounds, and CNN's Jeremy Herb joins us now. Jeremy, we've seen this approach tried before.

It's a MAGA-palooza over there at the National Harbor convention area outside of Washington, D.C. What does this year's CPAC tell you about the state of the GOP? JOE WALSH (R), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You know, Jim, I know the temptation is to always laugh, right? Mike Lindell and Kari Lake, and Steve Bannon, and laugh at how crazy these people are at CPAC. But we shouldn't laugh. I mean, this is -- this is scary, and it's odd having to say this six to seven years after Donald Trump came on the scene, but America needs to wake up. What we're seeing at CPAC right now is the base. The base of one of America's two major political parties and it's fully radicalized. I mean, Jim, virtually every speaker lied and lied and lied. It's been two to three days of lies and disinformation, misinformation, cruelty. My god, you had Brazil's Bolsonaro spoke today about how his election was stolen.",

Look, there's no other lane in this party. Right now Trump and DeSantis are the only two people who measure inthe polls, but Jim, as you and I have discussed, all of DeSantis' support it is Trump's supporters who just kind of maybe think DeSantis can win a general election, but they're all Trump supporters.

Outside of what Mike Pence did the evening of January 6th, and let's be clear, Mike Pence who I served with and I like is no hero. He did his job on January 6th. Outside of that moment, Mike Pence and Donald Trump have been really tied at the hip on all of this stuff. Mike Pence has fought tooth and nail to avoid having to talk about January 6th, to avoid having to appear in front of the January 6th Committee, to avoid having to -- to run away from subpoenas and all the rest.Mike Pence was aware that this was not a stolen election before January 6th but he never said anything publicly.

We've talked about that for the last couple of weeks. This was also documented by health officials here. So all of this data basically now going to be taken by Ohio's Department of Health.

Could this investigation end with Santos leaving Congress? REP. ROBERT GARCIA (D-CA): I mean, it has to. I mean, at the end of the day there's evidence that George Santos is a fraud, he's a liar. This investigation is important, the House Ethics Committee of course. But he's got to do the right things. I mean, it's not just the House Ethics Committee that's looking at investigating him. You have federal and local prosecutors investigating him. You have the FEC looking into his challenges which is also why we have expulsion resolution in front of the Congress.

Hospitals lost a major supplier of the drug last week when a manufacturing plant suddenly shut down. Let's discuss what this means for patients out there with CNN medical analyst, Dr. Jonathan Reiner. Dr. Reiner, great to see you. Tell our viewers, in case they're not totally familiar with this, what does Albuterol do? DR. JONATHAN REINER, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST: Jim, Albuterol is an old drug. It was licensed by the FDA for use in the United States in 1982. Its's what's called a bronchodilator. It activates a receptor in the airways that allowed the airways to dilate. It's the primary drug used for acute exacerbations of asthma. And it comes in a couple different forms. It comes in inhalers that people can use at home. And it comes in a liquid form that is used in nebulizers when people are admitted to hospitals with serious asthma exacerbations. A nebulizer essentially a device to convert a liquid drug into a vapor that can be easily absorbed by the lining of the airways. The problem is that this drug, until recently, was manufactured by three companies in the United States. One of those companies was shut down basically for manufacturing issues. As you said, Akorn Pharmaceuticals, that was manufacturing Albuterol, shut down their Illinois plant after they declared bankruptcy. That was the plant that manufactured this agent. That leaves only one company in the United States to produce Albuterol. There are 25 million people in this country with asthma. There are about a million and a half E.R. visits every year for this very common issue. It kills 4,000 people a year. Almost all those deaths are preventable. This is a crucial drug. It sort of underscores the fragility of the U.S. generic drug pipeline.",

      "sentences": "Well, the problem right now is not for individual patients and consumers because the drug that is manufactured in inhalers is still readily available.The bigger problem is the liquid forms that hospitals need. And hospitals can and have hoarded these drugs. Hospital pharmacies are very resourceful now. Hospitals can create usable batches of this drug by compounding other forms of Albuterol. And another manufacturer has stated that they will begin to manufacture Albuterol, but it takes months to ramp up production and get the necessary approvals for the FDA so it's going to be a while. But, again, this underscores the fragility of our system. We saw, in 2020, when Covid hit the United States, two big countries that provide generic drugs around the world and to the United States, China and India, they stopped exporting crucial, old, but necessary generic drugs around be the world and we saw shortages of all kinds of things. This is going to continue until the U.S. really changes how we approach these drugs and we start to manufacture more in this country.",
