Apple announces a new iPhone built for artificial intelligence. Catherine, Duchess of Wales, announcing she has finished her chemotherapy and plans to gradually return to public life. And we are just over 24 hours away from the US presidential debate. Polls are showing a historically close race. Live from London. It is Monday, September 9th. I am Isa Soares, in for Richard Quest. And of course, I too mean business. Good evening, everyone. Tonight, Apple is banking on artificial intelligence to revitalize its rather sluggish iPhone sales. The company just unveiled the new iPhone 16 during an event in Silicon Valley. The iPhone is powered by chip designed to support Apple's new AI features. And here is a look of what the phone is supposed to do. Have a look at this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The problems being particularly acute in China, the world's biggest smartphone market. Apple has responded by aggressive civilly cutting prices there. Lance Ulanoff is editor-at-large of TechRadar and joins me now. Lance great to have you on the show. Look, lots of new tweaks, upgrades, the current models, airports, Apple Watch, but clearly the star of the show was this new iPhone 16 family. You were in the room. You were there. How exciting was the reveal? LANCE ULANOFF, EDITOR-AT-LARGE, TECHRADAR: Well, I literally just stepped out of the room, it is right behind me. It was exciting. There is a lot of cool new features. They are more powerful, yes, big focus on Apple Intelligence, although we don't get every feature that Apple Intelligence will bring, but the iPhone 16, the 16, the 16 plus, 16 pro, and pro max -- now all of these phones, one of the most interesting things to me is all of them have this new camera control button. And I honestly think it is going to change the way people take photographs with their iPhone. It says both press and haptic control, so it is really cool new feature that I think in some ways people get more use out of than some of the Apple Intelligence features which they are going to have to, you know, to have to search little bit for writing tools. Do they want to remove Aunt Mary from every photo with Cleanup? I don't know, but I think everybody takes photos with their iPhone. So they've got new finishes. They look good. They are actually bigger, the iPhone 16 pro and pro max, just slightly bigger -- bigger screens and they are more powerful, A18 pro chip on pro and max and A18 on the rest of them. So all got an upgrade and by the way, what that means is they all support Apple Intelligence.",

So, when you're writing the text and you're in there or you're writing the e-mails, you can select it and then you dig in and you find those tools. They are not that well surfaced on the dais yet, and I think maybe that is because they were just trying it out. On the photo front, obviously, yes, you can clean up photos quite easily. You will just go into edit. There is a new eraser tool and it is actually useful if you took what you think is a perfect shot and there is a distraction in the background, you don't even have to pick it out. It will find it for you and you'll tap and it will disappear. That is the thing. [16:05:09 ] It will also make memories with all the photos for you. Siri got a massive update. It even looks different. It works different. It has got more of those the features on your phone to be able to sort of tell it in a more kind of conversation away what you want.

So these systems all have an A18 chip, either A18 or A18 pro, what's called the three-nanometer process.

And I think in ad-tech, if you ask the brands that are engaging in that advertising space, how much, if you look at how much is being paid to Google and how much Google is made is making from ad-tech and how much it contributes to its bottom line and how difficult it is for anyone to compete in that market, I think you know, Google can perhaps rely on AI and the changing landscape to say, look we may be dominant today, but there is no guarantee that we will be dominant tomorrow.

The more than 350-page Republican report does include some new details, for example, on the negotiations that were going on between the U.S. and the Taliban about a power sharing agreement with the Afghan government. Those negotiations were led by Zalmay Khalilzad who was the Special Representative for Afghanistan who was appointed by President Trump's administration. However, the overall conclusion of the Trump or the -- excuse me, the Republican report, is that this was all on the decisions made under Joe Biden, not under President Donald Trump. Now this is not a surprise. We have seen a number of reports and other conclusions that are largely on party lines. The Republican report is very blistering of its condemnation of the Biden administration. And the Democrats say that it is a partisan and cherry- picked report, picking out facts over the course of this years long investigation, the Democrats are saying that this is down to the Trump administration decisions made under them to broker this agreement to begin with, with the Taliban that deal was called the Doha agreement. And they say if it were not for that, the Biden administration would not have had to choose to fulfill that full withdrawal that we saw there. So, a lot of accusations being traded back and forth, but not a lot of new information here.",

Now by the end of the decade, one in six people will be aged 60 or older, with more peopleliving longer, society will have to reconsider some of the ways it really operates. In the latest reading for succeeding Richard Quest explores the world of Self-Help and how we can create an age in society that is healthier as well as more productive. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RICHARD QUEST, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR (voice-over): The humble Self-Help book dates back in some form or other to ancient Egypt. Today, in modern times, Self-Help was brought into a new era with work like Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People. The personal growth industry has had no shortage of success. It's worth more than $10 billion in the U.S. alone in 2020. We all know books like Rich Dad, Poor Dad, The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, Think and Grow Rich and Self-Help has created its own celebrities, Tony Robbins, Deepak Chopra, Eckhart Tolle. The insight that they offer is greatly valued by many, but there's also a view that says it's all simply nonsense and that's what we're going to find out. Healthier, happier and more productive lives. What if getting older was not a challenge but an opportunity to be embraced? It's the premise of the longevity imperative. The latest book from the economist Andrew Scott, longer lives means society must reconsider the way we think about healthcare, relationships, the economy, finances, the lot. To do so, the way current governments are set up and think the policies they follow need to support a larger aging society. The idea of structured retirements, pensions, can they survive? Scott argues, these changes can help us live not just longer, but healthier, happier and more productive lives. ANDREW J. SCOTT, AUTHOR, THE LONGEVITY IMPERATIVE: We've really got to adapt to just the fact, for the first time ever, the young can now expect greater than 30 percent chance of living into a 10th decade, and we just haven't prepared ourselves to do that. We haven't got the individual behaviors, the social norms, the health work institutions that can make sure that we don't just live a long life, but we live a healthy and productive and engaged one.",

For me, I think what's I see happening is more and more people are working for longer, but what they're doing is that often-going part time as the last debate. So, for instance, in the 20th century, we sort of -- we decided that being old started at 65. That's a kind of bit of an arbitrary choice. And then as life expensive got longer and longer. We just took more and more years of leisure after retirement. I think what I'm seeing now is retirement is happening later. Every country around the world has an aging society. Birth rate's falling. People are living for longer. And I know, Richard, how you feel when I say the word aging society where no one says, yes, great, we've got an aging society. But it really is one of the greatest achievements in the 20th century. So, we've really got to think about this as time. Because, you know, if your day went from 24 hours to 32 hours, you'd say, great, I've got more time. And that is the mindset change that we have to do with longevity.",

So, I think one of the issues is we will sort of think about age chronologically, a number of years we've lived and sort of also veryimportant is how many more years you can expect to come. So just recognize that whatever your job is doing, you know, if you're sort of 30 or 40, given current work trends, you're probably going to be working to your late 60s or early 70s. In other words, you've got more work to do than you've done already. So, that requires thinking, wow, is this the path I carry on? What would I do next? You also, I think, got to think very hard, because obviously money is really important. If you're living a long life, you need more money. So, the only thing is, if you just work for longer, just to tackle the financial challenge, you've also got to think about your health, you've got to think about your relationships, you've got to think about your skills. And so, you've got to sort of think about a very broad portfolio of assets you start investing in. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
