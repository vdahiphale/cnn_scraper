      "sentences": "Happening now, breaking news, the House speaker, Mike Johnson, is scrambling to rescue his must pass government funding plan from very angry conservatives. And now Johnson's fight just got a lot more difficult with President-elect Donald Trump publicly trashing the bill.Plus, multiple sources now tell CNN the House Ethics Committee has secretly voted to release its investigation into former Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz. Stand by for a reaction to our new reporting and the response from Gaetz, who now admits to, quote, embarrassing behavior. Also tonight, some House Republicans are backing Donald Trump's calls to prosecute his political opponents, a new GOP report urging the FBI to launch a criminal probe into Liz Cheney for her role investigating the January 6th insurrection. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. We begin our coverage tonight with turmoil here in Washington. The House Speaker Mike Johnson's fight to avoid a government shutdown just hit a major snag as Donald Trump joined the conservative revolt against this funding bill. Our Chief Congressional Correspondent Manu Raju is up on Capitol Hill and CNN's Kristen Holmes has details on all of Trump's latest dramatic moves. Manu, we're awaiting an update, first of all, from the House Democratic leadership, but what's the latest on the Hill and is Speaker Johnson in trouble?",

      "sentences": "Yes. Trump's 11th hour demand, Wolf, has sent Washington scrambling. They would look like they were on a glide path to pass a bill to keep the government open past Friday up until March 14th. But in the 11th hour, Donald Trump has come out opposing the plan, bashing the deal that Mike Johnson cut with congressional leaders and contending that it should also include an increase to the national debt limit. Remember, the debt limit is an incredibly complex negotiation that typically takes months and months to resolve. Trump wants this off the table now. He says, why deal with it now when Joe Biden is in office, add it to what is Congress is dealing with and get it off their plate.He's also criticizing deals that Johnson cut in order to get Democratic support. Remember, in order to get this bill across the narrowly divided House, he needs Democratic votes. So, Democrats have their own demands. That's been all part of this complex negotiation that's been happening behind the scenes for weeks. But after Johnson as well as the other congressional leaders put this deal out on Wednesday night, it was roughly 1,500 pages, many lawmakers revolted, particularly on the right, arguing they did not have time to review the plan and people on the right were critical of Johnson's deal- cutting. So, where does this leave things now? Uncertain, Wolf. Democratic leaders have been huddling behind the scenes trying to figure out their strategy on how to proceed, whether to fight this or whether to try to cut a deal with the president-elect or with Speaker Johnson. That's why this moment right now will be critical. And we hear from Hakeem Jeffries and his Democratic leadership team, how do they plan to proceed? And how does the speaker of the House deal with this. On top of the all this on January 3rd is the day that he needs to be reelected speaker. He can't afford very few defections in order to become the next speaker of the House. Already at least one Republican member, Thomas Massey of Kentucky, told me that he will not vote for him come January 3rd, which is one big reason why, Wolf, that a lot of this is uncertain at this moment. How does Johnson navigate a position that Donald Trump has put him in against the wall? And how does he get the votes to avoid a shutdown? Huge questions at this moment in Washington, Wolf.",

But I think if you look at the standpoint for what President Trump is, is he feels that the C.R. is so loaded with so much pork, even more than enough pork to feed all of Iowa. That's a concern. And the debt ceiling is another concern. You know, President Trump is being strategic on how he wants the lame duck to sort of benefit his administration. Certainly dealing with the debt ceiling and dealing with, you know, a temporary spending in March becomes a challenge and he wants to weigh in. And Speaker Johnson is going to do whatever President Trump says. We've seen that at the time. The speaker always acquiesces to what the president wants to do, and that's where in this situation. So, he's breaking a deal, which is, let's get used to it. President Trump, if he doesn't like the deal, it's and he's not involved in the deal, it's not a deal. That's what we're doing now.",

There was a huge political fallout even as senators wanted to privately read this report. I'd also say that this Ethics report has basically been very consequential in ways beyond actually allegations at hand.
