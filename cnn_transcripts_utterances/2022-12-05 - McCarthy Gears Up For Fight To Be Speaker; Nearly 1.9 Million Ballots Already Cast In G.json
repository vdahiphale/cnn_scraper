However, if McCarthy can't get to 218, or if he does drop out, any number of Republicans are expected to jump into the race. And then in the other camp, you have McCarthy's allies and they are starting to get vocal and they are starting to push back. A group of moderate House Republicans wrote a letter to their colleagues last week, warning that if they have a messy floor fight, it's going to undermine them just as they're prepared to enter into power.David Joyce, an Ohio Republican told me, he refuses to let them handcuffed themselves to a burning building. And meanwhile, you have McCarthy's team, they are confident that at the end of the day, when the lights go on, on January 3rd, that enough of McCarthy's opposition will fold and that they will be able to get there, even if it takes multiple rounds of voting. So really, it is shaping up to be a game of chicken right now, John.",

KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), MINORITY LEADER: We will secure lifting that vaccine mandate on our military. And that's the first victory of having a Republican majority. And we'd like to have more of those victories and we should start moving those now. What I'm going to announce this week, is a new Select Committee on China, we're going to look at every single industry that China has leveraged in, we're going to start bringing the supply chain back from China to America.

This is slightly different from the case we heard four years ago brought by another Colorado individual, a baker who didn't want to serve a same sex couple with his cake.There were very specific facts in that case, John, and the justices ended up ruling for him narrowly. In this case, there are really no any -- no concrete facts yet. Laurie Smith, the website designer is challenging Colorado law before it's even been used against her. So that's why there were so many hypotheticals here, as we heard in the clip from Justice Sotomayor, various justices, mostly on the liberal side, were asking if the court rules for Laurie Smith here, what will it do for cases that are brought on the basis of disability discrimination, racial discrimination, national origin discrimination, other religious discrimination? And there are no clear answers at this point, because the law, we don't know exactly what the facts are. But we could really feel, John, I have to say the majority of the court is conservative.
