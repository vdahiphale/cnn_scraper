Key players in the region are stepping up efforts to prevent terrorist organizations from making gains after the fall of the Assad regime. At the same time, there's fighting underway between pro-Turkish and Kurdish factions in northern Syria.The Syrian Democratic forces, a coalition of militant groups dominated by Kurdish organizations, says Turkey and its militia allies are bombarding areas near the Turkish-Syrian border. The SDF also says there were two drone strikes in the city of Raqqa. A resident tells CNN that a U.S. military convoy was seen at the northern entrance of that city on Wednesday. The U.S. has worked with the SDF since 2017 to eliminate the remnants of ISIS, and has some 900 troops still stationed in northern Syria. Well, the Israeli military claims to have confiscated several Syrian tanks along that buffer zone that separates the Israeli occupied Golan Heights from the rest of Syria. The Israeli prime minister had ordered the military to seize the buffer zone, as Israel insists that it's working to eliminate threats to its security. Well, meantime, video has surfaced on social media, which allegedly shows a warehouse in Syria packed with illicit drugs Captagon. It reportedly is located at the headquarters of a military division near Damascus. If confirmed, the discovery would support claims that the Assad regime was involved in actively exporting that drug. Syrian rebel leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani says his team is working to secure possible chemical weapons sites, and promises to shut down all prisons operated by the Assad regime. Here's what he said about the future of the country. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ABU MOHAMMED AL-JOLANI, HAYAT TAHRIR AL-SHAM LEADER (through translator): We must give Damascus its right. We must give it its right by restoring people's dignity and pride and by building it properly. The opportunities are available to us and the people who have emigrated, who have sought asylum, who have been displaced, they must return. All these people must return so that hand in hand we can build the next Syria, God willing. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We know our students at Pepperdine have actually been in an opposite situation where they were ordered to stay in place, and that was for their safety and to make sure that emergency personnel were able to traverse the area and access some of those really hard to get to areas in the canyons that they need to access in order to truly fight this fire.So our law enforcement agencies are working in partnership with our firefighters on the front lines. We also have a community fire brigade, which was trained by the county fire department and other partners to work alongside the department in crisis situations like this. So we have members of the community who themselves are stepping up and putting themselves in harm's way to be supportive of this effort.",

Right now, the focus is on making sure that we get the fire contained and that the area is safe, and even after the fire is mostly extinguished, there are teams that go in to sort of survey the land and make sure that some of those lingering embers are also put out.And I saw firsthand today some of those teams who are doing that excruciating work. And so while it looks like in some of those areas the fires are out, they're doing that work just to double check and make sure all community areas are safe. So we will get people back in their homes as quickly as we possibly can. I'm proud to say that it looks like right around 15 structures have been impacted so far, and for a fire of this magnitude, we're really lucky that the circumstances haven't been worse so far. I'm really proud of those who have been on the front lines. They are second to none and I really thank them and the community members who have supported them.",

He made the announcement Wednesday at a town hall in Washington, calling it, quote, \"the best way to avoid dragging the bureau deeper into the fray.\" A clear reference to the shake-up that's expected when President-elect Donald Trump takes office. The move seemingly clears the way for Trump to install Kash Patel as the new director. Patel has been on Capitol Hill this week, looking to drum up support for his nomination, and says he'll be ready on day one to fill the post. Some in Washington have expressed concerns over what Patel would mean for the FBI's future, but Trump's allies in the Senate are showing their support. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. KEVIN CRAMER (R-ND): I'm glad he did it, to be honest, because clearly, when it comes to his relationship with Donald Trump, it was tainted by the fact that he authorized the FBI to raid his home. And to think somehow, he could, you know, survive that and maintain his job while Donald Trump becomes president would have been untenable. So, I'm glad he did it before he got fired. SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO): This FBI director activated the FBI against parents who went to school board meetings. I mean, he's the worst FBI director in American history. He should go. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
