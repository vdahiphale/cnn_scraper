      "sentences": "The hospitalization rate is higher than it's been in more than a decade.The good news, though, the head of the CDC says this year's flu vaccine is a quote, \"very good match\" to the circulating strains of the virus. But people just aren't getting the shot like they usually do. CNN's senior medical correspondent, Elizabeth Cohen, is with us now. Elizabeth, given that it is a good match, how much does it protect you if you do get the shot? DR. ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: You know, the flu shot, when it's well-matched, works really so well, Ana. As a matter of fact, it works quite well even when it's sort of a bad year, when the match is OK but not great like it is this year. Let's take a look at some CDC statistics. And these are looking at a whole bunch of years. So this is, you know, good year, bad year, sort of everything put together and see how effective it is. Folks who got the shots, adults, it reduced their chance of being admitted to the ICU with flu by 82 percent, 82 percent. Imagine that, keeping yourself out of the ICU by getting a flu shot is amazing. Also reduces the risk of your child dying from the flu by 65 percent. Healthy children do get the flu and giving your child the flu shot reduces their chance of ending up dying by 65 percent. That's pretty amazing. But unfortunately, people haven't been getting them as they have in the past. Pregnant women, down 25 percent from 2021. For seniors, those flu vaccination rates are down 17 percent. So important to get a flu shot. Ana, one thing I hear all the time is, wait a minute, I got a flu shot and got the flu. Yes, you got the flu but you didn't die of the flu, right? So the flu shot doesn't necessarily keep you from getting the flu. I mean, it might, but it might not. But what it really does is keeps you out of the hospital and out of the morgue and thank goodness for that -- Ana?",

There have been all these different theories, like we're more inside so we're more with other people and that probably is true.But this is such an interesting study by researchers at Harvard Medical School. What they did is they looked at cells in our nostrils. Those cells in our nostrils are highly specialized cells. Their job is to be the first line of defense when germs enter. What they did was they dropped the temperature by just nine degrees and they found that the presence of those cells went down by nearly 50 percent. So in other words, the colder it gets, the worst those cells work, why it's so important to get the flu shot I talked about.",

The sporting goods giant has officially cut ties with the Brooklyn Nets star over that anti-Semitic Twitter post a few weeks ago. Nike did suspend its relationship with him more than a month ago. In response, Kyrie Irving tweeted, \"Anyone who spent their hard-earned money on anything I have released, I consider you family and we are forever connected. It's time to show how powerful we are as a community.\" Joining us now is L.Z. Granderson, op-ed columnist for the \"Los Angeles Times.\" Good to see you, L.Z. The timing of this seems odd. Irving just returned to play. It seemed like this controversy had largely been put behind him. Now this move by Nike. What do you make of the timing? Doesn't it seem maybe a little late? L.Z. GRANDERSON, OP-ED COLUMNIST, \"THE LOS ANGELES TIMES\": Well, I don't know if it's late. You know, Nike has a lot of things to consider. I know a lot of people think that we look at how they handled Colin Kaepernick and seemed to have been more instantaneous to bring him into the fold but I like to compare Irving to Tiger Woods. Nike didn't dump Tiger Woods. Nike didn't -- stuck by him and didn't when AT&amp;T didn't. And they could have dumped him but chose not to. But they chose to dump Kyrie in his prime. They sent a significant message not just in terms of future athletes an how he handle social media but the business in terms of sportswear goes forward.",

He will be the next head coach at the University of Colorado.He's facing criticism of this -- about this because he's leaving an HBCU, historically black colleges and universities, where he's had great success. And \"Deadspin\" writer, among the critics, Carron Phillips, wrote this: \"Sanders didn't care about making HBCUs better. He cared about making the one that paid him better until he could parlay that into a better opportunity for him and his sons at PWI,\" which stands for predominantly white institutions. Full disclosure, L.Z. My family is from Colorado. My dad, brother are alumni at C.U. But I'm a grad of the rival school in the PAC-12 conference. How do you see this move?

What Deion did was leverage his stardom to leapfrog over the process of getting hired as a head coach.And we all know about discrepancy of getting hired at the collegiate level with black men in the NFL, in college and high school, whatever those stats happen to be. So he used an HBCU to position himself to leapfrog that process. He could have gone to a PWI or to a community college and done the same thing because he's that popular of a figure or brought cameras to wherever he wanted to be and leapfrogged that way. To do it with a HBCU stains, and that's what the criticism comes from, who he did it to.",

The way it was described was it can be binary. There are some people who may not smell good, period. And this can help with that. But for the most part, you're attracted to certain senses because of the person who smells like that. So the chicken and egg kind of question.
