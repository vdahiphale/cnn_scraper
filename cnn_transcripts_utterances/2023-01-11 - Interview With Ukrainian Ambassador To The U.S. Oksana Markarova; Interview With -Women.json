Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. During this long winter of war in Ukraine, in the eastern town of Soledar near Bakhmut, every inch of land is contested. Russian mercenaries in the Wagner Group claim that they've conquered the entire territory. But Ukraine says, they have been unsuccessful. While the Kremlin is playing musical chairs with its battlefield commanders naming its most senior general, Valery Gerasimov to replace Surovikin after just three months. The United States and its allies are, \"Positioning Ukraine to be able to move forward and retake territory\", that is according to a senior Pentagon official. And another says, the upgrade in weapons they are providing gives Ukraine, \"A much more powerful offensive capability\". But still, both sides do rely heavily on Soviet era artillery as we hear now from Correspondent Ben Wedeman, who is with Ukrainian troops on the eastern front. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover):  Commander Maksimiliam or just Max as he is known is finalizing the coordinates for a strike on the Russian occupied town of Kreminna. Before the war, Max was an English teacher. His 43rd artillery brigade has already seen action in the battles of Kyiv, Kharkiv, and now Donbas. Their target today, a building in Kreminna from where, he says, attack drones are launched against Ukrainian forces. This artillery system is known as a Pion, that's a Soviet era artillery system, 203 millimeters. The rounds weigh 100 kilos, 220 pounds. This is a system used both by the Russians and the Ukrainians. The cold here chills to the bone. Making this work all the more difficult. To protect against Russian drones, they have deployed a special weapon that depletes drone batteries. First the round goes into the barrel, then the cordite, and the trigger cord is pulled. Sending the massive round hurtling towards its target 18 kilometers, around 11 miles away. It fires again, and again. A forward spotter radios Max that the target has been hit. He tells his men to use shrapnel rounds to finish the job. MAKSIMILIAM, 43RD UKRAINIAN ARTILLERY BRIGADE:  We damaged it. We destroyed the building where they hide. And I suppose they will not make problems for us in the future. WEDEMAN (voiceover):  A small victory in a big war. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, we would like -- and President Zelenskyy has been very clear about it, that we would like to liberate our territory as soon as possible because peoples' lives depend on it. On the other hand, you know, President Zelenskyy is the chief commander, and our commander Zaluzhnyi, and all of our brave defenders are not only doing everything possible to liberate it but do in -- do it in a very efficient way in trying to save our military but also civilians. So, we trust them on how they do it. And we know that when they say that they are heavy fighting in Soledar and Bakhmut and everywhere, we know this is what it is. And Russians already lied before so many times. And they have already claimed victory by surrounding Kyiv and by not leaving Kherson and so many others. So, again, whatever they say and regardless of how difficult it is, we will continue liberating our land. And it's just a matter of time and effort on our part. And it's all 40 million of Ukrainians who are helping our brave defenders on that when Ukrainian flags will be everywhere. So, our heart goes to everyone who defend in Soledar and Bakhmut right now.

The defense department is going to open cinemas to, you know, heard people in and show them the glories of the troops on the ground in Ukraine.

The invading troop on our territory. They have lost so much equipment. And you are right, it is not only the losses on the battlefield. They are losing internally, as well, from the sanctions and from all the policy that the civilized world is applying to them because of their aggressive actions. So, they have to start explaining it somehow to their people. On the other hand, they do have problem with mining and they do have problem with the weapons. So, they have to put their own on the war footing if they are to continue this. Now, we really hope that with the resolve on our part and with the true information that they should be receiving, and with the additional capabilities that we are getting. That, at some point, they have to realize they cannot win it. They have to face the reality. They have to stop the brutal war of aggression. And they have to start discussing, you know, how they will actually participate in providing justice and be accountable for what they've done.

So, everything from their oil caps to their -- all their decisions and sanctions that have been taken to actually storing sufficient numbers of gas, and this is where the Transatlantic community really generated good results. Where Putin tried, of course, to use the energy as weapons. He actually physically destroyed more than 50 percent of the energy infrastructure in Ukraine. And yet, we, together, were able not only to pull the resources together to help Ukraine, even though it's very difficult in Ukraine. I just came back from Ukraine, I mean, it's very cold. And without electricity and without water, because when you don't have electricity, it's very difficult. But, you know, we are much stronger when we acknowledged that Russia is a source of risk and when we get ourselves prepared. And I'm very glad that all the calculations of Mr. Putin and his team did not work this winter. We still have a big part of the winter to go through. But we already are talking about the next winter.

Yes, there is one male, but it's entirely women. What we're you -- what was your goal in making this film that way. SARAH POLLEY, WRITER AND DIRECTOR, \"WOMEN TALING\":  I fell in love with the novel by Miriam Toews, \"Women Talking\" when it came out. It just raised so many essential questions about what kind of world we want to build as opposed to only what we want to destroy. I think we've done a lot of identifying harms in the last several years which has been an extremely important process. But what I loved about what she was doing in this novel was opening up a really rich group of democratic discussion about what we want to build. And there was such hope in that.

I came into the league asa wide receiver, just wanted to catch passes and get the glory and score touchdowns. And, you know, I did that in college. And then I got to the NFL. And you realize that there is a bunch of other dudes who have the same plan. And so, you have to kind of fall in and do what's asked of you and after a couple years as a receiver, I was asked to put on some weight and play tight end, which is a much more physical position. You're down next to the offensive lineman. Your hand is in the dirt. You're blocking those really large human beings who are really good at their jobs. But also, I got to catch passes as well. But I was a core special teams' member as well. So, that meant I was on kickoff, kickoff return, punt, punt, return. But that switch from wide receiver to tight end made me a little more intimate with the physicality of the game. Because you're down there with those big bodies and you're hitting almost every single play. So, I had my share of injuries. And I -- when I stopped playing, I wanted to write about the reality of the NFL. I love football, I always, and I still do.

It's about equal, inflicting pain and absorbing it. And from a very early age, I didn't start playing football until I was in high school. My parents wouldn't let me. I wanted to at an early age but they knew it was dangerous. And so, they told me that I can't play until I'm in high school. They were hoping that I would lose interest in that. I didn't. As soon as I got to high school, I signed up. And got out there and put on a helmet and put on shoulder pads. I have been playing at the park with my friends. I have been playing in the street with my friends, watching every single game that came on. But there's nothing like the visceral reality of putting on a helmet, putting on shoulder pads, and running full speed into another human being. That's really what it is. And on day one of football practice, I realized that the sport was a lot different than what I had thought, consuming on television and playing on the street with my friends. Hard plastic and metal, sinking into your supple flesh and bone, day after day after day. The pain is constant and it becomes a badge of honor. It's about who can endure the most pain. The more pain you can take, the tougher and the more you are celebrated. And so, that becomes ingrained in football players at an early age. And then the inflicting part of it, you know, when you're desensitized to your own pain, you're not thinking about your own. I'm certainly not thinking about the pain of my opponent. So, when I hit somebody really, really hard, I'm not worried about how much that hurts him. I'm -- I feel good that I'm doing that part of it as well.",

And the fact that we see the guys just pop up from these huge hits, we call them routine football hits, it desensitizes us, the audience, to what those guys are really going through, the physicality of what they are doing. But when you're down there on the field level, watching these guys, how quickly they move, how big the collisions are. The equipment that some people think, you know, Europeans when they talk about football, they say, oh, you guys are wimpy because you have to wear this armor over you. Well, that armor becomes your most dangerous weapon on a football field. I have a hard helmet on my head. I know the best way to bring down a larger man is to use that armor and hit him with it. So, that becomes a weapon. And so, it is a surprising to me that more stuff like this doesn't happen. I have been on the field in 2007, for example, we played a game in Buffalo. Kevin Everett was a player for the Buffalo Bills who was covering a kickoff. Had to routine tackle. Put his head down and he broke his neck. He was motionless on the football field for 15 or 20 minutes. You can't hear a pin drop in the stadium. They brought the ambulance out. Stabilized his neck. Got him in the ambulance, and they drove off. And no sooner was the ambulance out of sight in the tunnel, then that murmur started again in the crowd, that anticipatory football crowd murmur, they were ready for the action again. And sure enough, the whistle blows, and you're right back at it. So, I think that's what was unusual about the game we saw last week, was they actually stopped the play because of the reaction of the teammates. You saw those guys circling their teammate who was, you know, they were administering CPR on this guy. And they couldn't control their emotions. They were sobbing on a football field, which to me, was the biggest surprise because when I go out there on the football field, I believe I'm superman. There's nothing that can penetrate my aim day armor. And not even the injury of a teammate and the things I've seen. You still snap back into it and play football. That was a terrifying scene because of the way his teammates reacted. And the two coaches rightly said, hey, we're not going to go out there and play the game. The game is over. So, maybe that means we're evolving. You know, maybe that means we are learning.",

They have a sound guy on the sideline with a big old satellite mic pointed at those coalitions to get those pieces of sound involved in the broadcast because that's what people come for. Those big hits. But there's also the acts of poetic movement. The ballet out there. The piece that you find in the chaos out there. And there is a value in enduring pain. In getting through something you don't think you'll be able to get through. It's violent, but I push myself through it and there is triumphant and glory on the other side of it. There are other sports that dance on that razor's edge like football does. I found a lot of value in enduring that pain and pushing myself to that distance. And, you know, I endured and saw a lot of pain on the football field. No pain was as great as the pain I felt when it was over for good for me and I saw the game moving on without me. It was in my blood. There was no amount of pain or injury I wouldn't endure to try to chase this football glory. Because the glory exists on the other side of that pain.

They started this heads-up tackling initiative a few years back to deal with the specific problem. Concussions, for a while, we're more on the forefront of peoples' minds when considering the sport. It actually has kind of dissipated. You don't hear as much talk about CTE anymore as when that was first discovered because of the concussion protocol. But I think some parents are still reticent of it and rightly so. Not every kid should be playing football. When people ask if I'm going to let my son play football, and he's three years old, I say, I don't know. I don't know what kind of athlete he'll be. I don't know if he'll be cut out for it. And I think sometimes, the popularity of football and the popularity of the NFL makes it seem like every little kid's should be playing football. Every little kid should not be playing football. I remember being in freshman year in high school and there were some kids out there that should not have been out there. They're -- not only where their bodies not developed and they're practicing against whose kids are developed. But they just don't have the physical tools to withstand those types of hits. But I think, ultimately, the kids who are cut out for it. The kids who do have that aggressive type of athleticism, that mentality, their bodies are built for it, I don't see a problem with letting them play football in high school. Allowing them to go out and play the game they love and follow their dreams as long as the medical attention they receive after an injury is sufficient. That's the most important thing to me. If a kid gets a concussion and it's clear, don't let him back on the field. Take his helmet away. Don't get swept up in the tornado of emotions on the football field that make you think like the only thing that matters here is winning this football game. It's the livelihood that all these guys are involved in and invested in. And so, when a player tells you, I'm fine. I can go. And you look in his eyes and you believe because you want to win this game, you send him back out there against his best interest and that's when the real problems come. Not the first concussion, but the one you get five days later. The one you get two weeks after that. That's what we need to protect these guys from.",

You have to work hard and do things the right way, and the results show up on the field. If you let up just a little inch for one millimeter of a second, you lose. The play doesn't work. You lose the game. It requires everyone going all out the entire time. The cooperation it requires from that many people, 53 guys on a team. Plus, like, 15 to 20 coaches. All those guys working together to accomplish one goal. I think that's what a value much about it. The life lessons persevering, not dwelling on your mistakes, believing in yourself, trusting the guys around you. Being part of a team. That stuff is virtuous and has a role in the outside world.
