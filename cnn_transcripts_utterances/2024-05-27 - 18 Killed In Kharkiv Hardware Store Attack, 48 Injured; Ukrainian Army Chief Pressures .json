      "sentences": "Yes, Boris, that death toll from Kharkiv, a staggering blast there. Ukrainian officials saying they found another unexploded Russian glide bombs nearby.The death toll rising to 18. Nearly 50 injured. The smoke billowing out across Ukraine's second city. But today, a fascinating development in terms of what Ukraine's army chief has been saying about the possibility of French military trainers. Now we've been hearing for weeks how Ukraine's experience guaranteeing a manpower crisis on his front lines? Yes, after years now of war with the Russian who have a far larger population. And Ukraine is really struggling it seems, its ranks at the speed that it necessarily needs. And part of speeding that up would be to get training for their troops done more efficiently here inside of Ukraine. Now they appear to have seized upon a willingness shown in the past weeks, potentially, from France's President Emmanuel Macron. He was the first Western leader to talk about the possibility, in extremis, of France sending troops on the ground here in Ukraine. And a previous meeting back in February, according to Ukrainian defense officials, the idea of trainers being sent by France here was floated. Now, Ukraine's military chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, has said he's been signing essentially internal paperwork, getting the documentation ready inside of Ukraine to potentially receive French military trainers. Now, we ask the French about that. They didn't take the opportunity to say this simply isn't happening. They said they were discussing this and what the needs of Ukraine were, something, they say, that's been mentioned multiple times before. So we've gone now, remarkably, Boris, for -- I don't know, cast your mind back 18 months ago -- from small arms anti-tank weapons being sent to Ukraine by the West than tanks, now F-16s, and now the possibility growing or certainly spoken about more frequently of NATO troops on the ground here. And that'll be a phenomenal escalation if, indeed, it does happen. I should point out that Paris has not openly said no to this Ukrainian idea. We know how urgently Ukraine, indeed, needs it. And in fact, too, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy gainsaying another European ally, Spain, today, visiting Madrid, being told of a billion-worth of anti-air defenses and other weaponry that they would, indeed, end up receiving from the Spanish. This is a trip that he had delayed after the Russian push north of Kharkiv, a new Russian offensive. He stayed around to try and be sure that was under control. Everywhere we look, the news for Ukraine, frankly, bad on the battlefield. Yes, they're seeing some areas, the Russian advance slow. But in other areas, it, indeed, speeds up. And the West now increasingly called upon to variegate the kind of aid it's bringing. And the idea of French military trainers being here unspeakable, unthinkable just a possibly six months ago, now being something Ukraine says it's readying documentation for. However, much is designed to pressure Emmanuel Macron into bringing this to fruition, where it just continually increases the debate about how involved NATO is going to be in this war in the end. It's a lot more than it ever thought it would be when Russia invaded over two years ago now. Just to startling sign, frankly, of how long this is going on for and how more it's dragging the West in -- Boris?",
