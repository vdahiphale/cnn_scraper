Last night, in a stunning decision, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled the former president is not eligible to be a presidential candidate in 2024 because he, quote, \"engaged in insurrection,\" citing the 14th Amendment. The majority opinion came to the conclusion that Trump not only incited but had, quote, \"direct participation\" in the events on January 6. But Donald Trump obviously not backing down. His team is promising to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.

      "sentences": "Hey, Sara, good morning. This was a historic ruling and a historic moment for our country in so many ways. But as you mentioned, it won't be the final word, as the U.S. Supreme Court looms over all of this. But let's look at that decision from the Colorado Supreme Court. Remember, this is all about the 14th Amendment, which was ratified after the Civil War, it says that anyone who swears an oath to the Constitution and then breaks that oath and violates the Constitution by engaging in an insurrection, you can't go back to serving the public, you are disqualified. And the Colorado Supreme Court, the majority and a four to three decision said that that is exactly what Donald Trump did. He engaged in insurrection, and now he is ineligible to run again for president. Let me read for you a quote from the majority opinion that carried the day in Colorado. The justices wrote that President \"Trump did not merely incite the insurrection. Even when the siege on the Capitol was fully underway, he continued to support it by repeatedly demanding that might Vice President Mike Pence refuse to perform his constitutional duty, and by calling senators to persuade them to stop the counting of electoral votes.These actions constituted overt, voluntary and direct participation in the insurrection.\" Because he participated in the insurrection he is disqualified from office. That was the majority. But Sara, there was also a dissent. It was a four to three opinion. And they took some issues with several of the rationales put forward to remove Trump from the ballot. Let me read for you one of the dissenting opinions. This one said that \"In the absence of an insurrection related conviction, I would hold that a request to disqualify a candidate under Section Three is not a proper cause of action.\" It's true that Trump has not been charged with the crime of insurrection. He's facing other charges in the federal election subversion case, but he wasn't charged with insurrection. And according to this justice, and according to a lot of people on the Trump side, without that type of charge, you can't be disqualified. Ultimately, it will be up to the U.S. Supreme Court to hash this all out. Sara.",

He had this to say about that Colorado ruling. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think the U.S. Supreme Court is going to reverse that. But here's the larger thing of what the left in the media and the Democrats are doing, they're doing all this stuff to basically solidify support and the primary for him, get him into the general and the whole general election is going to be all this legal stuff. And look, it's unfair. They're abusing power, 100 percent. But the question is, is that going to work?

So as much as this campaign is being sort of litigated on the campaign trail, significant decisions are being made in the courtroom as well. So all of the rivals are defending Donald Trump saying voters should make these decisions.But the biggest probably takeaway of all is that Donald Trump once again, benefits from all of this now just 26 days before voters start laying into this race.

Do you consider anything short of a win in Iowa a victory for Ron DeSantis there? REP. CHIP ROY (R-TX): Well, I'm not looking through that lens, all right.

And you know, Iowans take this very seriously, right? They know that polls aren't going to decide who the president is going to be, they get to decide. All roads to the White House lead through Iowa. Iowans are convicted. And when they sit down and they meet with Governor DeSantis, they see a leader who has delivered. He is time and time again proven that he will do what he said he would do. And he's done it on serious conservative principles, right? This is a time right now where people in Iowa want strong conservative leadership to push back on what we're seeing out of Biden with wide open borders, rampant inflation, and economy teetering, you know, worldwide, all sorts of instability with respect to what's going on in Israel in the Middle East and Russia and Ukraine. We need leadership right now that sorely lacking, but we need conservative leadership.

I don't think it's unconstitutional. I think it's harassing the former president in ways that are completely inappropriate.But here's the key issue. My point is, it wasn't really to say that you don't -- you shouldn't, you know, cover the question, it's to say this, the people in Iowa that I'm talking to, they're not talking about the Colorado Supreme Court, other than the extent to which it's about all we're focusing on are those questions about the former president. We're not focusing on inflation. We're not focusing on how we're going to end the internal combustion engine in Iowa right now. Will that's going to impact Iowans, Texans, because this administration is going to move us to a fleet of electric vehicles, which will destroy the internal combustion engine, which drives up the price to goods and services for every American, drives up inflation is harming hardworking families. Let's stop that. Governor DeSantis would stop that. That's what Iowans are talking about. They care about their food bills, their electricity bills, having the ability to get a car they can afford, a house they can afford, interest rates coming down, a border being secure. They don't want to be talking about legal rulings because of the focus on the past issues with the president.",
