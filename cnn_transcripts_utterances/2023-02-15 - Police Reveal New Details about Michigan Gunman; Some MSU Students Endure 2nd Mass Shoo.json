She's on both sides of the fence on -- when it comes to election deniers. She said -- she didn't really challenge Trump's election denialism. But she did support election deniers, right?

And what's key about this is they want to override that sacred right of attorney-client privilege, after they say Corcoran already appeared before a grand jury for about four hours, where he did not answer some questions, citing attorney-client privilege. We've been reporting this. I've been reporting this with CNN's Justice Department team, including none other than senior crime and justice reporter Katelyn Polantz. We're back on the Kaitlan-Katelyn reporting. But Katelyn, can we talk about why this is such a big deal?

Alina Habba, she's actually the chief lawyer leading Trump's defense in a civil case opposite -- or the Trump family and the Trump business, their defense, in a civil case opposite the attorney general in New York.

One thing that you heard from Republicans and Democrats coming out of the briefing yesterday was not their concern about these objects being shot out of the sky specifically and that being a threat to the U.S. But they did argue a lot of them remember the Cold War. A lot of them remember a long battle with Russia over the last several decades. And their concern is they could be entering into that same sort of posture with China.
