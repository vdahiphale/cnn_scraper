And, you know, we need to have a conversation about what level of threats we're going to take so seriously that we remove a 14-year-old from school and maybe put them in a juvenile facility because up until the day of the shooting, it's only a threat and a lot of these threats are not taken seriously. But I think that it's a multiple-tiered solution, I think you have to have less access to those weapons. You have to have more accountability to anyone that allows access to those weapons to children like this who are troubled. And you need to have better monitoring procedures in place at schools when a kid is identified as somebody who made a threat. What are we doing to monitor that kid and his behavior?

This was a few months before the war. He said the war is coming. And secondly, he said that the world should stop looking at Ukraine through the prism of Russia. In other words, too much is calculated on Russia's ration in terms of what's going to happen to Ukraine. But I don't see as strong as replacement coming.
