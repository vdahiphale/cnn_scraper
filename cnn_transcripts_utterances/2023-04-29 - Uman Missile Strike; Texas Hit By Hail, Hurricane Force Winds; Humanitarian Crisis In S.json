We do understand that, as of this morning, search and rescue operations were still underway, Kim.There was believed to be two children, a young boy and a young girl trapped under the rubble of that home. Again, this is a strike that happened in the early hours of the morning. So families would have been sleeping. And the United States has been quick to react to that. A tweet from the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget Brink, she said, \"More lives tragically lost as Russia's missiles hit another apartment building. Russia still hasn't learned its brutality only enforces Ukraine's resolve and deepens our commitment to support them in the fight.\" I want to also bring you a few more updates, Kim, across the region. I want to take you to the latest updates on the spring offensive as well. This is something that's been anticipated for months that, as the weather warms, Ukraine will ramp up its push along the eastern front line. Of course, Russia is expected to ramp up its attacks as well. But an update from Ukraine's defense minister saying that the preparations for that counteroffensive are coming to a close. He said -- and I'm sort of paraphrasing his quote here -- but, as long as God wills it, the weather allows and commanders give the go-ahead, we will carry out this spring offensive. It's important to note just the pouring of weapons that have come from NATO allies in recent weeks and months. There's been this lightning speed preparation to prepare Ukrainian soldiers, to train them on this new weapon, particularly tanks. NATO says 98 percent of tanks promised by NATO allies have made their way to Ukraine. So signs there from Ukraine's defense minister that those preparations, that training is nearing an end. I want to finally bring you an update from Crimea, Russian occupied Crimea. We have images to show you from the port city of Sevastopol. There, a fuel tanker is on fire. That fire has spread across 1,000 square kilometers. Russian-backed officials on the ground say initial reports indicate it could have been a drone attack. Now we know in the past, Ukraine has used drones in covert operations on Russian territory and inside Russian-occupied regions. Now Ukraine has time and time again denied this. And it's unclear what's taken place in this specific attack. But yet again something to keep our eye on. There is no update yet on casualties -- Kim.",

We're awaiting one ship expected to dock here in 30 minutes, bringing more people trying to escape the conflict in Saudi Arabia. This is what is called a small warship, part of the fleet of the Saudi Royal Naval Forces, involved in the operation to evacuate as many people as possible out of Sudan. Saudi Arabia is a key diplomatic player in the country. It's part of what's called the Quad, the U.S., the U.K. and the United Arab Emirates. This is on the military side of the Jeddah port, the commercial side. And you see the other ships in the fleet of the Saudi Naval Forces carrying out this operation constantly. They've been coming back and forth in Port Sudan and Jeddah across the Red Sea. The reason maybe Jeddah is an important part of the evacuation operation, it's the closest major port from Port Sudan under the Red Sea that people can take across here, especially for people who didn't have initially evacuation efforts on the nations, such as the United States. The United States evacuated diplomatic staff at the Khartoum embassy. But private citizens were told it's too dangerous to coordinate an evacuation of private U.S. citizens.

The Sudanese diaspora and our friends have come together to fund an evacuation process that should have been done by an international NGO or at a country level. It is now completely being funded by individuals like myself. And we came -- we honestly did come to the border with supplies that we thought at the beginning was for a 1,200 people that were struck. We found the numbers were astronomically higher than that. People stuck in between Egypt and all the way into Sudan are close to 300,000 people. And you're not allowed to take the supplies actually in to distribute them. So they're going in; you don't see where it's going. People are coming out and most of the people are saying that they could not find enough supplies, right? So we started rerouting our help or aid to helping people who are just leaving out. There are a lot of people where the buses just left them at the border and went back to Sudan. So there are people who are stranded after this five-day trip and could not -- cannot get themselves to Aswan. So it's not even a funding issue as much as a strategic. It needs like a full evacuation, humanitarian crisis strategic plan. But individuals are now a part of, individuals like myself, where we're trying to find out buses, to pick up people from that area, taking them to Kolkata (ph), finding out where people are going to stay.

And everybody is just calling each other, helping each other. It's an amazing community. But most of the people crossing the border are dual citizens from lots of different countries. We've found people who are British Sudanese, Australian, that made it across the border because they were left behind. And not only were they left behind when they were asking for help in the border or being stuck in the border or have health issues, nobody came for them, right? So they are relying a lot more on the Sudanese diaspora network than they are relying on their own embassies. And if they are evacuating people from, I don't know where, they're evacuating, greeting (ph) people, could they have at least some presence on the ground in (INAUDIBLE) and in the borders? Could they have some hotline presence on the ground to help the citizens that made it across to get them back to the U.S.? We've already funded a big part of this.

That never got a vote.MERV RIEPE (R-NB), STATE SENATE:  The six-week ban appears to be a winner-take-all position and the pushback will be strong. It will be immediate and it will be funded heavily as now seen in other states.",

South Carolina did pass a six-week abortion ban but the state Supreme Court struck it down. So as neighboring states shut down access, South Carolina has seen a sharp increase in out of state patients seeking abortion care. Right now abortion is legal in South Carolina and Nebraska until about 20 weeks. That doesn't mean further restrictions are totally off the table, especially in South Carolina where there's about a week of the session to go. In fact, the state Senate passed a bill they say addresses the issues the state Supreme Court had with the original six-week abortion ban with exceptions but according to those three senators, the Republican women, the House won't entertain anything that is not a total ban from conception. They told CNN they believe the two chambers are at an impasse. Dianne Gallagher, CNN. Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
