It's what everybody has been hoping for. It didn't come. Now, both NASA leaders and Boeing leaders say that they've made great progress on the testing that they've been doing on the grounds in White Sands, New Mexico. They've been testing these thrusters that failed up in space on the ground. See if they can duplicate the efforts there. They say they've made progress, but not enough to give an actual return date. And listen to this. One of the NASA leaders that was on the call, Steve Stich, he was asked, point blank, can you definitively say that these two NASA astronauts -- NASA astronauts, Butch and Suni, will definitively be coming home on this Starliner spacecraft? Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEVE STITCH, NASA COMMERCIAL CREW PROGRAM MANAGER: Our focus today, as Mark says -- Mark and I have been working for the last number of weeks -- is to return Butch and Suni on Starliner. I think we're starting to close in on those final pieces of the flight rationale to make sure that we can come home safely. And that's our primary focus right now. We have contingency options. We put those in play. NASA always has contingency options. We know a little bit of what those are and we haven't worked on a whole bunch, but we kind of know what those are. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's a big change for this -- this low-cost airline.And it's all about trying to earn more money. They're making this change because they are under pressure from activist investors who want to see a change in management. They want to see higher profits. Southwest used to be the most profitable airline in the U.S. But that's not the case anymore. In fact, they just reported about a 50 percent drop in profit in the second quarter. And so they're facing higher labor costs, higher fuel -- fuel costs. They hope that this change to assigned seating will bring in more money because it will allow them to charge a premium for some of the seats on their flights, just like their competitors do, just like United and American and Delta has been doing for years. They're also going to be starting overnight red-eye flights for the first time ever. And the airline says this will help with efficiency because you'll be using planes more. Southwest Airlines says that customers have been clamoring for these changes. They say that when unhappy passengers switched from Southwest to a competing airline, the number-one reason they give is this open seating plan. Some people love it. Other people, it makes them very anxious because if you forget to plan for it, you could end up in the last row, middle seat, that sort of thing. So this big change they hope will bring in more fliers and make them more appealing -- Brianna?",
