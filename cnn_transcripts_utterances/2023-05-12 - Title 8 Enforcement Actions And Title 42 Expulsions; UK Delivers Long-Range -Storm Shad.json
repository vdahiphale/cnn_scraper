For the tens of thousands of migrants camped out in border towns and cities, there seems to be a mix of confusion, desperation as these new rules take effect for those wanting to claim asylum.Several U.S. cities and counties are asking the federal government for help to manage what was the expected influx of migrants but in the past few days, authorities have detained a record number at the southern border. One official telling CNN it will get worse but hasn't yet. The Biden Administration estimates about 150,000 migrants are waiting in northern Mexico, including these regions and shelters are also capping out on streets. They also estimate hundreds of thousands of migrants are in the pipeline in southern Mexico and Central American countries. The head of Homeland Security says the government has done everything you can to prepare and gave this warning to those who would like to enter the United States illegally. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS, U.S. HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: If anyone arrives at our southern border after midnight tonight, they will be presumed ineligible for asylum and subject to steeper consequences for unlawful entry.

You hit it right there right in the nail when you said that it was going to be a five-year punishment not being able to return to the United States.And so that's probably the most draconian aspect of the law that people are not going to be able to come back. Remember under Title 42 if they were expelled, that didn't count against a future proceeding and that's going to go away now. And we were talking about the numbers, John, Ed was also saying about the 15,000 estimate that the Biden administration had. But let's remember that only a week ago, we were talking about 7,000 people, and today we're talking about 10,000. So there's still a lot of people that are trying to make it across the border. And this is because, like I said before, many migrants had this belief that they could just show up at the border and be able to come into the United States, and you have smugglers telling them because it's in their best interest to run to the border, because it'll be closed, even though it's a lie, because it was wasn't open to begin with. And those numbers you just mentioned can also be explained by some of the things that the migrants themselves have told us in the last few weeks. Title 42 or not, they told us, we will try our best to get to the United States. A Venezuelan migrant told us that for him returning home to Venezuela was not an option. He said I don't want to live in a dictatorship and are reporting from different parts of the border and multiple countries. One thing remains clear immigration is not a single country's problem, but a regional challenge. And we're looking at what's happening at the border right now, John.",

There's also part of the provisions have been struck down like that court ruling by challenge, too.I think the part of the rules which apply to the release of those who are in custody. There's also a provision that the Biden administration wants to push through which if you didn't apply for asylum at a country before you got to Mexico, you'd be kicked out again, that's part of these tough new rules. But the Trump administration tried all of these things. And they were thrown up by court. So a lot of these things have been tried before and didn't stick.",

And that's kind of highlights the issue with immigration policy here in the United States exist, it's extremely complex, very difficult to really fully grasp and understand. And you have many different options and many different scenarios under which people are either processed or not processed, expelled, or allowed to stay, you know, it can get rather daunting, but to kind of go through some of those that you're talking about there.The late night court ruling that you're talking about is a federal judge in Florida, that has struck down this plan that the Biden administration had to create this as what is essentially a temporary -- a parole process that would allow some migrants to be released in the United States without the pipe and paperwork. Many of the migrants we meet here have been processed. They've been given paperwork that as a future court date. The DHS Secretary said that this was going to be a plan that would release some of those under conditions. They would have to check in with immigration officials periodically but a federal judge has temporarily blocked that. And the reason the Biden administration wanted to use that parole policy is because the Border Protection, the Border Patrol scenarios where they are able to house people and process people are is extremely strained at this point. They have 28,000 migrants in custody, that's way beyond capacity, and obviously the concern about what might be coming in the days ahead. So they were trying to figure out ways to alleviate that pressure. But you know, the federal judge blocking that temporarily. So how that will affect what the Biden administration does in the coming days. We don't quite know yet. It really kind of depends on how many people are coming but, you know, this kind of just highlights the constant struggle that is taking place to continue to control this issue.",

We know that U.S. officials outreach extends to countries including Germany, Norway, Brazil, and a form Soviet bloc country, as they go to those countries and have recently arrested Russian spies.And the key here is countries that have Russian spies because the United States does not currently have a high-level Russian spy in its custody. And when you talk to U.S. officials in their engagements with Russia over efforts to try and secure the release of Paul Whelan, Russia made it very clear that they expect to get someone in return who is part of Russia's intelligence gathering apparatus. They want a Russian spy in return for the release of Paul Whelan because they are considering him as a spy. The same is true for Evan Gershkovich. The U.S. officials expect that they are going to have to offer up someone on the table who Russians view in a similar bucket. And when it comes to these efforts, they are also extending to countries that are U.S. allies that don't necessarily have Russian spies, but could potentially offer something up to the U.S. to be used as leverage at the negotiating table. Again, to gin up interests on Russia's side to engage in some sort of deal to try to get out these two Americans who remain wrongfully detained in Russia. Kylie Atwood, CNN, the State Department.

According to legal documents in March 2010, van der Sloot, \"Offered to take the cooperating witness to the location of Natalee Holloway's body, advises to the circumstances of her death, and identify those in her death and disappearance in return for a payment of $250,000.\" Papers were signed, a total of $25,000 was given to van der Sloot, and Holloway's attorney flew to Aruba. Van der Sloot took the attorney to a house, saying her body was buried within the foundation. Soon after fleeing to Peru with the $25,000, he e-mailed the Holloway saying, \"He had lied about the location of Natalee's remains.\" Extortion charges were filed a short time later. In May 2005, the 18-year-old Holloway was last seen leaving a nightclub in Aruba with van der Sloot and two other men. All three were charged by Aruban prosecutors in 2007 for involvement in manslaughter. But a judge ordered their release, citing a lack of direct evidence. Her body was never found. Beth Holloway said in a statement, she would be 36 years old now. It has been a very long and painful journey, but the persistence of many is going to pay off. Together, we are finally getting justice for Natalee. After the U.S. legal proceedings conclude, van der Sloot will be sent back to Peru according to a statement from Peru's judiciary, to a Peruvian prison where he is serving time for the murder of 21-year-old Stephanie Flores. She was murdered five years after Holloway's disappearance. CNN was allowed exclusive access to van der Sloot's cell shortly after his arrest. And in 2012, he was sentenced to 28 years in prison for that murder. CASAREZ (on camera):  The attorney for Joran van der Sloot, Maximo Altez, is telling CNN that he is going to fight this extradition request that was ordered by Peru's Supreme Court. He believes the charges are just too old to have it be valid. Of course, there is an extradition treaty between the United States and Peru signed in 2001. Jean Casarez, CNN, New York.
