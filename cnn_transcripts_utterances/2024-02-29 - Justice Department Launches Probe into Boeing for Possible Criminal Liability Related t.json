And now the Justice Department is piling on here. Well, what does it all mean? This could expose Boeing to criminal liability if the Justice Department finds that Boeing violated their agreement after the 737 Max-8 crashes of 2018 and 2019.The deferred prosecution agreement is what it's officially called was reached in 2021. It avoided a charge of conspiracy to defraud the United States. Boeing admitted to the fraud, but it was controversial because crash victims' families were not consulted. Set to expire on January 7th, that was two days after the door plug incident on January 5th. That agreement cost Boeing $2.5 billion in 2021, included a $243 million criminal fine. So far, no comment from Boeing on this latest development. Also, no comment from the Justice Department. This all comes from reporting from \"The New York Times\" and from \"Bloomberg\" citing unnamed sources. It's happening as multiple investigations are appearing to come to a head this week. Just on Monday an expert panel said that Boeing employees do not have the ability to properly report safety issues to their managers, fearing retaliation.",

Of course, this is an administration that has dealt with multiple surges at the U.S.-Mexico border, and sources telling me that over the years discussions within the White House about this issue were tense as it increasingly became a political liability.Now, border crossing have dropped in recent weeks, but the turning point here was that Senate border bill that you just talked about. That included some of the toughest border security measures in recent memories. But it was tanked by Republicans at the encouragement of former president Donald Trump. And so President Biden is expected to hammer Republicans while he is talking here at the Border Patrol facility behind me. He is also expected to meet with law enforcement and with Border Patrol agents and really make the focus about what hasn't been done in Congress, despite his own administration officials working with negotiators to include some of the most extraordinary authorities in this Senate border deal. But I should also note, John, that the timing here is critical. A new Gallup poll released this week shows that a bigger share of Americans sees this issue of immigration as one of the most important issues. The president here is going to try to flip the script on Republicans, on former President Donald Trump, and seize an issue that up until this point has really dogged his administration.",

You have talked about this and spoken very publicly about the need for resources and the need for help from the federal government. The mayor of New York City, Eric Adams, he's trying to make moves on this, right now, saying that he wants to basically change the city's sanctuary city status in order to make it easier to deport migrants who are accused of serious crimes, though before that's even worked its way through courts.

We are allowed to work with federal immigration officials when a crime has been committed, as we should be able to. And what we want to have happened in the state of New York, if someone commits a crime like the horrific assault by migrants against police officers in Times Square, I immediately said, I want them arrested, tried, and if convicted, I want them to spend time in New York jails before they are deported, because if they're released, go back to their country, I don't know if they won't be back in the next few months.So I think we have more control, at least under New York state laws. Now the city has a different view. They can choose the path they want to, but also it's a crisis that we need solved right now. We should not be talking about crimes being committed by migrants in the streets of New York, and the vast majority of them are law-abiding citizens. They truly are. They came here for a better life, and I don't want to highlight those who committed crimes. They do exist. They exist in every society. But right now the state of New York has the power to work with ICE when these situations occur.

BOLDUANsome -- getting a real fix to the problem, Governor, obviously it's in the hands of Congress. Congress has stalled and getting their act together and any major bipartisan deal. It's been -- you've been following those negotiations and how that's gone. While House Republicans have definitely held up movement on what really was seen as could have been a pretty big bipartisan deal, Democratic members from New York have also been against.

That is an issue that the US Supreme Court is looking at. And now there are three states that say Donald Trump is ineligible to be voted for in their state's primary elections that are upcoming. Illinois, a court decided last night that Donald Trump is ineligible. He will be able to appeal that and potentially put that on hold, as the state continues to work things out. But the US Supreme Court is looking at whether courts in Colorado and Illinois are able to do this and whether the people who run elections in the state of Maine are also able to remove Trump from the ballot or throw out votes for him. So that's on the lawsuit side, and his eligibility related to the insurrection calling him an insurrectionist and votes toward the presidency. On the criminal case side, that's where the US Supreme Court has now said they are going to be weighing questions of presidential immunity if there is a bubble around Donald Trump that protects him from criminal charges and prevents him from going to trial in his obstruction case related to the 2020 election. Right now, that case is paused. It was in the trial court. It was scheduled to go to trial very soon, as soon as March, but it has been paused for several months now as appeals over these presidential immunity questions play out. The Supreme Court says they are now going to be looking at that. They're going to be hearing arguments in April with the decision very possibly coming by the end of their term in June, and so the trial date could fall any time after that -- John.",
