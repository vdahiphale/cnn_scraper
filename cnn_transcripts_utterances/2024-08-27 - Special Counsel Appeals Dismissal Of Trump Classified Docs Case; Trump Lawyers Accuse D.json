And here's why.Donald Trump's not the first person to make this argument. Plenty of people who've been the subject of special counsel investigations and prosecutions have argued before this whole scheme is unconstitutional because Congress never specifically said, OK, DOJ, you now have a position called special counsel. But that argument has been rejected. It was rejected in Mueller. It was rejected in one of the Hunter Biden cases. It's been rejected by appeals courts. Judge Ken is actually the first one to accept it. And the reason that it has passed constitutional musters because there are various laws passed by Congress that say the AG can delegate his power, his authority, basically however necessary to carry out his goal. So I think the 11th Circuit will probably reverse this, and if not, it could well go to the Supreme Court. I don't know --",

If you're talking to them are the price of groceries, the price of gas and the price of housing. And if voters that you care about, particularly in the middle, 50 percent think that grocery prices will go up. That means that voters who already feel, because we know that a majority of voters feel like there's a tightening on their pocketbook, think it's going to get worse under Harris. And that's likely going to impact them when they go to the polls.So if I was Harris, I'd be very concerned about that. But just to go back to one of the things that Daniel was saying overall, the best strategy for Donald Trump's team, they believe, is to try and make Harris an incumbent candidate. So far, it's proven very hard. She has had this bounce over the last several weeks that they have had a hard time infiltrating, but their goal is, by the end of this, to make it the Biden-Harris administration, to make her the incumbent, and that all of these policies be linked to her, whether or not they can do it.
