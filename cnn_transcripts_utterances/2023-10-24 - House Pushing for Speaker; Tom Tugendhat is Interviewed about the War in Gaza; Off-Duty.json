This isn't one of the top issues within the conference right now, but what this underscores, this entire kind of range of issues, is that this isn't necessarily an issue-based election. This has been more of a personality run up to this point.And the big question for Emmer, who is a member of leadership, who does have some high-profile support already, including former Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy, is, where does Trump stand? His endorsements haven't won out up to this point. He's zero for two right now in these races. However, Emmer and he have a history. And it's not exactly a great one. They've had some phone calls. Whether or not that will help him get over the line over the course of the day or days or weeks at this point, we'll have to wait and see. Poppy.",

And I think for a lot of Republicans in that period, they were willing to say, OK, sure, anyone has the right to go to court to talk about this stuff. Of course later we learned over time that the courts rejected all of these appeals, right?And then you get to January of 2021 when we faced these certification questions and, of course, what happened on January 6th. And, you know, while Trump was up in New Hampshire saying those things that you showed about Emmer, saying, I'm not trying to get involved, like, only Jesus Christ could win, he was actually reposting later that day attacks against Emmer on his social media. So, it's clear that there's an issue here. I -- you know, I think the challenge - you know, and, Phil, you've pointed this out, we don't fully understand how much influence Trump has here. He obviously wanted Jim Jordan to be speaker. He didn't have enough juice to get Jordan into the - to get him the gavel. I think it's more likely he does have enough juice in the conference to sink somebody that he doesn't want. And if he really applies himself to sinking Emmer's bid, that could happen. But I do think that exhaustion factor is really setting in. And I think you saw last night member after member telling our team, look, we got to get this done. We are - we are over this. I think they are starting to see in their polling just how bad it looks for the American people and they are realizing that they're going to start to get punished for it if they don't actually move.

The French prime minister today. Macron telling the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, that France shares Israel's pain and understands what it's like to experience a terrorist attack. Of course, referring to the Bataclan. The French president is also expected to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. And that should happen later on today.

She survived. She thought she would never see her children again. She was used as a human shield, she says, for a Hamas commander who actually surrendered.

It's one of the reasons why our foreign secretary devotes so much time and effort into building up diplomatic partnerships in the region. We have some extremely close partnerships in the region. Allies like Jordan and Egypt have been extremely important partners for many years, as they have been in different ways for you, too.And so what we're looking to do is to make sure that we're working together with others so that we can resolve this crisis, we can get aid into the Palestinian people, we can get security to the Israeli people, and we can resolve this without it escalating. But let's be absolutely clear who wants this to escalate. It's not Israel, it's not even the Palestinian people, it's Iran and Hamas who want this to escalate. And it's up to the free counties, the countries like ours and our partners in the region, to make sure that escalation does not happen because if there's one piece of advice you should always follow is don't do what Iran wants you to do.",

And clearly closing down finance networks that fund terror groups like Hamas is incredibly important. And it's something we devote an awful lot of time to. But, of course, terror groups also devote time to and try to use new currencies and new systems to get around it. And that's why we constantly got to update our systems, constantly got to update our laws to make sure that we're working alongside partners like the United States, but also the European Union and many partners in the region to close down those routes, those funding channels that don't just fund terror in Israel, but also fund -- let's not beat any - let's not, you know, skip over it, the murder and brutalization of the Palestinian people.Hamas is an organization that has literally dug up water pipes to turn them into rockets. It has stolen aid off the Palestinian people while its leadership lives in luxury abroad. This is a brutal regime that has done more to destroy the lives of Palestinians than anything else.",

Actually a passenger says a flight attendant announced to the plane that Emerson appeared to have a breakdown of some sort. And that same passenger actually saw Emerson and said he looked well kept but, quote, \"dead in the eyes.\"Now, Emerson was an Alaska Airlines pilot flying on this Alaska Airlines regional flight in what's known as the jump seat. That's a small, third seat in the cockpit. It's behind the captain of the first officer. It is used all the time by airline employees, often to commute between their home cities and bigger airline hubs. Now, this flight left Paine Field, near Seattle, in Everett on Sunday afternoon. It was bound for San Francisco. And at 31,000 feet, the pilots radioed air traffic controllers in Seattle to declare an emergency. And I want you to listen now to what they said after the captain and first officer subdued Emerson. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The FAA is telling airlines it's not in any way connected to world events. And the FBI says there's no continuing threat. But one more interesting detail here, Phil. Alaska Airlines says Emerson attempted to engage the engine fire suppression system for both of the engines on this Embraer 175. When that system is first engaged, it first cuts fuel off to the respective engine causing that engine to begin to shut down. Those big red tea handles there you see at the top of the screen. Now, Alaska Airlines says the captain and first officer acted really quickly to reset that system. And that kept the engines from failing completely. Phil.",
