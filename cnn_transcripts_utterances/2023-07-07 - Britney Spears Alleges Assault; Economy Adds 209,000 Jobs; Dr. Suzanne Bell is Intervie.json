Surprisingly, this time the judge allowed them to talk to their son. This was through, though, that clear glass. \"The Journal\" interviewed his family, sat down with them to talk about how they're coping, how they're getting through this, and they said they're happy that they were able to talk to Evan, laugh with him, in the courtroom.

Now Victor, you just heard, says that she grabbed him from behind. Brittney says that the security guard backhanded her, causing her to almost fall to the ground, slapping her in the face. Now, she takes issue with what he told reporters, saying that she -- it feels like he was laughing when he spoke to that pool of reporters, that this is no laughing matter. That she's 5'4\". You know, h e's seven feet -- over seven feet, like you said. An that she says that she has not received a public apology from him, from the security. So, a police report was filed. We have contacted the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department who say, obviously, no arrests have been made, no charges have been filed. But Britney Spears, we showed you that full screen a moment ago, saying that the - that this story is super embarrassing to share. You know, she doesn't want to be talking about this. And, obviously, Britney makes a lot of headlines for especially her conservatorship over the last couple of years. But she says that she thinks it's important to share the story to urge people in the public eye to set an example and treat all people with respect. And then her husband sharing pictures of Britney and video of her when fans approach her. She says when she was in Vegas that she was approached by over 20 fans and that, you know, her security isn't slapping anybody.

Unemployment rate came in at 3.6 percent. That was what we were expecting. Ticked down quite a bit, slightly, rather, down from 3.7 percent.Guys, if we can pull up where we're seeing some of the strongest job gains. Some of this is a continuation of some of what we've already seen. We can pull up the sectors for you. But we know that construction added jobs. We know that health care added jobs. And we'll try to get these sectors pulled up for you. Health care also adding 40,000 jobs. So, in some of these sectors, including health care, this is an industry that still has struggled to rehire workers coming out of the pandemic, right? So, you're starting to see that there. They're just still adding jobs there. Here's what the Fed has been watching really closely. Wages. Wages not so great in this report. So this came in slightly higher than what economists were expecting. So wages, on a monthly basis, guys, that came in at 0.4 percent. The expectation was closer to 0.3 percent.

Explain why this is taking so long. DR. SUZANNE BELL, LEAD FOR NASA'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE LAB: Well, it's really one of the extreme challenges of having a habitat on Mars, is that Mars is different distances from earth at any given time. And so with that comes a communication delay where they won't necessarily receive messages real time. In fact, the further a crew gets to going towards Mars, the longer the delay. And the delay can be up to 22 minutes each way. So, just as you're talking about imagine mission control sending a message to the crew. They receive it 22 minutes later. And then make a response back, which is another 22 minutes before mission control on earth would receive it. Completely different paradigm than what we see in the International Space Station today where mission control really helps the astronauts real time execute a variety of really complicated tasks.",
