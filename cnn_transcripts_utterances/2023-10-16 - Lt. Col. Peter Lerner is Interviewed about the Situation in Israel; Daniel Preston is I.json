So, there is so much bad blood, so much tension, so much frustration right now within Republican ranks that this could go on for a while. Right now House Republicans are slated to meet behind closed doors around 6:30 p.m. tonight. This is one of many meetings we have seen over the course of the last several weeks among House Republicans, and yet they are no closer to electing a speaker. As you noted, Jordan's office is making very clear that he is having conversations, he is trying to move members. But the biggest question right now is, you have a bloc of members who are arguing that they may go to the floor and block Jim Jordan. One of the questions has been, if you went to the floor, would members start to get to yes on whatever candidate was before them? But what we are hearing from our sources is the fact that actually that is not going to happen because some of these members are dug in, saying that they are never going to support Jim Jordan. A lot can change in Congress as this war in Israel continues and this goes on and on and on. There becomes a question of when do Republicans come together and say enough is enough, we need to find someone. But at this moment, it doesn't look like Jim Jordan has the support he needs.",

That kind genocidal hate, I'd say, fueled by a deep hatred, not only for the state of Israel, but for Jews and Hamas charter, just like (INAUDIBLE) actually, stipulates clearly that its role is to annihilate the state of Israel and to murder Jews. That kind of hate I think is not one we can understand.",

If there is somebody that cannot condemn that unequivocally, then there is not anything that we can do without identifying the anti-Semitism that fuels it. In order to be able to address or identify anything, we have to first define it. And anti-Semitism is defined not only as what we see here in the ground, in protests, as what we hear is we are Hamas, or on university campuses where we hear legitimization of what it was that happened last Saturday, but actually in many ways the understanding that anti-Zionism is our modern form of anti-Semitism. It's imperative that we understand that if we're going to be able to identify and combat it.",
