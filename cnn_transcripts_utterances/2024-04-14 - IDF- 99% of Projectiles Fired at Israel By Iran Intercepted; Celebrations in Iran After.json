      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world. I'm Alex Marquardt live in Washington with our continuing CNN breaking news coverage of Iran's unprecedented strike inside Israel overnight. It is noon in Israel, the country getting back to normal following that historic, never before seen attack by Iran against Israel. Take a listen.Those are the Israeli air raid sirens that Israeli citizens have become all too accustomed to in the past six months with the war between Israel and Hamas. But those were not Hamas rockets flying at Israel. Those were Iranian drones, ballistic and cruise missiles. The Israeli military saying that more than 300 of those projectiles were fired at Israel over the course of five hours. But the IDF says that the vast majority, almost all of 99% were shot down. The few that did get through those formidable American allied and Israeli air defenses all across the region and in Israel, the few that got through did hit an air base in southern Israel in the Negev. But it only caused minor damage, we're told. Now, Tehran is saying that the attack was in response to the Israeli strike last week, almost two weeks ago on the consulate building that what they claim is the consulate building of Iran's embassy in the Syrian capital of Damascus. That was on April 1st. But Iran said as this attack was getting underway and as these drones and missiles were getting close to Iran and to Israeli airspace, that the matter was concluded, essentially saying that's all over for now, at least. Israel's Foreign Minister, for his part, is repeating an earlier statement that if Iran attacks inside Israel, as they just did, that Israel then reserves the right to strike back inside Iran. And that is the big question right now. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, the head of the IRGC, says that if Israel hits Iranian interests anywhere, Tehran will respond directly again. So it goes without saying that tensions right now are sky high. Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden has spoken in the past few hours with his Israeli counterpart, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. They spoke by phone and according to U.S. officials speaking to CNN, President Biden said that the outcome of what happened last night was essentially a win for Israel because the Iranian attacks had largely failed, because almost all of those drones and missiles were intercepted and taken down. There was no major damage and there were no deaths inside Israel. Now, Prime Minister Netanyahu, for his part, he posted a statement on social media. You can see it right there. He said, quote, \"We have intercepted, we have contained. Together we shall win.\" So now that these Iranian attacks are over, Israel, Jordan and Iraq have all reopened their airspace. You can see those planes flying again. Airlines still avoiding flying over Iran, which includes a vital corridor for global and commercial travel. I want to get straight back to Jerusalem and CNN's Nic Robertson, who has been up all night giving us a blow by blow of what he has been seeing and what he has -- is hearing. Nic, I imagine right now you're not seeing and hearing much of anything aside from life getting back to normal. But this is a far from normal situation. Everyone on tenterhooks about what could happen next in terms of a potential Israeli response?",

So the lines are being drawn. But the track record of Prime Minister Netanyahu listening to President Biden's wishes, as we've seen in Gaza, more than 33,000 Palestinians killed there, serious food shortages, lack of humanitarian aid in the north of Gaza, in particular, people close to starvation. President Biden pressing for many months for Israel to change that dynamic. And only marginal change is coming.President Biden's will and wish that is expressed to Prime Minister Netanyahu may not influence Prime Minister Netanyahu's decision. I mean, it isn't clear at this moment. But -- but if you study the track record, it is likely that the Prime Minister will operate in what he thinks is Israel's interest. The concern in the population here is that the more he turns his face away and ignores what President Biden says, the weaker the U.S. support for Israel going forward. And very significantly, the United States has made very clear that it was their support for Israel that helped them have a successful defense last night. So any growing rift, that's a big worry for a big part of the population here.",

Nic Robertson, a terrific reporting in Jerusalem, as always. Thank you very much.Meanwhile, in Iran's Capital, crowds of people have been gathering in the streets to celebrate. Iran's state alliance Tasnim news agency showed this demonstration with people chanting, honking car horns and waving Palestinian flags in Tehran's Palestine Square, showing their support for Iran's attack on Israel. CNN's Paula Hancocks joins me now from Abu Dhabi. Paula, what do you make of what we're hearing from Iranian officials in terms of essentially saying, well, this is over for now, but we are willing to do more if there is an Israeli retaliation?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, certainly some tense moments there inside the White House as President Biden was really monitoring this event in real time. And you'll remember, Alex, President Biden actually rushed back from his beach house in Delaware to be in the Situation Room with all of sort of the monitoring equipment that is necessary for this kind of event.Of course, President Biden is in something of a tenuous situation here as he works to contain the situation, prevent it from exploding into a regional conflict, while also demonstrating support for Israel, the kind of that was necessary for preventing a much worse attack from happening last night. And the President did speak with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Of course, there have been tensions between these two men over the war in Gaza, but certainly last night President Biden seeking to diminish any daylight between them. In a statement, the President said, \"I've just spoken with Prime Minister Netanyahu to reaffirm America's ironclad commitment to the security of Israel.\" The President goes on to say, \"I told him that Israel demonstrated a remarkable capacity to defend against and defeat even unprecedented attacks, sending a clear message to its foes that they cannot effectively threaten the security of Israel.\" And I think reading between the lines of that statement and also talking to American officials, President Biden is saying here you won, you just take the win. The U.S. does view Israel's response to this attack as successful. They don't see any targets of value having been struck. The majority, the vast majority of Israeli drones and missiles shot down before making impact. And President Biden essentially telling Netanyahu here that this should be considered a success. We also heard from an American official that President Biden told his counterpart that the U.S. would not participate in any offensive operations against Iran, so essentially drawing a line here, certainly mindful of the effect that a reprisal from Israel and the United States would have on U.S. forces in the region. Now, President Biden today plans to confer with the leaders of the G7 on a diplomatic path forward, and certainly the emphasis is on diplomacy and not necessarily on military actions in the days ahead.

Major questions now about how Israel will respond.United States President Joe Biden is expected to meet with G7 leaders today to coordinate what's being called a united diplomatic response to Iran's attack against Israel. Biden also making it clear that the U.S. will not be participating in any offensive operations by Israel against Iran. That's according to a U.S. official speaking with CNN. But the U.S. did help Israel in a very significant way during the Iranian attack overnight. Officials saying that U.S. forces intercepted more than 70 Iranian drones and at least three ballistic missiles that were all heading for Israel. U.S. fighter jets were scrambled and U.S. warships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea were also part of the effort. Iran's mission to the U.N. is warning that if Israel commits what it called any further military aggression, that Tehran's response will be, quote, \"stronger and more resolute.\" CNN's Fred Pleitgen has more on that.

Now I'll bring in CNN's Senior International Correspondent, Ben Wedeman, who joins us now from Beirut.Ben, one of the big questions amid this Iranian attack last night was to what extent the Iranian proxies in the region, the Iranian-backed groups, would join in this attack on Israel, Hezbollah being the most formidable among them. So what did Hezbollah do overnight, and what is the reaction there today?",

      "sentences": "Well, overnight, we do know, Alex, that Hezbollah, according to them, fired tens of Katyusha rockets at an Israeli anti-missile, or rather missile defense, in the Israeli-occupied Syrian Golan Heights. We did see sort of an intensification of action along the border between Israel and Lebanon, and what we did see this morning is that Israel has struck fairly deep inside Lebanon on the town of Nabi Chit, which is in the Beqaa Valley, far away from the border. There, the Israelis apparently destroyed one building. There was also a strike on the Iqlim al-Tuffah area. It's in southern Lebanon, but well away from the border itself.But what we heard in the days leading up to the Iranian retaliation last night was that Hezbollah was stepping back, was going to -- basically, we were told by an official close to Hezbollah that Hezbollah understood that it would be an exclusively Iranian response to the Israeli strike on the 1st of April on the Iranian consulate in Damascus. So it does appear that at the moment we're kind of back to where we were prior to last night's strikes. Israel is striking targets inside Lebanon. Hezbollah, we assume, is going to resume its fire onto Israeli positions in the northern part of the country and also in the Golan Heights. Overnight, of course, the Beirut airport was closed. Lebanese airspace was closed. But it does appear things are sort of getting back to what passes for normal here in Lebanon. Alex?",

And I hope that he will be convinced.Even the conversation with President Biden, I don't know what exactly they exchanged, but his behavior after the last kind of come-to-Jesus conversation that he had with Biden, he behaved much better within 36 hours. We pulled out from Gaza the last division level unit there, and we opened the road for triple the volume humanitarian aid and even kind of were ready to consider flexibilities that were not shown before in regard to the hostages. So somehow Netanyahu is not totally independent. He's not just hovering in the air. He listens to the Americans. He listens to some members of his cabinet, and I hope that it will end up with kind of a good trajectory for Israel which is looking reality in the eye and not trying to deal with every threat in the world simultaneously but deal with them one by one.",

Plus, also installations in places like the Gulf States.So all of this came together, and in essence we cast a very wide net using resources that were in place in theater, plus national level resources such as satellites, both for imagery and signals intelligence, and also other sources that we were able to glean from normal technical means, and that is the kind of thing that I think really helped. But yes, the forces were postured and positioned in a correct way, and I think the fact that General Kurilla, the commander of CENTCOM, was in Israel in the run-up to this event also indicates that there was a high degree of cooperation between the two militaries that resulted in a very successful countering of this Iranian attack.",
