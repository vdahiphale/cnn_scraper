Vladimir Putin spoke to Russian state media in an interview published on Wednesday. He tells them nuclear conflict is not imminent, but he says he is ready to use nuclear weapons to deal with any threat to the existence of the Russian state. He's also trying to stoke fear about Polish troops entering Ukraine, saying they may be tempted to retake land they consider theirs historically. And President Putin is warning the United States to keep its soldiers out of Ukraine -- not that there are any plans for the U.S. to send its troops into combat. But more American weapons will soon be on the way. The U.S. announced a surprise package of $300 million in new military aid to Ukraine on Tuesday after months of warning there wasn't any money left. Senior defense officials say this isn't a long-term solution because they scrounged up the money with savings from weapons contracts. President Joe Biden again called on House lawmakers to pass a bill that includes billions in aid for Ukraine. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The council would include seven members from different political factions within Haiti. And it will appoint an interim prime minister. The goal is for it to stabilize the country enough for presidential elections, which haven't happened since 2016. This comes as current prime minister, Ariel Henry, has succumbed to the mounting pressure and announced his resignation. But he says he's going to stay in power until the transitional council is in place. Meantime, you've got gang and former coup leaders saying they either won't recognize the transitional government or they say it won't work because it doesn't represent the will of the Haitian people. They see this as put in place by an outside force. This comes after weeks of anti-government protests and gang violence. A lot of it directed towards Henry. We were in Port-au-Prince a little more than two weeks ago. And you could feel the anger amongst folks who believed that Henry had overstayed his welcome and they wanted him out. At the same time, the country has been dealing with lawlessness and gangs taking more and more control, especially following the assassination of President Jovenel Moise in 2021. Folks, we first met a couple of weeks back, having recent days felt the growing wrath of gangs. Some have had their makeshift camps or homes torched. Others are sealing themselves indoors, trying to hunker down. Police are feeling the pressure too. A Haitian security source telling us they are frustrated. They've been holding the front line as they see it, awaiting the Kenyan security forces, but that deployment is now on hold, much to the frustration of the U.S. And it's because Kenyan officials say with Henry resigning, there is no anchor for the Kenyan forces to rest. Meantime, the Pentagon is on alert for possible mass migration from Haiti. This is happening as the WFP, the World Food Program, warns a million people in Haiti are one step away from famine.

His parents released a statement saying their son was fun-loving and a bright light for his family and friends.The Israel Defense Forces say Chen's remains were taken into Gaza after he was killed. His parents are urging Mr. Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to do everything they can to bring him back home. Israeli police say a 12-year-old Palestinian boy was shot and killed by a border officer in a refugee camp in Jerusalem. In a video tamed by CNN, the boy can be seen holding a lit firework above his head before the sound of a gunshot is heard. Now in a second video, he's seen lying on the ground as several people gather around him. A police spokesperson says forces responded to a violent disturbance at the camp when an officer fired towards a suspect who, quote, endangered forces whilst firing aerial fireworks in their direction. Hospital officials say the boy, identified as Rami Al-Halhouli, arrived in critical condition and died a short time later. CNN has reached out to Israeli police for further evidence of the alleged disturbances they say took place at the refugee camp. CNN's Paul Hancocks joins me now.

But that is, of course, a few weeks away at this point.Now, some of the key gaps that still remain between the two sides is Hamas would like all the Israeli military to leave the Gaza Strip when there is this pause in fighting. But Israel is not willing to do that. So, we've heard that Hamas wants a permanent ceasefire, which Israel does not, because we've heard from Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, that he still wants to carry out this operation in Rafah itself, where more than a million Palestinians are sheltering. We have heard, though, from Qatar that there is still constructive dialogue. So, even though there are no delegations travelling to meet each other at this point, there is still negotiations on language of a deal going back and forth through these mediators. So, it's not completely ended at this point, but certainly not as optimistic as it was last week.",
