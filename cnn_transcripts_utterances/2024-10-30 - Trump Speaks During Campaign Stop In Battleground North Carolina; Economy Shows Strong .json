But President Trump is certainly not taking it that way. He said that Biden revealed what he and Kamala Harris actually think, bunching of Vice President Harris into those remarks from President Biden, despite Harris saying that she strongly disagrees with any criticism of anyone based on who they vote for. President Trump there going on to say, quote, \"You can't lead America if you don't love Americans.\" Notable words coming from former President Trump, who has called John McCain a loser, who has, according to administration officials, that served him, called fallen servicemembers, suckers and losers. Who has described entire American cities, including Baltimore, Detroit, even Milwaukee a range of insulting names. He's called on members of Congress, who are serving in Congress, to go back to their countries, even though they we're born, most of them that he was talking about, in the United States.
