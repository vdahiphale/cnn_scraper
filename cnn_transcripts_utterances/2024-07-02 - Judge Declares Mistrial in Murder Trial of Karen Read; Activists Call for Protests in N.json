At least one person died after the storm struck the Wynwood Islands on Monday. Democrats are mostly sticking by U.S. President Joe Biden in public amid the fallout from last week's debate. But there are talks behind closed doors that things could change.

The U.S. Supreme Court's decision to give President -- President's absolute immunity from prosecution for official acts is drawing severe condemnation. President Joe Biden slammed the ruling and warned Donald Trump would have nearly unchecked power if he wins a second term. Donald Trump's former advisor Steve Bannon is now in a federal prison in Connecticut. Bannon reported to the facility on Monday to serve a four month sentence for defying a congressional subpoena.
