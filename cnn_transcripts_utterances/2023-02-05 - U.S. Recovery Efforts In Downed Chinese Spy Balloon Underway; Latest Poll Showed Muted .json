I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.At this hour we are learning critical new details about when the Pentagon learned about the Chinese spy balloon and when they realized they must tell the president about it. This comes as U.S. Navy divers and other military personnel are scouring the ocean floor off the coast of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, collecting the wreckage of the balloon downed yesterday by a U.S. fighter jet. Republicans, meantime, are condemning President Biden for failing to take action on the balloon sooner. Let's get the latest on the balloon and today's recovery efforts. CNN national security reporter Zachary Cohen is here. Zachary, what more are we learning about this balloon? And, I guess, at some point, they need to pull it up out of the ocean and start examining it.",

      "sentences": "Yes, well, Jim. I think at this early stage, it's important to know that U.S. officials are not buying the Chinese government's explanation that this was just a civilian aircraft. It was for research purposes. They have strongly indicated, Defense officials and administration officials, strongly told us that this was used for spying and they believe that it was used to try to collect data about sensitive U.S. Military sites across the country.Now, that raises an interesting question, though, and one that the Biden administration is going to have to grapple with in the next few days. If they know that that was the intent of this balloon, why did they not shoot it down before yesterday? Now that is the question Republicans and Democrats are asking today. And we're learning through our sources that the reasoning is a little bit complicated. Now we know that the Biden administration told reporters recently that the safety was the key issue. Right? They didn't want to shoot this balloon down over land, risk having it fall on people or infrastructure below. But the other part of this, and this is something Congressman Garamendi said earlier today on CNN, that they wanted to wait so they could monitor the surveillance aircraft and pick up interesting information about what this balloon was doing and what kind of data it was trying to collect. Take a listen to what he said earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JOHN GARAMENDI (D-CA): I can assure you that we were gathering information. We probably gathered information the Chinese did not want us to have. Communication systems, the way in which they are communicating from that balloon probably to satellites. Also what it was that the Chinese were looking for as they were on this little journey. And also all of the detail and we'll go back and we'll take all of that apart and we'll learn from this.

Particularly if it's confirmed that this balloon had the capability to pick up sensitive information and was an intelligence gathering mission, was on an intelligence-gathering mission. And secondly, whether it was maneuverable. I think those are the key points.If it is a spy balloon, if it's maneuverable, then clearly invading U.S. air space was of concern and I think the president made the right decision to shoot it down. So there's an awful lot of information we need to know in order to confirm our worst suspicions. ACOSTA: And you've been in the position of Defense secretary, CIA director, White House chief of staff. Would you have advised the president to shoot down the balloon immediately, as soon as it was becoming noticeable over the skies in Montana or do you think it made some sense from an intelligence-gathering standpoint to let it drift for a while and let it get out over the ocean where it can be brought down without really any potential for danger below?",

If it was that, and if we were aware of the balloon, I think we should have taken steps to prevent it from entering our air space and I'm not sure that we should have allowed it to simply crossover the country, crossover what were obviously sensitive military sites. I don't see the logic of that.So the question obviously is the Pentagon said that there were risks here. I understand that argument. That there were debris risks. At the same time I think we should have acted earlier if our suspicions were valid that this was, in fact, on an intelligence mission. I hope in the future we make clear to the -- to China that this kind of incident cannot happen again. And it will not happen again. And in the future, if we see that kind of balloon, we are going to -- if they don't take action to prevent that balloon from entering our air space, that we will indeed shoot it down much earlier than we did this time around.",

When they initially found that the balloon was there, when they considered it to be an intelligence- gathering balloon, and frankly, when the president made the decision to shoot it down.If he made the decision on Wednesday to shoot it down, I think that should have been made public. It would have prevented some of the criticism that occurred later and the American people I think are entitled to know just exactly what our adversaries are up to.

I know you probably know exactly where all those bases are. And U.S. officials said they were taking steps to protect against foreign intelligence collection.Do you think the Pentagon could have used electronic interference or other measures to prevent the balloon from acquiring important information?

If it was in fact the kind of technology that could gather intelligence or pick up signals of one kind or another, and really obtain very sensitive information, then that raises a lot more concerns about allowing it to do that and just exactly what China will do with that information.If, in fact, it was a weather balloon, then, I think, obviously, the world needs to know that as well. So a lot is going to depend on what our intelligence officials and the FBI that look at that -- at all of that equipment, what determination they make as to what in fact was involved with this balloon.

I'll tell you that speech that the president delivered on Friday night in Philadelphia felt very much like a re-election launch speech, including he was there with the vice president, there Joe and Kamala signs, and people chanting four more years.

It's actuarial. You look at these polls, and you know, \"The Washington Post\" poll today, 58 percent of Democrats said they would prefer another candidate.Yet the president has like north of 80 percent approval rating in most polls from Democrats for his performance. This isn't about his performance. It really is about age and you look at that \"Washington Post\" poll, 69 percent of voters under 40 said they would prefer -- or Democrats under 40, I believe it was, said they would prefer another candidate. So, you know, and that's a difficult thing to grapple with. I think what their counting on to some degree is that Trump will either be the candidate on the other side and even though he was trailing Trump marginally, it really is a statistical tie in this poll. I think ultimately they have confidence they can beat Trump again. Or Trump isn't a nominee and, Jim, you're an expert on this, but there's a lot of -- you know, the President Trump said again this week that he won't guarantee that he's going to support the nominee of the Republican Party, and there is this sense that Trump, who, you know, is so loathe to admit failure, would accept if the party doesn't make him the nominee and would tear the nominee down.

So, the bigger pieces are going to fall down and should be able to be seen by sonar, the side-scansonar, when they tow it around there. The smaller pieces are going to be a little bit harder to find. Big deal, the big key to this, though, was that they know exactly where it was when it was detonated in the sky and they should know fairly exactly where it hit the water. Then with currents and tides, they should be able to predict about where most of the items are resting on the bottom.",

That's not -- that's not only for the sonar operations but it's also for the divers and any recovery vehicles that you're going to put in there. So, you want to have nice weather. I believe it's rainy down there now, which is not an issue but wind and waves can be.47 feet is a fairly easy slope of -- the bottom there is pretty gentle and it's usually sand down there. So, things should be standing up on top of the sand. However, with that parachute, that's a big area that could be dragged by currents and tides. And so they just need to get equipment in the water and start looking for it.",

If they get a big chunk of this thing, and that they should be able to technically determine what it was and what it was there for. If there's a lot of small pieces missing, one of the options that they would have is that they could drag the bottom with nets, you know, like fishing nets, scale trolleys or something like that. But that's still a long ways off. Most likely, they would be able to get -- hopefully get most of what they need just by divers and a quick -- hopefully a quick operation.",
