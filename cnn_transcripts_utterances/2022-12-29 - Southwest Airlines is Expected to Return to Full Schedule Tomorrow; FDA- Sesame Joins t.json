She didn't have money to buy a new ticket to get her back to Columbus, Ohio. And she told us that she wasn't getting a refund from Southwest. But now today we're hearing that Southwest is laying out new options online for passengers like that to put in for full reimbursement for their expenses, reimbursement for canceled flights as well as putting in missing baggage info. We know that that has been a huge issue throughout this entire ordeal. Listen to what the chief commercial officer for Southwest airlines had to say about the issue of reimbursement in a Twitter video he posted on Wednesday night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I would hope that based on the conversation that we had, that they do fully plan on getting those passengers that are on those flights on those flights and running a full schedule tomorrow. I can tell you that today we canceled over 2,500 flights just to get everybody situated. I don't know if those passengers are the ones that were booked on those flights originally or if there's a backlog of passengers. Like I said, this was all caused by an outdated IT system and not enough infrastructure to be able to get those pilots and flight attendants on. You know, the impetus was weather, but what happened afterwards was definitely IT and infrastructure related. So, I'm not sure who those passengers are that are on those flights tomorrow that are a full schedule. Whether there backlog passengers or people that booked originally on those days to travel.",

      "sentences": "Sure, and I can tell you that we pointed this out very analytically back in 2016 and dating all the way back to 2014 actually. Back then, Gary Kelly, we pinpointed the problem that the IT infrastructure and specifically the scheduling software that they were using is not up to snuff if you will. It does not -- it's inadequate in doing what they would like to do. And you can see where the increase in meltdowns and then how severe the meltdowns have become. We had one in October of 2021 with 2,000 cancellations that cost the company $75 million.And now they've recovered from these meltdowns are becoming more and more cumbersome. And it is very much that Mr. Waterson or chief operating officer is finally specifically talking about that program which is that sky solver program. And he said -- I'll quote. In our desired state we have a solver that would be able to do that quickly and very accurately. Our system today cannot do that. So, it's the lack of infrastructure spending and reinvesting back into the company that's gotten us there. Whether or not this is going to be kind of an impetus for them to turn around and do a very rapid and expeditious reinvestment back into the company with a new program or better program, and not be assigned pilots and flight attendants. That's another part of the problem is that as soon as the weather event or an air traffic control event happens, any kind of irregular operations, they start massively re-signing.",

First of all, it's not labeled, and so you don't have to put sesame on a label all the time. It can just be, like, natural flavorings or spice or something. So, you don't even know that it's in there. It's like this hidden ingredient in many different foods. And here's what can happen, Sara, if you are allergic to sesame.It can bring on wheezing, throat tightness, certain GI Symptoms, your blood pressure can drop. It said that there is, you know, more than a million nearly 2 million people who have sesame allergies. So, that's a lot of people. So, sesame will be added to the list of eight other food ingredients where there has to be labeling so that people can see that it's in there. The other one -- this is just as familiar to anyone who reads labels -- is milk, eggs, fish, certain types of shellfish like shrimp, crab, lobster, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, soybeans and now sesame. And you know what, Sara, people with sesame allergies do need to beware when January 1 comes in, you're still been a have products on there on the shelf that haven't had to label. So, it's not as if you're going to wave a magic wand and it changes quickly. So, people need to keep that in mind -- Sara.",
