She traveled there to visit her sick mother and she is now stuck.And Nabil joins us from Chicago. Thank you for joining me. What is the latest that you've heard from your mother? How is she doing? NABIL ALSHURAFA, HIS PALESTINIAN-AMERICAN MOTHER IS TRYING TO LEAVE GAZA: Thank you, Kate. We just -- I spoke to her about 24 hours ago. I couldn't reach her this morning. I was hoping she could speak to you. But in the last 24 hours, I spoke to her. It's been an impossible situation. There's no food. There's little water. They're eating garbanzo beans, whatever they can find. When my uncle went to go get some bread, it took him about two and a half hours to wait in line to get bread when the Israeli military bombed the store forcing everyone to fall and collapse on top of each other. It's been a really challenging situation. They just bombed -- I heard from my another -- my uncle that they bombed the street where my mom is. So, if she wants -- if she could go to the Rafah Border, she'll have a very difficult time. And it's just -- you know, it's an impossible situation to be in. Right now, my mom, it's not -- it's not that she is stuck in Gaza. She was trapped in Gaza. She was 10 minutes away from getting out of the border, the Rafah Border, on October 10 when the Israeli missile -- when Israeli -- when Israeli military struck down that border shutting it and trapping 600 U.S. citizens and hundreds of European and other international citizens. Trapping them in Gaza. And so, this is really an important narrative that's missing. And what strikes me right now, Kate, is that the -- you know in 1990, in the first Gulf War, the U.S. president, George H.W. Bush, before getting involved in the Kuwait-Iraq War, he sent freedom for flights to get the U.S. citizens out. And I was on -- my family was on those freedom flights and were U.S. citizens. Why didn't the U.S. before getting involved in the war, get the U.S. citizens out? This makes no sense to me before getting involved. And now our, allies trapped our US citizens. Israeli Government traps them in there. And railing bombs on them. And their bombs raining on them. It's just unbelievable what's happening.",

The IDF says -- I remember seeing the IDF speaking about a strike, maybe on that same day near the Rafah Border that they were targeting underground tunnels that are used by Hamas, which of course, adds to the complexity of all of this. And the administration has said that it has proven really complicated to get Americans out.We've heard from the Secretary of State speaking about it. He was asked about it. And he says that -- what he has said is that to date, Hamas has blocked people from leaving. And then the spokesperson for the State Department explained the situation further this morning when asked on CNN. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Happening now, trump's one-time fixer and lawyer Michael Cohen is on the witness stand testifying in the civil fraud case against Trump where Trump has already been found liable. This comes as ABC News reports that Mark Meadows, his former chief of staff, was granted immunity to testify in the special counsel probe in efforts to overturn the 2020 election.With us now. Former Assistant Special Watergate prosecutor and former Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Nick Akerman. Counselor, how essential do you think Mark Meadows is in the special counsel case against Donald Trump? NICK AKERMAN, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY: Oh, I think he's huge. He is actually a fulcrum point in this entire case. It's going to be tried on March 4 of next year. He was the person that basically took in all the communications that were directed to Donald Trump. He carried messages from Donald Trump to everybody. We know from the testimony of Cassidy Hutchinson, who was Meadows's chief assistant, that Meadows was supposed to go to a meeting at the Willard Hotel, the War Room with Bannon and Giuliani and other miscreants, who were there plotting what was going to happen the next day, he decided not to go but attended by telephone. We know that he talked to Roger Stone who is up on the Capitol steps with the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers. I -- he might even be able to put evidence out there that Donald Trump knew beforehand that there would be violence on the Capitol steps. He is an extremely important witness. He was in the room at the time. He knew what was going on. I know there's reports in the ABC about what he may have said, but we're not going to really know the importance of that testimony until we actually hear him testify at the trial.",

He's going to be corroborated by his own text messages and other documents. And the government is likely to incorporate that into the narrative that they put forward when Mark Meadows testifies. He's going to talk about all of that.",

So, there's going to be a lot of evidence.
