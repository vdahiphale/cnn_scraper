We've got some breaking news for you to start here as the U.S. begins airdrops today over Gaza. We are now learning that Vice President Kamala Harris will meet with Israel's war cabinet minister Benny Gantz on Monday in Washington. And it comes as a senior U.S. official tells CNN that a six-week ceasefire has basically been accepted by Israel, and they're now waiting on a response from Hamas.Earlier today, three C-130 Hercules cargo planes dropped a total of 66 bundles in Gaza. They included mainly food, but no water or medical supplies. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is in Washington and Paula Hancocks is in Abu Dhabi. I want to start with you, Priscilla. What do you know about this vice president?",

      "sentences": "Well, this meeting is part of an ongoing effort by the vice president to meet with multiple Israeli officials. But of course, this meeting on Monday comes at a critical time. Two key topics of discussion that are expected to come up are a hostage deal and humanitarian aid, which both of them are linked.On the first, as you mentioned there, were learning today from a senior administration official that Israel has basically accepted, that's how the official put it, a framework that includes a six-week ceasefire to allow for the release of the most vulnerable hostages -- that includes women, elderly, and the wounded -- and a way to get humanitarian aid into Gaza. Over the course of those six weeks, the idea is that officials can continue discussions to work out some of the stickier points of these talks, which has been also the release of IDF members. Now, of course, on top of that, there is discussion, or expected to be discussion, about the humanitarian aid going into Gaza. White House officials say what is going in is not enough. So that's going to be part of the conversation that the vice president is going to have with Benny Gantz, in addition to the day-after planning for Gaza, which is something that has been a priority for her. So many threads here that the two of them will be discussing. And this Israeli war cabinet member, Benny Gantz, will also be meeting with National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan while he's in town.",

He says \"The amount of aid flowing to Gaza is not nearly enough, and we will well continue to pull out every stop we can to get more aid in.\"Now, I will tell you that the White House has seen today's drops as, quote, successful. And they have been able to come to that conclusion because of what they have seen so far. So these drops happened. And then with monitoring, they saw that civilians approached the aid that was dropped in that region, a region that was chosen because it is where they assessed there were people sheltering and people in need. Now, what we know about the aid that was dropped was that it was 66 bundles. It was done with the Jordanian air force and included 38,000 meals. There was no water or medical supplies that was part of this drop. But what senior administration officials say is that they are trying to flood the zone. This is not just one effort. They want to have humanitarian aid drops. They're looking into a maritime corridor. And they're saying that none of this is a substitute to getting aid through land crossings, which has been more difficult. In addition to getting aid in, the other difficulty has been distributing it among those who desperately need it. So clearly, the president's message today is that more needs to get into Gaza. That is a key topic of discussion with Israeli officials. And these humanitarian aid drops, while the beginning, certainly not the end as of now, Omar.",

      "sentences": "Well, we understand from the United Nations secretary general's office, they say that a U.N. team was able to go to that area and to the hospital where many of the survivors and the injured of that tragedy were taken. This happened back on Thursday. More than 100 were killed, more than 700 were injured when humanitarian aid trucks were brought to northern Gaza, just to Gaza City. Now, there are differing narratives so as to what happened. Palestinians on the ground, including eyewitnesses and a local journalist, say that Israeli tank thanks opened fire and there was a panic, a stampede, and aid trucks did run over some of the residents after that. But the Israelis say that they only opened fire after they saw a stampede.But this U.N. group is saying that the survivors that they saw, many of them had gunshot wounds. They say they were unable to see the bodies of those that had been killed, but for what they had seen in the hospital itself, they are certainly taking that as part of the investigation, more calls, in fact, from different countries that there should be an independent investigation into what happened. The Israelis say they are carrying out their own investigation. But it does really point to the fact that it is very difficult to distribute this aid in a safe fashion considering the infrastructure has completely collapsed within Gaza itself. And also, this is what humanitarian aid groups are pointing to when they look at these airdrops, saying it is not ideal. One of them calling it a band-aid measure, because once the airdrop happens, there is no control over what happens to that aid once it hits the ground. There is no safe distribution among those who are in that area, and there is no way of making sure that it does get to those who are most in need. U.N. agencies on the ground and humanitarian aid group saying the situation is desperate, the U.N. saying there's potential of famine in the future in northern Gaza if this is not addressed immediately, calling for other crossings between Israel and Gaza, one crossing, in particular, which could access northern Gaza be opened by Israel.

So that's why I think she's going to stay on. But the way she's handled this case has been botched from the beginning. She was the last to file. She charged 19 co-defendants, 15 of which remain.

The same poll also shows 40 percent of voters think they've personally benefited from former President Trump's policies.So joining me now to break down the numbers is CNN reporter Alayna Treene, who is covering a Trump rally in Greensboro, North Carolina, where the president, former president, has taken the stage.

      "sentences": "Right. Well, Omar, I think what are the big things that's sticks out to me, but I also know has stuck out and is sticking out to the Trump campaign is that hypothetical match-up between President Joe Biden and the former President Donald Trump. This poll shows Trump narrowly leads Biden by 48 percent to 43 percent among registered voters. And that's something I was told from some of Donald Trump's advisers was something they were celebrating, particularly on social media, sharing some of these figures any chance they can to show that they might be able to beat Biden in November. We know they like to tout those numbers.Now, I do just want to share with you, Omar, what we expect to hear from Donald Trump today. And I apologize, it's very loud because he is behind me speaking. But North Carolina, as well as Virginia, which is a state he'll be in later today, are both places that the Trump campaign recognized our battleground states. They recognize that it will be a hard fight against Biden in November. And that's why these are the only two states he's really visiting before Super Tuesday next week. And I can tell you that I know Donald Trump is going to spend the majority of his speech attacking Joe Biden, not Nikki Haley, even though he is still in a primary. His team really views the general as already having begun. And I also just want to share some of his messaging. I think he's going to really lean into the economy, inflation. Those are issues that the Trump campaign argues they take Virginia voters and North Carolina voters care the most about. And just one more thing, Omar, that I think is really interesting to note is how the Biden campaign views North Carolina. This is a state that Trump narrowly won in 2020, and the Biden campaign thanks that they could potentially win the state's 16 delegates in November, not just to win it overall, but also as more of an insurance policy to fight back against some of the other battleground states like Michigan that they're a little bit more concerned about. So that's how wow Trump campaign came in today, how the Biden campaign is viewing his visits here. And we'll hear more from him in the next hour or, so about how he's planning to target voters in the state. Omar?",

The most recent numbers in a 2024 general election matchup between Joe Biden and former president Donald Trump continue to show no clear leader between the two. Trump showing 48 percent, Biden 46 percent. But look, with me now to talk more about this is Alice Stewart. She is a CNN political commentator and a Republican strategist. So Alice, despite all the legal troubles surrounding Trump, he continues to pull either about even or slightly ahead of Biden in some cases.

Obviously, the numbers aren't that great in other key battleground states, but we're seeing that many Republican voters are looking for a change, and they certainly still want a choice.But again, we're talking about the GOP voters. And look, as we head into the general election, Donald Trump's not going to have quite as favorable a reception from the independent voters, the disaffected Republican voters. So the question is, how will he add to the base that he has? We know his base is strong. We know that his support within the GOP is very enthusiastic. Those numbers are much greater than Joe Biden. The question is, as we know, these general elections are all about the mushy middle, the more moderate voters. And can he add to the base that he has and bring about a victory in November?

What were you thinking?CAITLYNN CARDEN, BRYCE CARDEN'S WIFE: Sure. So I actually was watching it live for WLKY on Facebook. And right before the run happened, Bryce sent me a text and said, semi hanging off the bridge. Here we go. And I was like, OK. And so I found out about 12:39, it was kind of right after Bryce had got her out of the cab that I realized that it was him. And I was actually sitting there feeding Oak (ph) a bottle at the time, just like shaking to know, just hearing, trying to prepare myself for what could have been a very positive or negative situations. So I did know halfway through that it was him. [14:45:01] JIMENEZ: Yes. Yes. Well, unbelievable. Firefighter, Bryce Carden, Caitlynn, thank you for taking the time to talk to us. Thank you for what you did that day. And Caitlynn, thanks for keeping your head cool in that moment. I can't imagine what it was like to see him.

But it's not just the presidential race that's drawing attention in Washington. With razor thin margins in the House and Senate primary states like California could determine which party controls Capitol Hill after November.So joining us now is the director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California, Dan Schnur. So Dan, welcome. In California, polls show Congressman Adam Schiff ahead with Democrat Katie Porter locked in a tight race for second place with Republican Steve Garvey. The top two vote getters on Tuesday will go into a head-to-head in a runoff. But how do you see the race playing out? Do you see it being Schiff and Porter? DAN SCHNUR, DIRECTOR, JESSE M. UNRUH INSTITUTE OF POLITICS AT USC: Because there's still such a large number of undecided voters in this primary, Omar, it is a little bit difficult to predict. But what I will say is just seen in the last day or so, new polling from \"The L.A. Times\" and the Institute of Governmental Studies at U.C. Berkeley, it actually shows that Garvey has moved into first place in the poll, only by a couple of points over Adam Schiff. But it's beginning to look more and more likely like Schiff and Garvey will be the two candidates in the runoff, because again, as I said a moment ago, of the large number of undecided voters, it's certainly more than possible that Porter could end up getting that second spot. But right now, it's beginning to look like a more traditional Democrat versus Republican matchup between Schiff and Garvey.",

And so while there are probably just enough Republicans to get a candidate into the runoff for the general election, there aren't nearly enough to elect a statewide -- a candidate statewide. So the Schiff campaign and Schiff's allies have been spending millions of dollars in advertising attempting to promote Garvey's candidacy because they know that running against him in the fall would essentially be a slam dunk victory for Schiff. And I suspect, even though they would never say so publicly, they'reprobably lot of Democrats in Washington who wouldn't mind seeing that happen, because while the seat will almost certainly be won by a Democrat, if Schiff ended up running against another Democrat in the fall, whether it be Katie Porter, are Barbara Lee, that race is going to cost tens of millions of dollars. And I suspect that that's money that the national Democrats would rather be spending in swing states and in other parts of the country.",

Two of those three seats, Adam Schiff's seat in the San Fernando Valley just outside of Los Angeles, and Barbara Lee's seat, which encompasses parts of Oakland and Berkeley, are very safe Democratic. It's almost impossible to envision a Republican winning that seat in November or anytime in the near to medium future.Porter's seat, on the other hand, is one of the most heavily contested seats in the state, if not in the nation. Porter herself took it away from a Republican incumbent a few election cycles back. And right now, the race to replace her does look too close to call. And there are a lot of Democrats in Orange County and elsewhere in California who aren't all that happy with Porter for putting what they believe needs to be a Democratic seat potentially at risk.",
