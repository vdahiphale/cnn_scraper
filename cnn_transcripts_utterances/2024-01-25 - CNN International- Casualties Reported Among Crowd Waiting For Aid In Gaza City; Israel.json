      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome to CNN Newsroom. I'm Max Foster in London. Just ahead, a leaked audio recording allegedly showing the Israeli Prime Minister criticizing Qatar has sparked outrage. This as intense fighting in southern Gaza continues and the civilian death toll rises by the hour. We're live in the region. Then, a prominent Russian pro-war blogger has been found guilty of extremism charges. He criticized Vladimir Putin's handling of the war in Ukraine. Plus, lawmakers in France are proposing a bill that will put the rights to abortion in the Constitution. We'll take a closer look with the national debate.Beginning with pictures from near Gaza City where the Hamas-run Health Ministry says at least 20 people have been killed and 150 injured when shells struck a crowd who were awaiting a delivery of aid. The ministry said multiple casualties have been taken to hospitals. CNN is asking the Israeli military for comments. Meanwhile, Qatar is slamming Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, accusing him of undermining its mediation efforts in the war between Israel and Hamas. It comes after a leaked audio recording which aired on Israeli television, allegedly captured Mr. Netanyahu criticizing the Gulf nation. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (TRANSLATED): For me, Qatar is no different in essence from the UN. But, it's no different in essence from the Red Cross. And in a certain sense, it is even more problematic. I was very angry recently and I didn't hide it from the Americans that they renewed the contract on the military base they have with Qatar.

I'm talking about the one in Gaza City on the Kuwait Roundabout, which apparently thousands of people, according to journalists, were there waiting to receive humanitarian aid when there was some sort of strike on that location. Now, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza, at least 20 people were killed, 150 wounded. They expect the death toll to rise from those strikes. The wounded were taken to the Shifa and Al-Ahli hospitals in Gaza City.Now, apart from that, the focus of Israel's current offensive seems to be on the Khan Younis area, particularly on the east of the city. According to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, the Al-Amal Hospital, which is on the grounds of the PCRS -- PRCS, was struck overnight in addition to the Nasser medical complex, which are both in the eastern Khan Younis. Now regarding that strike, what the UN said were two Israeli tank rounds on a building in a UN Vocational Training Center. The death toll there has risen to 12 with 75 wounded, including 15 of them in critical condition. Max.",

Idan Amedi spoke to reporters earlier for the first time since being badly wounded whilst fighting in the Gaza Strip. Amedi is a star of the Netflix show \"Fauda\". He says shrapnel penetrated his neck and spine area, but thankfully didn't hit the spinal cord. Amedi said he'll need a few months' recovery and rehabilitation before returning to his acting and singing career and fighting, if he is needed. United Nations Security Council meeting later today to discuss the downing of a Russian military plane. Russia says all 74 people on board were killed when the plane crashed in the Belgorod region near the Ukrainian border on Wednesday. Russia accuses Ukraine of shooting the plane down. Kyiv, meanwhile, says it's launched its own criminal investigation into the crash. Moscow has claimed the plane was carrying Ukrainian soldiers for a prisoner swap. Fred Pleitgen has been covering the story since it broke, and joins us from eastern Ukraine. And it's very difficult to make sense of exactly what's happened here because we're relying on this incomplete information.",

You certainly had these claims and counterclaims going on, and really at this point in time, Max, I would say that there is probably more questions than answers out there.The Russians, though, continuing to stick by their story, saying that they tracked a Ukrainian surface-to-air missile after it was launched from Ukrainian territory towards the area around Belgorod and all the way to when it hit that aircraft, an IL-76 cargo aircraft from the Russian military. They say that they had, among others, among the flight crew and some accompanying personnel, 65 Ukrainian POWs on board and that everybody who was on board that plane died when the plane crashed outside of the city of Belgorod. Now, the Ukrainians are saying they have absolutely no information to verify any of that, and they accused the Russians of playing with the emotions of the loved ones who were expecting those soldiers to come home. I want to listen into what the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (TRANSLATED): It is evident that the Russians are playing with the lives of Ukrainian prisoners, with the feelings of their families, and with the emotions of our society. It is necessary to establish all clear facts to the extent possible, considering that the plane crash occurred on Russian territory, beyond our control. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Igor Girkin has criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin's handling of the war in Ukraine, although he denied inciting extremism. Girkin is a former military commander who played a crucial role in Russia's annexation of Crimea. In a separate case, a Russian woman has been sentenced to 27 years for the killing of a different pro-Kremlin blogger. Daria Trepova was convicted of killing of Vladlen Tatarsky.

      "sentences": "Yeah, Max. Staggeringly, I remember him back in 2014 when Russia was first invading Ukraine. He was the guy held up by Russian extremists as kind of a hero who was doing the dirty work of leading so-called separatist taking over parts of Donetsk, leading the fighting, and was then convicted of obscenity of Israel and the downing of the Dutch aircraft MH17. Remember, many holidaymakers killed in that. But, since the war began again in 2022, he has become part of this sort of inner coterie of Russian extremists who are criticizing how the war had been conducted very publicly as well.Now, the first one we saw coming to a sticky end was Yevgeny Prigozhin, who led that abortive coup. He then died in an enormously convenient plane crash, which most rational analysts think the Kremlin must have had a hand in. Igor Girkin, outspoken increasingly online, and while criticizing how the war being conducted, he essentially said Russia needed to be harsher. Now, I'm sure many Ukrainians who have seen their civilians bombed and seen appalling Russian tactics would essentially wonder quite what was left in the Kremlin armory to do that. But, he then got personal against Vladimir Putin himself. And that is ultimately, I think, the crime that even the most hardened extremist or nationalists end up being put inside for. He called Putin shortly after Prigozhin led that failed coup. He called him a cowardly lowlife, called him a bum, and essentially said he wasn't up for the job of leading Russia through these difficult times. He went a step further, saying he'd run for President. Now, that's always extremely dangerous to do in Russia unless it's at the Kremlin's behest. He wasn't able to register because he was already imprisoned by then. And now, we're seeing this sort of end to the chapter here with four years in prison, keeps him well out of the way likely of the future conduct of the war. But, it's also a signal to have two things, one that any kind of dissent about how Putin is running Russia, and particularly that invasion isn't tolerated, but also too, the Kremlin is still pretty paranoid, locking someone up like this in a high-profile way just for mince (ph) dissidents against how badly the Kremlin has been running this war, to some degree, although he seems to be doing better now. And so, it's a sign perhaps that Vladimir Putin isn't totally calm, and the whole Prigozhin affair has left him slightly unsettled, although still very much in charge.",

I think the Kremlin would have learned now there is nothing more dangerous than letting people flirt around and stir up dissent. That was the issue with Prigozhin. Suddenly, he went from somebody giving telegram videos criticizing the Ministry of Defense, to leading a march, it seemed, though, sending his people on a march towards Moscow. Girkin, a much lower level here, running something online called the Angry Patriots Club. But, it was their constant nature of their criticism of how the war had been conducted at a time, really, when it was going pretty badly for Russia. This led to this increased sense of paranoia, I think, from the Putin administration, putting something like that out of the way. But, ultimately, the ultimate crime here is publicly calling Putinnames to do that, kind of you're going to see the inside of a jail cell pretty fast.",
