Rescue workers are struggling to reach some of the worst-hit areas. They are being held back by destroyed roads, a lack of heavy equipment, and harsh winter conditions, including snow, sleet, and rain. And temperatures are dropping to near-freezing levels at night in Turkey.This image really says it all. That is a father whose 15-year-old daughter is now dead. He is holding her hand as her body remains trapped under the rubble. And in Syria, rescue crews found an extremely brave little girl, called Maria, comforting her siblings as they lie beneath the wreckage. And officials are particularly concerned about Syria where more than four million people were already relying on humanitarian assistance. Let's go to our colleague Jomana Karadsheh. She joins us live in Adana, Turkey with more. Good morning to you. You were there in the aftermath -- the hours after this happened. What can you tell us about the search and recovery efforts?",

And remember his last trip to the United States came when President Biden announced the fact that the United States was going to commit Abrams tanks to Ukraine. That opened the door for the Germans to take that momentous step as well.And it seems a similar track here in the U.K. -- the Ukrainian president coming here to Downing Street. He's already with the British prime minister. They're traveling in from the airport together right now, expected to walk up the street here. Zelenskyy is also expected to go and see Ukrainian troops training on the British Challenger 2 tank. The British were the first to offer tanks to the Ukrainians. But significantly, he is coming here at a time when the host nation -- the same with the United States with the Abrams -- a host nation, the U.K., set to offer Zelenskyy something he's not getting from other allies at the moment. The British are going to expand their training program for Ukrainian forces and going to offer fighter jet training on NATO standard aircraft. Not the planes just yet but the training so that in the future those Ukrainian fighter jet pilots can fly NATO standard aircraft. And also, Britain is going to supply longer-range capability -- capacity for the Ukrainians. And that's being understood at the moment to mean longer-range rockets that reach deeper behind Russian lines. The HIMARS the Ukrainians have always wanted -- that longer-range version it seems that the British are going to announce something similar with their weapon systems for the Ukrainians. So, significant gets expected for Volodymyr Zelenskyy here. And crucially, as is done on previous visit -- as he did with the United States as well, here in the U.K. making a speech later today to Parliament where he can expect a very, very warm reception, Don.",
