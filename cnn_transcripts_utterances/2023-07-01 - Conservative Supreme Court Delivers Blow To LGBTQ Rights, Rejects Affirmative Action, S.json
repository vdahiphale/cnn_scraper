Jim Acosta has the day off.The US Supreme Court has wrapped up its term delivering three momentous rulings that carry deep social and financial impacts. All three of the cases were decided by a six to three vote along ideological lines. The conservative super majority ruled that a Colorado web designer can turn away customers who want a same sex wedding announcement. The Colorado woman cites her Christian beliefs and the court rules, it is an issue of free speech, but many see it as a setback for gay rights. The court also ruled that President Biden does not have the authority to implement a plan to forgive roughly $400 billion in student loan debts, some 40 million borrowers would have benefited to varying degrees. And the court effectively ended affirmative action in college admissions. This means US colleges and universities can no longer use race as a factor when reviewing applications. Now I want to bring in Supreme Court reporter, Ariane de Vogue. Ariane, thank you so much for joining us. How significant is the affirmative action ruling for higher education?",

He basically said, if you're going to take race into consideration, the government -- it has to be a really high bar. And here the states, the schools did not meet that high bar. He said, basically, the programs serve to thwart the goal of a colorblind society. So now the schools go back to the drawing board. And there's a little precedent for this, because there have been a handful of states that got rid of affirmative action. So they've been working behind the scenes to try to work on diversity through race, neutral means et cetera with mixed results. Some states have spent a lot of money to try to keep diversity up in a race-neutral way. But what's interesting here is really not just about the schools. The schools are a pipeline to society. They really argued this in court, and it means that the schools send their students out, and now when they do, you may see less diversity in areas like medical schools, corporate America, all those areas could be less diverse because of this decision. And Justice Jackson, she really called them out on this. And she said, look, we don't live in a colorblind society right now. There is still discrimination and those programs were necessary.",

Sources also telling CNN that Vice President Pence was enlisted in this effort by the president as well. And while Pence did speak to Governor Ducey multiple times about the election, a source tells CNN he did not pressure him as he was asked to do. Now, if this sounds familiar, that's because it is similar to another call that President Trump had with Georgia secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger in 2021, when Trump asked the governor -- excuse me as the secretary of State to find enough votes for him to win. There are some key differences. First off is exactly the ask that the president made. Our sources tell us that the President asked Governor Ducey to find fraud, not necessarily to find votes, like he said to Secretary Raffensperger, which is a key distinction. The second difference is, our source tells us that there is no recording of this conversation that Governor Ducey had with, with President Trump, unlike the Raffensperger call where the recording was not only taken, but it was released almost immediately after that call in 2021. Now in a statement, a spokesman for the governor downplayed the significance of this call, telling us: \"Frankly, nothing here is new nor is it news to anyone following this issue in the last two years. Governor Ducey defended the results of Arizona's 2020 election, he certified the election, and he made it clear that the certification provided a trigger for credible complaints backed by evidence to be brought forward.\" None were ever brought forward.

There have been polls that have been 50-50 on that and there's polls in 60-40 the other way. I don't know if the court's decision even on affirmative action is necessarily out of step with the majority public opinion at this point.What it does is collide with the intrinsic reality of a changing America. And what you see from this Republican coalition is a variety of attempts now to allow people to escape broader anti-discrimination laws, on the grounds that it impinges on their religious beliefs. I mean, we just saw Gov. Ron DeSantis saw into law - signed a law in Florida that allows medical professionals to deny medical services to anyone that that they feel provides an ethical or moral collision or contrast with their own personal beliefs. I think what you're going to see in the years ahead is the attempt to take this beachhead that the court has now allowed and to see how far they would allow it to be expanded. Can people make the case that they have religious objections to treating unwed mothers or interracial couples. Those are the kinds of questions that I think they're going to come up as you see this, what I've called the coalition of restoration, working in all sorts of different ways through state and national policy to try to carve out exemptions from a broader move toward inclusion and tolerance on the grounds that it violates religious belief. It is worth noting that white Christians are now down to 42 percent of the population overall. White evangelical Christians are down to 14 percent of the population overall. They're only about 30 percent of Americans under 30. But they remain almost three quarters of the Republican coalition. And I think you see that driven in the state policies and as on many issues, you see that reflected in the jurisprudence of this Republican appointed court majority.",

The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act requires businesses with 15 or more employees to provide reasonable accommodations. Those could include longer breaks, shorter working hours and time off for medical appointments and recovery for workers who need them because of pregnancy or childbirth.Now estimates say the law more than a decade in the making could help nearly 3 million pregnant and postpartum workers across the U.S. Dina Bakst Co-Founder and Co-President of the workers' rights organization, A Better Balance, is one of the women who push for the law. Dina, thank you so much for joining us. What made you want to push for these additional protections? DINA BAKST, CO-FOUNDER AND CO-PRESIDENT, A BETTER BALANCE: Thanks for having me, Paula. We were hearing from women in low wage and physically demanding jobs on our free legal helpline over and over again who faced the same impossible choice. Can I maintain a healthy pregnancy? Follow my doctor's orders. And too often women were forced off the job and face devastating economic consequences. When modest accommodations could help them continue working and supporting their families. It was outrageous. We worked with women who were wound up homeless or unable to support their families, put food on the table, all because their employers refused to provide them temporary accommodations at work, and it was just outrageous and the law needed to be updated.",

And these are the people that greet you, the people behind the scenes that are cleaning and making the food and they have a number of demands, which of course begins with higher wages. And they're asking specifically for a $5 increase an hour. They're also asking for safer essentially work and they're also asking for better health benefits. And what they're saying here is that they would like to see a housing fund and that's because of what you mentioned. They say a lot of the employees that work at these hotels cannot live nearby and have to commute maybe two hours to get to their places of work. And so a lot of these union members are just frustrated and say that more needs to be done here. I want you to listen to one of those employees who says that she considers herself an essential worker. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
