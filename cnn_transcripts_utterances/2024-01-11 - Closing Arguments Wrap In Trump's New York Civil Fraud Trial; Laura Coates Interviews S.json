The strikes coming as the world tries to keep the Israel-Hamas war from spilling into a much wider conflict.The latest from the region is coming up on CNN. But first, why do we keep giving Donald Trump exactly what he wants? Tonight on LAURA COATES LIVE. Donald J. Trump got exactly what he wanted today -- and I mean again -- a giant megaphone to call the $370 million-dollar civil suit against him -- say it with me, we all know the phrase -- a witch hunt.

What's happened here, sir, is a fraud on me.\" And that's Donald Trump's closing argument. But will the buck or the $370 million bucks stop here?Well, now, I want to bring in former Trump attorney, Michael Cohen. He is the host of the podcasts \"Mea Culpa\" and \"Political Beatdown.\" He's also the author of \"Revenge: How Donald Trump Weaponized the US Department of Justice Against His Critics.\" Michael, thank you for joining me today. What a week and what a day it has already been. (LAUGHTER) It was today Trump speaking out during closing arguments, calling the prosecution a fraud, a witch hunt, things we've all heard before, despite, of course, the judge saying he needs to stick to only the facts. Then the judge ultimately telling Trump's attorney to control his client. I mean, talk about the drama. What did you -- (LAUGHTER) -- think in those moments? MICHAEL COHEN, PODCAST HOST, AUTHOR, FORMER DONALD TRUMP'S ATTORNEY: Look, I have never seen Donald look so preoccupied. I mean, he has the face of a defeated man on the verge of a nervous breakdown. I mean, it's why he blames everyone but himself for destroying his father's business. And no matter how many times Alina Habba or Chris Kise or any of these others regurgitate his talking points or their denigration of me, the one thing that Donald knows is that the bill is coming and that he can't afford to pay it.",
