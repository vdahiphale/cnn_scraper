We know it happened around 12But that's what happened to person drove into that barrier and then exited the vehicle trying to enter the FBI field office complex there and they were stopped by the security people. Now, we know that that person has been put in custody of the DeKalb County sheriffs they were taken to a hospital for evaluation and that includes a mental health evaluation. We've seen just in the last few minutes, there the tow trucks were trying to remove the vehicle from that barrier. They had sent in the bomb squad to look at it, to make sure that there was nothing -- no further threat in that vehicle, no bombs, no other weapons were found at the scene and what we're told is that he exited -- this person exited the vehicle. There with no threats. There was no -- nothing that he said that would explain why this happened, of course. So now that means that there's going to be further investigation where that person came from. We know from looking at those pictures that the vehicle has South Carolina license plates. We don't know whether that's where this person just drove from or whether there's something else that is happening here that is related to this incident. So at this point, the FBI and the local authorities are going to wait for that evaluation. You can anticipate that they will be facing both local and federal charges as a result of this incident. Nobody else was hurt. Nobody was hurt in this, which is of course, a thankful thing. But, Abby, as you know, there has a heightened concern for the FBI and for law enforcement in general about threats to some of their agents. We saw in 2022, someone tried to attack the FBI office in Cincinnati. A person was killed later on in a standoff with police.

We don't know what is going on here, but I think it's misleading and I'll be careful here to say, well, if there's mental issues or previous mental issues, then that's excused because as we know many people with mental issues would never do this.

Many of the demonstrators are expressing their anger at his government for not having secured the release of all of the hostages who were kidnapped during the October 7 attacks.

The plan of this protest, which began last night, this is day two. It should go onto Wednesday morning is to keep up the pressure on the Israeli government. What we saw when there were many hundreds of protesters out here last time, many thousands last night was, Abby, that there's a great deal of anger that nearly six months on, more than 130 hostages remain in the hands of Hamas and that this war we've been hearing repeatedly from protesters aimed because it wasn't releasing the hostages has failed on that front, but also they say is failing in terms of Israel's long-term security interests. And there's a great deal of anger out there about the images that are seeing coming out of Gaza as well.

And you know basketball really wasn't shown on TV, you didn't have these star players that were just showcased on television.And now that's what you see. Little girls are able to look up to women who like Caitlin Clark, like Angel Reese, who have so much passion and so much competitiveness and so much drive, it's exciting to see. And you know what?
