There were several sharp clashes as the candidates sparred over issues ranging from electability to the border, and whether Trump is fit to return to the White House. Haley has been rising in the race faced criticism from Ramaswamy and DeSantis. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RON DESANTIS, REPUBLICAN U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We beat the Democrats on election integrity, I have delivered results. That's what we need for this country. And you have other candidates up here like Nikki Haley, she caves. Anytime the left comes after. NIKKI HALEY, REPUBICAN U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We pass pro-life bills. We moved in unemployment from 11 percent to 3 percent. We took on the unions and we took on Obama when it came to the unions to Syrian refugees and everything in between. And so I've had a fight. And so as much as Ron says that that's not true. VIVEK RAMASWAMY, REPUBLICAN U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: After you left the U.N., you became a military contractor. You actually started joining service on the board of Boeing whose back you scratched for a very long time, and then gave foreign multinational speeches like Hillary Clinton is and now you're a multimillionaire, that math does not add up. It adds up to the fact that you are corrupt. CHRIS CHRISTIE, REPUBLICAN U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We've had these three, acting as if the race is between the four of us. The fifth guy who doesn't have the guts to show up and stand here. He's the one who has you just put it his way ahead in the polls.

And that, you know, from her standpoint is a positive if you if you're the receiving of attacks, you're clearly out front, and I think she handled it well. She showed again, her strength and foreign policy. Ron DeSantis did a good job of showing that he is a winner and a proven leader. And Chris Christie in the face of boos from the crowd, really continued to stick his fire to Donald Trump and saying Donald Trump is the one we need to take out.

And he's not doing that well in polls in his own state. I mean, he's about 50 percent approval rating in Florida. So he's been dipping there. And if you look at the beginning of the year, where he was pulling pretty strongly against Trump, he hasn't done very well. And we see he just keeps going down in the polls. And I don't think he's coming across as likable enough. His favorability rating amongst all Americans is around 32 percent.

We've always wondered why Africa has the megafauna, why it has these great grand wildernesses, these great migrations. And it's because of these water towers. Africa's managed to weather these climatic oscillations that have happened naturally in the past through this water storage capacity that naturally exists in these high-altitude sources. So these water towers are keystone to our future. They're unexplored, un-surveyed, scientifically misunderstood most of the time.
