You can see that business structure, just the dark plumes of smoke rising into the air. You know, a few moments ago we had to sort of move further back because were watching which direction the wind suddenly changed in and the embers were coming more toward us.Now it's a little bit back toward the original direction. So we're OK where we are. But you can just imagine how quickly changing the situation can be on the ground. This is a main thoroughfare of businesses where every direction we look there is either something that has been already burned to the ground or it's in flames. And I'll just pan a little bit around to show you. And of course, we're next to a grocery outlet where you see that mural, greetings from Altadena. Unfortunately, the postcard from this city isn't looking great right now. This business right here on the corner is gone. So is the business at that corner. I believe that used to be a dentist's office or laundry of some kind. In that direction where we're pointing is also a residential neighborhood. That's the way we came in. And passing through, we saw blocks and blocks of homes that had been destroyed, burned down to just the foundations. If we turn back over here, we can actually see another apartment complex that's on fire right there that's still raging on the other side. I did see a fire engine over there trying to put that one out. And so going up the street as well, there were some -- yes, that's still on fire. There were a couple of engines up there that we saw fighting those fires at those buildings. But they have more recently in the last few minutes just come tearing down the street to help out with this one. So, it really is moment to moment seeing which fire is worse. We already see so many people who have lost their homes in the neighborhood over there. And what's interesting, of course, in any fire is because of the random nature of how the embers can fly, there are some houses that have randomly stood up and are still intact and there are people around just trying to protect what is left there. As for everybody else, this is -- you know, most people have left the area. We are being very careful about when it might be time that we have to get out. But we can feel the heat from this fire right here. And we're a block away where this is down the next -- at the corner of the next block. So, you can imagine how intense that is for the firefighting crews who are just looking at a lot of work no matter which direction you turn, Jake.",

What Pete Hegseth said as recently as November 7th is that women don't belong in combat, in the military. So think about that. You recruit people and you say, you know, guys, you want to be in the military, come on in, be all that you can be.

Four are burning out of control in and around Los Angeles. For more on the federal response, joining us now, the Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne Criswell.

And what I want people to do is to make sure that they are continuing to listen to their local officials so they can get the best information on the actions that they need to take to stay safe.We know that the fires are not contained yet, that the winds are extremely strong still, which is limiting the ability for some of the aircraft to come in and support that. But firefighters are moving in. We've got firefighters from eight different states that have come in to support California. I mean, we will continue to send resources in to support the people now that have been impacted by this disaster.",

But despite that preparation, the fires are zero percent contained right now. They're growing. They're moving really quickly. What is your -- your message to people who are in evacuation warning areas? And also when -- when will there be some achievement in fighting this fire?",

And so until the -- the weather begins to cooperate with the firefighters, they're going to be able to then go in and start to make some progress. But because these winds are so strong, it's still so dangerous. And so again, people really need to listen to exactly what their local officials are saying because the fire can shift very quickly from one direction to another. We want to make sure people know where to go, how to get into a safe place so they can protect themselves, protect their families. [17",

California is very experienced at fighting these fires, but they also have to work with the -- what they're given, with the weather conditions. And so they will request what they need. They will bring in the resources that they need.And what we need to focus on now from the FEMA perspective is how do we help those people that have lost everything? How do we help them understand what's going to be the next step of the process? How do we help them understand how they're going to jumpstart their recovery now that they have lost everything?",

They bring in the head heavy tankers, the air tankers to come in and the helicopters to drop that water on these fires to send in more resources and fire trucks and personnel. But they can't fly right now from what I've been told, because the wind conditions are so strong.And so they have to make sure that they're protecting the people themselves. I have confidence that California, we've got staff that are embedded in the state EOC being able to help coordinate any additional resources. I think you heard President Biden say he's directed the Department of Defense to send more aerial equipment in. They've got to be able to get in there safely to support this. And so we just really need to listen to the incident commander on the ground and what his needs are and help make sure that we're getting the right resources in a place where they can fight this fire safely.",
