Smith is seeking a protective order to keep Trump from revealing evidence to the public before the trial by barring Trump from getting copies of evidence deemed sensitive and from taking down any personal details from such material.   Trump's lawyers say that order is too broad, limits the formerpresident's First Amendment rights. The two sides had until just five minutes ago to suggest times for the judge, Tanya Chutkan, to hold a hearing on that issue. She plans to have that hearing this week to make a decision.

They are not allowed to continue on investigating the case, in fact, can't investigate unless there are actually charges laid in front of the grand jury for them to consider. So it tells me that she may be just using some belt and suspenders here to tighten up the indictment a little bit and maybe fill in some places that she thought about after either watching some of the extensive interviews that the former lieutenant governor gave or maybe looking at the most recent indictment from special counsel. So I think she's probably cleaning that up a little bit so that it's ready to go. The process of presenting the indictment will be so quick. This thing could be presented in a day or two by a summary witness. It will in no way mirror the eight-month time delay that we saw with the special purpose grand jury.

Weeks into it, Western officials are describing to our very own, Jim Sciutto, an increasingly sobering assessment about Ukrainian forces' ability to retake significant amounts of territory. They continue to have difficulty breaking through Russia's multilayered defensive lines in the east and the south, which are marked by 10s of thousands of mines and vast networks of trenches.Ukrainian forces have taken major losses, leading Ukrainian commanders to hold back some units to regroup and to reduce casualties. And these latest assessments are a major change from the optimism at the start of the counteroffensive. Jim is going to be talking more about this with Gen. Wesley Clark here in just a moment. But first, despite these sobering assessments on the counteroffensive, Ukraine is claiming some advances in the Zaporizhzhia region. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh is near there for us. You have President Zelenskyy, Nick, saying the counteroffensive is probably happening slower than some had hoped, so getting some word of that even from him.",

But I think a lot of the assessments here are relative. I think Ukrainians certainly perceive the fact they've made progress near Orikhiv, out to the far east near Velyka Novosilka, and today said further progress was made in the Berdyans'k direction. That's three separate points along the southern counteroffensive line, all where we've seen them move forwards by kilometers over the past weeks. They would certainly point to that, given the level of Russian fortification they're up against, the minefields, as some reasonable progress.Remember, too, once those first fortifications are, in fact, breached, there are some reports suggesting they're not going to see as much Russian defenses as they progress further into those open spaces.   And one other important thing, too, I think to point out here, a lot of the Ukrainians we speak to say, well, yes, it's fine for you to judge the progress we're making, but you haven't really given us the equipment that we hoped for. Some of the equipment we've got isn't really the quality we thought it was going to be. And the real big problem here, too, Brianna, is their superiority. The Russians have it and the Ukrainians don't. The Ukrainians have asked for F-16s to take the Russians on and not got them. And so we were recently near a front-line position, frankly, seeing Ukrainian troops getting hit a lot by airstrikes, Russian airstrikes, causing casualties, slowing down their progress. And so I think when Ukrainians hear criticism saying, well, you've really got until the fall, they say, well, actually, we've probably got probably till the end of the year, till the weather really gets in our way. And also, too, perhaps feel a sense of frustration that the expectations put upon them were perhaps more due to American electoral politics, perhaps, than the facts of what they could do on the ground. They think they have more time. They see the initial progress they're making as perhaps positive, and they also, too, see, in the words of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, he said today, well, we may have fatigue in our eyes, but the Russians have fear in theirs. That may not be the case in all Russian front-line positions, but certainly there's been a lot of chaos in Moscow and behind those trench networks in the past months or so. And a lot of airstrikes - missile strikes by Ukraine on their supply lines, and we might start seeing that Russian cohesive defense shattering in the weeks or months ahead. There is more positivity amongst the Ukrainians we're speaking to about how they're going. They never thought this would be over in a matter of days. They knew this would be tough and it's tough for them, not for us in the West to observe how it's going. Brianna?",
