So the hostages looked to be in bad shape and it's time to bring them home. Natasha Bertrand is at the Pentagon for us. Natasha, let's begin there with hopes to see more hostages released.

The negotiations have been very slow. They only just restarted Israel originally pulled its Mossad chief back from these negotiations a few weeks ago. The Mossad Director was scheduled to meet with the Qataris to discuss this more. But that was ultimately cancelled because there were simply no concessions being made. Now we are seeing that start to begin again very, very slowly, very cautiously. The CIA Director as you said has been meeting with his Qatari and Israeli counterparts to discuss a potential restart in these negotiations. But of course, one of the major sticking points has been that Hamas has not been willing to release the women that it still has in its captivity, Hamas saying that they consider these women to be IDF soldiers. Of course, the Israelis saying that that is not accurate that is not true that there are civilians. So that has been a key point here that has led to these talks to stall. So we'll have to see whether there is any progress on this in the coming days. But as of right now, they seem to just be very slow going, Julia.",

The Israel Defense Forces appear to deny the claim. Hundreds of people are said to be sheltering inside the church. And the U.N.'s Humanitarian Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Processes left the Palestinian territories after Israel refused to renew her visa. Israel previously criticized Lynn Hastings for what a Foreign Ministry official called, \"Ongoing silence about Hamas's responsibility for the October 7th terror attacks that sparked the war\". The Israeli Foreign Minister cited what he called \"The bias of the U.N.\" Now in Northwestern China now the death toll from an overnight earthquake has risen to at least 126 people according to state media. This is believed to be China's deadliest quake in nearly a decade. Hundreds of people are hurt after a magnitude 5.9 earthquake hit the Gansu Province. Electricity has now been restored to the region says authorities, Marc Stewart has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARC STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Under a dark sky and enduring sub-freezing temperatures, rescue crews shuffle through debris desperately looking for survivors. The 5.9 magnitude earthquake in Northwest China struck late at night while many people were sleeping. The survivors are carefully carried out from the rubble and rushed to the hospital. They are lucky to be alive as the death toll is rising. Surveillance cameras captured the moment when the earth shook. According to state media, the tremors lasted nearly 20 seconds and felt more than 60 miles away from the epicenter. Video on social media shows people inside buildings running downstairs fleeing to safety as lights across the region shook from the ceiling. At a local school students inside a dormitory are forced to break open a locked door to escape. While others poured into the streets still in shock standing in the dark. Amid frigid temperatures these students are told to run and jump so they don't get too cold. And fires are set on a playground to keep warm. The cold weather gripping the area is yet another obstacle to the victims. As the sun raises the view from above reveals the extent of the damage, homes in nearby villages have collapsed. Thousands across the region are damaged. In some places water and electricity have been cut off. Mobile signals have also been impacted making rescue efforts even more difficult. While rescue teams still scurry to find survivors, there is fear of this quake may be the deadliest to hit China in nearly a decade. Marc Stewart, CNN, Beijing. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And thatfissure now four kilometers wide and its southern edge is only three kilometers from the Town of GrindavIk that you mentioned that's been entirely evacuated. The real question was which way the lava would flow once it started to emerge from this fissure turns out? And this is what we've been hearing from authorities on the scene dealing with that over the course of the last couple of hours is that, the lava flows are in fact heading north and east and therefore away from the town itself so some good news there. The other piece of good news as we watch these extraordinary images are the fact that we are seeing that the eruption itself is not as violent, not as strong as it was just a few hours ago. There was a time overnight when we were looking at 200 cubic meters of lava erupting from this every second Julia, so extraordinarily impressive pictures. The other big question everyone had as they started to watch this is as you mentioned, throwback to 2010 at that time it was the mixture of the lava and the glacial ice that had caused that ash cloud. No danger at this time. Flights still coming in and out of Reykjavik and it's expected will be continued to do so. The real danger now authorities say are the toxic fumes that continues to emerge from that fissure. And people have been warning authorities have been warning people not to try and come and have a look too close because of the danger of that. And there is some fear even now Julia that those toxic fumes could even make their way towards Reykjavik, the Capital which is not that far away. So still some concerns about what the consequences of this volcanic activity will be. But the immediate fears of loss of life or a huge disruption to air traffic systems appear to have been delayed for now, Julia.",

The Houthi say the attacks are a response to Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza and the Red Sea task force will not stop them. In Northwest China, the death toll from an overnight earthquake has risen to at least 126. Hundreds are hurt too after the magnitude 5.9 earthquake hit the Gansu Province. You're looking at a gas station as that quake hit. And many homes were also damaged. Rescuers are looking to debris for survivors. This is China's deadliest quake in nearly a decade. And a volcano in Iceland is erupting with dramatic bursts of lava. It's near the Town of Grindavik which was evacuated last month after weeks of seismic activity. The Icelandic government says the eruption poses no threat to life and there's no disruption to flight. Now in the United States nearly two dozen lawmakers have written a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland expressing what they called \"Grave concern over the signing of a Texas border bill\". The State's Republican Governor signed a bill into law on Monday which makes illegal border crossings a state crime. The measure is creating fear in particular throughout the Latino Community in the state. In the letter Joaquin Castro, a Democrat from Texas called on the Attorney General to stop the controversial bill from going into effect writing \"We urge you to assert your authority over federal immigration and foreign policy and pursue legal action as appropriate to stop this unconstitutional and dangerous legislation from going into effect\". Rosa Flores has more on the potential impact. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, 45TH U.S. PRESIDENT: They're poisoning the blood of our country.

Several nations in Europe including Denmark, Spain, Belgium, France and the Netherlands have also seen exponential growth of JN-1 and with it rising hospitalizations. For more let's bring in our CNN Medical Correspondent Meg Tirrell. Here we go again, I read this morning that this variant is now 20 percent of cases in the United States. How bad is this? How concerned should we be?",

      "sentences": "Well, this is rising pretty quickly here in the United States. If you look at the CDC's estimates for thevariant proportions over the last few weeks, you can see that this one JN-1 has really been rising pretty quickly from just about 4 percent a few weeks ago going up there now to more than 20 percent nationally and here in the northeast, more than a third of new cases. And this is expected to become dominant both here in the U.S. and worldwide really within a few weeks. And now, when we think about variants of course, in order for them to become dominant they have to be fitter than the variants that came before them. They have to show some kind of advantage. And with this one this is a descendant of a variant known as BA.2.86, which is part of that Omicron sub variant group. Now people were worried about that previous one because it has so many mutations in the spike protein, they thought it would really be able to evade our existing immunity. Now that one really didn't seem to take off maybe because it wasn't as good at infecting us. But this one has an additional change and it does seem to be even fitter. The good news though is that early tests suggest the vaccines should still provide good protection against JN-1. So public health officials are recommending if you haven't already go out and get your updated COVID booster, of course this comes in the face of increasing hospitalizations not just around the world, but here in the United States as well from COVID. Particularly across the Midwest, you're seeing on the CDC's map of increased hospitalization or hospital admissions. You're seeing higher levels in the Midwest. But really they are increasing everywhere, unfortunately Julia.",

Now it's Turkish delight for football fans as the sport resumes in Turkey after an attack on a referee last week halted fans going to matches. Amanda Davies joins us now.

I think it's fair to say there are still a lot of questions amongst fans and the football community uncertainty amongst Turkish referees about what happens next? What measures are going to be put in place to protect them moving forward? And we are going to be speaking to our team on the ground in Istanbul in just a couple of minutes in \"World Sports\".
