Federal prosecutors now have a tape of former President Donald Trump acknowledging he held on to a classified Pentagon document and suggesting he wanted to share it but had a limited ability to declassify records after leaving office. The tape is from a meeting at his New Jersey golf club in the summer of 2021 with the team working on Mark Meadows' autobiography. While CNN has not obtained the recording, multiple sources have described it, saying the tape will be an important piece of evidence for Special Counsel Jack Smith and his investigation.This new audio undercuts the Trump legal argument that he declassified everything. Just last month the former president told CNN this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: I have no classified documents. And, by the way, they become automatically declassified when I took them. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, Rahel, we've actually learned quite a bit of detail about what happened, though we haven't actually listened to this tape or seen the exact words that Donald Trump would have been saying on it.But the Justice Department certainly has this audiotape right now and it is an audiotape that reveals a couple different things from what our sources are telling Paula Reid, Kaitlan Collins and myself. So, on this tape Donald Trump is discussing a plan from the Pentagon, from the joint -- chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley, that was maybe not written by him but somehow given to Trump. And it is about a strike on Iran, the plan for the U.S. to take military action in Iran. Something that there were reports after Trump's presidency that Donald Trump really wanted to do that and people like General Milley had to talk him out of that, especially at the end of the presidency, after he lost the election. They were telling him he would start a war. And so Trump, at that time, July 2021, in Bedminster, at his golf club, he's meeting with people working on a book for Mark Meadows, his former chief staff. He also has some communications aides or at least one communication aide, Marco Martin, in the room with him. And he's very mad at Mark Milley and he wants to undermine him. And so at that time, in this meeting that is being recorded, that the Justice Department now has testimony about, they also have the audiotape, Trump is referring to a document, he can be heard on the audio referring to the document, he can be heard waving it around, that there's the sound of rustling paper. And then, on top of that, a very -- more significant thing too than just the paper himself - the paper itself that he's referring to, is that Donald Trump is acknowledging that it's classified. It's the sort of document that has national security secrets that should be protected, that he wants it out there more widely, and that he doesn't have the power to do that at that time. So, those are all very significant pieces that the Justice Department appears to have been able to get from this audiotape in locking it down. And, you know, just yesterday his -- we did get a statement from the Trump campaign. We also got a statement from one of his attorneys who was on CNN, essentially not denying that this tape exists or that this happened, but instead calling it a leak. Rahel.",

Is he merely waving around a piece of paper or is it the thing that he says it is. I say that because there are a few different crimes that could be implicated if, in fact, he's in possession or receipt of a sensitive document. Number one, mishandling or retaining defense information - defense specific information -- we gather that this is related to military information -- is itself a crime. Number two, the fact that it's a government record is itself a separate crime that one could be charged with. So, there's a lot going on here.

He sort of opened up this question of saying that because I declassified the documents, and I have the right to do that as president, then I can't be charged with a crime. That's simply inaccurate based on any number of statutes and certainly the statutes that the Justice Department appeared to be investigating when they searched Mar-a-Lago. They bolted out what the statutes were and none o them had anything to do with classification.What matters here, at least for that Espionage Act, is, was it defense information.

And then, separately, disclosing the information to someone else who didn't - who wasn't properly cleared to see it is itself a separate crime.And so back to your very first question here, what could be concerning to you, what would you be looking for in the video. If he actually knows that it is defense information and when he does - he is waving it around, if somebody else sees it, that itself triggers a different section of the statute. So, there's a few different things here. And like - you know, there's very few smoking guns. I hate that term. It's a TV term. A fictional term. But this is real evidence if, in fact, it is what it has been reported to be and could, you know, be used to really support criminal exposure for the former president, or those around him, if they knew what it was.",

First, it needs unanimous consent to get to the House floor. Unanimous. Which means every single senator needs to agree on a timeline before the vote can begin. Any one person could hold it up. Both Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and the Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, they are pushing for a speedy resolution. Now, for that to happen, the bill needs more than 60 votes to overcome any filibuster attempt. They also need to make sure that no amendment gets 60 votes because if an amendment were to pass, the whole thing would have to go back to the House again. Then they would miss the June 5th deadline. So, for leadership to review, yes on 60 for the bill, no on 60 for amendments.CNN's congressional correspondent Lauren Fox up on Capitol Hill in the middle of it all for us now.

He was in Iowa yesterday, New Hampshire today, South Carolina tomorrow. And as he is traveling on the trial talking to voters, we are starting to hear more and more about what his vision is for leading the country, what some of his priorities might be, what some of his policies might be. He has mentioned that he wants to fire the director of the FBI, Chris Wray. He believes that that has become a weaponized FBI and that he wants to get rid of Chris Wray. That's something that we hear time and time again. We heard a couple new policies that he was previewing yesterday. One would be to give back pay to military members who come back to the military after leaving because of the Covid vaccine mandate. Another is to make universities pick up the tab if students or former students default on their student loans. So, again, starting to get some of the contours of what he will be proposing. And also what is interesting to note, John, is that we are not hearing him go directly after former President Trump by name when he's on the stump, but he is kind of taking these indirect hits at him. It's when he gets with the media, whether on a radio show -- he talked with the media in Iowa when we were there earlier this week - that's when we hear him going directly after the former president, really sharpening those attacks. And we're really starting to see this campaign take shape. As you mentioned, the GOP field is set to widen. But a lot of people here in New Hampshire are very interested to learn more about the governor, about Senator Tim Scott. We've heard a number of names floating up. They certainly want to learn more about all these different candidates that might potentially be in the race.
