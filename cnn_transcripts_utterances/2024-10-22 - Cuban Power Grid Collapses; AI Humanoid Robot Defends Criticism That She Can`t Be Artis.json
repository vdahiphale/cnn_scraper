Cubans certainly are no stranger to power outages, butthis is very unusual, even for a country that is used to so many shortages and efficiencies like Cuba is. On Thursday night, Cuba`s Prime Minister, Marrero Cruz, took to the airwaves here to announce that there was a severe fuel crisis, and that more would be coming, but it was being delivered by boat, and that was delayed, and essentially Cubans would have to tighten their belts, and only essential workers would be required to go to state jobs, that many activities such as nightclubs and culture events would be canceled to save power. He didn`t give any indication, though, that this kind of blackout was coming, and it has shocked Cubans. I`ve been walking around the city, and you can hear a pin drop. There are some generators that are working. Here in our building, we have power for about another half an hour, and that is because the building has said they have to maintain fuel. No one is really clear when power is going to be restored. Cuban officials say they are working around the clock to see that happen. Already, though, throughout this island, most of the time, there is power outages, power outages that sometimes last for 12 hours a day or more. In the countryside, it is far worse, and it`s been going on for weeks. So very clearly, people are on edge. This is something that even for Cubans who are accustomed to going without, to having to make do with the little they have is somewhat unprecedented. And of course, the longer it goes on, that means people`s food spoils, that means they`re not able to work, other kids are not able to go to school, and people become more and more concerned about when power will be restored.

Well, the world`s first ultra-realistic humanoid artist uses robotic arms, cameras for eyes, and AI algorithms to draw and paint. And one robot already has its work headed to a prestigious art auction. CNN`s Anna Stewart got to talk with the artist to find out more about its process and the impact its arrival on the art scene might have on the future. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) AI-DA, ROBOT ARTIST:  I`m really pleased to have my artwork included in the auction and be the first humanoid robot artist to sell their work at auction.",
