      "sentences": "And I'm Erin Burnett. Welcome to this special edition of OUTFRONT. We are glad that our viewers are with us here and around the world tonight.President Zelenskyy arrived at the U.S. Capitol a short while ago. When he did, he was greeted by the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. They appeared on the speaker's balcony. And that underscores the significance of the Ukrainian leader's first trip outside of his country since the war began. Here is how this day is going. President Zelenskyy met with President Biden earlier at the White House, calling it a great honor to be in Washington, thanking the American people for their support. Biden then formally announced the shipment of the crucial patriot missile defense system to Ukraine, sharing that advanced system at a time when the Ukrainians may need it most. Something Zelenskyy has been asking for day in and day out, now finally delivered. And we are keeping an eye on the Capitol right now because President Zelenskyy is due to begin speaking in this hour. So, about half an hour from now, so we are literally watching that. We'll show you, of course, as he goes into that meeting of Congress. And we will carry every word of his address live. And our correspondents are here in Washington and around the world, including live in Kyiv tonight. All of that I do want to of course bring in our chief congressional correspondent Manu Raju to begin. Because, Manu, in these crucial final moments where Zelenskyy now is final preparations going to be heading into that joint meeting of Congress, you have new information about what's happening behind the scenes right now. Tell me what you know.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Zelenskyy meeting with other members of congress. And we are told our colleague heard from a source that Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader, who wants to be the next speaker of the House, did in fact meet with the president of Ukraine just moments ago.We saw pictures of three other -- the three other top leaders in Congress, Mitch McConnell who has been a staunch advocate for more funding for Ukraine, Nancy Pelosi, who, of course, was the one who was spear-headed his visit to the Capitol today. She was the one who was in charge of all the coordination here. She of course met with Zelenskyy privately. Also Chuck Schumer was there. We did not see pictures of Kevin McCarthy. But we are told that they did in fact have a face-to-face interaction. And that relationship will be significant, particularly in the new Congress if McCarthy does get the votes to be the speaker of the House. Behind the scenes even earlier today, there was a debate with Republicans on the Senate side of the Capitol where they talked about more funding for Ukraine. I'm told from senators who were in that meeting there was discussion about this. McCarthy suggested that this is the issue of fiscal responsibility will be a big focus for them going forward, suggesting there could be some constraints on more Ukrainian aid after this $45 billion in aid gets rolled into a larger bill that should be signed into law by the end of this week. But that doesn't mean that this will be the end of it. More money is coming. So this meeting could be very important. We'll see what we learn about the meeting between McCarthy and the Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. But Chuck Schumer who also met with him, just said that it was clear that they need to provide more aid. He said without the aid, Ukrainians will be in real trouble and could even lose the war. So that is the message Zelenskyy is delivering to members of Congress and probably what we'll hear tonight when he addresses the joint session.",

He's the National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications at the White House. So, thanks for joining us, John. Appreciate it. President Zelenskyy, I am told this evening, will talk about the peace formula that he proposed and brought to President Biden in their meeting this evening -- in this meeting earlier today.

When you think about everything that they're facing right now and Bakhmut, by the way, as CNN's been reporting, that's been the scene of pretty intense fighting in the last few days.These aren't guys that are sitting around drinking coffee all day. They are in the fight. And for them to take that time out and to send that message, that means a lot. The president was moved today when President Zelenskyy gave him a medal that had been awarded to a Ukrainian soldier. And the Ukrainian soldier wanted President Biden personally to have it in his possession. And, of course, the president will look for a way to personally thank that Ukrainian soldier. But that medal and that flag, those are tangible. You can reach out and touch them, stark reminders of the sacrifices that Ukrainian soldiers are making every single day.",

We are seeing the senators walking in as well.According to our reporters in the room, there are about half on the Republican side. It is mostly full on the Democratic side. Now, I was told that Nancy Pelosi was calling members urging them to come today because the House has been out of session all week. No one was expecting this to happen until yesterday. A lot of the Democrats listened to Nancy Pelosi. It sounds like they're there. The house Republicans, a lot of them are gone and are skeptical of the Ukraine aid. Because they are still waiting to vote on aid to Ukraine, which is wrapped into the larger bill to keep the government open, they are here. So we should expect to see virtually all members of the United States Senate here, even the 11 Republicans who voted against the funding for Ukraine back in the spring also to be here.

It's an investment that you can see paying off on the ground over the last ten months. Ukraine is doing so much better than anybody imagined almost exactly ten months ago. So he wants to tell that story as well. And I think, also, I asked him whether it was true what he had saidwhen President Biden apparently at the very beginning offered to evacuate him. He said, no, I don't need a ride, I need ammunition. He confirmed that to me. And he said I will still say that. Many, many military experts believe that he needs more long-range artillery, perhaps attack and surveillance drones, those kinds of hard-core military, you know, technology to fight this war. But, look, this is not for the faint of heart here. And the U.S. has put itself behind this fight because it's not about Ukraine only, it is about the entire world order that the U.S., since Churchill came to the Congress, and since the U.S. helped win World War II, this is the world the U.S. has built.

Would the U.S. under Trump leadership have given the financial and military support that it's given, marshal the NATO alliance, as it has done, led the NATO alliance? It's a fair question.I mean, there was a reason why Zelenskyy was seeking that imprimatur of U.S. support those years ago, didn't get it, because he knew the threat from Russia.
