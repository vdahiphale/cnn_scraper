The breaking news that we're following right now, U.S. Secretary of State Tony Blinken. He is back in Israel this morning. Blinken has been shuttling around the region for days now. This morning came out with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He's also meeting with the Israeli president. And we're standing by to see if Blinken will be speaking after these critical meetings.One major focus, the horrifying news that we're learning this morning the IDF says 199 people are now being held hostage by Hamas in Gaza. That's a huge and significant jump from what was believed to be the number of people taken after the Hamas terror attack. The latest from the Biden administration is that at least 15 Americans are still missing. Now we have new video also coming in showing the group growing humanitarian crisis on both sides of the border. There's video of hospitals struggling to keep up amid airstrikes from Israel who are trying to take out Hamas leadership in northern Gaza. The Palestinian Red Crescent says hospitals are running dangerously low on supplies including water and fuel in southern Gaza overnight. This we will show you is the scene where Israel see a scene where Israel directed people to move to Gaza officials say at least 10 people were killed. John.",

The United Nations wants to get supplies and aid in the United States very much wants to get Americans out. But unless Egypt and Hamas and Israel can all agree, it will stay close. Now, in northern Israel right now there is renewed fighting along the border here between Hezbollah forces the militia group that exists in Lebanon, and Israel. Israel has now ordered 28 villages within two kilometers of the Israel-Lebanese border. Ordered those people to evacuate.

But the United States Government chartered this enormous cruise ship so that Americans can get out because it is very, very, very difficult for Americans to be able to leave Israel. There are very few flights and those that go out are usually completely full. They're about 20 Something 1,000 Americans who contacted the State Department here in Israel, asking about how to leave not all of them wanted to leave, but they needed to know what the deal was in trying to get out.So all of these folks are being taken to Cyprus who made it onto the ship. They are basically a full 10 hours away by ship to Cyprus, where we are here right now at the Haifa port, where all of this happened. And we'll be giving you some pictures and talking some to some of the families in just a bit here. But first I want to start with CNN's Jeremy Diamond. Jeremy, we have Secretary of State Blinken. He is here for the second time in a week. That tells you a lot about the U.S. involvement with Israel as it tries to deal with the ramifications of the terror attack that happened a week and two days ago. Jeremy, what are you learning right now about everything? There are Americans that are trapped in Gaza. There are Palestinians that are incredible amount of danger trying to get out of Gaza. And of course, you have the potential ground offensive by Israel that is expected to happen at any moment.",

It is a true humanitarian crisis in Gaza where people don't have enough food, don't have enough water, don't have fuel, and just want to get out the civilians that are there, here in Israel. There's a lot of fear. Jeremy Diamond, as you well know, a lot of fear a lot of trepidation. But there's also a sense of solidarity here. Jeremy Diamond, thank you so much, for all the reporting there and what is happening from the U.S. side coming into Israel.I'll talk a bit more about where I am now and what has happened here. I am at the Haifa port. We are about 85 miles away from the Lebanon border. So we are in the northern part of Israel very close to Lebanon, where there have been sirens that have gone up over these past eight days because of rockets coming over from Lebanon. There have been some incursions on the ground in Lebanon between Israel and Lebanese Forces. The Hezbollah forces who are backed by Iran and a sworn enemy of Israel. But here, this is where Americans today streamed in from all around Israel, all around the country to try and get out. These are Americans that had wanted to get out from the beginning but could not seem to find their way out because there are very, very few flights leaving. Sometimes difficult to get to those flights. And all of the flights going out are generally completely booked up about 20,000 Americans had inquired with the State Department, not all of them wanted to leave, but they wanted to get some sense. We know that the huge ship that just left here and you're seeing some pictures of what happened about half an hour ago, with the Rhapsody of the Sea, a Royal Caribbean cruise ship that was chartered by the United States was put here in this port so that Israel, Israeli Americans, and a straight American citizens could get out. There were about 200 to 300 people that we saw most of them were families with children, feeling that it is just safer, better, easier for their kids mental health as well as physical health to be able to get out of the country for now. Every single family we talked to said though, they will be back. Let me let you hear, I think we have some sound from one of the families who we spoke to earlier today who was just about to board that cruise ship. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They want to aid folks who need it. They want to get supplies, for example, that they've been taken to the troops on the border with Lebanon, that is the folks here in Haifa. But ultimately, for the sake of the kids, for the sake of family members in the United States who are terrified as they're watching what's happening here, they decided it was time to leave.But they said they will be back. And they said they were felt so strongly about it, that they were going to come back next week potentially. And they said that they can't get back by air and by boat, they would swim.

What we've had until this point is images of fuel trucks lined up on the Gaza side trying to get into Israel empty fuel trucks.

I mean, you know, a cameraman that is employed by us witnessing that. But the question has been, there is an enormous amount of aid on that Egypt side of the border in a place called Irish.The UAE has sent enormous amount of supplies, as has Jordan. The U.N. has, you know, an enormous amount of medical supplies of fuel, of food aid sitting on that border. They need to get that through in order to support the near half a million or more people who have fled into southern Gaza. I mean, this is a -- an enormously complicated task. They need that border open. The problem with that border has been that Egypt does not want to see a flood of refugees going into the Sinai at this problem. They can't cope. Jordan has said it's a red line for them. They will not take Palestinians fleeing. Not that they don't support Palestinians, not that they don't. Absolutely squarely support the plight of the Palestinians but they say they cannot cope given the refugees that they already host. So this is -- this is difficult because of course Antony Bingham wants that border open in order to get the US citizens who are caught in Gaza through very, very complicated.

This would be the first aid getting into Gaza since the terror attack more than one week ago. Very significant. All right. With us now is Former NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe Retired U.S. Air Force General Philip Breedlove. General, thank you. In addition to that, which is a significant development, we want to talk about the other development this morning, which is Israel, the IDF saying that 199 hostages are being held in Gaza right here, small, hairy, it's only 25 miles. How does that complicate the ground mission? What will the ground mission therefore look like from Israel? GEN. PHILIP BREEDLOVE (RET.), FORMER NATO SUPREME ALLIED COMMANDER EUROPE: Well, thanks for having me. The ground mission is going to be hard no matter what. But these additional hostages are going to make it tougher. And we all know that Hamas intends to use those hostages. Hamas wants the world to see Palestinians dying. They want the world to see Israeli hostages dying and American hostages dying. This is their entire effort. The Public Affairs campaign is the biggest campaign now for the Hamas.",

All of Gaza is still in desperate need as we know of water, medicine, and food. The U.N. also says that its shelters in southern Gaza are now becoming overwhelmed. Most are not equipped for this kind of emergency, which of course is why people of the United States and Israel have wanted Egypt to open up some flow so Palestinians can get into Egypt in this time period.Show video -- we just showed you video of one woman who gave birth on Sunday, staying with her newborn in a school turn shelter in Gaza. The Palestinian Authority says half a million people have fled to southern Gaza from the north as this Evacuation warning has been issued by the Israeli Defense the Israel Defense Forces.
