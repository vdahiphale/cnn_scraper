In fact, this woman had been explicit. She testified to the committee that her sons' tragic loss occurred in July 2020, under President Trump. The Biden administration did not exist. I reached out to congresswoman's office for comment on this and to ask if she'd maybe delete the tweet or correct the tweet. Instead, her spokesperson, Nick Dyre, responded with profinity. He said that, you know, many other Americans have died under President Biden from drugs. And he said -- and I will sanitize this, he said, do you think they give an F about your BS fact-checking? So, an usual response from a spokesperson. I also reached out to the spokesperson about other false claims that Marjorie Taylor Greene made the same day at a different meeting lying again about the 2020 election, saying that President Trump won Georgia. He lost to thousands of dead voters, cast votes in Georgia, the number is four. And in response to that query, the same spokesperson responded, and I will sanitize this, too, F-off.",

But we know as a matter of security at the border, as a matter of public safety, we're not going to be able to prosecute our way out of this crisis. So, we need to be in the community as law enforcement leaders, as prosecutors as chiefs of police, leaders of the federal agencies. We need to be in homeless shelters, we need to be in the classroom.
