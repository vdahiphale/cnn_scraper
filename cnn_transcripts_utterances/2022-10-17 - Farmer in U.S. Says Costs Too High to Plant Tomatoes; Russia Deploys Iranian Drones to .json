Up until last Monday, things had been relatively quiet and peaceful in the capital. Life here was getting back to normal for the last several months. That all changed last Monday with this barrage of deadly missile attacks. And of course today now with this spate of drone, kamikaze drone attacks. Again, we have seen these Shahed drones used in several places around the country in the last month, but this is the first time we've really seen them launching an attack on Kyiv in this way. And authorities here saying that they managed actually successfully to intercept 15 of them. Now, I want to bring in now, if we're able to get him up on the line, the mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko. Vitali, I'm not sure if you can hear me. Hopefully you can.

By the second quarter next year, these economist see on average 34,000 jobs lost a month, and a little worse than that each month in the third quarter. That is quite a reversal, you guys, from what is a very strong job market right now, 3.8 million jobs added so far this year.MARQUARDT  And Christine, what role is the Fed playing in all of this?",

But now, economists are criticizing the Fed for being too aggressive. From \"The Journal\" here, \"Some 58.9 percent of economist said they think the Fed will raise rates too much and cause unnecessary weakness.\" The worry is that a soft landing is becoming more and more elusive. What is a soft landing? You've heard me say this, you hear economists talk about this, this soft landing, it's when the Fed tightens enough to lower inflation, but not spark a recession. It's interesting, Brianna, because the Fed has to solve the problem, but the Fed can make the problem worse at the same time.",

The US is a standout with the rest of the world. And most economists surveyed expect the Fed will eventually have to reverse course and begin cutting interest rates in 2024.And you guys, the other silver lining is, I want to be very clear here. These are predictions, nobody knows exactly what's going to happen. You have to have a lot of humility to be an economist or a journalist covering these economists in these times because as we know, the last two and a half years have been absolutely unprecedented. No one really knows with certainty how this is going to turn out. MARQUARDT  Yes, potentially troubled waters ahead. Hope your silver linings' prediction is correct.
