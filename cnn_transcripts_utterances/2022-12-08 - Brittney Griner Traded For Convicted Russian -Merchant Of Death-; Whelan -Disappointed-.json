The U.S. is now making final preparations to receive Brittney Griner on U.S. soil in a matter of within the next 24 hours.But the second thing that is going on is the recognition of the regrettable and unfortunate reality that Paul Whelan was not a part of this deal and that he will not be coming home. U.S. officials have described this decision and this negotiation as difficult and painful. But what they said is that in recent weeks, the Russians made very clear that Paul Whelan could not be a part of this deal. And that it was in recent days that President Biden himself gave the final greenlight to agree to this deal. What officials have basically said is that at the end of the day, the choice was not which American are we going to bring home, but the choice was to bring Brittney Griner home right now or no American home from Russia at all. So, I can tell you, John, that the pressure to bring Paul Whelan home that is not going to let up anytime soon. But of course, the big question is what is it that the U.S. can now offer in exchange for him now that Viktor Bout is off the table? John?",

He is charged with espionage, charges that he vehemently denies. But because of that, they were treating him differently. They were only offering to give up Brittney Griner for Viktor Bout. And we should note that U.S. officials also worked with the United Arab Emirates. And when the president of the UAE actually traveled to Russia, just back in October and spoke with President Putin, he offered to be involved in prisoner swaps. And a UAE official tells me that that is part of the reason that this deal got done today. U.S. officials thanking the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia saying they were also involved. We're waiting for details on that front. But the Secretary of State Tony Blinken is speaking here at the state department, making it clear that the Biden administration will work relentlessly, of course now to try and bring Paul Whelan home, but questions about how they'll be able to do that.",

I worked in conflict zones, but I was flying around harmless material.But a man whose track record through U.N. investigations with the work of analysts and journalists has, with some pretty convincing evidence, backed up the title as he's earned through a book, The Merchant of Death, for a movie starring Nicolas Cage fictitious to some extent, the Lord of War. Now, he denies all that, I should say, but he's essentially a man accused of flying small arms weaponry around the conflict zones of Africa, as I say, in the 90s and in the early 2000s. And that potentially, those weapons had an enormous impact on those conflicts, sometimes against the interest of the west. He's been accused of multiple other arms deals, all of which he denies. But when you meet him, as I did, 13 years ago, and months of negotiations to get him to agree to his last on camera interview in a Bangkok jail before he was extradited to the United States to face trial, over the charges he served 18 years for already before his release, today or yesterday. He was a very charismatic individual with a long history, a personal history with big geopolitical names. You'd know in some of the wars in Afghanistan, in Africa. I've seen home videos of him that show him pretty close to some of those conflicts, as well. So, a man with a very scattered past, always on the surface, denying any wrongdoing, but having this incredible significance to Moscow that they were willing to spend all that time, trying to stop and being extradited to the United States diplomatically over the past years trying to get him back to Russia. Some say that's just pure evidence, frankly, of what he'd done for Russia geopolitically as an arms dealer, which he denies. Others suggests perhaps a more complex history that maybe he served in the past with other Russian intelligence officials who went on to be close to Vladimir Putin, and therefore may be useful to the United States in that way. We don't really know exactly all about his past, but we do know, it led him to be so important to Russia, that they would go through all this kind of diplomacy at a time of the lowest relations between the United States and Russia for decades to get him home.
