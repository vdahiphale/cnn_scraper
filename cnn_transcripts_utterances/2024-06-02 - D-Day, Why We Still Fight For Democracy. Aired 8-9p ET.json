      "sentences": "Welcome to THE WHOLE STORY. I'm Anderson Cooper.On June 6th, 1944, American, Canadian, British, and other Allied Forces launched the largest amphibious invasion in history. Nearly 160,000 troops landed along five beaches in Normandy, France, in what became known as D-Day. It was a turning point in the war in Europe. World War II was fought against fascist regimes and Germany and Italy and Imperial Japan. The victory of democratic principles was hard won. But 80 years have passed since D-Day and we thought it'd be a good time to take a look at the state of our democracy today. Over the next hour, CNN's Jake Tapper looks back at D-Day, the sacrifices so many young men made on those beaches in Normandy that day and what it means to us now. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
