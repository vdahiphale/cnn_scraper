One of them was that he was putting him on notice about his conduct being contemptuous. \"If you try to stare me down one more time, I will remove you from the stand,\" Merchan said. In another one, Costello tries to interject. He says, \"Can I say something, please? And Merchan says, \"No. No. This is not a conversation.\" What was going on with this witness? MARCUS CHILDRESS, FORMER JANUARY 6 INVESTIGATIVE COUNSEL, ATTORNEY, JENNER &amp; BLOCK LLP:  I actually have no idea because typically, right, it's the judge's courtroom. And so the fact that you have a witness showing up the judge in any type of way is honestly, probably what we expected from Michael Cohen, which is why I was saying in some weird way Michael Cohen had credibility, especially when you compare him to Costello's conduct after the fact.

But Ted Cruz is someone who is facing a challenge from Colin Allred and Republicans nationwide know IVF is an issue for them. Women voters, suburban voters are shifting away from the party in many ways because of the stance on abortion. And when the abortion stance expands to things like IVF, which many Republicans support and many Democrats and Republicans say on the Hill this is not a partisan issue. Conceiving a child should not be something that's restricted by the government. So it's a sign that they know this is a vulnerability. And Ted Cruz, as being the spearhead of it, is a sign they know it might be an election year issue, too. HUNT:  Well, so to zero in on that for a second, I mean, there are some big differences between Cruz's opponent and situation now than when we have talked about it in the past. Texas is a red state, right? The idea that Democrats could win a Senate race there has been something that -- there's been a lot of hope and a lot of money poured into that, but it's never really actually panned out.

The third baseman set a team record yesterday after hitting a home run for the sixth straight game. The two-run shot in the fourth inning against the Rays putting him ahead of six other players in Boston history, including Hall of Famers Jimmie Foxx and, of course, the great Ted Williams. The Major League record for homers in consecutive games is set at eight. And here's the play of the day coming from Brewers outfielder Christian Yelich who literally stole a run against the Marlins last night. Check it out. The former National League MVP caught Miami's defense off guard here and stole home plate in the sixth inning to make it a 2-0 game. But the Marlins ended up having the last laugh, winning 3-2 in 10 innings. I know that now that we're starting to talk about baseball, Kasie, this has you very excited as a proud Baltimore fan. We're starting off -- we're going to have to start forcing these O's highlights in to keep you happy.",
