Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are targeting key battleground states as this campaign enters its final stretch. Trump will rally tonight in Latrobe, Pennsylvania. That's outside the Pittsburgh suburb. Though he criticized early believe voting in the past, he has urged Detroit supporters in Michigan to cast their ballots early. Tonight, Harris is headed to a rally in Atlanta where she's going to be joined on stage by superstar musician Usher. And later tonight in Las Vegas, former President Barack Obama will stump for Harris as Nevada kicks off its first day of early voting. So far more than 11 million people across the country have already cast their ballots with record-breaking early voting turnout reported in some areas. Joining us now to discuss the latest in the race for the White House is Democratic strategist Julie Roginsky and CNN senior political commentator Scott Jennings. Good to have you both here with us. We are in it now, early voting underway in multiple swing states. Julie, were starting to get some data, but what we do know for sure is that it is record breaking in some places. I'm looking at Georgia specifically, but people are voting in big, big numbers. What does this say to you?",

And I think that's the overhang from the last two years, especially after the -- after the abolition of Roe versus Wade, that you see that demographic, which really stopped the alleged red wave that was supposed to take place two years ago. They haven't forgotten and they're coming out very strongly. That's not spin, that's data that you see in places like Pennsylvania and places like Michigan and Georgia as well.

The Israeli prime minister and his wife were not there. Nor were any of his family it seems and so that's something.

Of course, Israel has been engaged in carrying out strikes against Hezbollah inside southern Lebanon and in Beirut as well over the course of the past extended period of time, past several weeks at the very three -- at the very least.

DEKEL-CHEN: Well, small correction. In the beginning, you said that he was 35. He actually -- we marked his 36th birthday a couple of months ago now. Look, Sagui is a father of three little girls, his youngest 10-months- old, he's never met for -- her name is Shahhat (ph), which means \"dawn\" in Hebrew.

These are all human beings. These are fathers, sons, grandparents husbands. There are also two women and two very little boys, the Bebas (ph) boys, who are my neighbors.

And I would continue you to ask all Americans to remember that. And for those Americans who consider themselves pro-Palestinian, which is completely legitimate. It's also legitimate for anyone to criticize this or that action of the Israeli government. But if one is truly pro-Palestinian, what they need to do right now, at least as much as criticizing Israel, is to do everything in their power at this moment, two days after the death of Yahya Sinwar, to pressure Hamas to end the madness.

We know that he's the one who appointed the members of the Supreme Court that overturned Roe v. Wade.So for him to say that he's not opposed to abortion is just ludicrous. The fact is that he wants to end a woman's right to choose. He wants to end IVF. He's OK with states limiting or eliminating people's right to contraception. And that's just a position that's untenable for women across America, for men, too, the idea that we're going to take away their right, as a family member, as a husband, to -- you know, to have a say over whether they're going to be able to have children. I know a lot of people who've gone in and had IVF in order to have children or are going through it now. Donald Trump and the Republicans would take that away. So we're fighting hard on that issue, and not just here in Nevada, all across the country. And I think you know that we won in Kansas on the issue of reproductive rights. We won in Ohio on the issue of reproductive rights. But it's on the ballot at the same time as the presidential election in Nevada, in Arizona, in Florida, in Missouri, and all over the country. Eight states, and many of them are very important to the outcome of the presidential election.",
