She needs to beat Ron DeSantis in this race for second place to get the momentum she wants going into New Hampshire. She'll go to New Hampshire regardless. So, while her focus may be on Trump, she can't forget DeSantis when he's standing next to her on the stage and he has to draw him into the equation. She says Trump is all about chaos. But DeSantis, in many ways, has emulated Trump in his handling of politics and government in Florida.

If she does well in Iowa, her second audience is New Hampshire. When she leaves Iowa, going to New Hampshire, which she will, she can say if she comes in third, it is your job to correct what Iowa did here. She can move forward regardless.

They have to come to a location and spend a great deal of time listening to people speak before they cast their ballots and so on. It's an organizational task. Trump's folks are out in the suburb, are out in the rural areas. His base, they're going to have to travel 10 to 15 miles. So, there are reasons for Trump to be concerned about turnout, complacency, the weather.

But what we've seen in the past, say, two or three weeks, is a real surge in her fundraising and a surge in her poll numbers, especially in New Hampshire.

Right now, we have over half a million people that are without power as we speak across the entire eastern seaboard. That's customers. Remember, that's not necessarily people. So, there could be several people to a household, for instance. And winds will be concerning today across the eastern seaboard where we could see gusts over 50 miles per hour.

There is no way they're going to reverse.The only question here is whether, for some reason, they decide they don't have the jurisdiction to decide this now, and it should be decided after the trial is over. But I don't think they're going to go that way. But they're considering it. It's clear to me, particularly Judge Henderson, is considering that. But she needs two votes, of course.

So, I don't think it's the right case for the Supreme Court to take and they might not do it.With respect to en banc, if he does that, it's solely for delay. If he loses with this three-judge panel and moves for en banc reconsideration, it's simply to run the clock. It's not going to change the outcome here.",
