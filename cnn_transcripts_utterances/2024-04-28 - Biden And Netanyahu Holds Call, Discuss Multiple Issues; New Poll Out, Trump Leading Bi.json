The White House saying President Biden just wrapped up a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. That call coming just days after the president signed an aid package, including $26 billion for Israel, and as Biden faces increased pressure to end the war amid big protests at college campuses all across the country.CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is joining us now from the White House with more details on this. Priscilla, what more are you getting on the readout from this call?",

      "sentences": "Well, the president and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke about multiple issues in their call earlier today, ranging from those attacks or those strikes, I should say, that hit Iran, that hit Israel earlier this month, as well as Israel's defense.And to that point, the president said, according to this readout, quote, \"reaffirmed his ironclad commitment to Israel's security following the successful defense against Iran's unprecedented missile and drone attack earlier this month.\" Now, in addition to this, they also talked about that hostage deal that has been ongoing. Those talks have been ongoing for some time now with top U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is traveling to the Middle East today. And they talked about trying to reach that deal and do so promptly so they can get those hostages out, but also get that ceasefire, the temporary ceasefire, so they can get humanitarian aid into Gaza. Another important topic that they talked about was Rafah, that potential operation that Israel has considered into Rafah. That has been a concern for the White House because there are over a million Palestinians that have been displaced that are in that region. And it's been a concern because the White House has been hoping that Israel can contain civilian casualties, and they don't see an operation there as tenable. They said in this readout, quote, \"The leaders discussed Rafah, and the president reiterated his clear position.\" So, clearly, the two leaders touching on multiple issues over the course of this phone call. The last time they talked was earlier in April. They talk often when they are in a pivotal moment or an inflection point. This is right now a very relevant time with those hostage talks ongoing and with hopes that there can be some type of breakthrough for that temporary ceasefire and for the release of hostages, Jessica.",

Now, according to these numbers that you see there on your screen, 49 percent of registered voters choose Donald Trump and then only 43 percent for Biden.Now, earlier in the year, Biden's numbers were around 45 percent. So, he's still those numbers are holding steady. And there are issues that are dogging the president and that his team is well aware of, one of them being the handling of Israel's war against Hamas that is unfolding in Gaza. Now, you've seen the protesters that have been happening across campuses. And according to our polling here, there is major disapproval over the president's handling of the Israel-Hamas war with 71 percent disapproving. And then, too, is the economy. And this has been an issue that the White House and the Biden campaign have tried to convey to voters that it is heading in the right direction. But we are still seeing in these numbers that there is still quite a bit of hesitation over whether that's indeed true, with registered voters here only 34 percent approving of the president's handling of the economy. These are two issues, Jessica, that are going to be front of mind for voters. That is what Democratic strategists anticipate at this point, especially the economy. And so, these numbers do not look good for President Biden. And, again, this has been a challenge for the Biden campaign. And as the president hits the trail, he has been touching on the economy and trying to, again, show the results of what his administration has done and how it's affecting voters in a positive way. But clearly what these polls show is that there is still a long road ahead for the president, Jessica.",

Look, you know, on its own, we saw in the Harvard IOP poll that concern about the war ranked relatively low among the issues that young people care about most.But it is reinforcing what was already happening, which is that Biden has struggled with younger voters really since his emergence as the Democratic nominee. I mean, he did not do well with them in the 2020 primary. They did rally around him against Trump in the 2020 general election. But his approval among them has been has been low ever since. And you are seeing, you know, what you are seeing on college campuses, there are, you know, obviously excesses. There are anti-Semitic behavior as part of it. But it is also a genuine reflection of a broad discontent in the Democratic coalition, especially among younger voters, with the extent to which he has basically stood arm in arm with Netanyahu as he has, you know, kind of pursued this strategy on the war. And, you know, you see in the CNN poll, Biden underperforming among young voters. Again, this is not the only reason. But when you start off facing a headwind, it is just another obstacle that he has to get over to get anywhere near what Democrats have gained among these voters in the past.",

And as Priscilla was saying, you know, the persistence of inflation, the fact that it hasn't gone down and continue to decline the way that the Fed was hoping, you can see that reflected in these polling numbers, both nationally and key states in the discontent about the economy.And similarly, you know, when you have this level of kind of tumult on college campuses, there's a risk for Biden of kind of getting hit on both ends of the swinging door where the visibility of this discontent, I think, will inflame the concerns among those in the Democratic coalition that are alienated and disappointed in his policy and how far he has gone down the road with Netanyahu. And then conversely, just the sheer disorder presents a risk to him. You know, Republicans believe that one of the problems Biden faces, and really this is kind of the political manifestation of the age issue, is that many voters think he just is being overmatched by events, you know, which is something that can really prove devastating to a president, go back to Jimmy Carter. And this, again, becomes one more example of that. So, it is a dangerous trend for Biden. He needs this war to calm down so he can begin to try to regain some ground among younger voters. But of course, Netanyahu's incentive is exactly the opposite. I mean, he wants October 7th to be as far in the rearview mirror as possible before he has to face voters. So they are, as on many fronts, I think, you know, operating on very different wavelengths.",

I mean, tensions and energy extremely high today. So, there was a counter-protest, a group of people who came out to support the Jewish students here on campus.That event ended about an hour ago, so you see a lot less of that group, but they're still here. A lot of them saying that the students here feel harassed, that they feel unsafe on campus. And so, you still have a group of supporters here. The problem was when the two sides would collide. And so, the university does not have police officers here. Instead, they have security guards. And what they did was set up a line of bicycles to separate both sides of this protest. Because things were getting violent, they were getting physical, so this is what they decided to do. Separate both sides so that they would not be able to essentially push each other and yell at each other. You know, they continue to shout and sing and say that they're here to support their movement. But they are divided at the moment, which has prevented a lot of that violence. Of course, on that other side, you have the pro-Palestinian supporters who are here in support of the students that are in the encampment. The encampment is actually a few feet away on the other side, and they have been blocked from these protests. So, what you're seeing is a lot of people who are not part of the encampment, but who are here to support this movement, who say they want to see this university divest from companies that are linked to Israeli companies and say they want to see transparency when it comes to the investment that UCLA and the UC system makes in terms of the money and where that goes. They want to see that transparency. So again, tensions are high. This division here has helped tone things down a bit in terms of the violence that we were seeing earlier in the day. But passions are still very high, and you're still seeing people who say they want to continue to be here to get their voices heard. But it is really important to point out that we've seen the violence on both sides. We've seen peaceful protesters on both sides. But again, just very, very passionate.",

The former president facing 34 felony counts for allegedly falsifying records to cover up a sex scandal that could have ended his 2016 run for president. In the week ahead, we could hear from some much-anticipated witnesses. You see some of them there, including Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen and former adult film star Stormy Daniels.Last week, the jury heard from David Pecker, the former publisher of the \"National Enquirer,\" about his actions to bury negative stories to help Trump win the election. They also heard from a banker and Trump's former executive assistant. Let's talk more about the week ahead with CNN legal analyst Karen Agnifilo. She is also a former chief assistant Manhattan district attorney. Karen, thanks so much for being here with us. Let's just start first with what we're going to be watching for in this week ahead.

Normally, we do know in a trial because the prosecution, as a courtesy, will let the defense know who the following day's witnesses will be and in what order so they can prepare. But here, they're not telling the defense because of the risk of witness intimidation because the way Trump's been violating the gag order and tweeting about witnesses. So, we don't know who's next.So, with that in mind and that caveat, this week, I am looking to see the prosecution continue to try and corroborate all of the details of this case through other witnesses before they get to Michael Cohen because as we know, Michael Cohen, although provides a lot of information for the trial, comes with some baggage. And, you know, he's been convicted of lying under oath before it, among other things. So that is what they seem to be doing because in addition to calling David Pecker, who I think was a really strong witness for the prosecution, he really set the entire narrative that this was about the election and this was all about trying to hide information from the electorate right before the November election. And he did a really good job, I think, establishing that. But after that, you started to see witnesses who were establishing things like dates, calendar entries, bank accounts, bank records, things like that. So, I think we're going to see a lot more of that this week. Sprinkled in there, I think we might also see some very substantive, interesting witnesses like perhaps Hope Hicks, Kellyanne Conway, people in Trump's inner circle who are going to talk about exactly what was going on at that time.",

It can be kind of boring, but at the end of the day, the records, I don't think, is going to be in dispute. They are what they are. They say what they say.It's going to boil down to what the witnesses say about the records and what Donald Trump's intent was. Was his intent, for example, as he's saying, to hide information that could be embarrassing from his family, that he was having a couple of affairs at the time with both Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels? Or was this about the election? So that's going to be what the case, I think, rises and falls on.",

Even within that, you know, that it still seems like they are quick, they're trying to decide what the right line is. Either way, the problem is it doesn't look like that trial is going to be happening before the election, and that in some ways is a win for Trump, no matter what the ultimate ruling is. So, I would expect that based on the way the arguments went and how complicated these issues are, you're not going to see a very fast ruling and the result of that may be that the case does not go to trial before the election and the voters might not know one way or another the facts and whether Donald Trump is guilty of those facts beyond a reasonable doubt or not.

We actually have a couple of tornado warnings right now that are right near -- kind of in between Waco and Bryan, Texas where we've had some storms that have had some rotation in them because we've got the atmosphere refueling after its busy day yesterday and the storms have been able to explode. So, here's the severe risk for today. It stretches from Des Moines down through Missouri, and then down towards Houston. This is where we've got that risk for some damaging winds, large hail and even a few more tornadoes. That risk for tornadoes is heightened there in the orange. The enhanced level 3 out of 5 from Shreveport down to Houston, that's where we could find the stronger tornadoes.
