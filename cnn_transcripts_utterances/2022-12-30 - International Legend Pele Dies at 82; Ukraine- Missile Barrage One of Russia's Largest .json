The Brazilian president says he, quote, \"transformed football into art and joy and took the name of Brazil to the world.\" The country's famous Christ the Redeemer statue lit up in Pele's honor. Now fans have been gathering outside the Santos Stadium in Sao Paulo state. That's where Pele got his playing start. And it's where his wake will be held, starting on Monday. His coffin will be placed at center pitch. And then on Tuesday, a funeral procession will carry it through the streets of Santos. Pele had been hospitalized for a month before dying from multiple organ failure caused by the progression of his colon cancer. His daughter posted this photograph with the caption, quote, \"Everything we are is thanks to you. We love you endlessly. Rest in peace.\" CNN WORLD SPORT's Don Riddell takes a look back at Pele's rise to fame, as well as his extraordinary accomplishments off the pitch. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DON RIDDELL, CNN WORLD SPORT CORRESPONDENT/ANCHOR (voice-over): When the world knows you by just one name, you have truly succeeded. Pele is regarded by many as the greatest footballer of all time. His humble demeanor and generous spirit have guaranteed his legacy as a global icon.",

The most important, respect the people.RIDDELL (voice-over): Raised in the slums of Sao Paulo in the 1940s, Edson Arantes de Nascimento discovered football at a young age. He made his debut for Santos at the age of just 16. And within a year, he was scoring goals for the Brazilian national team. By this time, he was better known by his nickname, Pele. And in 1958, at 17, he became the youngest man to play in a World Cup final, scoring twice as Brazil beat Sweden. It was the first of three world titles he'd help win for his country. He electrified audiences with his fancy footwork and ability to score seemingly impossible goals. So it was something of a disappointment that his 1000th goal was a penalty.",

Obviously, we always hold that positive -- that positivity that there are some who may have been able to protect themselves from the impact of this fire. But we can see, from the pictures that these rescue workers have to go through these charred, mangled ruins of a hotel to find these people. I think one of the most disturbing aspects of the story, Michael, is that some of them, it's suspected, would have been trapped in their bedrooms. We know that hundreds of people would have been in the hotel. As you'll see now, some people might have resorted, and indeed, did resort, to the unthinkable to get out. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TANK (voice-over): Desperate to survive, this man attempts to escape. Teetering on the edge. Harrowing scenes, in the Cambodian casino town, of Poipet as a huge fire rips through the Grand Diamond City Hotel. A rescue worker says the blaze started in one of its restaurants, moving so fast that by the time they got there, most of the buildings were on fire. The rescue worker says he saw at least two people jump to what they thought was safety. Others were left severely injured. Around 700 Thais were rescued, taken to Thai hospitals. For some, though, it was too late. Officials said many of the dead, trapped in locked rooms when the electricity went out, taken by a silent killer. Where the fire didn't go, the smoke did. As dawn broke, onlookers struggled to see past thick, acrid smoke, still billowing across the sky. Over the coming days, rescue teams face the grim task of recovering the dead and answering the tough questions: How and why. (END VIDEOTAPE) TANK (on camera): And I'm sure that a lot of the families that would have lost loved ones, Michael, will have exactly those questions. We do know that the Cambodian government is, and has, put together a committee to investigate the cause of the fire. All we know from the rescue teams in the initial moments of this, what has become a catastrophe at this hotel, is that it may have started in a restaurant on the lower levels, and then spread upwards. And as you see from the pictures, absolutely engulfing the hotel.",
