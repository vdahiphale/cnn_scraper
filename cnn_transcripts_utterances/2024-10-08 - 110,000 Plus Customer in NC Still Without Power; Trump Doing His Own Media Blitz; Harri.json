Because, of course, we have rural counties around us that have been devastated as well. So, we are seeing a lot of support.I'll just give you one example, FEMA drilled a well for our hospital, our major hospital in the center of the city, a 750-foot well, they did that this last week. That's just an example of the kinds of help we're seeing, but also for individuals who need relief, who have experienced damage to their homes damage they're unable to work because of this disaster. So, we have FEMA representatives throughout this area that are helping people sign up to get the relief that they're entitled to.",

But, Larry, I do want to ask you about this new poll from The New York Times and Siena College this morning. It finds Kamala Harris making some progress among likely voters. Harris with support from 49 percent to Trump 46 percent nationally. As you and I've said many times, we don't vote in a national election in this country, we don't do a national popular vote in terms of determining the outcome. But it does look as though she is gaining somewhat. What's your sense of all these polls right now and where the race is? SABATOWhether it's true or not, the average is about there, I think the average is around three, and they have plus four. But you never know how many of those votes are coming from California, wasted votes, really, not that anybody's vote is wasted, but wasted in terms of the Electoral College. You only need to win by one vote per state in order to win all the electoral votes from that state. Now, what was more interesting, Jim, was the Florida result. According to The New York Times/Siena poll Harris is behind by 13 points. Trump is ahead by 13 points. That's way above the polling average, which is around 4 percent, 5 percent in Florida. Now, look, that as the pollster that works for The Times, Nate Cohn, pointed out, that's actually good news for Harris if it's true. I don't know if I believe it, but if it's true.

My restaurant's one of the lowest places in Cortez, Florida. And we got about three and a half foot of water on the last one. And fortunately -- or unfortunately or fortunately, I've been with Hurricane Relief. So, right away, my walk-in works. So, we started serving hot dogs to first responders and such.
