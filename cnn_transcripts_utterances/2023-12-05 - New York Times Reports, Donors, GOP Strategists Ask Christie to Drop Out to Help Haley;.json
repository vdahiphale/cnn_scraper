Will the fourth Trump-free Republican presidential primary debate sway any voters' minds? Those are the key party-rattling questions this morning with key dates fast approaching.The New York Times is reporting now Chris Christie is right now feeling the public pressure to drop out of the race. This is from his donors, GOP strategists and pundits who instead want him to support Nikki Haley. As for Liz Cheney, the fiery Trump critic and longtime conservative, tells The Washington Post this morning that she has not ruled out a third-party run. Tomorrow night's Republican debate stage will have the fewest podiums so far, just four candidates qualify as Trump prepares to ditch the formality again. And here are those key dates, tomorrow night's debate, and then just 42 days from now, the first major 2024 test, as Iowa holds its Republican presidential caucuses on January 15th. And January 23rd, New Hampshire holds its primary election. CNN's Kristen Holmes is joining now with more on all of the rumblings that are happening right now surrounding this debate. Trump, of course, going to skip it again. What do you know?",

It's likely the same group that we are seeing talking to Chris Christie right now. They believe that he is actually taking votes away, that Liz Cheney would take votes away from Trump. Now, all of this is coming at a time where we are seeing amplified fringe rhetoric from the former president on the campaign trail bleed over into his legal problems. We know his lawyers have been asking the Justice Department for more information on fringe conspiracy theories regarding January 6. Sara?",

You can see the cover, if Trump wins, in which writers imagine what a new Trump term would entail.David Frum, a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush, put it this way in the magazine, quote, the existing constitutional system has no room for the subversive legal maneuvers of a criminal in chief. If a president can pardon himself for federal crimes, as Trump would likely try to do, then he could write his pardon in advance and shoot visitors for the White House. For that matter, the vice president could murder the president in the Oval Office, then immediately pardon herself. And David Frum joins us now. Thanks so much for being with us, David.

Although when we look back at the past, we know there have been all kinds of catastrophic events in it. And yet when we look forward, we can't imagine those things happening to ourselves. So, this is a work of imagination.When Donald Trump runs for the second time, as he does, should he win, if he is sworn in, he will be under four sets of criminal indictments, two federal, two state. He will have his companies be on the verge of dissolution in civil proceedings in New York. He may be on criminal trial already. He may be convicted already. He's the chief law enforcement officer of the United States. He may be a proven criminal or on his way to being one. His first priority is going to be to rip apart the legal system of the United States. He'll have to do that for self-preservation.

This is the time to start thinking about this.One of the things I say in the article is that Donald Trump's defeat does not solve any important problem for the United States. There are a lot of issues that we have to argue about. This is what Liz Cheney was saying in that pack.

The United States in the 1790s didn't have police forces, the military was all there was, the military and the militia. Today, there are police forces and they keep order in the cities. But Donald Trump, as he contemplated, how would he seize power in 2021, had this fantasy that he could use the military. And that means, in a second Trump term, the military is going to be flooded with illegal orders from the president and every general is going to have to think every time they get a piece of paper from the Oval Office, is this legal or is this not?They don't take an order to the president but he doesn't believe that. They take an order from -- to the -- they take an oath to the Constitution and the president's orders are checked against the Constitution. So, it's going to be crisis upon crisis upon crisis, dissolution of military civilian relations. That's what we face, chaos with a second Trump term.",

So, I think people do recognize the truth.Look, Donald Trump has never gotten much above 46 percent of the vote in the United States. You look at the six elections from 2000 to 2020, 12 major party candidates, stacked the candidates in order of their share of the vote, Donald Trump ranked 10th and 11th. Mitt Romney did better. Al Gore did better. John Kerry did better. Trump fluked into office and then he was decisively beaten out of office. There is an anti-Trump majority in this country. And that has to be activated. It has to be inspired. But when it is, in 2018, it came out to stop him in the House. In 2020, it came out to boot him from the presidency, 2021 to deny him a majority in the Senate, 2022, Trump election deniers were punished in the states. It's there. It just needs to be woken.",

Many believe that Hamas commanders, leaders, command and control centers, if you can call them that, may be in Khan Younis. And we also know, however, that, as a result of the fighting, the U.N. says they can't get any aid to the city. Residents apparently have seen leaflets dropped from the sky by the Israelis, telling them to stay where they are, or if they're in a dangerous place, to move to hospitals and other areas where they might be safer. But this certainly does represent a major escalation in terms of the operation south of what's known as Wadi Gaza, which was sort of the initially the line south of which Gazans were told they were safe. Now, of course, there are massive parts of Southern Gaza that aren't safe. We know that tens of thousands of people are trying to move away from the fighting. But what we understand is that they are moving to areas where there's nothing in the way of infrastructure in terms of sanitation, shelter, food, clean water. And as a result, things are only getting worse. A variety of international aid organizations, U.N. agencies, have been ringing the alarm bells that the humanitarian situation in Southern Gaza, which was bad already, is now going to get dramatically worse.

When you think about it, there really got to be three different parts to it. One is an investigation into the intelligence failure. How is it that the most vaunted intelligence system that we've known in the past two decades, one that presumably had the Gaza completely wired up, managed to miss an attack like this that was in the planning for so long? The second big question is, if they did get parts of it, and we know from my colleagues at the New York Times' reporting that, in fact, there was a full plan from Hamas that the Israelis had that looked very much like what ultimately happened on October 7th, why was that not communicated up the chain or taken seriously if it was?

The standard here is, have you done everything you can to protect civilian life. And that's going to be the really hard question. It was a hard question in the north. It's a much harder question now in the south, because Israel's first message to people in the north was move to the south. So, they moved there. They're without homes. Most of the population has been displaced. And now they're in areas that are out in the open, and the question is, can Israel, with more surgical attacks, manage to lower the civilian count dramatically?
