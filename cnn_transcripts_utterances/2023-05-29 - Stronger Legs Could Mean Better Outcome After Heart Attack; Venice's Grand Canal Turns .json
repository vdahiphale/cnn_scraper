Research suggests squats and lunges could pay dividends for people who have had a heart attack. CNN health reporter Jacqueline Howard joins us now. Jacqueline, you spoke with the researchers behind this study that looks specifically at a patient's quads. So I'm wondering what the connection here -- I'm guessing circulation?",

CNN's Barbie Nadeau reports from Italy.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BARBIE NADEAU, CNN CONTRIBUTOR (voice-over): Venetians are used to just about anything happening in their beloved Grand Canal. Tourists jumping into it, even surfing in it. They're used to high water, low water. But on Sunday, they were seeing green. At first one city official was sure it was another episode of climate activism. Giving the term \"Going Green\" a whole new meaning. None of the groups usually involved took credit. Instead the region's president announced on Twitter that authorities believe a tracing agent used in small quantities to find leaks in underwater structures somehow got spilled into the water. He says it isn't dangerous for the canal's flora or fauna and hopes it doesn't give climate activists any ideas for their next stunt. Officials say they don't know how long it will keep the canal system looking like slime or exactly how to get rid of it. Barbie Latza Nadeau, CNN, Rome. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

This is the first time that a Texas Attorney General has been impeached by the state and you also have more than half of the Republicans in the Texas statehouse voting to do so.The only two other times there has been an elected official that's been voted to be impeached in the state of Texas was in 1917, and that was the governor at the time. And then in 1975, that was an elected judge. But it's not just Republicans who are voting obviously to impeach him in the House of Representatives there in the state, Democrats are speaking out as well.

Finding and keeping life guards is critical right now. We should note that according to the American Academy of Pediatrics, 70 percent of drowning deaths for children 15 years old and younger happen between May and August, in summer time. Now cities across the country are upping their lifeguard recruitment efforts by offering things such as signing bonuses, incentive pay, higher hourly wages, also free lifeguard training.

It's the cities throughout the country, are being affected by this lifeguard shortage. Keeping that in mind, let me give you perspective just with New York City alone.It takes about 1,400 lifeguards to safeguard the city's beaches and pools. The city -- the Parks and Rec Department -- saying they'll be lucky to make it to 900 lifeguards from last year. And that's why here today not a lot of people are braving the waves here, certainly braving this wicked, just absolutely wicked wind on this Memorial Day. And this issue of staffing, it really has been around for several years now. The spokesperson for the American Lifeguard Association estimating that about half of the public pools throughout the country will likely be affected in the coming months, either because they have to close or because of reduced hours. That same spokesperson also has said recently that, yes, there are some cities trying to really boost up those recruitment efforts, but in many cases they're falling short. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
