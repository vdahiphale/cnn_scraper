Our CNN White House team reporting team Biden is under no illusions. This visit to Florida will boost Charlie Crist in the governor's race there or Val Demings in her Senate campaign. But the hope at the White House is that it helps some in Florida and elsewhere.Also important to note, there are two fundraisers on the President's schedule in Florida. He may not be welcome in many of the key battleground states, but his ability to raise money is a giant help for Democrats in the midterm campaign year that is shattering spending records. Our great reporters back at the table with us. It is interesting that, you know, the North Star of the first midterm election is always the President. His approval rating is underwater. He's not being asked -- Barack Obama's in Arizona -- I mean, in Nevada today, he's going to Arizona later. Biden's not being asked to go to those places.",

      "sentences": "Right. Biden's closing night arguments are going to be in Maryland, right, which is the democratic state. But two things. Biden also has his eye on 2024. And in Florida, Biden actually has an audience that can be very responsive to part of his message and the Democrats message. It may not be enough to save things for Charlie Christ, or for Val Demings, but the health care argument is especially salient in the state, with so many older Americans.And Democrats work to pass legislation to try to overtime make prescription drugs cheaper, allow negotiations. That's a very potentially strong argument for Democrats. It's been a little bit lost in a year where we're talking about the price of gas or inflation or COVID malaise or all this kind of stuff. But the truth of the matter is healthcare is what won it for Democrats the last two cycles and now in the very last week, they're going back to it.",

He's, according to people who have talked to him, he's watching very closely to see who's inviting him, who's endorsing him early, who's talking about wanting him and supporting his policies and standing up for the Biden agenda and all of the things that he's passed legislatively, even though he's not personally popular.So he's looking very closely to see where he can be effective as well as whether or not Democrats want him on the campaign trail in 2022 as a bit of a proxy as to whether they want him as their nominee in 2024.",

That's the unemployment rate during my tenure. How many jobs have been added since Joe Biden became president? 10 million jobs.You would think he'd be on the campaign trail saying, this is good. The problem is inflation, it masks all that. And you just look at gas prices a year ago, gas prices at their peak, gas prices today down from the peak, but still up from a year ago. That's why it's complicated for the President. If you could just do jobs and unemployment, Democrats would be bragging, but.",

I mean, it's really in some cases, just that simple. And the challenge for the administration all along has been to try to tout their accomplishments while also acknowledging the pain that people are feeling. And I know when I talk to Republicans, they feel that it's been good for them that the White House hasn't in their view always gotten it right. And that that's what they're hearing from voters that the White House doesn't seem to understand how tough things are. I mean, the economy it's a very weird thing right now. And I think that's part of what's unsettling for voters and for all of us, to have an unemployment rate so low, inflation so high, the housing market so uncertain, people's 401(k)s don't look as good as they did before and nobody seems to know exactly how this plays out. That's a tough place to be when you're trying to pitch people on reupping the policy.",

Remember, Barack Obama carried the state in 2008 because of historic African American turnout. But Democrats tried and failed in 2012, in 2016 and in the 2020 presidential races. This year, the Democratic Senate candidate Cheri Beasley is in a very close race against Republican Ted Budd.Now Republicans point to those last three presidential cycles and they bet Democrats will again be disappointed in the end. CNN's Isaac Dovere just took a close look at the race. His report includes this. \"Democrats have spent the past few months side-eyeing Beasley, a former State Supreme Court Chief Justice, as their sleeper insurance policy for holding the evenly divided Senate.\" Isaac is with us now to join the conversation. Sleeper insurance policy because Democrats are worried they may lose one or more of their own, their current seats and so they have to look at these states where Republicans now hold them and hope for one or two. EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER: Yes, I would say they're very worried that they might lose, especially in Nevada and thinking about how you do the math and to get to 50 so that Kamala Harris would be 50 plus one. And North Carolina is the state like as you said, it's -- since 2008, it seemed to be almost there for Democrats. And each time it's fallen short, including of course in the Senate race in 2020 when the Democratic candidate then had a big scandal, an extra mile an affair, but he ended up pulling down Joe Biden and Biden thought that he might win North Carolina too. He lost by close margin. Now when -- talking to people on the ground in North Carolina, what they say is Democrats are like maybe we can do this, maybe but they also talk about how it's sort of managing their heartbreak ahead of time and thinking it's just going to be so hard given that it keeps coming up just short for them.",

And again, Republicans say the state will go back to its DNA, its DNA is still red. We will eke this one out.Interesting though, look at this Cheri Beasley ad, your nationally, you know, inflation hurts Democrats. She's trying to make the case. She's a former State Supreme Court Chief Justice. She is not of Washington. Ted Budd is a Republican congressman. Sometimes congressmen have problems especially their first time they try to run statewide. She says blame him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHERI BEASLEY, CANDIDATE FOR U.S. SENATOR: Costs are too high. Wages aren't keeping up. You can't afford necessary prescription drugs and you have to make tough choices every day. And Washington politicians like Congressman Ted Budd aren't listening.

So she can point to Washington and say, if you want change, even though I'm the Democrat in this race, vote for me and not for the person who's been in Congress, who's been a career politician.And so that is a message that she's pushing. She also has the opportunity to say, I'm a judge, and all of these crime attacks that are going against Democrats don't work against me, because I've put people behind bars for crime. And so she is a unique candidate that the Democrats have. It is a difficult state for Democrats that has been for the last decade plus, but it's an interesting place where they may have a chance.",

Everything seems like it's already baked in, like this is a prime example of one of the races where it's not baked in.And it could go either way. And whichever party you're in, or whatever your affiliation is, whether you vote actually matters. It's also a case where Budd is part of this group of there's a few of these Republican Senate nominees who, their own weaknesses of candidate gives the Democrats a chance that might not have had and I think this is an example of that.",

So you look at this race. You have North Carolina, a Republican health seat right now. The incumbents not running again. You have Pennsylvania, a Republican health seat, the incumbents are not running again. You have Ohio, another Republican health seat, the incumbents are not running again. You have Wisconsin, a Republican health seat with the incumbent is running.

The one thing I would say about North Carolina that I think is a challenge is that it really is more than -- and I would put Nevada in the same category -- they're kind of generic ballot tests Senate races. They don't necessarily have candidates that really stand out. There's no John Fetterman or even Ron Johnson, right, where people have strong opinions about certain people that are going to affect things.They are very much going to be dictated by the national mood. And I think that's why it's a little bit of a pipe dream for Democrats in North Carolina to be hoping for this just because if the environments moving for them, I think it's going to move North Carolina before it may move another race like Pennsylvania for example.",
