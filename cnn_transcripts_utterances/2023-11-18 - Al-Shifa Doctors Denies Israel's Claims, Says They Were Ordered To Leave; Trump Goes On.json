I'm Paula Reid in Washington.More than 200 hostages are believed to still be inside Gaza tonight six weeks after being taken captive from Israel by Hamas. Today, thousands gathered at a massive rally in Tel Aviv, calling for the Israeli government to do more to bring those hostages home. As negotiations for their release continue, President Biden is doubling down on his support for Israel. In an op-ed for the \"Washington Post,\" the president rejected mounting calls for a ceasefire saying it will only give Hamas more time to, quote, \"restart the killing by attacking innocents again.\" But the fighting continues in Gaza City. Doctors at Al-Shifa, Gaza's largest hospital, say they were ordered to evacuate by the Israeli military. Now the IDF disputes that claim. It comes as Israel Defense Forces are now vowing to advance anywhere Hamas is found. And there are growing signs that a ground offensive into southern Gaza could be imminent. Let's go straight to CNN international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson live in Sderot, Israel. Nic, give us the latest from where you are.",

And we've been able to see flares, heavy missile strikes from aircraft, heavy tank rounds fired into the area. Sometimes the skylights up bright orange with some of the explosions.Sometimes you just can't see precisely what's being hit and what's happening but we can hear heavy machine gunfire as well. So it really does feel from here as if the battle in northern Gaza is still raging. The IDF said several days ago that Hamas has now lost sort of operational control over the north of Gaza. But clearly, from what we're seeing, the IDF hasn't gained operational control over the north of Gaza either. It is still having these intense fights and as you said, Al-Shifa Hospital, the IDF's narrative about what's happened there is at variance with the doctors. The doctors say that they were forced to evacuate everyone that they could. The IDF said that the doctors had requested an evacuation. Fighting continues close to there and late into today, the U.N.'s principal refugee agency in Gaza indicated that one of their schools where displaced people had been sheltering as they had been for many, many weeks now, in fact, a school that was hit in a missile strike a couple of weeks ago, the U.N. agency said that there was some sort of incident there which had caused dozens of people to either be injured or killed. And video from that site really showed a very grim situation of bodies scattered in rooms in that U.N. operated school building. So the fight really still ongoing into tonight and every sense from the IDF, from the politicians as well, that the south southern part of the Gaza Strip will be next. But much to be done here as well in the north clearly.",

With just eight weeks left until the state's first-in-the-nation contest for Republicans, the former president is mounting an aggressive campaign as he attempts to stop his GOP rivals from catching up to him, including former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Nikki bird brain, sir, I will never, ever vote against you. You're the greatest president in my lifetime. She's not that wrong. I mean, she's not that all bad. I would have preferred if she said in generations but I know her well. She's not up to the job.

      "sentences": "Trump's swing through Iowa comes as he faces intensifying heat from Haley in another critical state for Republicans. A new CNN poll shows Trump maintaining a significant lead among 42 percent of likely voters in New Hampshire's GOP primary. But Haley has leapfrogged Trump's other rivals, moving into second place at 20 percent.Now let's discuss more now with CNN's senior political analyst and senior editor at \"The Atlantic,\" Ron Brownstein. All right, Ron, I want to get your reaction to Nikki Haley's rise in the polls. Is this a flash in the pan or can she mount a serious challenge to Trump? RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, the answer to the first question is no and the answer to the second question is TBD. Nikki Haley has two goals that she has to reach and one of them I think she's clearly on track to do and the other one we'll have to see. The first one is to supplant Ron DeSantis as Trump's chief rival in the race, and I think she is on a pathway to do that. I mean, DeSantis' strategy as we've talked about before has been to run at Trump almost entirely from the right and in the process he struggled to peel away many of those Trump hardcore, Trump supporters but alienated a lot of the voters in kind of the center right of the party who are the most resistant to Trump. He's left a vacuum that Haley is clearly filling in New Hampshire, even in Iowa to some extent, and certainly in South Carolina. So you can imagine the scenario, Paula, where Haley even if she finishes third in Iowa, can finish a much stronger second and possibly even challenge Trump in New Hampshire, and then get a real shot at him in South Carolina. Now to ultimately dislodge him, she's going to have to cut deeper into the voters who are now supporting him. But I think there's no question that she has consolidated the voters -- she's in the process of consolidating the voters who are most resistant to Trump where DeSantis kind of had an opportunity at but so far has failed to convert by the way he has chosen to run in this race.",

      "speaker": "BROWNSTEIN",
      "sentences": "Well, I think it does create the opportunity at that point for someone else to have a shot at him in South Carolina, which would be about four weeks later. You know, the history of the Republican primary in the modern era has been remarkably consistent. In every contested race since 1980 except for one, one candidate won Iowa, a second candidate on New Hampshire, one of the two won South Carolina, and eventually became the nominee.The only exception was 2012 when Newt Gingrich won South Carolina and didn't win the nomination. I think if Haley, you know, who clearly seems to be on a trajectory now where she is likely to be the closest finisher to Trump in New Hampshire, particularly if Governor Sununu there endorses her, which certainly seems possible, and if Chris Christie, who is drawing largely from the same pool of voters, you know, withdraws from the race closer to the New Hampshire date and potentially endorses her. If Haley did that, she would kind of be in the same position that John McCain was in 2000 when he beat George W. Bush in New Hampshire. That gave him a chance. It put him in the ring. They had this epic battle in South Carolina. Ultimately Bush won and then he won the nomination. I think if Haley runs well in New Hampshire, she would give herself a shot in South Carolina at really emerging as a true challenger to Trump. But to do that, she's going to have to -- you know, as I said, she's in the process of consolidating that 30 percent, 35 percent of the party that is most resistant to Trump. Ultimately, she's going to have to win more of what Republican pollster Whit Ayres calls those maybe Trump voters who voted for him in the past but are open to an alternative now. And we'll see if she can find a way to do that. Because so far she really hasn't directly confronted him to the degree that she'll have to if she's really going to make this list.",

I know there are polls now showing him at times drawing 50 percent, but given the agenda that he's running on, calling his political enemies vermin, talking about detention camp, mass deportation, deploying the National Guard into blue cities, et cetera, it's very hard to imagine him getting to 50 percent of the vote.And therefore, you know, there's arguments and polls about whether various third party candidates take more or less from one side or the other. In general, I think all of the third party candidates help Trump because Biden has shown that he can get to 50 percent. Democrats have gotten to 50 percent several times over the last generation. Republicans have only done it once since 1988, in 2004. So if you lower the number you need to win on balance, I think that helps Trump. You know, it is possible that a third party candidate or candidate could draw a significant share of the total vote. You have a lot of Americans who are dissatisfied with both Trump and Biden. They really don't want this choice. The problem for a third party candidate is not winning a lot of votes. It's winning any states. I mean, you have the risk, no matter how plausible a third party campaign you have, you might come in second in the blue states for the Democrats and second in the red states for the Republicans. Ross Perot won 90 percent of the vote in 1992 and didn't win a state. So No Labels has to understand that it will be a spoiler, it will be a spoiler that would make it more likely that Trump would be president again and we'll see whether they choose to go forward with that clear knowledge that that would be their likely effect.",

There was a successful stage separation between the booster and the spacecraft, and the spacecraft made it all the way past the Karman Line, all the way to the edge of space, almost into orbit. But then something happened and that's why what happened today was also a failure. There were two explosions, both the booster and the spacecraft ended in an explosion. And that's not what was supposed to happen. Ultimately, if everything had gone according to plan, it was supposed to complete almost a full lap of the earth and then splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Hawaii. So this is what the FAA calls a mishap and that has now triggered a mishap investigation. It's going to be led by SpaceX, but now they have to get another launch license from the FAA before they can attempt to fly Starship one more time -- Paula.",

CNN's Rafael Romo is in Atlanta, where a charity that has been feeding Metro residents for decades is holding a drive-thru Turkey giveaway. RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Paula, the goal was to help about 800 families today with boxes of food, turkeys, and other items that were donated by local donors, and the reality was that once they reached that goal of 800, there were still families lined up trying to still get help, so they had to bring some more. And organizers told us that the idea here was to give each family enough food so that they could have what they described as a modest Thanksgiving feast. These families are here from the community. This was open to everybody, but the families had to pre-register so that they would have access to this. And the president of Hosea Helps told us that this is not about Thanksgiving only, this is, she told us a way to reach those families in need, many families who have lost their jobs that are still trying to recover after the pandemic, this is what they have to say about this effort.
