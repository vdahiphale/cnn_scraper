You don't want any juror who is there, eventually picked and impanelled, to be watching any of your lead prosecutors and thinking about their romantic relationships. They want to have them focused, singularly on the evidence at hand. And this has been quite the distraction.On the other hand, it won't necessarily cure what is endeavored right now. Remember, it's not whether Nathan Wade financially benefited from his relationship with Fannie Willis. It's whether Fanie Willis benefited from hers with Nathan Wade. If she is disqualified, the entire team is disqualified, an outside consulting agency, the prosecuting counsel of Georgia would be the one to actually then replace this team. We should kick a can down the road, perhaps indefinitely, because that new team is not required to follow the indictment of the grand jury, to follow the defendants in this case, or even continue to pursue it. So that's going to be a very big thing. But if he were to step down now, certainly the idea of the optics for a jury would be improved. But will it cure the issue of the financial benefits, qualification, motivation by these litigators? Likely not.",

Obviously, he's going to have to here for an appeal.But the other part of this is that it's really personal for him. This is the entire brand of his existence. He's Donald Trump, Trump Tower, New York businessman. Even though he lives in Florida, still considers himself a New York businessman. Not only did he build an empire on this and build a brand on this, he also political brand on this, saying that I'm the successful businessman. Look at all the things that I've accomplished. If I could do this for myself, I could do this for you. And people bought into that in 2016. It's a message that he's still selling today. The other part of this is that Don and Eric run Trump Org.

It's not going to be anything like has got liquid cash.The other issue, though, is does Engeron agree to bar people like Donald Trump himself, his kids, from serving as officers of companies in real estate within the territorial integrity of the state of New York? That is something else the Attorney General also has sought and would obviously be a huge blow, as Kristen was just saying, to his entire business ethos and personal brand, the idea that he couldn't run a real estate company in New York.

I said many times during the primary, you know, there were a lot of reporters who said, well, Trump is not saying he's going to support a national ban. In fact, he has made clear all along that the question was not whether, but what, how many weeks, and that he had argued that he had put the pro-life community in the position to get the best deal it could by appointing the justices who overturn Roe. That is something that he's going to have to carry into November.And I guess I do think that the voters who are most likely to move away from the Republican Party over the issue of abortion are essentially the same voters who are most likely to recoil from the idea of all of the chaos that surrounds Trump and the same voters who are disproportionately voting for Haley in the primaries and saying they are reluctant to vote for Trump again, particularly if he's committed a crime. And those are white, you know, Republican-leaning independents who traditionally have been closer to the GOP on issues. And in fact, they feel closer to Trump on issues like the border and the economy than they do to Biden. And the question is whether Biden can win, as I said, a slice of them, despite all that, because of their personal reservations about Trump and what he means for rights, values, and democracy itself.",

No, I thought her testimony, on the factual front, was very persuasive, very strong. It was an outright denial, categorical rejection of the allegations brought by one of the defendant's lawyers.And what we've had going on just over the last 30 minutes, right before I came on the air, was that they were trying to get testimony in from Nathan Wade's former law partner. The judge rejected some of the questions saying it implicated attorney-client privilege and that the crime fraud exception did not apply. That's a blow to the defendants. And reviewing, all the information they've presented today through Mr. Bradley, it appears basically that they have misinterpreted gossip that came out of text messages, multi-pronged commentary, and they just ran with it.
