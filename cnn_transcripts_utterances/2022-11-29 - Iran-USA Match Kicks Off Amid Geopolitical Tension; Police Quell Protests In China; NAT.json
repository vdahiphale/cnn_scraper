USA must beat Iran if they're going to move forward in the World Cup. Then, China's police are out in force after zero COVID unrest shocked the world. Plus, NATO allies promise to help Ukraine as Russia weaponizes Winter. I'll ask Latvia's foreign minister, what was agreed to at a meeting that just wrapped up hours ago? Now, the hotly-anticipated World Cup game between Iran and the United States has just kicked off in Qatar. And the stakes could not be higher. The USA need a win to get through to the next stage of the tournament. At least, up until now, politics   has been taken center stage over sport. CNN has learned that the families of some Iranian players have been threatened with prison and even torture if they don't, quote, \"behave\". That's according to a source involved with the security of the games. It comes after Iranian players refused to sing the national anthem before their England match last week. What many saw as a protest against the Iranian regime. Jomana Karadsheh has been covering Iran and the protest movement for us since the start. She joins us now. And Jomana, one can only imagine the pressure these Iranian players are under, given what we know about that reporting about the threats to their families. Just bring us up-to-date about what more we know about those particular threats and how this is already playing out on the pitch. Because we know the national anthems have just taken place in the last few minutes.",

The players did sing the national anthem, barely, I'm told, not very enthusiastically, really. I mean, considering what we know, this is not very surprising because what we understand from a source who's involved in the security of the World Cup telling CNN, and he's also been monitoring the movements of the Iranian security organizations who are in Doha for the games. The players, after that first match against England, when they didn't sing the national anthem, they were pulled into a meeting with members of the feared Revolutionary Guard Corps, and they were intimidated and they were threatened. They were told they will behave or -- and that they will sing the national anthem, and they will not take part in any protests against the government or their families back in Iran are going to face violence and torture. Then we saw the game after that with Wales, where they did sing the national anthem. And here we are again right now. We understand that they have been not only under pressure, under duress, under, you know -- their families under threat, but also that they're constantly monitored with dozens of members of the IRGC, according to the  source, monitoring the team members, not allowing them to mingle with anyone outside the squad or speak with foreigners.

During a brutal crackdown that is ongoing, the security forces who are accused of carrying out these horrific human rights violations, accused of killing hundreds of people, were out on the streets of Tehran celebrating and handing out candy, as they celebrated that victory. And, you know, with the regime under so much pressure right now facing one of the biggest threats to the Islamic Republic since its formation in 1979, they will want to try and use this moment for as much propaganda as possible, making it so difficult for people who really want to support their team, but at the same time feel that the team has come now to represent that regime, making it very difficult for them to, you know, to support the team right now, Christina.",

Musk also says Apple has mostly stopped advertising on Twitter. Last weekend, the head of Apple's app store deleted his Twitter account. Well, CNN's Donie O'Sullivan is in Coral Gables, Florida, live for us this evening. Donie, I understand we have not yet heard anymore from Apple. But you have been at an event today where a former Twitter employee, I believe, has been speaking out. So, tell us more what you've been learning about these threats from Apple. DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Christina, yes. We're here at a knight foundation event where Uelle Ruch(ph), who was basically in charge of writing the rules and implementing the rules at Twitter these past few years, certainly implementing them is due to speak in a few hours  here. He quit the company about two weeks ago. He had been working with Musk, so it's the first time we're really hearing from a very senior former employee in this way. When it comes to Apple -- when it comes to Apple as it relates to Twitter and all of this situation, Apple has a kind of vetting process for the apps that go into its app store. A lot of times, that vetting has to do to make sure the apps don't have viruses or spyware that goes on to our phones. But also, in the past, they have taken into account apps that might have hate speech or danger, what would be considered dangerous misinformation. We saw last year, there's a right-wing social media platform here called Parler, primarily in the U.S. That app was removed by Apple from its app store for a few months last year, until they got their policies on hate speech together, until Parler cleaned up their app a little. So, what we've seen with Musk, of course, is he's promising to make Twitter this bastion of free speech. But there are concerns that by taking off all the guardrails, that hate speech could also flourish on the platform. And speaking of tearing up those rules, we just learned overnight that Twitter has -- is no longer enforcing its COVID misinformation policies. Since 2020, it's had a policy in place that -- to remove accounts -- to remove accounts and posts that are posting what it considers dangerous COVID misinformation, misinformation about the virus as well. We saw overnight that, that policy is no longer in place. So, a real roller-coaster when everything that Musk is doing on the platform, and it's going to be very interesting to hear from this former senior Twitter employee later today --",

Now, President Biden is asking Congress to do the more aggressive of them. Have them accept a deal that was made that he was very involved in, in September. Now, congressional leaders who met with President Biden earlier today, they feel like they can get something passed on this. Of course, it has to go to the house.

And  that includes scheduling, staffing levels, quality of life and a lack of paid sick leave. Of course, the U.S. does not have a national sick leave law. And so, basically, the president is kind of asking Congress and saying that we understand that these are sticking points for these labor unions. As of now, 4 out of the 12 labor unions have basically voted against the tentative agreement made in September. So the president is saying, we understand that there are problems here, but for the good of the economy, the good of other workers, the good of commerce, we need to go ahead with this deal. Now, the president is not coming to this decision, he says, easily. He says it wasn't an easy decision, and he's reluctant to get involved and to override these protections, these procedural issues when it comes to trying to find a deal. But as groups say that the U.S. could lose as much as $1 billion in the first week if this strike is able to go along, obviously that is a problem for the president, for the president's administration. And I just want to note for you, Christina, that, of course, the president is in a precarious situation here because he's fashioned (ph) himself as the most pro-union president that this country has ever seen. But of course, this move pits pro union allies, Democrats, potentially against this president when moving forward, as he's trying to basically get Congress to make these two parties come to the table and accept a deal that some feel is not fair and is not workable for them. So of course, we will see how this plays out as Democrats have suggested that maybe in the back end, they could add some sort of paid sick leave or anything like that.

He's an infectiousdisease and global health expert at the University of Oxford. Welcome to you, thanks for your time. So to me, it seems that shift in approach by China makes sense, right? Because we've seen this approach by multiple countries around the world, targeting the elderly. But the question is, is it going to work? Because we know there's been serious doubts over the efficacy of China's domestic vaccine, Sinovac. So what are your thoughts on that? DR. PETER DROBAC, OXFORD UNIVERSITY:  Yes, change is long overdue, absolutely. I think there's a long way to go. One of the issues here is that, you know, zero COVID policies in 2020 were really smart and, in many cases, effective, as using border controls, mass testing and restrictions from social distancing to occasional lockdowns to interrupt the spread of COVID. However, once we had vaccines on board, in most countries, the strategy shifted. And China made the decision to stick with locally developed and manufactured vaccines, which it looked like were pretty good at the beginning. But it turns out that their effectiveness wore off after about six months. And then secondly, they targeted workers in high risk professions and did not target at the time the elderly, who, of course, are at the highest risk for developing severe disease and death. That's because, in the trials, they had very few elderly volunteers. And so, they didn't know if it was safe for the elderly. One of the issues is that not only now are the highest risk group, the elderly, under vaccinated-- we're talking about 40 percent of over 80s having gotten a three dose series, including a booster. But there's a lot of vaccine hesitancy because, initially, they were not eligible and they wondered why and thought, maybe it's not safe for us. That was compounded by the misinformation and disinformation, which we've seen around the world. And now the issue is, if they open up, they've got a population that's under vaccinated, has not been exposed to very much COVID-19. And so, if they open up now, there's going to be a tremendous amount of illness and death. And so, they've got to ramp up vaccinations quickly but overcoming a great deal of reluctancy (sic).",

But one of the things that we've seen, of course, that this virus is ever evolving and mutating. Think of all the variants that we've been through over the last couple of years. In the mRNA vaccines that have been most commonly used in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere, have been updated to take into account the evolution of the virus as it's become more contagious and invaded immunity, things like that. So there's a real gulf between the effectiveness of those vaccines and the ones we use in China. I don't know if it's politically possible. I think there's a widespread understanding that the Chinese vaccines are less effective, one reason that people don't want to be bothered to go out and get it when offered. Certainly, I think that introducing mRNA vaccines, while it would be a real shift, might actually change minds and make people more likely to come forward and get vaccinated.

So Bill, I think this is the first time that the volcano has erupted since, what, 1984? How dangerous is this for the residents of Hawaii?",

It is huge, it's 16 kilometers high. Most of it under the ocean, of course. And so, they don't know exactly what is causing it. Even the best science can't  predict precisely when it will go. But given the activity and sort of the shifting plates below there. But it surprised them, came in the middle of the night after a holiday weekend in the United States. But now there's so much fascination and who knows how long it could go. It could go for months. The ones in 2018 actually did take out some neighborhoods out of Kilauea there as well. So this will be one to watch. And they were talking about reservations before COVID for so many tourists coming to the islands. Now there will be double the interest for those who have this on the bucket list.",
