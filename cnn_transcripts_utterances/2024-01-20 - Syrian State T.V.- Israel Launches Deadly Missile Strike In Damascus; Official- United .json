      "sentences": "Hello, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me this Saturday. I'm Fredericka Whitfield.We're following two major stories at this hour. Reports of an Israeli missile strike hitting a building in Syria, a dramatic escalation of tensions in the Middle East. And it's the final weekend in this country before the first primary of the U.S. presidential election. How candidates are spending these last critical hours on the campaign trail? We begin with this \"BREAKING NEWS\". That missile strike in the Syrian capital of Damascus. Syrian state television says several Iranian military advisors were among those killed, when a building was targeted today. Iranian and Syrian news agencies, both saying Israel was behind the attack. The Israeli defense forces say they won't comment on the reports. Video from the scene showing the building in ruins. We're also getting reports from the Lebanese-state run news agency that four people were killed when Israel targeted a car, traveling near the border between the two countries. CNN's Nic Robertson is in Tel Aviv, Israel. Nic, good to see you. What do we know first about the target of the strike in Damascus?",

      "sentences": "It does seem to be by the reporting we're getting from Damascus and from Iranian media outlets as well that this was a house that house IRGC officials, military commanders from the Iranian military.One of them will -- five of them have been named, but one of them -- at least one media outlet in Iran said was a senior IRGC Quds Force Commander. They're sort of overseas operation, if you will, in charge of intelligence inside Syria. CNN can't independently verify that. But this is exactly the sort of target Iranian IRGC targets that Israel has been blamed for striking in Damascus -- in and around Damascus. And in Syria previously, on Christmas day, a very senior IRGC commander was killed in a similar sort of airstrike. Now, it's absolutely typical that Israel will not comment on strikes like this in Syria. It does, in the case of Lebanon, it has said that it struck over the border inside Lebanon today. Didn't say it was responsible for hitting the four people in the vehicle, but did say a hit number of targets. So, this is not out with the norm for Israel not to acknowledge their strike. But it has all their hallmarks. And it certainly has their full military philosophy in Syria, which is absolutely to try to deny Iranian forces, a strong foothold to develop another proxy or allow a proxy in Syria to get even stronger, and threaten Israel. And also connect to the Iranian proxy in Lebanon, Hezbollah. So, this is really part of Israel strategy. And I just have to add here, although there's been no claim of responsibility, we understand that multiple missiles were fired at a U.S. airbase in Iraq. I know Assad, there are a number of injuries to U.S. personnel, not clear how many people are injured right now. The local mayor said a barrage of missiles were fired at the base. Interceptors -- interceptor defensive systems took some of them down. The no claim of responsibility. But typically, it has been Iranian- backed militia inside Iraq that have conducted attacks against U.S. forces. We don't know if that's the case, this time. More than 140 attacks against U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria, mostly by Iranian-backed proxies over the past few months.",

[12:05:00] So, when he says Prime Minister Netanyahu needs to level with the people and say that it's not possible to completely destroy Hamas, that is very much a criticism within the war cabinet. And if the war cabinet breaks, then, that will probably lead to elections in Israel, which would likely mean Prime Minister Netanyahu losing his position as prime minister.

Joining us right now is retired Navy Commander Kirk Lippold. He was the commanding officer of the USS Cole, when the ship was bombed in October 2000 by al-Qaeda in Yemen.Good to see you. So, let's talk about these recent missile strikes. Israel isn't commenting on the strikes. But if Israel was behind this, what kind of statement is being delivered with this kind of attack? CMDR. KIRK LIPPOLD (RET.) FORMER USS COLE COMMANDER: Well, when you see the strikes that are being conducted, what Israel is basically saying is they are not going to tolerate Iran continuing to destabilize the region. They have conducted these strikes before, into Lebanon, into Syria, because you have to remember, Fredricka, one of the key points is Syria is the transit point that Iran use -- Iran uses to get equipment and weapons down to the Lebanese Hezbollah for them to be able to then conduct strikes into northern Israel. So, interdicting them with the source where they're there in Syria is a vital action that Israel needs to take for its long-term defense requirements.",

They want to keep their powder dry and preserve it for the fact that if Israel, in fact, does continue and destroy Hamas, they want to make sure that if they need to exercise Lebanese Hezbollah, to further their objectives in the region, they want to have that capability.

And you're always going to have these in any democratically elected government. And you don't want to amplify those voices to a point that it gives the enemy the opportunity to now leverage that against the government of Israel.Right now, you have to remember Iran very much owns the information warfare domain in this conflict. And so, consequently, anything that comes up where a division shows with respect to Israel. Iran is going to use that to their advantage. What we want to do is make sure that we don't give them more credence than they actually have. Just because someone speaks up, doesn't necessarily mean that they are representing a large majority of the Israeli people who continue to support the war effort, given the horrific nature of what happened on October 7th.",

I need you to turn out for me in a big way. Ignore the polls that show me leading by big margins, and come out and vote for me. Now, another big theme for Donald Trump this weekend is really escalating those attacks on Nikki Haley. Nikki Haley is the person they see that he needs to beat here in New Hampshire. And part of that is because of the polls, poll after poll shows that she does very well, with independent voters. They are able to participate in this primary, and so, you're seeing him escalate his messaging.

Willis is trying to stop the questioning saying it's being used to harass and damage her professional reputation and is obstructing and interfering with an ongoing criminal prosecution. This exploded in the public eye earlier this month when one of the defendants in the Georgia election subversion case, Mike Roman, a former Trump campaign official moved to disqualify Willis, alleging she had an improper relationship with Wade. Roman alleges Wade was paid more than others in Willis's office, and used money he billed for his work so far adding up to more than $650,000 to take Willis on romantic and lavish vacations. Roman has not provided any public proof for the accusations. But Trump's lawyer says this is another reason the case should be tossed.",

And when you look at the overnight temperatures again tonight we're at five degrees below zero in Chicago. Four below in Omaha. Temperatures in the single digits from Nashville, even Atlanta only getting down into the teens overnight tonight.And when you look at the high temperatures tomorrow, there's still a decent chunk of us that will be below freezing with highs in the 20s from Chicago to Omaha only 31 in St. Louis still 10 degrees below average, a chilly 42 degrees in Atlanta. And as you look at the next four days, we start to see the uphill climb where we've got temperatures getting closer to average by Monday and Tuesday and really starting to see the other side of this cold snap where you've got temperatures way below average today by about 20 degrees, still chilly about 10 degrees below average tomorrow. But then as we look towards Monday a little bit closer to average. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, we start to see more of those oranges pumping in, right? Temperatures tend to 20 degrees above average by Wednesday and Thursday. But temperatures at 70 degrees from Charlotte down to Atlanta, so really thawing out and starting to feel quite warm. Then when you look at this seven-day for Atlanta, you've got temperatures barely breaking freezing on Saturday, and then already by the end of the week, by Thursday, we're looking at temperatures up at 70 degrees with some showers and thunderstorms. That's the storm that's going to fuel and bring in all of that warmer air. And even for a place like Chicago that's not going to hit 70 degrees, you're also still looking at a pretty big warm up. Your daytime highs will climb into the 40s after being only in the teens on Saturday. Then look at those overnight lows that are subzero, those will warm a good 30, 40 degrees above freezing by the end of the week.",

Kate, the Princess of Wales, remains hospitalized following abdominal surgery. And King Charles will soon begin treatment for an enlarged prostate.Buckingham Palace says the King will have a corrective procedure at the hospital and that his condition is benign. Earlier in the week, news of the King's upcoming treatment came just 90-minutes after the Princess of Wales surgery was revealed. Kensington Palace announced Catherine will spend two weeks in the hospital then continue to recover at home for months. A royal source tells CNN her condition was noncancerous. CNN royal historian, Kate Williams, joining me now from London. Kate, great to see you. I mean these health scares really came as a shock. I mean, everyone wishes them well, of course. But let's start with Kate's situation. That means both she and Prince William have canceled all their public engagements through Easter. Royal officials are being both transparent and still very secretive. How long, you know, can it keep people in the dark, so to speak, about Kate's condition and what precipitated her surgery?",

First, we were told that Kate was already in hospital had had abdominal surgery was recovering well, and she will remain in the hospital for two weeks. And we wouldn't see her until I think well after Easter so not until perhaps the end of April. And the Prince William would also be canceling engagements for at least January.And then just an hour and a half later, we were told that the King next week would be going into hospital for a minor procedure, an enlarged prostate. And he would be probably out of action for three weeks. We're expecting three four weeks, but I'm sure he'll be doing his constitutional duties with the Prime Minister on Zoom. So that means that we have this already slimmed down royal family. And within that two major Royals, Kate and the King, are in hospitalized and recovering during January. William is supporting Kate. So the only senior role really that we have is Queen Camilla, but she'll be mainly supporting Charles as well. So really, we are not going to see many Royal engagements at all during January and February. And we don't expect to see Kate until well into April. That means that some of their royal tours, like the tour to Rome will not go ahead. But the King has a big tour in Canada in May. And that I think he'll be fine for that. But Kate is obviously a much more serious operation. We don't know what it is. We've been told as you say that it's not cancerous. But I don't expect that we will be told what it is. We will be told that she's recovering. I mean, possibly in a year or so she might do an event with a charity connected to sufferers of the same condition and talk a little there. But I don't expect that we will hear about it. And of course it's her right to keep it secret and we do wish her all the best.",

There is paperwork to be done. And also he has work at home. He has to support the children.This is a long time by which Kate prides itself on being a hands on mother will not be at home with the children. She'll be recovering. She won't be able to run around after three small children. So things are really a different balance at home for William at Windsor. And he's really I think, determined to try and keep things as normal for the children as they can, as we know any family going through surgery. It's very hard. It's very disruptive for the children. Children find it very difficult. And he's determined to keep it very straightforward for them. But certainly, you know, we think just a few years ago, Fred, of these big balcony waves, huge royal family, it's getting smaller and smaller.

And people might -- some men might find this an embarrassing issue that he wants to speak out so that men do get checked and get tested. It is a condition that affects up to about 50 percent of men by the age of 60, so it's very common, but I think a lot of people don't want to talk about it.And I think the King also wants to make it very clear that it was a minor condition. He's not suffering from anything long term, who back on his feet very, very shortly. It's something that he's going to get treated possibly in Scotland where he is now and be, you know, recovering very quickly. So I think they know about all of the -- in the royal family that people do you worry. And they worry when the King is 75 that it might be something more serious.

But of course, there are lots of -- it's a big hospital and people were going out. There are other patients going to be there. There are lots of staff, but they will keep it secret.But of course it's very difficult with records. The Royals normally go to the Edge of the Seventh Hospital quite often. They will also be to this hospital too. But the Edge of the Seventh Hospital was recently like quite a few institutions in London, hacked by some hackers who threaten to sell the information. So these kinds, it's a very different cyberspace now. I do think that the King will probably tell us quite a bit about his conditions in recovery next week after he comes out of hospital. And certainly I think Kate and Kensington Palace have said very clearly, they want to keep the matter private. But these are the days in which everyone wants to talk about the royal family.
