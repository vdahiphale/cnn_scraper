I'm -- I think, you know, it's fascinating about this election is that it starts off in 27 independent E.U. member countries and at the end of the day the configuration based on proportional allocation of members of the European Parliament becomes evident in the court -- in the Parliament in Strasbourg and these former national groups now join parliamentary groups that reflect like-minded similar kinds of ideas.So I think what's, first of all, the interesting thing is that the sort of the center parties, as Ursula von der Leyen was describing them, have pretty much held on to their -- to their positions and have not really been eroded in any kind of significant way, except perhaps for the group that Emmanuel Macron belongs to. But I think it's also important to point out that many of those center-right parties she's described have in fact moved considerably to the right. I think when it comes to then determining the question of the influence of the right, yes, as a bloc they are a significant portion, but between the ECR, the Conservatives and Reformists, and say the ID party that Marine Le Pen's group will go into, there are significant divisions. But I do think that the most important thing to take away from this is the sheer number of important E.U. countries in terms of the proportional votes, such as France and Germany, the Netherlands and Italy, in which the far-right parties either came in overwhelmingly first or in second position. And I think as one moves forward, that certainly will shift the conversation in terms of the power dynamics in Strasbourg and Brussels, Michael.",

I think the German example you just mentioned is especially complex here. The coalition ran by Scholz that has three parties in there, the center- left, center-right, and the Greens, together scored less than their opposition party, CDU, CSU, Merkel's party that sits at the EPP in Brussels.

Some of those members are interested in kind of reaching out to some of those far- right constituencies, which will be divisive in those particular parties.I think when you look at the politics of the EU today, Michael, the big questions are environmental questions and immigration questions. And these far-right parties have been sceptics on both of those and therefore can shape that particular narrative. But I think the broader question is the kind of adherence to or proximity to Russia, and the way in which the Ukraine conflict will play out moving forward. And along those far-right lines, there are divisions there as well. And I think that moving forward, thinking about Europe, thinking about Europe as a kind of security space, is going to be the number one challenge in bringing unity.

Now, Gantz had been seen as a counterweight to the more far-right elements within Netanyahu's coalition, and he had been pushing for a ceasefire deal to secure the release of all the hostages from Gaza, that despite an IDF mission on Saturday that rescued four of those hostages. (Voice-over): A complex mission that achieved its objectives, according to Israel, extensive air power, hundreds of personnel, weeks of intelligence gathering and training to rescue four Israeli hostages held by Hamas in two residential buildings in central Gaza. This the moment IDF headquarters learned the hostages have been rescued. For those on the ground, it was the deadliest day in six months, according to Gaza officials, capturing the moment of impact of Israeli air strikes. Sustained gunfire followed. The IDF says there were fierce gun battles with Hamas fighters throughout the operation, but did not provide evidence of this claim. Then a constant stream of dead and injured arrive at two nearby hospitals. The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital overwhelmed by the sheer number of trauma cases. The breakdown of fighters versus civilians is unknown, but women and children are seen in every corner of this hospital. Gaza officials and hospital directors say more than 270 were killed, hundreds more injured, sparking cries of a massacre from some countries, including the EU's top diplomat. Israel claims less than 100 died, blaming Hamas for the shockingly high death toll. CNN cannot independently verify either side's figures. LT. COL.

The U.S. came out with a plan, which you may agree or disagree with if you're Netanyahu, but the U.S. came out with a plan as early as December and January. It was called the Biden Doctrine, if you recall. And Mr. Netanyahu refused to even engage in negotiations and even engage in talks about this. So Mr. Gantz, by raising this, raises a valid point.
