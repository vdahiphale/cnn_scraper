We begin with some breaking news. For all of you watching from Saudi Arabia don't worry about getting to bed early tonight because tomorrow has just been announced as a public holiday. That is after the Falcons ranked 51st in the world used a pair of second half goals to stun Argentina one of the favorites to win the World Cup. The final score of 2-1 sent the Saudi team and their fans into jubilant celebrations few expected the match to even are competitive, and a Saudi win was all about unfathomable. Argentina got a first half penalty from Superstar Lionel Messi and what is expected to be his final World Cup. But several other chances eliminated due to off sides; Argentina, now face a tougher road to even get out of the group stage. Let's bring in our Don Riddell who was at the match, and is now with fans at the - here in the heart of Doha. Let's just start with the atmosphere of that match, as I understand it 88,000 in the Lugsail Stadium that's an awful lot of people and there were an awful lot of Saudis at that match. What was the atmosphere like after this upset?",

I would say that the Argentine fans out numbered them, maybe two to one, maybe even three to one. And so it was a terrific atmosphere inside the stadium throughout the match. But once the Saudis got in front, and then and then held on to it. It was just absolutely amazing. And nobody saw this coming Becky. You're absolutely right, such an historic and epic upset. I was kind of laughing before the game because they were all these prayer rooms around for the Saudi fans to pray in before and even during the game at halftime. And I was just thinking to myself, you know, they're outnumbered in the stadium. They're going up against Messi the God they're going to need a helping hand from Allah. And boy, did they get it? And yes, I think the Saudi fans absolutely deserve the public holiday tomorrow. I suspect quite a few of them will use it making travel arrangements to get here for the weekend for their second game, because who would want to miss what's going on now with the Saudi team?",

The countries are neighboring each other Riyadh less to Doha less than a seven hour drive away. As I said, and fans out there pickup traveling by land, sea or air. Will despite the proximity the fact that the Saudi fans are even here does remind us that football is sometimes a lot more than the action on the pitch. It was, of course an incredible performance one of those games that makes the World Cup so special. But this was about so much more than football. This image of the Amir of Qatar, the leader here, wearing a Saudi scarf is so symbolic and here's why? Until 18 months ago, Qatar and Saudi had fallen out big time and I mean big time along with three other Arab nations. For three years Riyadh had boycotted this tiny Kingdom of Qatar. They shut down their border with it; they closed their airspace for it. They had squeezed them both diplomatically and economically and that cost this tiny Kingdom this tiny state billions of dollars. Well, today that rift is well and truly over. Saudi Arabia has now clinched its biggest football win on Qatari soil. It's biggest football win ever. This is what some fans told me earlier.

We've come here to the Kurdish region of Iraq to try and find out more. This is Hannah, not her real name, a Kurdish Iranian woman recently smuggled out of Iran, she fears for her life.

It was in these interrogation rooms, she says that she was assaulted and others were raped. CNN was able to locate the police station through Hannah's description, eyewitness corroboration and geo-location using key landmarks. It's in the Islamabad neighborhood of Urmia. Based on this testimony and speaking to a number of sources, a pattern of repression comes into focus. Police sense is used as filtration points, moving protesters from one location to another. Often families left not knowing where their loved ones are held. One Iraq based Kurdish militant opposition party pack identified over 240 people who they believe are missing within this maze of detention centers.
