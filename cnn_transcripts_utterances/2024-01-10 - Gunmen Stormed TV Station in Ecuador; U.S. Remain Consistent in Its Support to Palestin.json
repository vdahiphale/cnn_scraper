The producer told us be careful. They are getting in. They are robbing us. The studio doors are very thick.

And as Mexican cartels have moved into Ecuador what we're seeing is what was previously a haven for peace, as your previous package had talked about, has now become really ground zero for drug trafficking. And all other sorts of illicit activities, including human trafficking.A number of immigrants that come through during a gap up through Mexico actually land off in Ecuador. So, what we're seeing is really the rise of illicit activities tied off in international groups, including Molvanian organized crime, Colombian narcotic traffickers and Mexican narcotics traffickers. In a country that's not familiar or a custom that has a capacity to deal with this level of insecurity, Ecuador really hasn't had the level of Civil War that Colombia or Peru has had. So, what we're really seeing is a weaker state that's now struggling to control this rise of illicit activity, and with it all the sorts of financing become with that. And, as you saw on the declaration by President Noboa, he named 22 criminal groups. This is a country that risk being overrun by criminal gangs. And that's where now we're going to see whether Ecuadorian state can establish some state control over parts of the country, not just in rural areas, but also in urban areas. And that's not going to be easy, given his lack of experience in this field.",

And as the state of emergency and the decree by President Noboa declares that it's going to be up to the armed forces. The police simply aren't up to the task. That comes with the real risk.Luckily the decree announces this will be done or any security measures will be done under international human rights law. That's important. But obviously, of course, the separation between civilian police authority and the armed forces has now been breached. And that makes it very difficult. The armed forces are not really equipped to carry out police forces. Not just in Ecuador but in anywhere else across the world. So, first of all, is establishing some sort of security and beefing up over the long-term the capacity of the national police to be able to carry out this functions. But also, the country has to gain some control over its prisons. You mentioned that there were prison riots. The previous package mentioned the deaths of the six people who were behind the assassination of the former presidential candidate Villavicencio. These prisons have been overrun by gangs. In fact, when they took over some of the prisons, they were cockfighting rings, and roosters, and pigs and other forms of sort of domestic living, including, you know, cell phone contacts for a lot of the gang leaders where they are running their operations in the prisons. The government has to be able to clean up these prisons and establish some control. But last this is going to require international effort. As I mentioned, this is not just a domestic problem for Ecuador. These are Colombian gangs, Mexican gangs, Albanian gangs that are running this. It's going to require the work of the United States and other partner governments to helped tamp down this transnational terrorist organization that's taken root in Ecuador and it's threatening to overrun the state.",

That's United States and in Europe, to be able to support his efforts to gain control over his country for fueling, for over the havoc that's been wrecked by cocaine consuming citizens in those countries. The third is his own political mandate. He was elected after the former president, Guillermo Lasso, basically resigned a cold snap election. His term only goes until 2025. So, he really has very little time to do this. But he was elected on a plan for democratic security. It's different from another one of his other competitors who was arguing for more of an iron fist strategy. So he has a mandate to do something. But he has a very limited amount of time. So we'll see what happens. But it's going to be a very difficult combination. Clearly, citizens are worried. They are scared. They should be. But we'll -- he'll have to take some very severe steps. And the first step is capturing Macias or Fito, as you mentioned earlier, and establish and demonstrate that the government can control some areas of the country.",
