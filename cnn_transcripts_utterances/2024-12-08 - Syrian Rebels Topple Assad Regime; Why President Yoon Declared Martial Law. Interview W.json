And what we've witnessed the last few weeks is really historic and unprecedented. And I think Assad basically fell into this doom loop and that his chief patrons, as you mentioned Russia, Iran Hezbollah were either consumed with their own battles or in the case of Hezbollah and Iran has been decimated by the Israeli military.So they lost their resolve. As a result, Assad in some ways his resolve diminished and when his military commanders saw that, you know, their commander in chief's resolve has been diminished, their resolve diminished as well. And you couple that with the emergence of this Syrian opposition leadership and the backing of Turkey, and you know, that's what we saw. It was quite remarkable. ZAKARIA: Natasha, it's still not over, though, right? Most people don't realize Syria is a mess because you still have in Syria the government forces that are on the coast, that still have -- hold some strongholds. There's ISIS in parts of the country that hold small parts of the country. There are Kurdish forces that hold parts of -- 20 percent of the country I think at least. What is likely to happen? Will the rebels, let's call them for now, be able to control the whole country? Or is this the beginning of a new civil war?",

There is no purge that seems to be taking place. It seems like maybe what he's trying to say is if you surrender that's fine. And you know, we're trying to keep peace here.",

And so we've actually seen rebels enter places like Tartus and Latakia and essentially say that they will protect minorities regardless if they're Alawites or if they are Christians or anybody else. And so that's quite heartening.I mean, it remains to be seen if there will be, again, spoilers within his group or within other groups that sort of change that. But we have seen the former prime minister even stay in Damascus and say that he will stay for a formal and peaceful transfer of power, which is really quite, quite astonishing. I don't think anyone could have told you that was going to happen from a group like HTS, but they've certainly learned a lot of lessons in the past few years.",

And then he said the United States should stay the hell out of this, which has, you know, been his position in general.There is one issue here, which is that the U.S. has been supporting the Kurdish forces because, you know, they sort of see themselves as being persecuted by all sides. The Turks have always not wanted that to happen. What is going to happen there? If the U.S. does not play a role will Turkey, you know, ethnically cleanse the Kurds in Syria?",

There's no longer an American project to really transform the region into secular democracies, but the priorities are to prevent the resurgence of groups like ISIS, to secure stockpiles of potential chemical weapons, WMD, and to protect minorities like the Kurds and Syrian Christians.",

As you mentioned, Syria has been Iran's only stable ally since the 1979 Revolution. And can Iran continue to finance and arm Lebanese Hezbollah without Syria because Syria has been the bridge to Hezbollah?I think what the Iranian regime will try to do is forge a partnership with Syria's new leaders based on common enmity towards the United States and Israel. That's a big question whether they can do that. Second question is what the impact on Iran's other resistance partners, namely in Iraq and in Houthi, with the -- and in Yemen, with the Houthis. And finally, what impact does this have on Iran internally? The Iranian regime is also deeply unpopular. Is the collapse of the Assad regime going to embolden anti-government protesters inside Iran?",

First and foremost is that HTS is a designated terrorist organization, and that's going to make rebuilding and reconstruction and a new Syria very difficult. So I'm sure this administration and the next administration is going to have to deal with that first and foremost. If they are not, then they are likely to engage in sort of the same nefarious activities that we saw the Assad regime do and Iran, as they try to build a power base in spite of sanctions and these kinds of designations.Whether or not there's going to be some kind of alliance between Jolani and Iran, I highly, highly doubt that. These are people that have been, you know, destroyed by Iran and its proxies so I don't see that likely happening. That said, Iranian proxies could come to spoil the future of Syria certainly. And so I think a lot of eyes are also on Iraq to see how Iranian influence is either strengthened or weakened there in the months ahead.",

And yet Israel has always wanted a stable Syria because they don't want chaos on their borders. And I noticed Jolani's family originally comes from the Golan Heights. So presumably he bears some grudges against Israel.Is this good for Israel? Is this bad for Israel? How do you think they're thinking about this in that country?",

And so you know, I think one of the questions journalists should ask Mr. Jolani is what country does he most seek to emulate? You know what is his vision for Syria? And if his vision for Syria is something along the lines of a Taliban government or something that has the foreign policy of the Iranian government, which is opposition to America and Israel? Then Israel is going to continue to have to do what they've been doing, which is to carry out targeted strikes inside Syria.",

He has narrowly survived the impeachment vote. His ruling party has rallied around him for now but the martial law really struck or fueled fears about what happened last time when a South Korean president under a military dictatorship had declared martial law that had sparked widespread student uprisings and protests.

And president Yoon was extremely courageous in making that decision to do that, to invest in that relationship.South Korea has also been an anchor in so many of the U.S. and global national security priorities whether it's cyber climate nonproliferation. And, of course, we have an increasingly aggressive China that's not going to be -- going away. We have North Korea and Russia cooperating with each other in the war against Ukraine.

During the vote, was not secret. There were all kinds of problems with ballot papers, ballot stuffing.You then had an election in Romania where a dark horse candidate was running a campaign on TikTok that was funded and paid for by outsiders against Romanian electoral law and against TikTok's own rules.

And what you're really seeing is a kind of clash between people who are too afraid and want to back down, and people who want to fight. It's hard for me to say now who will win. There was a similar kind of division inside Ukraine in 2014 and afterwards as well.You know, the decision to break off negotiations with the E.U. that the government made seems to have been a kind of almost a deliberate provocation. Like they wanted to get over this hump, get over this decision in the winter while people are less likely to protest as a way of preparing maybe deeper changes in the in the new year. They seem to have anticipated protests. They've used a lot of violence both on the streets but also targeted at people in their homes and outside of the demonstrations. And they seem to have been prepared and ready for this to happen. It's hard for me to say from the current perspective what the final outcome will be. But the division is real and there is certainly a part of the Georgian population that will not give this up. They will not allow their country to be sacrificed or to become somehow part of a Russian bloc or an anti-Ukrainian bloc without further protest. So, the story is not over.",

You know, on the contrary, everything that they have said makes it sound like they want to continue fighting and their plan, which is to partition Ukraine or occupy Ukraine, doesn't appear to have ended. And so, I think Europeans are waiting to see if there's something more to what he's going to propose other than what we've heard so far. I don't think anybody's leaping to any great conclusions yet. Clearly, there are some fears that -- not so much Trump himself but the MAGA movement, the online movement that helped him get elected. The pressure on Twitter and on other forms of social media that that kind of movement could join with Russian pressure, with existing Russian online social media operations and seek to swing elections in other European countries.
