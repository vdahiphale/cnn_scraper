The race critical, one that could alter the current Senate makeup. Frontrunners on the Democratic side in a three-way race. Congressman Adam Schiff, who's national profile skyrocketed from his starring role in former President Trump's first impeachment trial. And then there's Congresswomen Barbara Lee and Katie Porter. And on the Republican side, former Dodger great, Steve Garvey, and attorney, Eric Early. CNN's Stephanie Elam is watching turnout at a polling precinct in southern California there in Santa Ana. Tell us what you're seeing. Tell us what we might expect.",

      "sentences": "Well, Brianna, I can tell you that there's been a slow trickle of people coming in here to drop off their ballots.Some of them coming into make sure that their names are read so they can vote here in California. As you know, a lot of people can vote by mail. So they've already dropped in their ballots and maybe have even gotten their texts from the state saying that their ballot has been received and it's been counted. So that's already what the situation is here. But while we do not see such large turnouts for the primary votes, this one does have a lot of importance because of that Senate race that you were just speaking of. The way things are done here in California, the top two candidates that win, no matter what party they're from, go on to the November ballot. So we've seen a lot of ad spending here. In fact, since the beginning of February, more money has been spent on ads here for this Senate race in California than have been spent on the presidential race. More than $71 million has been spent on that. And we're seeing Adam Schiff, who says he's running as if he is the underdog, spending a lot of money. He's got a lot of support from the California Democrats here. There's support within Congress for him as well. So he's moving his momentum that way. And also trying to raise the profile of Steve Garvey, the Republican, which may seem counterintuitive. But he's hoping that if he can get Steve Garvey to be the number-two winner, then it will be a Democrat versus Republican come November. Which since the odds here of Democrats are two to one versus Republicans, he sees that as a shoe in that he would be able to fill that position that has been empty since Senator Feinstein passed away in September -- Brianna?",

When you get your ballot, you do have to vote for Senator twice.And the reason is there's one to vote for who will finish out Senator Feinstein's term. And then you have to vote again for the full six- year term that will begin January 2025. Now you remember Governor Newsom appointed Laphonza Butler to be in that position for now. She already indicated she wasn't going to run for it. So you have to vote to see who will end out the year. And then vote for that full six-year term. And, whether or not people are going to vote for the same person or not, that's what we're waiting to see. But it's a very special situation here in California, for sure.",

In just three weeks, jury selection is going to begin in his hush money trial in New York.Then in April, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on whether Trump has immunity for alleged crimes he committed while in office. That ruling will impact if and when Trump's federal election subversion case and his Georgia interference trial may happen. On July 8th, special prosecutor, Jack Smith, wants to start Trump's classified documents trial. And a week later, Republicans hold their national convention where Trump is hoping to officially become the GOP presidential nominee. Let's discuss the loaded calendar and more with Anthony Scaramucci. He's a former Trump White House communications director. Anthony, thanks so much for sharing part of your afternoon with us. I'm wondering, as you hear about the slew of court dates that Donald Trump has and you're watching tonight on Super Tuesday as it appears that he's just going to dominate across the map. What are you specifically watching for that would give you any indication that there's a weakness in Trump's argument for president that might be persuasive to voters in his base?",

      "sentences": "Persuasive, the voters in his base, Boris, I'm not so sure. Because I think Mr. Trump is probably right. You can shoot people on Fifth Avenue and there'll be some level of art and support in his base.However, some of your polling, CNN polling suggests that if he's convicted in any one of those cases, there might be a few people that leave him. What I think would be the most concerning thing is -- are Independents, Mr. Trump knows that he's not polling well with Nikki Haley voters. I think it's a blended 40 percent of those voters say they will not vote for him under any circumstances. And so you guys know, you have to win the crossover vote to win the presidency. Bernie Sanders voters did not vote for Secretary Clinton. She lost. But Hillary Clinton voters did vote for Barack Obama. He won. And of course, Mr. Trump got the voters from the Republicans in 2016. So this is a big issue for him. I'm going to say something very contrary -- contrarian on your air. I think Jack Smith's onto something with that -- that July 8th court date. Right now, the Trump campaign is riding high. They want a 9-0 in the Supreme Court. But if you're hearing oral arguments in April, you could render a decision in June, which is customary for the court. And I don't think they give Mr. Trump, or any president for that matter, absolute immunity. Selective immunity sure, while you're in office. But I don't think the Supreme Court wants a president to have the ability to assassinate adversaries or to potentially even insurrect the American government. So you could be in a situation here, three weeks before the convention, where Mr. Trump is in a criminal prosecution with the chief witness being Mark Meadows, his former White House chief of staff.",

Here are some of the other headlines we're watching this hour.Starting in Michigan, where investigators are looking into an explosive fire at a vape shop that sent debris raining down nearly a mile away and killed an onlooker. Officials say the vape shop was storing more than 1,000 vape pens -- sorry -- 100,000 vape pens and an excessive number of butane canisters, more than what is allowed for the space. Were told the 19-year-old who was watching the fire from up to a half- mile away was struck and killed by one of those canisters. And an interstate in Nashville has been narrowed to just two lanes today, as officials investigate the scene of an overnight plane crash. Traffic cameras were recording as a small plane fell onto the highway shoulder and burst into flames, killing all five people on board. Shortly before impact, the pilot can be heard by air traffic control in an audio warning that he'd lost engine power and asking for safe place to land. And finally, a retired Army lieutenant colonel has been charged with sharing classified information on a foreign dating Web site. Prosecutors say, back in 2022, David Franklin Slater attended classified briefings about the war in Ukraine and then sent the classified information to someone who claimed to be a woman living in Ukraine.",
