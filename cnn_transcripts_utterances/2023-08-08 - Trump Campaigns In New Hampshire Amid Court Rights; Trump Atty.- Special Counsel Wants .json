But the question is whether or not the former president can tamp down his rhetoric, particularly when it comes to his various legal problems.Now, I will tell you, it doesn't seem as though he's going to. Just moments ago, they were testing out a video that went after Alvin Bragg, obviously, from that New York indictment as well as the Special Counsel Jack Smith, and Fani Willis, clearly putting those legal issues front and center here just a moment ago. And we also saw another clip from a video in which they painted him to be a victim of a corrupt DOJ saying he would never give up, he would never stop fighting for his supporters. And that's really what we expect to hear today. That is what Donald Trump's narrative has been around all of this taking these legal issues that have been mounting these investigations, these charges and turning them into a political winning point. They believe that they being trumped seem that they can craft a narrative around this that sells votes to Republicans and even possibly some independents. Now, whether or not that can happen is obviously up in the air. But I will tell you, he has a big crowd here. People were waiting outside. And those people that I talked to did say they believe that there is some sort of conspiracy against the former president.",

You don't necessarily want defendant sharing sensitive information that they learned in the course of preparing for trial. But here there are pretty extraordinary circumstances, right?We know the former president, it often goes on social media to share things, the prosecutors have expressed concern about how this could impact witnesses, other people in this case. Now, obviously, prosecutors, they want a very broad protective order. They want this to be quite restrictive. And they laid out their reasons for why. But the former president's lawyers are asking for something more narrow. They're saying this should be limited to only the most sensitive information. They also pointed the fact that this kind of protective order is what has been applied in other January 6 cases. But fair to note, this is unlike any other January 6 cases.",

And, of course, it is enabled him to not address the substance of the allegations against him, which are, you know, overwhelmingly negative.I think when you get past that top line in their response to the government's motion, their argument about restricting the protective order to only truly sensitive materials, it makes sense. It's not unreasonable. And this both positions anticipate a process by which they can essentially argue later about individual pieces of evidence that have been turned over that the government wants to protect and the defense would like to be able to share with people or disseminate. So I think the substance of the Trump team's argument is actually once you get past the First Amendment --",

And some witnesses do, we're told there were five investigators, three prosecutors, two FBI agents there for this interview.And this is his first time meeting with prosecutors previously handed over hundreds of documents. We assumed that most of the questions would be about Rudy Giuliani. As you noted, he's a longtime associate of Rudy Giuliani. He was on the legal team working looking for any alleged fraud. But interestingly, part of the interview is about Rudy Giuliani, but they also asked about other people too. Of course, Epstein, Mike Romans, they also asked about Sidney Powell.

But to the extent that Trump attempts to make as a part of his defense, essentially relitigating the question of whether or not there was, in fact, fraud, Kerik and his work, those documents give the government some insight as to what they actually investigated. So it'll identify other potential witnesses, people who claimed fraud, people who signed affidavits about alleged fraud, and it kind of enables them to move forward on kind of looking into the background of those allegations and how they were disproven before they'll need that, that trial.",

You're in touch with conservative voters every single day there. Do you think that what you just heard is a message that will resonate?BOB VANDER PLAATS, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, THE FAMILY LEADER: Well, I think that message is resonating, Dana, in regards to we've seen different versions of that ad, where people are basically saying, hey, there's a lot we can thank the former president, his administration, what they've done. But there's an exhaustion level right now about a complaint about the past, the continuing indictments, and the more indictments coming.
