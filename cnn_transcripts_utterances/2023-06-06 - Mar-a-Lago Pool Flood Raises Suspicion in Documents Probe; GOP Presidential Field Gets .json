Chris Christie set to announce that he is running today, and we're expecting Mike Pence to jump in tomorrow.This hour of CNN This Morning starts right now. So, this is where we begin this morning, because what is happening in Ukraine is very, very significant. This is CNN exclusive reporting. We'll get to Ukraine in a moment. But this is where we begin in the United States, because sources say that a Mar-a-Lago maintenance worker flooded a computer server room where surveillance video was stored when that worker drained the club's pool. This happened in October, and it's just raising a lot of questions in the special counsel's probe of Donald Trump and his handling of classified documents. We are told this is the same maintenance worker who was spotted on surveillance footage moving boxes before the FBI executed a search warrant and found hundreds of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago. It's not clear if the surveillance video room was flooded intentionally or if this happened by mistake, but our sources are telling us it happened during a string of incidents that federal prosecutors at least find suspicious.",

Prosecutors have been investigating whether Trump and his staffers tried to hide the classified documents from federal agents.Let's bring in CNN Senior Justice Correspondent Evan Perez. And, Evan, prosecutors have been asking questions about this flood, whether the surveillance video was tampered with. What's their endgame as far as you know of right now on this issue specifically?",

There is obviously the moving back and forth of boxes around the time that prosecutors were down there to visit and to try to retrieve some of these documents that were being stored at Mar-a-Lago. And so for prosecutors, they're asking witnesses about this flood. And the timing is the key here.This, of course, came after there was subpoena for the production of these documents. It came after the FBI did the search in Mar-a-Lago in August, and then this happens in October also after prosecutors had sent another subpoena for additional surveillance video. And then they finally sent a preservation order at the end of August. Again, all of this driving towards the idea of whether anyone else besides the former president, whether those workers who were moving boxes, anybody, was involved in trying to obstruct this investigation. Obviously, we don't know whether there's going to be any charges, but the picture we're getting, certainly, is the activity that prosecutors are driving towards is to try to wrap up this investigation. And so trying to get the answer to some of these questions is very key. I will note that the sources told Katelyn Polantz and Kaitlan Collins that at least in some testimony that prosecutors received, they said there was no damage that was done to this I.T. room where some of this stuff happened.",

They also met with Jack Smith, who I don't think they really wanted to see. After all, their complaints are all focused on the conduct of Jack Smith's office.Again, we don't know their exact complaints, Poppy and Phil, but we know that prosecutors have obtained material that they're very concerned about, the Trump team is very concerned about, including things that they believe are attorney/client privilege materials that almost never fall into the hands of prosecutors.

And will that in and of itself give Donald Trump a hand up in this race?And I think that we're getting perilously close to that point where you're looking at a sizable field that is pretty similar to the last time around when he utilized the rules of the nominating process on the Republican side that make it really easy for someone like a Donald Trump who's getting 30 percent and above to sweep because it's a winner take all system. Once you get a plurality in some of these states, you can take all of the delegates, and they keenly understand that. So, while all of these candidates have some rationale in their own minds for running, the real question is going to be down the road, at what point do they get out? Because I think it's going to be one of those situations where they have to just look at the numbers and the math and determine whether it's possible for them to win.

That's what he's going to be up against.And so I think people are really putting him in a kind of Trump antagonist role in this race. That's partly because there hasn't really been evidence that he's been able to make kind of inroads among a Republican electorate. I think when we think about the Pences and the Christies, they're all kind of running like ideological test cases in this race. Can you be anti-Trump and still have some level of support among Republicans? And for Pence, is that evangelical wing? Is that kind of pro-life wing still driving a lot of the Republican activism? He's someone who has a lot of trust among that group of people, but it's not very clear that that means he's going to be prioritized over others, particularly when he crossed Trump on things like January 6th and the rest. And so I do think that these new candidates in the race are testing kind of theories about the electorate, but we don't really have a sense that they're really able to build those type of coalitions. Because I think to Abby's point, this year is really about can you break into that top tier? And so if you're DeSantis, you have to be looking at these type of people getting in the race and saying, are they kind of cobbling up 2 or 3 percent that I might need to cross Donald Trump's threshold, because, as she said, those winner take all states mean that his high floor in that 30s and 40s becomes really, really important in this race.",

In just in the last few days, that indeed happened on a limited level with the road across the top, giving way and the waters pouring over the top of the dam.There have been explosions subsequent to the breach, which may be attributed to the mines and other explosives that the Russian occupiers had left at that location. But nonetheless, 80 settlements and villages, towns and others are under threat, eight have been completely inundated. According to the Ukrainian authorities Nova Kakhovka, the town right next door, under Russian control. The Russian authorities have admitted has been inundated. There is a threat to Kherson city, but the greater threat is actually to the Russian forces who occupy the East side of the bank. That is the location, those are the locations from which they have been using artillery and rockets even direct fire from tanks to attack. Ukrainian civilians and military on the other side of the river and they are in the lower ground, much more vulnerable to flooding. The Kyiv issue then, will be whether or not they had pre warning that this breach in the dam was going to happen or whether they too have been caught up in this. But either way, it's a deep humanitarian disaster for the Ukrainian population on both sides of that river, with the Ukrainian Government in Kherson ordering evacuations, offering evacuations, rather evacuation trains and exhorting people in the low- lying areas to get out of their homes, release their pets and flee with their essential documents.",

The United States has upsurge military support to Taiwan to make sure that Taiwan can defend themselves in the case of a Chinese invasion. And obviously, that ruffles feathers in Beijing.

We have also sanctioned innumerable Chinese high-level officials for their conduct in Xinjiang.Their cooperation with Russia, and as I mentioned, the Biden administration has a suite of policies that standing up and ability to combat China's economic and military rise. I understand that there's a lot of Republicans out there who are, you know, interested in our entire relationship with China being one of confrontation. I just don't think that's smart, because what we are trying to avoid is a direct military conflict, which would be disastrous for the world for the United States and for China. And so, I think you've got to have a policy of strategic competition while you're also pursuing some ability to deconflict and cooperate where we can cooperate. And we shouldn't forget that there are places where we can still work together, whether it's on North Korea or Iran or climate, we can't give up opportunities to try to find common cause where they exist with the Chinese Government. Those are limited, but we shouldn't forsake that opportunity.",
