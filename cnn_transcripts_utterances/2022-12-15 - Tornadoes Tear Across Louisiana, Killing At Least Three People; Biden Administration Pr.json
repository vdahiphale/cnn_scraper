I'm going to say episode six is very much the fallout.Now, I'm still going through it. It is quite tough to watch in parts. The first episode that we saw today, episode four starts in such a positive note. The big wedding day, Meghan said she felt calm. It's beautiful moments, unseen footage again, like we saw in some of the episodes released last week. But very quickly, it moves to the couple saying that there was jealousy within the royal family, particularly on a Royal Tour, which I think is a turning point, they say. They say that in the royal family, they don't like people marrying in and meant to be Paris as a sporting act, then stealing the limelight. They say that is what changed the narrative and it moves on to Meghan talking more and we heard this in Oprah, but expanding much more and how she felt suicidal and how difficult that was. And we hear from her mom on how difficult it was to know that about your daughter, Doria Ragland is very tearful, wipes away tears and says she couldn't protect her. Harry couldn't protect her. And, actually, Harry goes on to say that he actually didn't deal with that situation very well. Meghan says that she sought help. She wanted help for her depression. And she was told she wouldn't be able to get that. It wouldn't look good. It moves on to the royal comms and how they work against each other. Harry says the different royal households, he says, that they do brief against each other. They plant stories to ensure that one comms team from one households principle isn't in the press. They might throw negative stories somewhere else. This is what they are saying. Of course, we don't have a response at this stage from the palace. I'm not sure we will, but I will keep watching.
