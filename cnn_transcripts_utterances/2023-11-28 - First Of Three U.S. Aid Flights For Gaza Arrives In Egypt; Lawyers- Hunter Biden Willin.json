The cargo being airlifted includes medical supplies, food and winter gear as the region enters its rainy season. Once the supplies arrive, they'll be distributed by UN agencies on the ground in Gaza. Officials say some 800 trucks carrying aid have made it in during this temporary truce. But the UN says that's just a drop in the ocean. They're words, drop in the ocean, compared to what is really needed. CNN's Larry Madowo is in Cairo for us. Larry, how vital is this aid that's arriving today?",

And the World Health Organization now says everybody everywhere has dire health needs. Listen to this warning.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARGARET HARRIS, W.H.O. SPOKESWOMAN: Eventually we will see more people dying from disease than we're even seeing from the bombardment. If we are not able to put back this health system and provide the basics of life, food, water, medicines and of course fuel to operate the hospitals. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The food distribution system, the need is just far greater than there is availability. Even though 800 trucks have come in in this last five days of the pause, the UN has said that they would need 200 trucks coming in every day for two months continuously to meet the needs here. So you're talking about food and fuel and water and cooking gas and baby formula. And as winter gets close by, winter weather gear. Because during the rainy season in Gaza, there leads to some displacement, some flooding, so all the aid the U.S. is bringing in, the Qataris, the Egyptians are barely scratching the surface -- Wolf.",

So that's what Republicans had asked for. They had asked for a deposition behind closed doors and then perhaps later on, if possible, a public hearing.What Hunter Biden's lawyers were saying is, no, no, we're going to go straight to a public hearing because we want the world to see what the answers are and not give the Republicans a chance to sort of distort what Hunter Biden says.

My sense is that this pro-Iran hacking group -- and there are a number of them that have sprung up around the Israel Hamas war. Some of them have ties to the Iranian government. We're not so sure about this particular one.But they're scanning the Internet for Israeli made industrial computers that are installed at water facilities, that other critical infrastructure facilities in the U.S. and elsewhere. And they're trying to send a political message. We have to point out that the water facility told CNN that there was no threat to drinking water at any point. And they were able to detect the intrusion and sort of seal things off. So this is very much a psychological message to anyone using Israeli made equipment. And it startled the general manager of the facility, who told me he'd never in his wildest dreams would he think he'd be caught up in this in some sort of hack to this, you know, cyber-attacks accompanying the this war in the Middle East. Here we have a county, you know, outside of Pittsburgh that is serving 15,000 people. So it's a very bizarre situation for them. But they're taking more precautions, and they're realizing that they can also be targeted if they have exposures online to this sort of thing -- Boris.",

Some context -- that's over a billion dollars more than last year's Cyber Monday, which was the previous record. So that means that yesterday was the biggest online shopping day ever.And so, this is more evidence of the \"R\" word. Not the recession that so many economists predicted we'd be in right about now. The other \"R\" word, \"resilience.\" Because even though the cost of living is still high and borrowing costs are elevated. You really can't bet against the willingness of Americans to shop, especially when there are deals to be had. Now, retailers did feel the need to offer some deep discounts up. Up to 31 percent off list price for electronics. My almost four-year-old will be thrilled to hear that toys were priced up to 27 percent off list price. Because he knows that lower prices means more toy monster trucks. But we also saw deep discounts for apparel, furniture and appliances. Now one thing we do need to keep an eye on is how much of this is being fueled by debt. Including that short term financing known as \"Buy Now Pay Later.\" Adobe found that \"Buy Now Pay\" later usage spiked by over 42 percent this Cyber Monday versus last Cyber Monday to almost a billion dollars. So we do need to monitor that. But still big picture, this holiday shopping season appears to be off to a very solid start -- especially online shopping.",
