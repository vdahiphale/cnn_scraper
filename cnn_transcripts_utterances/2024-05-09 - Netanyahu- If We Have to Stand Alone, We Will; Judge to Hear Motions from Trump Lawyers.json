So I think that gives you a feel for some of the emotion coming from Israel's political leadership here, but the broader question of whether Israel will heed the very strong warning that the U.S. is essentially delivering about going in to population centers remains to be seen. The rhetoric that we are hearing, the satellite imagery that we are seeing, all seems to point towards Israel pushing ahead with a broader offensive in Rafah and that was even communicated to mediators in Cairo, the Israeli delegation in those talks at the end of them said essentially that they are going to press on with Rafah and that they were very unhappy with what they described as large areas of disagreement that remain between the two sides.

It has been days that aid has not been able to get in, in the quantities that it is needed. The Rafah Border Crossing is closed. Kerem Shalom has been open on and off for the last couple of days, but according to the UN and the State Department, just a few trucks have been getting through. The UN warning that we are talking about days before hospitals will not have enough fuel, will start to collapse, and on top of that, you have what the WFP has called a full-blown famine in the northern part of the country. You have the spread of disease. You have aid workers on the ground in these so-called safe zones like Al-Mawasi, who say, they don't have the capacity to cope with a huge influx of displaced people. More than 80,000 reportedly have already left Eastern Rafah, but some 1.4 million people are hunkered down in that city, and not only do they not have the capacity, they don't have the infrastructure, they don't have the food. So this has all the makings of a cataclysmic disaster and it is hard to fathom that Israel's leadership is not aware of that. They have the indicated in the past that they have also been trying to use the sort of threat of Rafah to try to extract more leverage or put more pressure on Hamas, whether that will be successful or whether that has indeed been counterproductive, remains to be seen. But the most crucial thing here is that for the ordinary citizens of Gaza and the people who are sleeping in Rafah tonight with no idea where they're supposed to go, how they're supposed to get there, and what will meet them when they do arrive somewhere, this is a truly dire and frightening moment.",

Can we call this the right decision at the right moment for President Biden as he weighs up domestic political pressure, the protests that we are seeing in colleges across the United States combined with the loss of Palestinian lives, and of course, the security of a key ally? EDWARD DJEREJIAN, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO ISRAEL: Julia, I think one of the key factors here is that the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu has virtually snubbed President Biden on a number of the issues arising from the October 7th attack on Israel and the massive Israeli retaliation against Gaza, and the crunch point has now arrived given the fact that the humanitarian disaster and crisis in Gaza has caught the attention, not only in American campuses, but all over the world, and the Israeli government is under increasing pressure that, what's your end game? And the Biden administration has been seeking from Netanyahu to learn what is the end game after Gaza? There is a school of thought within Israel itself that the military operation in Gaza has already succeeded, and that going in to Rafah and eliminating two or four more battalions so-called is not going to bring a military victory. Calling a mission accomplished is a very dubious thing when you're battling a group such as Hamas. So the problem I think the administration has, which is a real problem is that they are leaning on a very weak read and that weak read is Benjamin Netanyahu. Commentators have talked about President Biden's challenges between the Republicans and the liberal progressive wing of the Democratic Party, but look at Netanyahu, he has cobbled together the most extreme right-wing government in the history of Israel. He has three ministers in Cabinet positions who are virtual annexationists and who do not want a settlement with the Palestinians and the creation of an Independent Palestinian state, they want to increase Israeli settlements in what they call Judea and Samaria and if Netanyahu gives in to the pleas of the American president, the international community, to cease and desist on the Rafah military. He then faces the prospect that these ministers were both from his coalition and he will lose this coalition, which is very essential to him, not only politically, but personally. It is the get-out-of-jail card because these are the three major indictments and this coalition is helping him evade the worst-case scenarios in that, so there is a personal political element here that is very important. And the other thing is, I just need to emphasize is what Israel's strategy after the military operation, even if they go into Rafah. They have never done that.",

Earlier, a Trump organization bookkeeper, Vice President of HarperCollins publisher Trump's Oval Office director were the latest witnesses all establishing in effect, a chain of custody of those payments to Stormy Daniels to kill that story during the 2016 election. Of course, they had a tough act to follow that, the testimony from Stormy Daniels herself. The jury was just dismissed. The judge is now considering issues raised by Trump's team, including a renewed motion for a mistrial not expected to accept that motion. The defense called out apparent discrepancies during their cross examination of Stormy Daniels, of various interviews she gave over the years regarding the relationship with Trump. Trump's lawyers established ways that Daniels gained publicity and money by going public with her story during the prosecution's redirect. However, Daniels said she signed a non-disclosure agreement offered by Trump and Michael Cohen, which affected statements she made publicly, but she said she signed it out of fear for her safety. Katelyn Polantz is joining us now from Washington. First to this decision by the prosecution not to call Karen McDougal, is that a surprise at this point?",

They are the people that would have painted more of the picture of how these hush money schemes in 2016 took shape, specifically with the \"National Enquirer.\" A little bit different than how the Stormy Daniels payments were set up through her lawyer and through Michael Cohen directly. But there are other things happening right now in the courtroom that are really bringing in the situation for Donald Trump as a criminal defendant, who is also running for president, really putting that in stark relief. His attorneys right now are arguing to the judge that they want an exception to some of the gag order. The gag order that bars Donald Trump during this trial from talking specifically about witnesses that are testifying against him or could be called and jurors in the case, they want him to be able to publicly speak to voters, potential voters for him or against him, that he in a way where he can respond to Stormy Daniels. There is clearly concern on Trump's legal team, as well as from apparently their client, the former president himself, that he wants to be able to perhaps refute some of the story that Stormy Daniels told about that 2006 alleged sexual encounter that she had. The testimony was at times quite detailed and embarrassing to the former president. It was heard by the jury. It is now part this case, but what his defense team is asking the judge to do is let Donald Trump go out there publicly and talk about Stormy Daniels and the testimony that she gave under oath because he is running for president, something that they are telling the judge over and over again, waiting to see what the judge does here.

The Chinese tech firm Baidu has reportedly parted ways with its PR chief after she sparked a public relations crisis.In a series of videos on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, she boasted about her strict management style and the grueling demands she placed on her staff. She even called out an employee who refused to go on a 50-day business trip saying, quote, \"Why should I take my employees' family into consideration? I'm not her mother-in-law.\" The executive has now reportedly left the company. Baidu has not yet responded to a request for comment. Marc Stewart is in Beijing for us. Marc, there's plenty of things we could talk about here. I do remember when Jack Ma of Alibaba praise the, was it 9-9-6, 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., six days a week?

If we look at the reality, the economy here in China isn't so hot, it isn't so strong. And young people feel like they are working ridiculously long hours. They are at a highly competitive environment. And not getting so much in return and are really questioning, what's the purpose, what's the point of all of this. So then we have this executive or perhaps former executive from such a well-known firm as Baidu, which I will note is pretty much like Google here in China. When she makes these remarks about her very long hours, including the fact that she was working so hard, she missed her elder son's birthday, it really creates some friction.

Instead of wearing high heels and a business suit, young people are choosing to wear slippers and puffy jackets to work. It's this idea of wearing a gross work outfits. That's what it's referred to online as this protest. The reality is this. China is dealing with an aging population. Fewer people are going to be in the workforce. Fewer young people are choosing to have children. It's going to result in these real questions about productivity. So perhaps this is going to be a point of reckoning in all of this.",

So the judge held firm on his gag order. The argument on the mistrial because of Miss Daniels' prejudicial testimony was going on as I left the courtroom to come talk to you, but Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass is making a powerful point, Jim, that the details that Trump's lawyers are complaining about that do not belong in this case actually are some of the most probative evidence we have because all of that stuff that Miss Daniels testified about is what would have come out if the hush money had not been paid. And so she illustrates as messy as it is the damage that would have been done. The judge has already rejected that mistrial request, and I don't think he's going to grant it on its renewal.",
