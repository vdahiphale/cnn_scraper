Prince Harry and Meghan were leaving an event in New York City when the relentless pursuit began lasting, they say, more than two hours and involving multiple near-collisions. Their security team says the couple were shaken by the incident but thankfully, no one was hurt.CNN's Scott McLean live in London with more. I mean -- and at one point, this couple were basically hiding out in a police precinct trying to get away from the paparazzi. Has the royal family responded to this incident?",

      "sentences": "Hey, Christine. So, yes, no response -- no comment from Buckingham Palace and no comment from Kensington Palace, which represents Prince William. And the Sussexes say that no one from the royal family has reached out to them either.We have, though, gotten a statement from one of the celebrity photography agencies that said it had four photographers there. It's called Backgrid USA. It said that its freelancers had a professional responsibility to be there. It denied that there were any near- collisions as the Sussexes have claimed. And they even accuse one of the Sussexes drivers as part of their four-car convoy of driving in a way that some may perceive as reckless. Now, no one has claimed that this was ever a high-speed chase but the reason that this dragged on for so long Christine is because the Sussexes were intent on making sure that the photographers didn't follow them back to the place that they were actually staying at. So after about an hour and a half of trying to lose this pack of paparazzi with no luck they ended up, as you said, going back to the police station to try to regroup. They ended up getting in a taxi to try to escape that way. That didn't work. That taxi driver, by the way, said that he never felt like he was in any danger. He also said that he saw no aggressive driving while the Sussexes were in his vehicle. Police have also described the situation in more benign terms saying that the paparazzi made the journey more challenging. And what's interesting here Christine is that none of the major British tabloids have actually, at least in print, published the photos that were taken by these paparazzi. The Daily Mail, one of the main tabloids, did originally publish them on the website -- on their website, but once the Sussexes came out with their version of events they were taken down. From the Sussex's viewpoint, they think that publishing or distributing these photos essentially only encourages this kind of dangerous behavior that they're alleging here, though at least one American gossip outlet still has those photos up on -- up online, Christine.",

A Chinese stand-up comedian under a police investigation after making a joke that loosely referenced a slogan to describe the country's military. Li Haoshi, whose stage name is House, has been fired and forced to apologize for that joke. A subsidiary of the firm that represented him has also been fined nearly $2 million.

      "sentences": "Well, Christine, the latest on this front is a woman in northeastern China has now been detained by police for appearing to defend this joke in a social media post. And to the mostly young fans of stand-up comedy, of course, they are rightfully fearful that this episode could spell the premature death of the entire industry, which had just gone from underground to mainstream.And to many, this is a rather tragic reminder of the extremely sensitive line that not just comedians but other artists and public figures have to strike in this highly-censored environment where everything could become taboo almost overnight. Now, this offending punchline really sounds innocuous to most people outside of China because this comedian simply used this phrase \"fine style of work\" and \"capable of winning battles.\" But the problem here is this was first uttered in 2013 by none other than Chinese leader Xi Jinping to describe the Chinese military. So that loose reference has now cost him everything, effectively shutting down the company he once worked for and even potentially, the industry. And he's now potentially going to jail because of that police investigation you mentioned. Because in 2021, the country enacted a law banning any insults to military personnel and the authorities have been prosecuting people for that crime and in previous cases sending them to jail for at least seven months. So that's why a lot of artists (PH) think this whole saga is the latest reflection of Xi Jinping's philosophy of reasserting the party's absolute control in every aspect of Chinese society -- and that is really no joke, Christine.",

But when you have Jimmy Butler -- Playoff Jimmy -- anything is possible. And the Celtics -- they actually had a nine-point lead at the half last night. But then, Butler and Miami had an incredible third quarter. The Heat scoring 46 in the third -- most ever for them in a quarter in the playoffs and second-most ever given up by Boston. Now, the Celtics got back to within four late in the fourth but Butler coming through again. This three right here is really going to put the game away. The Heat win game one 123-116. Butler, 35 points, seven assists, five rebounds, and six steals. And after the game he talked about the privilege of being the leader of the Heat. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

U.S. borrowing costs spiked $1.3 billion in 2011, the last time the U.S. was on the brink of a debt default. Congress raised the debt ceiling two days before the money ran out but it still cost taxpayers.Net interest on the debt already accrued, of course, is a big driver of growth in the national death, along with health care costs, payments for an aging population, and insufficient tax revenues. Now, debating tax hikes and reforms to popular programs like Medicare and Social Security -- that's not what's happening in Washington right now. That seems to be a non-starter. It will take serious, hard, bipartisan work to prevent the national debt from choking in the country in the decades ahead. Debt ceiling brinksmanship is anything but that. All right. Looking at markets around the world right now, you can see Asian shares closed higher. Europe has opened higher. And on Wall Street, stock index futures -- if we pull that up -- also leaning up here. After gains on Wall Street yesterday, the news of negotiations underway to raise that debt ceiling inspiring confidence around the world here. Treasury Sec. Janet Yellen and bank CEOs meet today. The two-year Treasury yield rose to 4.15 percent, up from Tuesday's close of 4.07 percent. Bank stocks yesterday popped after Western Alliance said its deposits grew by more than $2 billion from the end of March to mid- May. Data out today for investors to chew on -- existing home sales for April, mortgage rates, and weekly jobless claims. All right, the return to offices stalled across the country. The Wall Street Journal reporting average city office occupancy rates topped 50 percent at the start of the year but now that number has stalled as companies embrace hybrid work models. I want to bring in Rob Sadow. He is the co-founder and chief executive officer of Scoop. It's a company that builds software for hybrid teams. Good morning.

Employees know that there are competitive options out there. It's still a tight labor market and have been pushing back really hard on that.I think companies, at the same time, are recognizing -- or a lot of executives feel that if employees are not in the office at all maybe something gets lost in terms of onboarding or mentorship, or ability to collaborate. And so, I think what's really happening is we're finding a balance -- two to three days a week, on average. Employees are happier with that than five days but maybe not thrilled. Executives are happier with that than no time in the office. But it's maybe not exactly what they want but it's a bit of a middle ground that folks seem to be able to align on.",
