All tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\"So, as you and I are having this conversation tonight, President Joe Biden is in the air right now, and he's about to land in Israel in the middle of the fog of war. This is his planned summit with Jordan's King, Egyptian president, and the Palestinian authority president has suddenly been cancelled. Cancelled, of course, in the wake of yet another shocking tragedy. This time, a massive blast at a Gaza hospital, of all places, killing hundreds of people. Now, we are trying to get a straight answer as to who exactly is responsible. And as you can imagine, the finger pointing has begun, and there is a whole lot at stake. Now, Palestinian officials blame -- they blame this on the Israeli airstrikes, but the Israel Defense Forces have categorically -- that's their words -- denied any involvement, blaming and said what they call a failed rocket launch by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group, which is a rival Islamist militant group in Gaza. Now, we're told by a spokesperson for the IDF that they will release evidence of this being the errant rocket they claim and not at all an Israeli airstrike, and that spokesperson is hoping that people will see that very footage whenever they do release it and draw only one conclusion. Of course, many of us wonder if consensus is even possible on days like this. Well, with the American president in route, the U.S. working feverishly to analyze Israeli intelligence, to try to understand exactly what happened at the hospital. But the protesters who were on the ground, they're not waiting for some kind of military readout or for some bureaucratic process to play out. They are angry and they have taken to the streets in Jordan, in Baghdad, Tehran. And as the protests grow, so is the concern that this war could spread. Now, the stakes are increasing now for President Biden in an already high-stakes diplomatic mission. And frankly, with all that is at stake, the real question tonight is, can diplomacy even still work? And if President Biden is not to be the one who can possibly broker peace there, who will or which country will be able to, and what will be the cost of that? Here with me tonight, two people who are uniquely qualified to answer some of these questions, CNN's Jerusalem correspondent Hadas Gold and chief national security correspondent Alex Marquardt. Now tonight, we also have some new and disturbing video shot inside the hospital after the explosion. I'm going to warn you, it is graphic, but it's also an important and sad reality of this war.

It took a beat for Israel to then turn around and say, in fact, this was an errant rocket from Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and we are waiting, we have been waiting for several hours now for them to present this evidence. What we do know is that Israeli intelligence has sent some of what they have to bolster their case to American counterparts, specifically signals intelligence, which means intercepts. It can also include drone footage. Those are two of the things that the Israelis have actually mentioned. And so, this is something that the U.S. intelligence is looking at right now, but they have not made any kind of decisive assessment as to whether what Israel is saying about this Palestinian rocket is true.",

The damage is already done. Look at just the media coverage over the last few hours. Look at what's happening on the streets in these cities all around the world. Israelis are being warned to immediately leave places like Turkey. Like at this moment, if you're vacationing in Turkey, get on a plane, get out now. So even if it turns out that the Israelis are correct, that President Biden agrees with their assessment this was an errant rocket, the damage is done. We've seen the summit that has been canceled is supposed to help with this humanitarian situation. President Biden's trip is being changed dramatically.

Islamic Jihad is much more focused on just militant activity. They often act on their own, but they do also act in concert with Hamas. There have been several conflicts between Israel and, specifically, Islamic Jihad that have kept Hamas sort of out of the situation, they have their own arsenal of rockets. And also keep in mind, they say they are holding 30 of those Israeli hostages. So, they are definitely a player in this. They're not the main player, but they are definitely a big player in this.",

You know, it's not an unbelievable idea since they do that all the time.But you've already had Saudi Arabia and UAE publicly come out and condemn this attack and blame Israel. You have Al Jazeera making that claim. You have the Arab street who is being fed this idea by many leaders, and certainly in the mosques, they're going to be hearing this and they want to hear this. It's reinforcing a narrative that is something that they have felt for many, many decades, that the Palestinians are the aggrieved party. And so, you know, we're pushing against something now that has been unleashed, and I think we really need to understand what a potential watershed moment this is. The next 24 to 48 hours are going to tell us whether the West Bank is going to explode, whether Hezbollah decides to remain restrained, whether the Arab populations push these countries and these actors into actions that they don't necessarily want. I personally do not believe that Iran wants a full-up war with the United States, right?

This opposition was spread throughout the country and many had different reasons. I think that Jim Jordan's bid for the speakership is in deep trouble.
