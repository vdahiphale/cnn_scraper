We are through the first part of the morning rush here at Reagan National Airport, but TSA tells me the airport's designed to handle about 40,000 people in total on any one given day, and we are going to get right up to that limit.The issue is not really getting through security, but what happens after. The weather's still having a pretty big impact. Here are the latest numbers from FlightAware. We just hit 1,000 delays nationwide today after we saw 5,200 yesterday. So, airlines are right now in recovery mode trying to get all these people from what -- to where they need to go. The anticipation from TSA 2.7 million people passing through security at America's airports today. The big thing that the TSA is trying to underscore is to not add to any of the delays, if you can help it, and really be on your game going through security. The line here, at some points for standard screening, has gone up to about 25 minutes under the TSA goal of getting you through in a half hour or less. And I just want you to listen now to some of the passengers who took that advice to heart. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But also, if you have travel, say, along Interstate 95, you've still got some patches here that are dealing with some pretty wet conditions. Down to the south, again, the main focus for the heavy rain right now is over the Carolinas, starting to see that wrap up across Georgia and Florida should be a little bit drier second half of the day.Off to the north and east, we're starting to see it dry out in New York and Philadelphia, but still have some rain around Providence, Boston and even Portland. And then you've got the snow in the interior portions of New England. Now, these low-pressure systems are going to continue to slide off to the east. That main one finally getting back out over open water and seeing things dry out once we get to late tonight and into the day on Thanksgiving. That means the eastern half of the country for Thanksgiving Day itself likely looks pretty good in most spots. The troublesome area now actually flips to the other half of the country where we've got rain and snow sliding across the Intermountain West, this also pushes into Friday and into the weekend. So, when we're talking about Black Friday and going into the weekend, now you've got snow across the mountain west, also creating some more rain showers across portions of the center of the country. One thing to note, too, is temperatures are going to drop back. Take Denver, for example, high of 68 today, a very nice day out there. Dropping back to a high of only 26 on Friday, and you've got some snow showers into the mix as well. They can expect the forecast calling for about one to three inches in Denver itself. So, you may have some travel problems there on Friday.",

The breaking news coming up.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [10:40:00] BOLDUAN:  We're hours from the first major pause in the Israel-Hamas war. And this, we want to show you, is what we're seeing over Gaza today. Israel continuing its bombardment of Gaza from the air. The pause in fighting is slated to begin at 10:00 a.m. local time tomorrow as part of the deal to free 50 hostages from Hamas captivity in Gaza. So, hours to go and it seems a very active scene still right now. Let's get over to CNN's Jeremy Diamond. He's in Sderot, Israel. Jeremy, what are you seeing and hearing right now?",

And so, it's very clear that they are continuing to carry out these operations up until the moment that this truce begins.One thing that the Israeli Prime Minister has also telegraphed, of course, is the fact that this is simply a pause in the fighting to get the hostages out, but it is not a full ceasefire. And he has made very clear that after that pause and fighting ends that he will resume military operations, that this war will continue up until the Israeli military achieves its objectives as it's been laid out to destroy Hamas. And also, he has said to secure the release, not just of these 50 hostages, but of all of the nearly 240 hostages who are being held in Gaza. In the meantime, we know that this has been a nerve wracking, anxiety induced period for the families of those hostages as they wait to see whether their loved ones will be among those released in this first round.

There were weeks of painstaking negotiations between Israel, the U.S., Qatar, Hamas.CNN's MJ Lee joins us now from the White House.

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, we now have a much clearer picture of the weeks and weeks of intensive negotiations that took place behind the scenes that really got us here. What we have learned is that shortly after October 7th, there was essentially a top-secret channel of communication that was established among just a small group of White House officials and Israeli and Qatari officials to discuss the hostage situation, and essentially negotiate with Hamas.And Omar, last month, we saw the release of those two American women who were being held hostage in Gaza. And when that was successfully executed, we are told it sent a signal to the administration that they basically had a model for how to move forward. And it is when -- that is when they, sort of, set out to try to get out a larger group of hostages. But the challenges that they confronted in dealing with Hamas, they were just immense. We are told that Hamas, for weeks, just refused to give any identifying information about the hostages, like their age, their nationality, their gender. And it became such a major sticking point, actually, that at one point when the parties felt like they were actually close to a deal, they even talked about whether Israel should delay its ground incursion, but ultimately decided not to because they just weren't sold based on the information that Hamas was not providing. They had no proof of life. They hadn't given any identifying information about the hostages. So, Israel went ahead with its ground and incursion on October 27th. We are also told that in the last few days or so, Hamas actually ended up going entirely dark. There was a period where they were just completely not responsive. And when they finally resurfaced, they demanded that the IDF take its forces out of Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza. This was something, obviously, that didn't happen. And then the talks eventually did resume. So, all of this just goes to show you how intensive and complicated and just touch and go these negotiations were. Not to mention, as you mentioned, the phone calls, the conversations that took place from the president himself and other top national security officials like Jake Sullivan, Brett McGurk, CIA director Bill Burns. All of these folks had a big, sort of, behind the scenes role. And I think what we have now is just a much better sense of why these officials all along had said they were just not even willing to get their hopes up sometimes because they really did fear that these talks could break down at any point.",
