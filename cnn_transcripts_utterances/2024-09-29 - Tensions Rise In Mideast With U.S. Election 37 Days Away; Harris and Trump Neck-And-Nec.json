(END VIDEOTAPE) RAJU (on camera):  Good morning and welcome to INSIDE POLITICS SUNDAY. I'm Manu Raju. The Middle East is on edge this morning following Israel's killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah on Friday. There are deepening fears that a wider war could engulf the region. It all comes with just 37 days left until Election Day here in the U.S. Vice presidential -- vice presidential debate is this Tuesday. And with polls showing the race still deadlocked and the candidates spending the weekend in key battleground states. Now reacting to the news from overseas, Vice President Harris saying in a statement, quote: Today's Hezbollah's victims have a measure of justice, but adding diplomacy remains the best path forward. Now, Trump was in Wisconsin yesterday where he did not mention the killing of the Hezbollah leader, but he did paint a dark picture of a Harris presidency over the border and he criticized her by saying this.

And there's just a furious effort ongoing to try to convince that small number of persuadable voters, people who have not made up their mind yet about whether they can vote for Harris or Trump, or maybe they could -- minds can change. A recent poll here shows kind of where that's at. Battleground voters say 10 percent of battleground voters say that their minds could change. Then you look at independents, that number from a Fox News poll nationally, likely voters, 30 percent of independent voters say their minds could change.

They look at \"The New York Times\"/Siena poll just coming out over the weekend. Trump have impact on candidates policies. What kind of impact does this have? That's the question voters from Michigan, Wisconsin and Ohio about Trump's policies, 46 percent say that have helped Donald Trump's policies have helped them. Thirty -- 43 percent say Harris's policies would hurt them. That said, you talk to the Harris campaign quite frequently, Jasmine, if you look at also this number on the economy, Harris is down to Trump when it's asked who do you trust more to handle the economy? Trump 52 percent to 45 percent in September. That's pretty much unchanged from August. So, what level of concern are you hearing from the Harris campaign about that? JASMINE WRIGHT, NOTUS 2024 REPORTER:  I mean, I think those numbers are why you continue to hear the Harris campaign and Harris herself call herself the underdog. They're really trying to change those. It's interesting because for the last two weeks or so, I was asking the campaign whether or not we would hear the vice president roll out more policy, and it was really unclear because I think they were deciding whether or not it was better for them, for her to be in businesses in Pennsylvania and Georgia, versus her to be on that big policy stage. But then they rolled out that economy speech that really tied her personality and her person to how she would be as president on the economy and then we, of course, saw her on the border on over the weekend as they try to bridge that gap between the numbers that they see between her and Trump on the economy and immigration. And it's actually something that they feel confident that they can at least minimize going into November, if not a kind of sew up all the way, but that is why we're seeing her on those policy stages, because they're trying to get to those Americans who don't necessarily trust her on the economy, trying to get to those Americans who don't necessarily believe that she would be as tough on the border as they would want her to be.",

And Governor Walz has very little experience, I think, facing off in this kind of forum against the kind of assault that that we think Vance will pursue. And, you know, in the race that is as close as this one, if it sways just a few thousand votes in Pennsylvania or another one of the very important swing states, that could make a difference, or one more thing, if it entices Donald Trump to think he wants to do another debate, then that could be really significant.",

That's the 33 percent. If 25 percent say that they're not familiar with Walz as of now. The view of J.D. Vance, there has been an unfavorability that has increased since he has jumped into the national stage here as the VP candidate, about 48 percent to 57 percent now view him unfavorably.

I think they grow a vote, share the way they have to do before November.I mean, J.D. Vance's introduction to this race has not been a particularly pleasant one, right? Picking fights with Jennifer Aniston and Taylor Swift is not exactly how I would go about introducing myself to America, but he's obviously made a kind of a specific play, not just, I think to be the attack dog for Donald Trump, but to be a kind of cultural warrior for him, too. J.D. Vance is a reflection of a MAGA ecosystem, that is not just, you know, a reflection of Donald Trump's policies, but the ethos of him. And I think that's what also Vance represents. I think we're going to see kind of two different versions of a masculinity fight happening on that stage on Tuesday. Walz has presented himself as such a cheerful warrior for Harris, and I think someone who represents a pivot from what Democrats have typically done to defend issues that he has done so as governor and on the ticket. And Vance is going to try to exploit that. I think we're going to see kind of two different versions of what kind of male politicians are right now.

I'm sure we'll hear about that. Vance has not walked away from that comment. His childless cat lady's comments as Astead was just alluding to his past criticism of Trump. Also, something that could be rife for something that perhaps Walz will bring up. And then what will Walz -- what will Vance go after Walz his past remarks about his military service? Republicans have been all over things that he said that didn't quite line up with the record comments about his family's fertility treatment.

That's probably something that Walz has never faced in Minnesota, and it's going to come really fiercely from J.D. Vance, because we know that he likes to operate in that zone. I think one thing about Vance prep is that although they're attacking, they're prepping attack lines on trying to expose him as a leftist Walz, his military record. What's unclear is whether or not he's trying to come off as more relatable, particularly when you look at those unfavorables because I think what we've seen in these recent debates is not just policy is important, but also personality is important, trying to get more people to understand who Vance is as a person.

They hold in the Senate and hold the Senate. That's one reason you see them now investing in Texas, which is frankly kind of a longshot. Florida, maybe a little more realistic. Rick Scott has never won by very much there. Abortion is on the ballot. That could be helpful to Democrats. But you know, they've got some new problems too.
