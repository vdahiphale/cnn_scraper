In it, you see Russian fighters holding a Wagner flag and claiming that they're in control of Maine train station outside the town of Soledar, which Putin claims his forces have seized. This station, train station, is not far from Bakhmut which has seen heaviest and bloodiest fighting of recent. We will take you to this region in a moment to see firsthand the loss and devastation.It's an area that is symbolically important for Russia, capturing Soledar and Bakhmut would be the most significant victory Russia had in months. But it's also coming at a cost. A former Wagner commander is now speaking out after abandoning the fight and seeking asylum in Norway, and he is revealing why they were constantly being sent more prisoners. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RUSSIAN SOLDIER (through translator):  Every week, they sent more prisoners to us. We lost a lot of men, casualties were high. We would lose 15, 20 men in just our platoon.

Twenty-five people are still said to be missing as the death toll now stands at 40, including children -- including three children, killed in this apartment complex.This brazen attack is one of the deadliest since the start of the war nearly a year ago, and it is renewing Kyiv's urgent calls for upgraded air defenses. That's because, right now, Ukraine doesn't have capabilities to shoot down the type of missile that brought this destruction. However, there is some help on the way. Tonight, a number of Ukrainian troops are at Fort Sill in Oklahoma to begin training on the sophisticated Patriot missile system. This system can take down tactical ballistic missiles, cruise-type missiles, and aircraft. Much more on that in a second. Ben Wedeman is OUTFRONT live for us, though, in Kramatorsk, Ukraine.

Really appreciate it.OUTFRONT with me now for more on this is retired Army Major General James Spider Marks, and Steve Hall, a former CIA chief of Russia operations, of course. Gentlemen, thanks for being here. General Marks, first to you. We just heard what Ben Wedeman has witnessed and what's reporting from Bakhmut, and also the unconfirmed reports that he has tonight about how it could be getting worse there for the Ukrainians, better for the Russians, if you will. What do you think of that fight here, and how much should Ukraine focus on defending it, as well as Soledar? MAJ. GEN. JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS (RET.), U.S. ARMY:  Well, Soledar, by itself, is nothing. It's a place where Russia has decided to make a stand, and Ukraine has resisted, but obviously, they lost that fight. Russia was terribly bloodied as a result of that. That could be described in military terms as a pyrrhic victory. You got a piece of terrain, but it's not key terrain. It won't necessarily add to what I think Russia's ultimate objectives are. But at the same token, key terrain means important to both sides, it's not important to Ukraine holds Soledar. So, the fact they lost it, it might affect them in terms of morale. If they were able to put to the Russians, then it was a good fight. Bakhmut, on the other hand, is important because it's a crossroad, north south, east west roads are there. It's deeper into Donbas. If you could take Bakhmut, if Ukrainians could take Bakhmut, you are now advancing your operational, and let's be frank, strategic objectives to try to isolate a part of the Donbas, and that allows the Ukrainian forces then to reduce either to the east and north or west. You can't do both at the same time. So, Bakhmut is important. But Soledar certainly less so.",

He said these more advanced military equipment being sent over from Ukraine, other countries, the way he describes, it says it will not be able to change situation on the ground.

Any other offices that maybe use during that time.And who does those searches? Do you want the FBI to do them? Or is the White House going to bring in somebody with the security clearance who can do those searches. I can tell you, on the part of the Justice Department, there's a lot of consternation really about some of the timelines here. If you remember back in November, that's when the first documents were found, there is an investigation begins, an assessment begins, and then you can skip forward to December 20th which is when the second batch of documents was found. We are told that the White House and certainly the Biden team had told the justice department that they were going to do these searches. Why it took five weeks is something of a mystery.

He declined to elaborate further and look, I'm sure Kevin McCarthy was unhappy about the idea that a campaign staffer for Santos was impersonating his own chief of staff. But Kevin McCarthy is known as shown no appetite to punish George Santos.In fact, not only has McCarthy not called on Santos to resign, but he said he is going to give a George Santos committee assignments, even if they are a less committee assignments, he will be given committee assignments. We are expecting that to happen at some point this week. We will be watching overall to see where he winds up.",

This goes for me and all my colleagues who spent time going to events with him, walking in parades with him. He held himself out as a very successful, you know, hedge fund investor. He had worked at Goldman Sachs and Citibank, and, you know, a property owner who understood what our residents needed, the former tax relief. He identified with our residents. And sadly, he lied in order to identify with them. He told stories about having grandparents who fled the Holocaust. It is just false. The things that he said in our district were false. We did not know that there were questions and I for one wish that if there were questions that they had been raced before Election Day.
