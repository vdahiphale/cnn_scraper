Of course, Donald Trump and Joe Biden were basically universally well-known. So, I want to take a look here, no opinion of the candidate. ForDonald Trump it was 9 percent in the ABC News/Ipsos poll that came out over the weekend. But look at this, for Kamala Harris, nearly a fifth of the electorate had no opinion of her. And those opinions, in all honesty, probably weren't that well baked in. They just knew Harris as Biden's VP.
