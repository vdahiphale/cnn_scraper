And he had to be flown to Germany, not to mention all the other assassinations that have happened inside and outside of Russia as recently as yesterday. So you know, it's -- it just doesn't stand up to reason. But what it does, I think, show us, John, is that I think Putin is really feeling it. He's feeling that now is his opportunity to move forward. And it's because he thinks his policies and his planning have worked. It's always been let's wait until the West loses focus. Let's wait until the United States loses track and becomes interested in other things. And it seems to be working for him at least right now.

It's gone from the High Court to the Supreme Court, right up to the British government that signed off on this extradition.What these two days' worth of hearings are discussing is whether or not the government was right to sign off. Did it breach Julian Assange's human rights? He argues that he's in an unfit mental state. He could take his own life if he's sent to the United States. He says he's just a journalist and that the move is politically-motivated. The British government is politically-motivated to sign off on this extradition warrant. Another extraordinary allegation comes from Julian Assange's lawyer is that they have compelling evidence of a CIA plot to kidnap or assassinate the WikiLeaks founder during his time when he was holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy, which is from 2012 to 2019, where he was effectively hiding from the British judicial process. These claims haven't been verified. If the judges think there is something in them, then they could have further hearings. If they don't think there's anything in them then the extradition process does begin. And Julian Assange could be sent to the U.S. in a matter of days, probably weeks. There is a chance he could appeal to the European Court of Human Rights but we're not sure how that process would work at this point. At the moment is just hearing about those human rights and whether or not they were breached by the British government by allowing, Julian Assange to be extradited to the U.S. Max Foster, CNN -- London.
