      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Max foster in London. Just ahead, a terrible tragedy in Ukraine. Interior Minister and kindergarten children were among those killed in a helicopter crash just outside Kyiv. This comes as Ukraine's President prepares to speak remotely at Davos today just hours after losing that key member of his Cabinet.And in a first, Taiwan announces women will be allowed to volunteer for reserve force training as tensions with China heat up. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has ordered the country's security services to investigate the helicopter crash near Kyiv that left 17 people dead. On board at the helicopter were the country's interior minister and five members of his team. All of them were killed. Along with three crew members. Eight people on the ground also died, four of them children. The helicopter went down near a preschool and a residential building. Search and rescue operation continued hours after the crash. The grieving widow of the interior minister's first deputy being comforted at the scene there. CNN's Clarissa Ward reported from the site just a short while ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And the visibility was terrible this morning. One man told us he was outside smoking a cigarette and he could hear the crash, but he couldn't see anything because of the fog.Another woman told us that after she heard the crash, she ran down to the kindergarten and saw children being taken out of the building, some of them still literally on fire. So this is an absolutely horrifying attack. Clearly, having a big impact on so many people around here. There's been a constant stream of people laying flowers, taking a minute to come and to pay their respects. And you can see those rescue workers still going through the rubble, trying to ascertain how this happened. They've been picking out large chunks of debris, parts of the helicopter that I think from what we understand sort of clipped that initial part of the kindergarten there and then crashed just over on the other side.

They're not ruling anything out. They say they're considering versions of events, including a violation of flight rules, technical malfunction of the helicopter itself, deliberate actions, they say, to destroy the helicopter, but this is now in the early stages of the investigation, Max. And meanwhile, the search and rescue as you say continues on the ground in addition to the four children that were killed among the 17 in total. There's another child that's unaccounted for, still there. So they are still searching through that building. And we're learning more about the interior minister himself, a top member of Zelenskyy's Cabinet who was killed. He was a trained lawyer. He took up that position just in 2021, so less than two years ago. This is what the mayor of Kyiv Vitali Klitschko had to say about him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

She wants policymakers to use their influence and to make decisions swiftly.Now, the German Chancellor will be speaking in the next hour. There's been huge amounts of pressure on him to announce that they will allow the re-exporting of German-made helicopters by other European nations like Finland and Poland to Ukraine, but also perhaps to export their own tanks as well. This is something we believe will come with the decision and the cooperation of the U.S. and that's what everyone's been waiting for. Yesterday, Antony Blinken, the Secretary of State, hinted there will be further announcements on this later this week. And we know that Olaf Scholz, the German Chancellor, also spoke to U.S. President Biden last night. So all that has led up to the speech today. We'll be listening out perhaps for a message of unity for the Western alliance, perhaps something more concrete. Following yesterday's speech by the First Lady, we will also be hearing from President Zelenskyy later today. He will be delivering a remote address. And, of course, we expect him to address the tragic loss of life due to that helicopter crash. Max?",

And the U.K. and Poland say they'll grant modern tanks. But the U.S. has resisted this, so far, fearing it might provoke an escalation of the conflict.U.S. Security Correspondent Kylie Atwood joins us from the State Department in Washington. I mean, it is always a fine line, isn't it? Basically, the Russians seeing some form of suppliers and escalation? KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: That's right. And I think what you've seen from the Biden administration over the last year is a really slow ratcheting up of what kind of military assistance that they've given to Ukraine. But we should note that it was significant that they -- at the end of last year, they announced that they were giving the Patriot missile defense system to Ukraine, that still hasn't gotten to the country. And so, U.S. officials are pointing to the fact that that's on its way. They are training Ukrainians to be able to use that. And that was a major development in and of its own. But as we look ahead to this defense ministers meeting later this week in Germany, of course, one thing we will be watching for is specifically Germany and what they do, because the U.S. has given some tanks to Ukraine. They aren't the kind of advanced tanks that the U.K. announced over the weekend that they are going to be giving to Ukraine. But there are, as you said, specifically, leopard tanks that Germany makes. And Poland has said that they have some. They're willing to give them to Ukraine if Germany signs off. And Germany has been so far resistant, but we've seen pressure building on Germany. U.K. officials in recent days had been very clear and saying they would like to see other countries follow what they have done and given these battle tanks to Ukraine. And so, it's highly likely that we could see a major announcement on that front later this week. And then additionally, we do expect that there will be more U.S. security assistance to Ukraine. We aren't at this time expecting that it will include additional capabilities. It looks like it's, you know, continuing more of the same, but that could change. There are constant conversations on this. The Foreign Secretary of the U.K. was just here in Washington, D.C. yesterday. Of course, he was meeting with Secretary of State Tony Blinken. And one of the things that they discussed was how to continue ratcheting up that military support to Ukraine.",

So this expansion of allowing women in this new role in the military is certainly is symbolic, and it's significant.Now, this does not mean that women who are currently in civilian roles, everyday roles in their lives can just join the military. These are women who have had a role before either as an officer or a soldier. Now, while this is significant, women have served in the military in Taiwan before. They do serve. About 15 percent of Taiwan's military is comprised of women, that's according to some data from 2021, from the CIA Factbook to attribute that correctly. But these are women who serve in non-combat roles. As you mentioned, this is going to be a one-year trial period, and it will start -- the training, at least, will start in the spring and then women will be introduced into this reservist type of role. As far as the makeup of the military, it is still a requirement for men to serve. As you mentioned, the time has been expanded, that will still remain in place, but this is going to be a trial. And as you mentioned, there is some symbolism behind this because lawmakers have said that this previous policy of not allowing women to take on these combat roles has been described as discrimination by many lawmakers in Taiwan, Max.",

You can see, I'm standing now right in front of that kindergarten, it really took a direct hit. When that helicopter, according to eyewitnesses, came flying, peered to lose control here, clip the edge of the kindergarten there, starting a fire and then crashed on the other side of it.When our team first arrived on the ground, you could see a number of bodies covered and gold foil that had been recovered. But they're saying now that all nine people who are on that helicopter including, as you mentioned, the Minister of Interior, Denys Monastyrskyi, the Deputy Minister of Interior, the Secretary of State of the Interior Ministry, that they were all killed immediately upon impact. And now we know as well, that the other people who were killed were a number of children and their parents, parents dropping their kids off at school, Max. You can imagine, this is every family's worst nightmare. The question becomes, how did this happen? Because this helicopter was sophisticated. It's a Puma helicopter. Airbus had just updated the avionics on this. And so, we don't know exactly how this happened. We know that there was a lot of fog, bad visibility in the area. Some people said that they were able to hear the crash, but they couldn't see it immediately, because there was such poor visibility. Ukrainian authorities say that they are investigating every possible avenue as to how this happened. There is no sense at this stage that there was foul play involved. But, of course, they don't want to eliminate any possibility either. And so right now, the main effort continues to be as you can see behind me, because you see, it's still smoldering in parts. The effort to go through that wreckage of that kindergarten, make sure that there are no other people who are killed or injured, who've been unaccounted for, and try to get to the bottom of exactly what happened here, Max.

His lawyer tells CNN the possibility of war crimes charges against his client is, quote, a thought that is unavoidable although Medvedev denies contact with civilians. But he's making grim allegations about how Wagner operates.CNN's Nic Robertson reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): Andrei Medvedev is lucky to be alive. The former Wagner eunuch commander says he fled Russia in a daring Arctic escape, dodging bullets and dogs across a frozen river to Norway. ANDREI MEDVEDEV, FORMER WAGNER MERCENARY (through translation): I've been chased. I'm afraid for my life. ROBERTSON (voice-over): Afraid, he says, because he has witnessed the murderous atrocities in Ukraine committed in the name of his ex-boss, Wagner oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, aka Putin chef, and he wants to tell all. Russians killing Russians, some of them former prisoners freed from Russian jails to fight for Wagner. MEDVEDEV (through translation): I know cases where prisoners were demonstratively shot dead for refusing to fight or for betrayal. They were showing fighters here, this is what will happen to you. ROBERTSON (voice-over): He says he joined Wagner in July last year, signed up for four months for near Bakhmut and eastern Ukraine. But when Prigozhin began recruiting former prisoners to swell Wagner's ranks, Medvedev saw a deadly change. Wanted out as his contract ended, but wasn't allowed to quit. MEDVEDEV (through translation): Since the moment the prisoners have come to serve with us, strange things and murders of their own recruited prisoners by the Wagner security service and foolish orders, such as sending us to die as cannon fodder started to happen. ROBERTSON (voice-over): He is the highest-ranking Wagner fighter to flee to the west. His eyewitness account of Prigozhin's murderous practices in Ukraine is revelatory.",

Last month, Prigozhin recorded this callous video purporting to pose in front of his dead fighters in body bags, claiming their contracts were complete and they were on their way back home. But Medvedev says he's seen the truth. Many fighters never making it home because Prigozhin is too cheap to pay out insurance on their death. MEDVEDEV (through translation): The majority of the prisoners were buried and then declared missing. The insurance only pays out money to relatives of the deceased if the body was identified and handed over to the relatives. So they were just declaring everyone as missing. ROBERTSON (on-camera): Right now, Medvedev is at a secure location in Norway, telling investigators every detail he can remember. He says he didn't commit a crime and wants those responsible for the murders brought to justice. Nick Robertson, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
