David Miliband, head of the International Rescue Committee and former British Foreign Secretary, tells me about trying to help civilians under siege. Then, how much influence does President Biden really have, even over the closest allies? I ask former U.S. Ambassador to Israel, Daniel Kurtzer. Plus, decisive wins for Democrats, despite those Biden polls. New York Times reporter, Astead Herndon, speaks with Hari Sreenivasan about last night's election results. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. As Israel says its troops have entered Gaza City, the humanitarian crisis is stark. Bakeries in North Gaza are closed, according to the U.N. Hospitals are nearly out of fuel, says the Palestine Red Crescent. Over 4,300 children have been killed, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in Ramallah. So, Gaza is at a breaking point. The U.N. insists more aid be delivered into the besieged enclave, including fuel, which is currently banned by Israel. The secretary-general today called for an unconditional release of all the hostages held by Hamas, but also pleaded for Palestinian civilians to be seen as separate from Hamas. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONIO GUTERRES, UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY-GENERAL:  This in nothing should reduce our total rejection for the horrible things that Hamas did the 7th of October. But we need to distinguish. Hamas is one thing, the Palestinian people is another. If we don't make that distinction, I think it's humanity itself that loses meaning. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

While the IDF gave remaining Gaza City residents five-hours to evacuate south today. But as Salma Abdelaziz reports, the destruction caused by Israeli bombing means travel is slow and dangerous. SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover):  Taking only what they can carry, families are fleeing Gaza City. They wave white flags made of anything they can find. And as the sounds of war echo around them, they signal yet again that they are innocents. Now, we're supposed to be in the safe area, but you can hear the bombs behind us, he says. All of our houses are gone. Nothing is left. The Israeli military has been calling for weeks on all those living in the northern part of the Strip to move southwards, most recently opening what it called safe corridors for limited windows of time, pushing thousands here to Salahuddin Street, where evacuees describe a harrowing journey. We saw along the road destruction, dead bodies everywhere, and the Israeli tanks would demand to search the youth, she says. We saw one young man stripped naked. We witnessed unbearable scenes. The only way to reach the route is by foot or by cart for those who can find room. There was heavy shelling on our neighborhood and we were forced to flee. We have to use these donkey carts because there's no fuel, he says. They cut everything off to force us out of our homes. Israeli troops are now in the heart of Gaza City. As Israel's defense minister apparently declared the entire city, the whole of the enclave's largest population center, a legitimate target.",

I've come on with a singular purposetoday, and that is to say that it is desperately beyond time for the world community to get serious about what a humanitarian halt in the fighting is, what a humanitarian ceasefire, what the Americans call a humanitarian pause, what that can mean in practice. Because our view based on our team on the ground in Egypt who are trying to get aid in, but also our experience around the world, is that a humanitarian halt, a humanitarian ceasefire, needs to be organized, it needs to be coordinated, it needs to be led, it needs to be monitored, it needs to have sufficient duration, if it's really to relieve the humanitarian suffering and save lives. And what I would say to you is that it's beyond urgent to get this humanitarian ceasefire so that our teams can do the work and the partners that we have on the ground inside Gaza can do their work. Because many, many are dead already, but many, many more are going to lose their lives soon. And so, this is a matter of the utmost urgency. And I appeal through your - - to your viewers through this program that we get into the details about what a humanitarian ceasefire could do over a period of at least five-days, which is the estimate that we base our expertise on, that our expertise has led us to believe is necessary if we're to fulfill the promise of saving civilian lives.",

Daniel Kurtzer, welcome to the program, Ambassador. Can I first ask you to respond to what we were talking about in terms of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and IRC -- and increasingly loud voices, including from the United States, calling for some kind of relief. IRC saying that it needs to be five days with careful deployment of resources and the ability to actually get sustainable -- lifesaving resources in. Others saying, and certainly Israel, no, no, no, because it'll allow Hamas to regroup. Can you figure out how to thread that needle? DANIEL KURTZER, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO ISRAEL AND FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO EGYPT:  Well, I think David Miliband put his finger on both sides of this issue. Number one, it will require more than a few hours to put into place the kind of -- a volume of humanitarian assistance, whether it's food and fuel and water and medical care, that's absolutely necessary. But he also noted correctly that before you can put a humanitarian pause or humanitarian ceasefire into effect, there are a number of issues that need to be addressed. Who are the parties to it? Is it Israel and Hamas? Who speaks for Hamas? What about Palestine Islamic jihad? Who monitors what happens during this period? And what happens if one side or the other violates it? So, it's not simple to simply say, well, let's have a humanitarian pause, when either side could violate it in a way which makes the resumption of hostilities that much more challenging. So, I think the efforts now by Secretary Blinken, CIA Director Burns, who's out in the region, the Qataris and others, are working towards resolving these very important issues so as to get to the more important question of bringing in the humanitarian requirements.",

But the United States, first of all, does believe that it's important to degrade Hamas' capabilities. It's important to create an atmosphere after this war ends that does not allow Hamas to reestablish itself and govern in Gaza. But the president, I think, I'm confident, has been telling the prime minister that, you need to moderate on change the way you are doing what you're doing in Gaza. The bombing may have been aimed at trying to find the tunnels and the underground headquarters, but the degree of civilian casualties suggests that there have to be other ways of finding Hamas.

His cabinet ofextremist politicians is proving itself, even during this fighting to be beyond the pale. And so, these statements about reoccupying Gaza or creating what could be a long-term security presence, I think, have to be taken only at face value. Secretary Blinken is 100 percent correct that any occupation or reoccupation or long-term presence of Israel is a guarantee of a long-term conflict with untold consequences. The two orders of business that need to be thought about now for the day after mean, number one, that Israel has to be out. Number two, that a very significant effort at reconstruction of Palestinian life, of buildings, of occupations, of resources within Gaza need to be undertaken, but there needs to be also a horizon for a political outcome that assures that we are going to move towards a settlement of the underlying dispute and not have a situation where we return to the status quo ante only to have another war or more terrorism a few years from now. So, Secretary Blinken is exactly right. I hope Israeli leaders are listening to this. I'm not sure that Prime Minister Netanyahu is listening to it, but his discredited leadership will probably end shortly after this war as a result of a commission of inquiry, and maybe we can find an Israeli leadership that understands the need, first of all, to help the Palestinians reconstruct their lives in Gaza, but also to look forward with the Palestinians towards a different future.",

So, again, I don't know why we believed that it was a good idea to be pushing for something that was going to end up the way it ended up. I think that what this calls for is a much deeper analysis of the situation on the ground. And not only analysis, but coming to grips with realities. You know, this is a government in Israel right now with which we cannot work on the peace process. And so, one of the key requirements after this war ends is to have the Israeli people make a decision about where they want to go, and it's going to be hard to work with the Palestinian government on a peace process since they barely managed to govern the West Bank, and we're expecting them to try to govern Gaza. So, there's a lot of work to be done. And you know, whether it's unfortunate or not, the United States is still the only real outside party that with determination can try to make some of these things work.",

What were the races that you were watching as the polls closed all over the country last night? ASTEAD HERNDON, NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER, THE NEW YORK TIMES AND HOST, \"THE RUN-UP,\" THE NEW YORK TIMES:  Yes. I mean, the principal races was, you know, the Kentucky governor's race. We had the kind of state legislature and state Senate that were both up in Virginia. Those were called kind of at the end of the night for Democrats. We're watching Mississippi, but that ended up not going to a runoff and holding with the Republicans. But I think on the top line, you really just have been watching all of the kind of races that show the continued salience of abortion rights, both from Kentucky to Ohio, to -- you know, and I think that continues to trim for Democrats, we've seen basically since the Dobbs decision has fallen. And so, that's why I was looking at the night going into. And I think if you look at Virginia, Kentucky and Ohio, there's a clear message that that is still top of mind for voters across the country.",

Democrats controlled one house, but we're looking to seek both. And Youngkin had basically said, if you give me two houses of a Republican legislature, I will give you a conservative agenda that includes kind of finding a moderate or compromised position on abortion that will limit it to somewhat -- to something like 15 weeks. that was what he was kind of going around the state saying and specifically pitching to national media as maybe an entry point for him to get into the Republican presidential race, but that didn't come to fruition. You saw Democrats really do well, and they took control of both houses of the state legislature, functionally, you know, kind of grinding Youngkin's proposed agenda to a halt. And I think that that is seen as a real blow to his kind of, like, parents rights, abortion protections that he was trying to put into place. And I would say another kind of result that, you know, stuck out in Virginia is that Loudoun County School Board also went to liberals. That was a place where there had been so many fights about kind of culture wars and LGBTQ rights in schools and what folks were teaching the so-called woke messages that were coming from education. And this has not really motivated Republicans to the degree that they had hoped once again. And so, I think, you know, for all the national narrative about Joe Biden's problems, we actually saw a Democratic Party, particularly in Virginia, that was showing real signs of hell.",

Now, remember the Beshear is a unique kind of Kentucky figure, has a long- standing family name and has a history of being a kind of approachable Democrat in a red state, but that should not, you know, overshadow what he really did in this race. He embraced the idea of protecting abortion rights. He cast his opponent, Daniel Cameron, as kind of an extremist on this issue. And you also saw him really -- you know, as a state that has experienced the recent mass shooting, you know, he was the face of the kind of consolation and, you know, for citizens, and that seems to have really done him. We saw a lot of counties that voted for Donald Trump as recently as 2020 vote for Andy Beshear last night. And so, that really says that there was some crossover appeal for this individual candidate, but I do think it's going to be somewhat of a model if we look about how Democrats can run broadly come 2024, is if you try to make it not about the kind of national race, but localize specifically the issues of abortion and protecting democracy, that's going to be the playbook. I was talking to a state party chair a couple of weeks ago, and he told me that, you know, no matter who's at the top of the ticket, they think they have to communicate the stakes of those issues to their voters, because what we have seen since 2020 is that Democrats will come out when that is communicated. That's true in the midterms, that's true in these off-year elections, and they're hoping that's going to be true next year.",

I mean, theyhave been led by an evangelical wing of the party that is clearly out of touch with the majority of Americans. And so, if the lesson for conservatives was that, you know, the end -- the Dobbs decision was going to bring this back to the states was going to be a kind of democratic repositioning of this issue, they need to take the lessons of democracy and make clear that, you know, the majority of Americans, if they are put in front of them, are going to act to protect abortion rights, what does that do for their message next year is the principal question I think Republicans have to ask themselves. The other kind of question here is just like the general Trump triangulation. They have not seen a kind of -- his kind of energy translate to other candidates. And so, if there is an enthusiasm problem, if there is a split among the Republican base, then that means that, you know, they're not -- they're less able to take advantage of any democratic shortcomings. And so, you know, when I was at the Republican National Convention earlier this year, the first and foremost thing they said they need heading into 2024 is unity around the party. Now, in the primary, there has been basically a deference to Donald Trump. But I don't think that from top to bottom, you have a united party around that figure. And because you still have so many people who are saying that he has too much baggage and others. And so, if you're Republicans, there's not only a message problem when it comes to abortion, there is a unity problem when it comes to whether the base of this party wants and what it's delivering in terms of candidates, because it is not delivering wins. These are winnable races for Republicans last night and in 2022 and they are losing them, and that's a clear message from voters across the country.",

You know, when I thinkabout post midterms, there was a lot of assumed political fallout that folks thought would happen from the indictments. Of course, voters would find him unqualified for the office if that were to happen. Of course, folks would have to kind of recognize the legal system and say that that makes him -- you know, disqualifies him for presidency, and that hasn't really happened. On the Republican side, you've seen people really consolidate around him under the vision of him being persecuted. The latest CNN polling has him at 61 percent nationally among the -- in the Republican primary. That means that this whole year, you know, these other candidates haven't really made a dent in his support and he has consolidated and grown that over the summer. So, I think that's one piece of it. But I do think there is an impact to the indictments when we think broadly and look ahead to a general election. This is a country that does not want a rematch of 2020, that thinks that Joe Biden is simply too old, and thinks that Donald Trump has simply too much baggage. And so, that is the big impact of them being -- us being big -- being brought back to this point. It complicates the question of just who's going to win, because I think we are going to see an electorate that is a near open revolt about its options come next year. So, may that -- will that mean there's more interest in a third-party candidate? Will that mean more people stay home? Will that mean people skip the top line and vote down ballot? Will that mean young people stay out? I mean, I don't know kind of where that kind of -- where that impact falls, but I do think it completely upends the type of calculations we're seeing. In a typical year, I think we would take these off-year elections as a sign for the next year. But with those two candidates at the top of the ballot, I think it scrambles everything.",

When we think about Republicans, the sheer fact isthat the -- you know, the changes in the increasing global conflict does not really up ended that race at all. There's pretty universal agreement when you get to Republicans about the need to kind of unconditionally support Israel. You got kind of Donald Trump saying, you know, praising Hezbollah smarts and kind of saying Trump -- ridiculous, like rhetorical kind of things. He said he's been previously accused of antisemitism, that hasn't really hurt him in this specific issue. Republicans are going to be in universal agreement tonight about the need to support Israel and blaming the conflict on Joe Biden's supposed weak leadership. Where there is not agreement for them is on the question of increased aid to Ukraine, which much more of that interventionist to noninterventionist split comes up when you talk about supporting them on that front. Among Democrats, though, it's unquestionably true that the conflict in Israel and Gaza has changed kind of some folk's perception of Joe Biden. I've been seeing reporting coming out of Michigan about the large Arab community there. I've seen reporting about American Jewish communities kind of changing based about how they feel the Democratic Party is being deferential to pro-Palestinian protesters. And then, I think we should also say the biggest group where we have seen this take root is young folks who have been increasingly calling -- leading the calls for a ceasefire, pressuring the Democratic Party to embrace that type of language. And we have seen only some do that. And really the top of the party, Joe Biden, Chuck Schumer, others really stayed clear from that. And I think that's going to be the increasing question for this is, does the United States support for Israel put it further and further away from where young people are on this issue? And does that drive an increasing distance between the president who needed those people to come out in 2020?",
