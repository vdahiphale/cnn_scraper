The former president just arrived back at Trump Tower. Although it's not clear whether he plans to attend when court resumes tomorrow morning. This is a case that could have been in the hands of a jury instead a single judge who already found Trump liable for fraud will now decide how much he must pay up and it could be a quarter of a billion dollars. Plus. Pushed out as a Texas state trooper over his health problems, developed while serving his country in Iraq. Health problems that he developed because of burn pits. This is a case we have followed here on The Lead for years. Today we're going to bring you some good news about a tragic case. And leading this hour, a brand-new warning about Donald Trump's true character behind the scenes, this time from his longest serving White House Chief of Staff, John Kelly. On the record only here on The Lead, confirming insults about veterans and wounded and killed service members that the former president made behind closed doors. When Trump thought no one was watching. When Trump thought no one cared. John Kelly setting the record straight about Trump's most stinging words about war heroes and military service members. Our coverage starts with this exclusive reporting with former Chief of Staff John Kelly offering his strongest rebuke yet of Donald Trump. Referring to Trump's recent comments about retired Joint Chief Chairman, General Mark Milley, Kelly called Trump, quote, \"a person who cavalierly suggests that a selfless warrior who has served his country for 40 years in peacetime and war should lose his life for treason in expectation that someone will take action,\" unquote. Kelly also called his former boss, quote, \"a person who admires autocrats and murderous dictators,\" unquote, and there's more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Trump at Arlington Cemetery in 2017, standing among the graves of American soldiers who died in Afghanistan and Iraq and saying, I don't get it, what was in it for them.

The only thing he cares about is Donald Trump. Everything else is instrumental. The idea that he has a philosophy that we have really much of an idea at all of what he will do in a second term, freed from any electoral guardrails, remember he can't run for a third term, so the political constraints that he faced in his first term will be largely non- existent, simply enhance the danger of what may happen in a second term.

Kelly calling Trump a person, quote, \"who thinks those who defend their country in uniform or are shot down or seriously wounded in combat or spend years being tortured as POWs are all suckers because,\" quote, \"there's nothing in it for them, who did not want to be seen in the presence of military amputees because, quote, \"it doesn't look good for me, who demonstrated open contempt for all Gold Star families and rants that our most precious heroes who gave their lives in America's defense are losers and wouldn't visit their graves in France.\" Joining me now is retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton. So, Colonel, a lot of these stories were reported in the Atlantic magazine by Jeffrey Goldberg and in the book \"The Divider\" by Susan Glasser and Peter Baker, but they were on background.

And they happen to, in that sense, get unlucky by being wounded. They could have, you know, there could have been other things that have happened, but those who have been wounded, those who have died, those who have, even those hidden injuries like post-traumatic stress and other injuries like TBI.

Well, let me explain to you why. Essentially, the person who was on the stand and who will continue on the stand tomorrow is Donald Bender. That is the former accountant for Trump and Trump.org.And the state's attorneys spent several hours questioning Bender on financial documents that relate to alleged crimes from 2011. Now, that is outside the Statute of Limitations. The court has already decided the crimes alleged have to be from 2014 and on. And so the fact that this was continued on for three hours, the judge said, was he's hoping the state's attorneys are going to connect the dots between what they're alleging prior to 2014 to what happened and is relevant to this particular trial. And he said in that, I trust that you can relate the 2011 documents to something that happened later, or else this has been a waste of time, so Trump very happy to hear that from the judge, of course, particularly because he fought in appeals court and won when the Statute of Limitations would be established. So that is why he was a bit more jovial in his last comments, Jake. But he did take many times before that to disparage the judge in those comments in the hallway.

McCarthy denies that, although President Biden did say there was some sort of deal when it comes to Ukraine, I'm not really sure what the President's talking about.But there is the bigger issue here is that there is no money for Ukraine in the spending bill that passed Saturday. I believe that you support further aid for Ukraine. What's going to happen? What should Congress do?",

Last Friday, this is good news, I promise, last Friday, a Texas jury awarded nearly $2.5 million, $2.5 million, to a former Texas state trooper who had essentially been forced out of his job because of health problems he had developed after being exposed to burn pits in Iraq where he was serving his country. A little background, burn pits were used by the U.S. Military in Iraq and Afghanistan to destroy trash and munitions and hazardous chemicals and even human and medical waste.More than 3 million veterans may have been exposed to the toxic fumes from the fires, according to the VA. My next guests are among those affected, Le Roy Torres. He's a former Texas state trooper and army reservist. He returned from his year-long deployment to Iraq with these health issues and that interfered with his daily work as a Texas state trooper rather than accommodating him because of his service, the Texas Department of Public Safety abruptly fired him and he sued. And his case went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court before he was even able to sue and take them to trial. Torres and his wife, Rosie, also co-founded Burn Pits 360. That's an organization we've covered a lot dedicated to helping burn pit victims. And Le Roy and Rosie join us now. You know them. You've seen them on the show before. First of all, congratulations, Rosie and Le Roy. I would say to you during the commercial break, I can't believe the system worked. We've been following this all for years. Burn Pits 360, you got all that worked out and I mean, there's still more to do, but people are getting money and help and the Supreme Court ruled the right way and you got your $2.5 million. And what's your reaction? Le Roy, you start.",

After almost seven years, that, you know, justice finally prevailed from, you know, just starting our battle, county courting, going up to the legal system and to the U.S. Supreme Court and then finally getting that opportunity to bring our battle back to Texas.

Let me make it clear, this is a wonderful day and a wonderful decision, but those heartless bastards that made this long, long struggle necessary should never sleep soundly again for the rest of their lives, 100 percent, you know, you're not saying that, but I'm saying that. Le Roy stars and stripes, quote, you're saying, as citizen soldiers, we deserve to keep our professions when we return from serving our nation, we should not have to bear the burden alone due to illnesses or injuries caused by an instrumentality of war, unquote. Elaborate on that for us if you would.L. TORRES: You know, Jake, it's like we, you know, we fulfill that oath when we go overseas and just the beginning of serving our country, but, you know, when we get back that we expect that same loyalty for us if we come back injured or over an illness. And we have that expectation that we come back as citizen soldiers, as reservists and to come back to Texas and that it was questionable because of my permanent lung injury that cannot be accommodated. And that was devastating because this was my childhood dream. And to know that we had to take our battle all the way to the highest court in the land, this just -- this should not have happened, you know, I was sitting there last week reflecting, you know, in the courtroom like, I shouldn't even have to be here. All I did was I served my nation. And the argument was that the argument wasn't it was military discrimination, but it was the accommodation of the USRA that was violated.",
