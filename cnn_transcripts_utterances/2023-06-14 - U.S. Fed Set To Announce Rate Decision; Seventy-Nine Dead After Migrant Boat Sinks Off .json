Now, as you mentioned, this was widely expected, but this is a big deal nonetheless. This snaps a streak of ten consecutive meetings where they raise interest rates. This has been the most aggressive fight against inflation in the United States in more than 40 years. Now, looking at the statement that just came out, the Fed officials, they did keep in language, saying that inflation remains, quote, \"elevated\". They say the job gains have been robust in recent months, and that the unemployment rate has remained low. And they also talk about the banking system, which of course is a big deal because we've seen a series of bank failures in the United States. And they reiterate that the banking system remains sound and resilient, but they do say that tighter lending conditions are going to impact the economy, going to impact families and households. Reading a little bit further into the statement, they do talk about sort of what is next for interest rates. And it looks like, for the most part, they kept in some of the language that had been there previously. Saying that as they assessed what steps are needed next for monetary policy, they're going to continue to look at the income information on the economic outlook. And I also think it's notable that this decision appears to me to be unanimous. So all the Fed officials --",

But I do think it's important to try totake a step back and think about why the Fed is shifting its strategy a bit here, right? I think that the fact that they're pausing is an acknowledgment that in their view, their strategy is working that inflation has cooled off. We learned this week that consumer prices went up in May at the slowest annual rate in more than 2 years. And so, maybe the economy doesn't need all of this inflation-fighting-medicine to get pumped into it, like it so obviously did last year, and arguably during much of 2021 as well. Also, I think this is an acknowledgment from the Fed that they've already done a lot here. Ten straight meetings, yes. But during that span, they raised interest rates by 5 full percentage points. And so, that has done some sort of damage to the economy, taking a minute to think about how much damage, certainly makes some sense. Now, we look at the market reaction here, again this was widely expected, sometimes we see a kind of a cell on the news reaction from the market. Stocks had been rallying in the days leading up to this decision. But as you can see, the Dow is down almost 30 points, about 1 percent, hitting session lows now.

I think that he's also got to address how much higher he thinks rates are going to have to go. Is it one more quarter of a basis -- quarter of an interest rate hike or does he think that there might be more needed? Also what does he make of the strength of the jobs market, right? It's been absolutely incredible how many jobs have been added in the middle of this war on inflation that everyone -- that many economists thought it was going to cause a recession. The jobs market is not cooperating. Is he concerned that maybe the jobs market is too hot? And also, does he think that the banking crisis is largely over? I mean, thankfully, we haven't seen any more bank failures after the three large banks failed earlier this Spring? So does he think that some of that damage is done? If so, then that could actually suggest that Fed officials think they might have to do more work here to slow down the economy, to fight inflation. In just one last point here, Isa, is even though inflation has cooled off, it's still not anywhere near back that -- back to that 2 percent target that the Fed is aiming for. And I think that Powell is probably going to have to address the fact that more work is going to be needed here.",

More than 100 have been rescued, and it is feared the number of people who perished may go much higher. There may have been as many as 750 migrants on the fishing boat. The boat set off from Libya and Greek authorities say it was headed for Italy. Here is CNN's Barbie Nadeau from Rome with the very latest for you. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BARBIE NADEAU, CNN CONTRIBUTOR (voice-over): Exhausted migrants who survived a shipwreck rest at a rescue center in Greece. The Greek coast guard responded to the latest Mediterranean tragedy on Wednesday. They say no one on board was wearing a lifejacket. Scores of people drowned. The death toll continues to rise. Hundreds of migrants crammed onto a boat in Libya, hoping to reach Italy or get rescued on the way. But that didn't happen. Their boat sank in the central Mediterranean, the most dangerous maritime crossing in the world. YANNIS KARVELIS, REGIONAL HEALTH DIRECTOR (through translator): It is indeed a tragic situation. A very difficult situation with a very large number of shipwrecked people, a number that I think we have not faced in the past to such an extent and volume.",

In February, a migrant boat carrying more than a 100 peoplebroke off the rocks of Calabria in southern Italy. Ninety four bodies were recovered. Despite the dangers, the number of undocumented people seeking a better life in Europe has soared in 2023. The Italian government says more than 55,000 people have arrived by boat since January. They're fleeing conflict at home, the climate crisis and sweeping economic inequality. But European leaders can't seem to agree on how to solve the crisis, which has grown increasingly deadly. Ongoing negotiations with Tunisia and Libya where most of the boats come from have stalled. So the boats keep coming, and the death toll keeps rising. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

These boats come from Libya, trying to get to Italy, and they either make it all the way across or they're rescued by NGO ships or by often the Italian coast guard. And so, you know, once they're flagged by these NGOs, these authorities have been told, we know, but they don't often communicate certainly to journalists about whether or not they sent anyone to send a rescue. Now, we don't know how it ended up in Greek waters at the port it left in Libya, obviously, plays a role into that. But we don't know if it had a motor problem, if there were strong winds, strong seas. The Mediterranean is a rough body of water, and it's not safe by any means. And so sending out, obviously, people know that they're risking their lives. And time and time again, you know, this central Mediterranean passageway is the deadliest migrant passageway in the world that people use -- more than 20,000 people they know have died trying to make this crossing since 2014.

Now, it has a very heavy series of trench lines, reportedly, the biggest and longest trench line built since the second World War, visible from satellite imagery, of course. Very serious defenses in depth. And that is because from the Ukrainian perspective, if they can punch through this frontline and head towards Crimea, they can also divide Russian forces. They can trap Russian forces in Kherson, on the other side of a frontline. And then they can perhaps then exploit some of the gains they've had around Bakhmut, where they're also pushing not in a massive way, but in a significant way. They have got a lot of momentum now building south of the city there. They've taken some estimates around 7 miles of territory there and assailant, that is pushing into territory they lost to the Russians. So, if you combine all that, you're starting to see potential, just potential, for a Ukrainian initiative to really get going, and start to get the Russians on the run, because ultimately, Isa, the Ukrainians know that they need the Russian army to collapse from within. Because they can't really beat it in terms of manpower. They do have much better equipment now. We're seeing that it being used and lost inevitably on that frontline that Fred was on just the other day. But -- and that will continue very significantly too, that they've had this uptick in new equipment being promised by the United States. Replacement Bradleys, more ammunition, more HIMARS and long-range rocket systems, all intended to back-fill the counteroffensive as it builds with momentum. Isa.",

But it is the case that the Ukrainians have built into their plans and understanding, and a regretful understanding that they are going to take a very significant casualties. They are going to spend and have a lot of this material that they've been supplied by the United States and other NATO partners, destroyed. And prior to this counteroffensive, in meetings all over Europe, you recall not long ago, President Zelenskyy went on a whistle-stop tour around Europe to drum up support, not just for his desire for F-16 fighter bombers, but also to make sure that logistics train won't break once his counteroffensive gets underway. Now, it's in the early stages, it is needing re-supply. And it's very important not just in a physical sense that the Americans have stepped up, but that they're doing so vocally and immediately.

That hinted more interests -- increases pardon me, could be coming. We are keeping an eye on the Dow Jones. You can see there. It was kind of priced in as we heard from our Matt Egan in the last 25 minutes or so. But the Dow Jones is down just over 1 percent. Nasdaq and the S&amp;P also down. We heard from the statement from the Fed saying that holding the target range steady at this meeting allows the committee to assess additional information and its implications for monetary policy. Jerome Powell is walking in. Let's have a listening. JEROME POWELL, U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIR: Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve. Without price stability, the economy doesn't work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy. We have raised our policy interest rate by 5 percentage points and have continued to reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace. We have covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt. In light of how far we have come in tightening policy, the uncertain lags with which monetary policy affects the economy, and potential headwinds from credit tightening, today we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings. Looking ahead, nearly all Committee participants view it as likely that some further rate increases will be appropriate this year to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time. And I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. The U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, and recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a modest pace. Although growth in consumer spending has picked up this year, activity in the housing sector remains weak, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment. Committee participants generally expect subdued growth to continue. In our Summary of Economic Projections, the median projection has real GDP growth at 1.0 percent this year and 1.1 percent next year, well below the median estimate of the longer-run normal growth rate. The labor market remains very tight. Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged a robust 283 thousand jobs per month. The unemployment rate moved up but remained low in May, at 3.7 percent. There are some signs that supply and demand in the labor market are coming into better balance. The labor force participation rate has moved up in recent months, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years. Nominal wage growth has shown signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year. While the jobs-to-workers gap has declined, labor demand still substantially exceeds the supply of available workers. FOMC participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance over time, easing upward pressures on inflation. The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises to 4.1 percent at the end of this year and 4.5 percent at the end of next year. Inflation remains well above our longer-run 2 percent goal. Over the 12 months ending in April, total PCE prices rose 4.4 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 4.7 percent. In May, the 12-month change in the Consumer Price Index came in at 4.0 percent, and the change in the core CPI was 5.3 percent.",

But what is especially usual about this crime is not only the randomness of it, or at least seeming randomness of it, but also the geography of this and the sheer physical space that was traveled. So if we bring up the map here, you had the two stabbings on Oxton Road. That was the first one, then you have the 65-year-old man Ian Coates, who was found stabbed at Magdala Road, just more than a mile away. Then you had the van stolen at Magdala Road from Ian Coates driven down to Milton Street, which is in the city center, where he tried to run down three people. One person still in critical condition in the hospital, and then a fourth location where this guy was actually arrested. And we just learned today as well that this suspect also tried to get into an assisted living, or supported living facility as well, but didn't manage to get in, thankfully.",

You can see on your map. And Ukraine claims to be gaining ground there. The offensive comes as part of Kherson are still coping with the floodwaters, of course, from the collapse, Nova Kakhovka Dam. On Monday, a team from the International Criminal Court, the ICC, visited the flooded area to gather information about the breach. That afternoon, I spoke to the ICC's first Chief Prosecutor, Luis Moreno Ocampo during his tenure. He investigated investigations in dozens of countries. And in his new book, War and Justice in the 21st Century, he's giving new insight into how those inquiries work. When I spoke to him, I started by asking him, what evidence the ICC teams would be looking for in Kherson? (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

So now, of course, the court could keep adding new charges, but the issue is how the states will react. Because another -- an international -- our warrant is not like a national it's not a police going to arrest a person. It's a constraint for President Putin. It's like when a group of criminals have a hostage in a bank. So you don't go and kill them. You try to negotiate with them. And in this case, President Putin has an entire country as hostage. And that's why it's very important how states, other states in Europe, in Africa, in Asia, in the U.S., how they react to this.

Second, it's important to understand this is a very serious crime. Third point, what's happened now is President Putin is limited. He -- there is a big debate now, he can go to South Africa, to the meeting there, and South Africa is debating the issue. So that's the impact. It's a constraint on President Putin and it's a constraint to the States, U.K. and U.S. rejected to him in a conversation in a meeting at the U.N. with this lady who was indicted with him. So there are warrant issued by the International Criminal Court limit the activity of Russia and limit the discretion of the States. That's why it's so important. International is more primitive.
