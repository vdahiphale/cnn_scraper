I'm Rosemary Church live from Atlanta with our continuing coverage of the Israel- Hamas War. And we begin in Gaza as the war between Israel and Hamas is about to enter its second month. The Israeli military says it's carrying out a significant strike right now on the territory.(VIDEO PLAYING) An IDF spokesperson says the strike was quote, \"very extensive\" and targeted Hamas infrastructure both above and below ground. The IDF also says its soldiers have now reached Gaza's coast in an effort to cut off the northern part of the enclave. This comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has once again rejected calls for a ceasefire saying all hostages must first be released. Meantime, an intense diplomatic push is underway to prevent a wider conflict in the region. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken landed in Turkey Sunday night. And the director of CIA is also traveling to several countries in the Middle East to meet with, quote, \"multiple intelligence counterparts and country leaders.\" The latest communications outage in Gaza cut off contact between several humanitarian aid groups and their teams on Sunday. The World Health Organization said it was very concerned about the blackout, along with the continued airstrikes from Israel. The U.N.'s main relief agency in Gaza, as well as the Palestinian Red Crescent, both said they lost contact with teams inside the enclave. It is the third communications outage reported in Gaza since the conflict began last month. And for more, we want to go to journalist Elliott Gotkine who joins us live from London. Good morning to you, Elliott. So, these aid organizations are worried, obviously, for their workers after losing contact with them due to the massive Israeli bombardments. What more are you learning about that and of course, these significant strikes currently underway on Gaza?",

Appreciate it.Well, all of this comes as dozens of people were killed in a blast at the Al-Maghazi refugee camp in Gaza. That's according to an official at a nearby hospital. He says it was the result of an Israeli airstrike. The IDF says it's looking into the circumstances around the explosion. Nada Bashir is following this developing story. A warning though, her report includes graphic images. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  At this hospital in central Gaza, another day of seemingly unending horror. Bodies, some tiny, arriving in their dozens. No one is spared the devastation of this war. Journalist Muhammed Alaloul, seen here at Gaza's Al-Aqsa hospital, not to report on this latest attack, but to identify his children amongst the dead. MUHAMMED ALALOUL, JOURNALIST (through translation):  I saw my son, Kanan (ph), my daughter, Rahaf (ph), and my sons Ahmed (ph) and Qais (ph). I saw my three siblings killed. I saw friends who were at my house, all killed. BASHIR (voice-over):  Hospital officials tell CNN this latest disaster was caused by yet another Israeli airstrike. Among the numerous bodies of countless women and children. UNKNOWN (through translation):  Fifty-two killed and more than 70 injured. Most of those killed and injured are children, women and elderly and still a large number buried under the rubble. BASHIR (voice-over):  In the now shattered Al-Maghazi refugee camp, once home to tens of thousands of Palestinians, residents searched desperately for any sign of survivors, many digging frantically with their bare hands. This residential community is located in one of the zones deemed safe to evacuate to by the Israeli military. But Israel's airstrikes have proven unrelenting. UNKNOWN (through translation):  All of a sudden, I saw the entire house upside down. I can't see. I don't even know where I am. BASHIR (voice-over):  Homes which are crowded on Saturday with entire families have now been reduced to blackened rubble. This crater, a reminder of the force with which Israel continues to bombard the besieged Gaza Strip. UNKNOWN (through translation):  I saw all my sisters screaming, then I saw my father. When I found myself alive, I looked to see who was still alive. We turned on the torch and my siblings were alive, but I did not find my father. I finally found him next to me. I moved him. I moved his hands. I moved his face. He did not respond. BASHIR (voice-over):  Gaza's hospitals are overwhelmed. The shortages mean it is virtually impossible to adequately treat those wounded. But hospitals like Al-Aqsa are also struggling to keep up with the mounting death toll. The bodies of those killed lay outside, awaiting identification. A gut-wrenching image, now an all too familiar reality here in Gaza. Nada Bashir, CNN in Jerusalem. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

We understand that there are security concerns related to that, but we have also demonstrated that we can deliver and we can use that fuel safely without being diverted to armed groups because that's the real concern. But this is essential for us to maintain not only our operations, but also bakery, desalination plants, hospitals running. I was reading yesterday night there are 43 infants in incubators.

The problem is unless a corridor is agreed by both parties, the risks for civilians are still there.And, in fact, what we saw is resumption of fighting in and around the area that was supposed to be that corridor and that has put at risk civilians.

That would really cut against the Trump brand.Now, having said that, the other cases are criminal cases. So, we're not talking about having to pay money or being barred from doing business in New York. What we're talking about is potentially being incarcerated.

We saw him start in Tel Aviv on Friday for discussions with Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Netanyahu. He pushed him on the knee to protect civilians to allow assistance to come in and to try to institute these so called humanitarian pauses. Netanyahu just hours after that meeting came out publicly and rejected the idea of any sort of pause or ceasefire in this conflict. And as you mentioned, on Saturday, he met with his counterparts here in the Arab World to talk about, again how to get assistance into Gaza. This is something that has been a key focus of leaders in the region, they have strongly condemned the Israeli offensive, and the humanitarian toll it is causing. They have called for an immediate ceasefire. Yesterday, we saw Blinken go to Ramallah to meet with the Head of the Palestinian Authority Mahmoud Abbas and also talk about how to stop this from spreading? How to respond to the situation on the ground in Gaza? So today, this is expected to be a key theme of his conversations with the Turkish Foreign Minister here. He is not expected to meet with President Erdogan. But he will be pushing him for those commitments to try to advance this caused and of course, stop this from spreading to the wider region.

In fact, I was looking at a story today from an \"NBC Wall Street Journal\" Poll in the fall of 2011, in which the conclusion was that President Obama was no longer the favorite for reelection. That is, you know, there's a lot of history to that. But there are other findings in these polls that I think are more sticky, more durable, more troubling for President Biden.

And more Democrats were able to focus voters' attention, especially in the key swing states, on the specific choice between Democrats and Republicans on issues like abortion and rights and democracy.
