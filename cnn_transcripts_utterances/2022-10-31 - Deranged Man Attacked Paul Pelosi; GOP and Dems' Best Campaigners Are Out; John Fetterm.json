MARA S. CAMPO, JOURNALIST:  Yes, I mean, it actually shows you how much deeper this goes than just kind of the random fringe conspiracy theorists who are trying to make this something that it's not. When you have the new owner of Twitter, the richest man in the world, and someone with the largest Twitter audience in the world, retweeting a conspiracy theory that has no evidence and it's completely baseless in the wake of this awful attack. And when you hear the details about the attack, it makes it clear that this was much worse than any of us had initially realized. Even though we realized it was really, really bad, it was even worse than we realized. And what that shows us now is a lot about the current political climate. You know, Dan Rather, the legendary journalist, has a metaphor that I love. He says, climate change did not create hurricanes, but it made them much worse. And it's the same with political violence. Political violence has always existed on all sides of the political spectrum, but today's political climate is making it much worse and it is a uniquely right-wing problem right now.

Remember that this attacker in San Francisco was asking, where's Nancy, which is pretty much the same thing that the mob was asking on January 6th when they invaded the capitol. This is a sickness, but it's not divorced from the Republican Party. And unfortunately, if you see the reaction of the Republican Party to what happened in San Francisco. You're seeing why we have this cycle of violence because Republicans are not denouncing the extremists in their own ranks. And you see a lot of Republicans really, really sick stuff, including Republican elected officials who are making fun of this, who are poking fun of Paul Pelosi, who could have easily died in this horrifying assault. And then you see, of course, as you mentioned and we're discussing a second ago, you see all these insane conspiracy theories, which are being spread by potent Republican influencers like Dinesh D'Souza and many others. So, there is a real sickness on the right here, which is when you have this combination of extremist rhetoric leading to extremist actions.

Remember, this goes back, there's a long tradition that long predates Donald Trump, unfortunately, of misogyny in American public life. Let's be real about that.Nancy Pelosi was the first woman speaker when she was elected speaker before Donald Trump was president. Republicans at that time made her into kind of the national face of their campaign to reclaim control of the House of Representatives. They demonized her at the time. What's different and I think it's very important is this astonishing rise in the number of politicized threats of violence against members of Congress. That is what skyrocketed since Donald Trump was president. And of course, to your point about what was it that this attacker allegedly was saying. You know about Nancy Pelosi and the truth that relates very specifically to Donald Trump and the big lie about the election, and I think that's very important. This is an agenda that has now become the Republican Party's agenda. But I have to say one final thing. I don't know about you. Listening to that clip of, it's not just what Kari Lake said.

President Biden does have an agenda he can point to, even though that job approval rating hasn't been getting him called in.
