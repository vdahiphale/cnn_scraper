This is the hour the highly anticipated Harry and Meghan docu-series is being released and a huge audience is expected to tune in for the royal revelations and possibly explosive details.

      "sentences": "Exactly the questions that we are asking here, Rosemary. I mean, it's literally just dropped. You can now watch it. So everyone is going to be pouring over it. What's interesting about this is that there has been no previewing of this whatsoever, only a very small group of people directly involved in the series have had any access to it whatsoever.No one in the media has been given a preview. No one in the palace has been given a preview, so we are just waiting to see what's in it. You're looking here at images from one of the trailers. It was controversial because images were used in there juxtaposed against a transcript, which didn't really match. The pictures weren't necessarily speaking to what was implied in the trailer. But that's the only bit of controversy really, so far, because the revelations in the trailers spoke to things that we've heard before. So, what we're really looking for is specific allegations and case studies really that back up the Sussex's claims that they weren't supported by the palace, that they were being briefed against by certain elements within the palace and that they weren't supported or protected by the family, or indeed the palace system. And if there are any additional allegations around race, for example, one of the descriptions of the series is addresses discrimination. So, we are expecting some more about the racism that Meghan, in particular, faced within the palace when she was part of that system. CHURCH:  And of course, the problem so far with this trailer is the distraction of one particular shot of the paparazzi. They're actually, that was from Harry Potter scene, wasn't it? And they -- that was paparazzi gathering for that, not Harry and Meghan. And that has a lot of people, lot of tongues wagging about them not really sticking to the truth.",

There's some cynicism around that because of course, when they sign the deal with Netflix and indeed the director, they would've -- there would be some degree of selection about what goes into it and how the -- what they want from it.There's also another still picture in there, which is more nuance, it is. It's when they're talking about media intrusion it shows a camera up high and they're down low, walking away from the camera. But that wasn't a paparazzi shot. That was a palace approved. Harry and Meghan approved pool position shot, which was in South Africa. I was on that tour. So, all of those positions were approved by the couple. So, there is some controversy there, but I think a lot of their supporters would say we're being distracted by all of this. What's important is the main message, which is that they weren't in control of their own narrative in the palace and it didn't work for them, and now they want to take control back. The other con -- criticism, of course, Rosemary, is that they are criticizing the media at the same time as using the media. I think their counter-argument to that would be they do want to tell their story, but they just want to be in control of it. They don't want lies and misinformation put out there about their own lives. They want it to be real.",

But there are some things that the U.S. simply will not send.They will not send long range drones, long range missiles that could strike, strike deep inside of Russian territory. They also, at least so far, will not send clustered munitions, but that has not stopped Ukraine from asking for them according to both U.S. and Ukrainian officials. Now, one Ukrainian lawmaker said on record that if Ukraine were to have more of these weapons, that it would change the course of the war and could potentially end it sooner. So just a bit of context here. A normal bomb used in war causes a heck of a lot of damage, radius of about, or an area about 50 meters wide or so. These cluster bombs part of the reason why they are so deadly, and also, so effective, frankly, is because the main bomb breaks into dozens and dozens of smaller bomblets and disperses over an area that is perhaps a hundred meters wide. [03:20:03] And so, Russia has been using these weapons in Ukraine, and they're controversial obviously, because it's hard to be precise. It's impossible to be precise with these really, and so they cause a lot of civilian deaths. We have video that you're seeing here of them being used in Kharkiv, and you kind of get a sense of why they could cause a lot of collateral damage. The Ukrainians argue that, look, we'll be using these against Russian troops, not against civilians. The difficulty with that argument though, is that war is complicated and you often have troops in areas where there are civilians. You also have troops themselves dispersed over a wide area to be -- avoid becoming a target. The other problem is that these bombs, not all of the little bomblets often explode, and so they're left behind sort of as de facto landmines for civilians to discover later on. And so, that's why U.S. Congress has restricted the ability of the U.S. to actually transfer those to other countries. So, as you said, the Biden administration hasn't rejected the Ukrainian request, but they haven't really considered it seriously though. A former defense secretary though, said last night that they should. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LEON PANETTA, FORMER U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY:  The Russians are not playing by the Marcus of Queensbury rules. They've used cluster bombs. They're sending missiles into schools, into hospitals. They have no regard for human life. The cluster bomb is designed to go after a military operation where you've got military units that are gathered in the battlefield. I think if there are some conditions with regards to the use of those kinds of weapons, I think it is possible, that they could have that kind of weapon. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

China succeeded in keeping death rates down dramatically compared to the rest of the world by walling off China from the COVID virus. It has lost by official figures somewhere over 5,000 people over the last three years to COVID-19, even though the virus was first detected in China at the end of December 2019, before it then spread around the rest of the world.The announcement on Wednesday that the Chinese government was going to dramatically lift many parts of its zero COVID policy were greeted in different ways depending on who you talk to in China. Among some people there was great excitement. I spoke with a friend in Shanghai who heard that the travel restrictions inside China between regions were being lifted, and she was delighted, talked about immediately trying to book a plane ticket to go see her parents who she hadn't been able to visit for months. And that's reflected by a 160 percent jump in the search volume for plane tickets on the Chinese travel platform, Ctrip. On the flip side of that, there is a great deal of anxiety, particularly among families that live in multi-generational households about vulnerable grandparents. And so, you've had a run on over-the-counter medicines for cold, fever, cough, and inflammatory drugs because people have been told by the Chinese government for years now that COVID-19 is a deadly disease. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WATSON (voice-over):  China is the last country in the world still trying to completely eradicate COVID. But after months of harsh restrictions some of the COVID lockdown barriers in China are starting to come down.

      "sentences": "Well, it's interesting. I mean, they're asked why they're doing this, and they want people to hear their story from them as opposed to other people and other experts. They're very critical. A lot of the royal experts, they say they're just effectively an arm of the palace communication system.But it starts with this -- with these sort of moments Harry and Meghan talking to their phones just after they've left their royal positions. I think that's interesting because they were clearly wanting to record this for some reason as they left their royal position. So, they're recording these elements and then that's playing into the documentary. And then, there's a big sit-down interviews as well where they really go over everything. An interesting quote from Harry I thought was, I think for so many people in the royal family, especially obviously the men, there can be a temptation or an urge to marry someone who would fit the mold as opposed to somebody who perhaps you are destined to be with. So, men marrying people they weren't necessarily in love with. I think he's arguing there. The difference between making decisions with your head or your heart. And he's clearly saying he was going with his heart when he wanted to marry Meghan. There's this criticism of the system not protecting the couple. So, for example, he was presented with some newspaper articles, which are very negative. And then his interactions with the palace off the back of them. And he said, what people didn't seem to understand was a lot of the family had gone through similar things with this negative press coverage, but it was almost seen as a rite of passage. And he would say, it's different though this time because there's this race element. So, we're just going through the different -- sorry, excuse me, three parts of the documentary so far, but it's very much setting up how they got together, how they are desperately in love, and how they didn't feel protected by the palace system really fleshing all of that out.",

I think, one part of it, Harry describes how Meghan gave up everything to join his life and the next thing he knew, he had given up everything to join her life, which is a reference to moving to California and just trying to make sense of it.So, I think they struggle to make sense of what they had done as much as the world had struggled to make sense of what they had done, and only now they trying to make sense of it and just putting it out there. A huge amount of frustration with royal experts, royal correspondence, the Palace system. They talk about something called the royal rotor, which they believe is some sort of conspiracy. The royal rotor, you know, is a pooling system where you, well, you know, there's a royal engagement, for example, Harry was very much part of this when he was part of the royal family. You can't have 20, 30 cameras in there and 50 correspondents. So, there's an agreement to send one camera in and one correspondent, and you share all that information. I would argue that the British media would view that as an efficient system. He was saying it's conspiracy where the palace basically plants stories with the media and their story gets out and they didn't feel they were part of that story. They would feel that if there was negative stories about them, they wouldn't be protected in the same way. So, it's that sort of, access of media palace and the family that they're trying to sort of describe and say it didn't work for them, which is why they left.",

A lot of critics are saying this is them cashing in making a profit when they had said that they wanted to basically sit back from public life. How would they address that? Would they address that in this? FOSTERout their soul, which is, they were never able to tell their story. Their story wasn't being told properly, and this is their way of taking control of their story and putting it out there. Yes, they're being paid a huge amount of money for this, but I think their argument would be, we have to, you know, we wanted to be financially independent and this is how we're doing it, and this is the reality of the world that we're living in. You get paid. And we are being paid for this. There's that, you know, a lot of their critics would say that they're hypocrites because they are claiming privacy whilst also revealing themselves and revealing their privacy and being paid for it. But they have a different nuance on that say, they're only revealing the parts of their lives that they want to reveal and it's their duty, in particular, to have the right to have consent over how their children appear in the media. I do remember at the time when Archie was born, we would normally expect to get pictures very quickly of the family, of the baby and they didn't put that out there. And that was an argument that did go out right back to that time when they were part of the family, the working royal family. They didn't want to put pictures out there. So, I think, you know, certainly something they believed in a long time, particularly the protection of the privacy of their children.

Instead, a former president is now urging the government to take a softer approach to the protests. While the estranged sister of Iran's current supreme leader is making it clear she's not on board with his regime. And that's happening as Iran carries out its first known execution related to the ongoing protests.And for more, Salma Abdelaziz joins us now from London.

It's a day that marks the killing of three students at the hands of security forces in 1953. And it was yet another opportunity for the youth of that country to come out back to those streets and hear those chants again against the government.I think there was a particularly telling episode yesterday, Rosemary, inside the University of Tehran. The president was giving, Ebrahim Raisi was giving a statement to students calling the protesters rioters, yet again making these accusations that it's a conspiracy against the state, that they're backed by countries like the United States. While he was repeating that rhetoric inside the university just outside the building, there was dozens of protesters chanting against his government. So, a really revealing day where again, you're seeing these huge acts of brave - bravery, and also, voices coming from unlikely places in support of the opposition. Iran's supreme leader's sister, now she has opposed the family in the past, but she released a statement on Twitter. I want to read you a part of it because it is very powerful. Losing a child and being away from your child is a great sadness for every mother. Many mothers were bereaved during the last four decades. I think it's appropriate now to declare that I oppose my brother's actions and I express my sympathy with all mothers mourning the crimes of the Islamic Republic regime, from the time of Khomeini to the current era of the despotic caliphate of Ali Khomeini. And again, this was an open letter posted on Twitter by her son. Again, yes, a figure that has opposed the government in the past. Her daughter is an activist that has been imprisoned for her activism. But yet again, this is a voice that people can rally around. And while we're seeing these extraordinary acts of bravery, we're also seeing the consequences of them. Yet again, Rosemary, we're hearing an updated death toll. This is from Iran human rights, it's Norway based group. They say 458 people killed since this movement began in September. Important to remember here CNN cannot independently verify those numbers. It's quite impossible to figure out exact figures because of limited media access on the ground. We're also hearing, as you mentioned, of the first protest related execution. A young man who was killed by hanging for allegedly stabbing a member of the besiege. But as we often see with those who are targeted by the government, they become symbols of heroism to these protestors. Rosemary?",
