Also, tonight, police dragging NFL star Tyreek Hill out of his car. The bodycam video just released and what Hill is now saying. We've got fresh reaction from none other than Stephen A. Smith. And remembering the singular, incomparable James Earl Jones. Actor Courtney B. Vance will be my guest live, tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\"So, has there ever been a debate as anticipated as tomorrow's? I mean, really, talk about this political \"Price is Right\" game show doors with just 57 days to go. So, you got behind door number one, you got the way the Harris campaign wants you to see the debate: The prosecutor versus the felon. Now behind door number two, the way the Trump campaign wants you to see it: The fighter versus a -- quote -- \"dangerous radical socialist.\" Now, tens of millions have already decided which door they're going to pick and the way they will see the debate. But for those many undecided who have yet to do and make that decision, tomorrow's preview could, in fact, be the deal breaker. In less than 24 hours, America will see Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris share the debate stage, this very one you're looking at right now, together in Philadelphia. You know what makes it even more intriguing? Looking at the scene of their very first meeting, the first time they'll ever be in the same room conversing with one another, Trump on the left, Harris on the right. Harris will have the opportunity to do what so many Democrats said President Biden failed at doing in his first debate, to prosecute the case against Donald Trump, to turn a debate stage into a kind of political courtroom. Now Harris, she says she's ready to do just that. Trump on the other hand looks eager to land some punches on Harris's policy positions. They say Harris won't know what's coming. And I quote, \"Imagine a boxer trying to prepare for Floyd Mayweather or Muhammad Ali. You just don't know what angle they're going to come at you with.\" That's Jason Miller, a Trump senior advisor. Now, if we're using boxing analogies already, I wonder if the gloves are going to come off. Former Democrat turned Trump ally, Tulsi Gabbard, has -- she has been prepping Trump. Now, she famously tried to take Harris a task on her record back in 2020, and tonight says that Trump is going to do the same. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

What are the most important points that he needs to hammer home?BRYAN LANZA, FORMER DEPUTY COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, TRUMP 2016 CAMPAIGN:  Well, first of all, I say Mark is right that President Trump is very well-defined. I think this is the seventh debate. He has done this a lot. He's around television cameras all the time. So, he's used to that apparatus of being around there. I think the first thing President Trump needs to do is acknowledge that Americans are suffering. He's going to be pointing to the prices of everything, the cost of affordability. Everything is out of price range for everything. Every month, households are struggling to make payments or having to max out their credit cards, take out new credit cards. He's got to make that case that America is suffering and that change is coming. And he has to additionally make the case of why America is suffering and how he's going to change that. He has to remind -- he has to remind the American people that the Harris-Biden administration created this inflation, created the dynamics that has wiped out their savings, that has led to bankruptcies, that has led to credit card defaults. He has to do all these things. But I think most importantly, which allows him to communicate that message best, is I don't think he should be insulting Kamala Harris. Every time he insults Kamala Harris, the pundits, the media, they talk about those things and they're not talking about the issues that matter to the American people, which are immigration and inflation. So, if he insults Kamala Harris, I expect that to be the leading issue of everything. We're now talking about the damage that the Harris- Biden administration have done to the American family. So, those are the three things I'd have him focus on, and I know those are the three things the campaign is also working to address.",

But he's not going to win a single vote for anybody that supports reproductive rights.But he's -- but the reason he did that flip on floor is he's concerned about what's happening with women, and women are turning out in incredible numbers in early voting and registration. And he's worried about that effects. We tried to have it both ways. And then he pissed off his base, and then he had to turn back and flip back again because he really has no core belief about reproductive rights. He just does whatever is politically convenient. GARCIA-NAVARRO:  But if you look at the recent polling, the shocker -- the shocker in this is that more people see him as moderate than they see Kamala Harris as moderate. Trump is moderate, which is just like, to me, inconceivable. But, you know, I don't know if they're confusing morally flexible with moderate. But it does work in his favor that he shifts his positions because people see him as a dealmaker. They still have this impression of him as a kind of businessman who doesn't need to stand on ideology, will be willing to make a deal on something as fundamental as reproductive rights if it is convenient for him.

Smith, the host of \"First Take\" on ESPA. He is also the host of \"The Stephen A. Smith Show\" on YouTube. Stephen A, I have to know what your reaction was when you saw the body camera video, not just what we heard about it, but when you actually saw it. And I remember a phrase you used earlier today, and it stuck with me, the ease of dehumanization. What was your reaction? STEPHEN A. SMITH, ESPA HOST, YOUTUBE HOST:  Well, I still feel that way from the standpoint that, you know, it was excessive. It was completely unnecessary on the part of the officers, particularly and specifically when he was handcuffed. And so, I stand by everything that I said earlier this morning on ESPN's \"First Take\" and, of course, my YouTube show, \"The Stephen A. Smith Show.\" I mean what I said when I said it was just unnecessary and it just speaks to the ease with which Black men can be dehumanized because you've seen situations where people who happen to not be Black have had issues with the police. And yes, they may end up in handcuffs and they be taken away, similar to what happened to golfer Scottie Scheffler in Kentucky a few months ago in May, but he was detained, he was put in handcuffs, he was detained, he was taken away, he was arrested. That certainly was not the case with Tyreek Hill. But in the same breath, to forcibly throw him to the ground face first, to know this 90-plus degree weather and you're putting him on that asphalt and in terms of that heat, and then afterwards, he's standing up, you already have him cuffed, you have other officers around in the field in need to throw him, to push him and shove him to the ground that way, to sit him down that way, was completely unnecessary and it speaks to the excessive behavior of the police officers. But in fairness to police officers everywhere, and specifically those police officers there, when this latest bodycam footage was released and we saw it, let me remind everybody, they did ask him to roll down his window. Not one, not twice, but at least three times. Then they also asked him to get out of the car. In each instance, there was hesitation on his part and a lack of cooperation. So, when they say he was uncooperative, you can see why they feel that way. Now, again, I want to emphasize, that's no reason for them to go as far as they did. But in the same breath, him saying that he didn't know what he did and that he didn't do anything wrong, well, that's not entirely true. You're Black men in America. I will remind everybody of what I'm sure you would agree with, Laura. You roll down all your windows, you put your hand on that steering wheel. The last thing you want to do, especially if you have tinted windows, is leave your windows up when the police officer is telling you to put it down, because when you don't do something like that, we have seen and we have had a reason to sense that the worst possible thing could happen. Tyreek Hill did not do that. So, when they say he was uncooperative, they did have a point with the latest bodycam footage we saw.",

There are many people who would say, there are instances of people fully cooperating, doing nothing wrong. And the lesson that is imparted around Black and brown people around this country is there is no escaping those officers who endeavor to commit excessive force against you. Not all officers, but those who endeavor do so.And the second point is it strikes a lot of people that this was an ego issue, not one of force. I'm talking about the officers. Officers are entitled to use force, to repel a force used against them. But it seemed as though what they were reacting to was an attitude that they perceived, and they were reacting to the fact that he was slow in his efforts. This is not the same thing, though, as one thing that they actually are in danger, and that's the criteria.",
