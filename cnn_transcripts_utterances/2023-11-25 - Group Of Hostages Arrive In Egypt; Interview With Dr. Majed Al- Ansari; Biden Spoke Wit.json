And then moments later, several of those hostages are seen exiting the ambulances and entering a building on the Egyptian side of that border crossing. They will now be making their way into Israel very soon. Qatari officials say that among the hostages released today are 13 Israelis who are being released. They are eight children and five women. Four foreign nationals are also believed to be in the second group released today. CNN's Wolf Blitzer is live in Tel Aviv.

You have been in this operations room in Doha. What happened today? What slowed this down? DR. MAJED AL-ANSARI, SPOKESPERSON, QATAR FOREIGN MINISTRY: Well, as you know, Alex, I can't get into the details of the ongoing mediation as it is happening right now. Our main focus here is to get the hostages and prisoners back home, and reunited with their families. And as you might understand, there's a lot of tension within the process itself that we don't want to exacerbate even further. However, what I can tell you is that within this kind of mediation, you're always going to find both sides saying that the other side did not abide by the agreement, and this is why we have the operations room. We are able to get (INAUDIBLE) in real time to immediately hash out these issues, and this is how we were able today to move on a very bleak moment, where it seemed like the agreement is not going to be delivered on this day to now the families on their way to be reunited with their families.",

The head of the Palestinian Commission for Detainees and ex-Prisoners Affairs told CNN that Israel is not releasing prisoners in order of length of time served, that they are failing to adhere to the agreed upon criteria of the seniority of the prisoners. Is that true?AL-ANSARI: Well, I mean, as you know, some of these prisoners spent decades in Israeli prisons and as you might understand, there's lots of talk about the criteria, the prioritization of people coming out on the hostages side with families being together and making sure that those who are most at risk are given priority. On the prisoners' side, it's the length of time they spent in Israeli prisons and some of them have been there since they were, you know, children and now they are teenagers, and that is definitely something that we are working with both parties. The lists were delivered to both sides by the first hours of dawn yesterday. And lots of discussions was done over these lists and we are now hopeful that with the second or the third day of this pause, we would be able to hash out a lot of these details that made this day so difficult.",

We are in a war zone. Emotions are high on both sides. And the level of death and destruction that we are seeing is unprecedented, and therefore we shouldn't expect for the pause to be easily conducted and for the agreements be easily conducted and monitored. We were ready for this and the operations from here in Doha became into effect as we saw the disagreements taking place. We know that we still have two days and our negotiation team here in Doha led by the prime minister and the efforts taken by all the officials in Doha is to make sure that whenever we have an issue like this, we immediately jump in and talk to all sides and get everybody on board and we're able to understand the concerns from both sides.

The discussion of course has, you might have found, focused on implementing the agreement, how to make sure that it is implemented and how we make sure that we safeguard the pause.

Do you have any sense of when those three Americans will be released?AL-ANSARI: Well, you know, the lists are delivered on a daily basis. We are now expecting the list for the third day. So sadly we can't know who's going to be on that list beforehand. I know that the U.S. administration has been doing all it can to make sure that the U.S. citizens are out as soon as they can. We are also monitoring the list, as I said, as soon as we have them, which we'll have them probably in a couple of hours from now.

Yesterday, there was a bus accompanied by several ambulances. So that may also be the situation here tonight.

There are also four Thai nationals who were also taken hostage on October 7th who were also freed today and who are also on Israeli soil.

So yesterday they brought in ten Thai citizens and a Filipino citizen. Tonight they are expected to take in the four Thai citizens that were released from captivity from being hostages at seven weeks at the hands of Hamas in Gaza.Now, let me pick up right where Clarissa left off, because obviously one of the most important parts of the recovery is seeing family as quickly as possible, and for many of these foreign nationals who are coming here, that's simply not possible. They came here to work. Many came on their own to raise money and then take money home to their families. So their families simply aren't here. One of the Thai nationals was able to hop on the phone yesterday with his family back home in Thailand and that is effectively where -- or as close as they can get at this point. It is worth noting why they're here, so many of the Thai citizens who are here come as farm workers to do grueling work on the farm land across the country here. Many of Filipino citizens who are here come here to be nannies or to help out families. In fact, the one Filipino citizen who came out last night was welcomed here by the family with whom he worked. And that became the closest ones, the family that effectively greeted him here at the hospital. So that is the sort of welcome they can hope to get here as they try to connect on the phone or in other ways with their families back home. It is about a two-hour drive from Kerem Shalom where we saw Jeremy Diamond to here. So it will be a bit of time before we get here. But just like what Clarissa is at Sheba Medical Center, the staff here set up and ready to take them in and to care for them, not only to check over of course, their physical condition but also their mental health as well after seven weeks in captivity. This is another part of the effort to take care of all of the hostages. Here the focus is on the foreign nationals, some of who, are still hostages in Gaza, Wolf.",

We are expecting the bus to come to where we are now in al- Bireh (ph). This crowd is growing, ready to receive those detained. Many of them expected to arrive here today to celebrate and welcome those being released. We are speaking to the family members here who have had to wait quite a while to find out whether or not their loved ones are on the list. Today, they are getting the confirmation of the list, 39 according to the Palestinian Prisoner Society. Among them, 33 children, minors under the age of 18. The vast majority of those minors were held under administrative detention, meaning no charges were laid against them. We spoke to two families, both of whom had teenage sons who were held under administrative detention. You could imagine the relief that they felt to hear that they would be returned home today. And we are still waiting for their arrival now. This is, of course, the second cohort of Palestinian prisoners and detainees being released as part of the truce agreement between Israel and Hamas. We understand, under the terms of that agreement, some 150 are set to be released over the coming days. That is dependent on the safe evacuation and release of Israeli hostages inside Gaza. And it is very much dependent on the actual release of prisoners and detainees. It cannot take place until then and they are back in Israeli hands. That is now what we have seen transpire over the last hour or so. We do imagine the crowds will begin to gather more and more over here. It is certainly getting bigger. Though not as big as we saw yesterday. Thousands gathered yesterday to welcome that first group of prisoners and detainees who were released. It was a huge moment of celebration. But of course, many feel this is a moment of subdued celebration because many have told us they feel this has come at a high price, referencing the death toll that we have seen in the Gaza Strip.
