I'm Fredricka Whitfield.All right, new today, Israel's military says it is intensifying operations in central Gaza and ordering the immediate evacuation of severe -- several more neighborhoods in the southern city of Rafah where millions of displaced Palestinians are seeking refuge. The IDF says about 300,000 people have already fled. These evacuations follow a new deadly round of air strikes across Gaza. CNN's Scott McLean has more.",

      "sentences": "Fredricka, new airstrikes in northern and central Gaza have flooded hospitals with a new round of victims. Included amongst them, a journalist, his wife, and 12-year-old son. And the death toll may yet still rise as people search through the rubble of those airstrikes with little more than their bare hands searching, at this point, for bodies.And the video of the aftermath and the chaotic hospitals that have taken in those victims is pretty hard to watch. Many of the victims are children, some of them are very tiny infants. The IDF declined to comment on the strikes other than to say that it was working to dismantle Hamas and insisting that it follows international law and takes measures to mitigate civilian harm. That is notable only because the U.S. State Department released a report yesterday saying that it is reasonable to assess that Israel has not always followed international law. The IDF just this morning has told people in parts of northern Gaza to evacuate to safe for areas and in several districts of Rafah, as well, to move to a humanitarian zone along the coastline, a zone where people have pitched tents along the roadway and along the coast. And there's very little in the way of infrastructure to support that volume of people. The IDF says that there are now 300,000 people there. That is double the estimate that they gave on Thursday. There are also people in Rafah who are struggling to leave at all. Some are unwilling to go, some are struggling with the logistics of moving around this active war zone, or the cost of moving around. One person told CNN that the situation there is beyond bad. It also seems like Israel is undeterred by the U.S. pausing shipments of weapons to Israel because of it's continued to advance in Rafah. The IDF says that it has enough weaponry to go this alone. The Israeli security cabinet has approved an expansion of the operating area. All of this just as aid into southern Gaza slows to a trickle, if that. Fredricka?",

And it's not a safe zone. It's not a humanitarian zone. Theres zero sanitation. There's very little access to humanitarian assistance there.And they're also expecting people to move to Khan Yunis, which is little more than a pile of rubble. But people don't have a choice. And so they get shepherded around the Gaza Strip, and they themselves will say it's this sick, twisted, cruel game, because we'll all remember that originally Israel told people to move to the south. The south was supposed to be a safe zone. Rafah was supposed to be a safe zone, except it never was. And now they're being forced or told to move to move from there and face the consequences. And you really end up with this situation where people are almost paralyzed to a certain degree because they don't know where to go. They don't know how to stay safe, and yet they kind of have to keep moving, because what choice do they have at this stage? But the fundamentals on the ground are that nowhere in Gaza is safe, and these humanitarian zones, these safe zones that Israel keeps talking about, they do not exist, have never existed, and Israel is not and has not coordinated with humanitarian organizations to establish something viable.",

Despite those risks, the northern lights are expected to last through Sunday morning.

      "sentences": "That's right, and quite a treat, because typically speaking, when you see the auroras, green is the most common color. But on these types of events, when they are such strong solar storms, you actually tend to get more of the pinks and the red colors, which is not as common.Take a look at this image behind me. This is from Seattle. You can actually see all of those colors we just mentioned. Youve got the greens, the blues, purples, reds, pinks, all of it all mixed in one. Now, granted, they are a little bit farther north, but even areas farther south are seeing it. This is actually the southern lights. This image taken from New Zealand. Again, you can see that very deep pink, red color. Now, we can still see these. These are more rare to see this particular kind of color, especially here in the U.S. So take, for example, this one. This is seen just south of Jacksonville, Florida. Yes, even that far south, they were able to see the lights. But notice too that it's more of those red and pink colors. And again, it's because of the latitude, those lower latitudes tend to see more of this color on the spectrum than they do some of the others. But as we mentioned, if you missed it all last night and you're feeling upset about it, you'd like another chance, you will get that opportunity tonight. Now, in terms of timing, the earlier in the evening is going to be the better timeline, especially up until about 11:00. You can still see them after that, but it really starts to diminish pretty quickly. The where, obviously the farther north you are, the better odds you're going to have. But even areas farther south -- Georgia, Florida, southern California, the only thing that really may limit it, Fred, is going to be a lot of these clouds you see here near the Gulf coast and up and areas of the northeast as well.",

While this report is critical, it does not mandate any actions by the Israeli government or mark any type of U.S. policy changes toward Israel. And that has received some pushback from allies of the president who say that the contents just still don't amount to policy changes by the U.S., which is what they want to see. But, as you mentioned, Fred, this too comes against the backdrop of the president issuing a pretty stark warning in an interview with CNN that he would withhold some weapons from Israel if it goes into that major ground operation in Rafah.

Roger, my late husband Roger Ebert said that movies are a machine that generates empathy, allowing us to put ourselves in the shoes of another person, of a different race or gender, socioeconomic status or ethnicity, religion, and helping to teach us to respect those differences.And so at the end of his life, I was called upon to do a lot of speeches at cancer centers and hospitals. And I developed a speech called \"Sometimes Hope is a Strategy.\" And it was doing that time that I actually started the idea for the book. And then the pandemic happened, and I stopped. But I live in Chicago. So when the world stopped, I walked, I looked out. I was standing in the street and Chicago. Coyotes were there. No people, no cars. Coyotes. And I thought, if an actual virus could shut down the whole world and insinuate itself into our consciousness, why not principles like compassion or kindness or empathy or forgiveness?",

After all, I mean, it was all about opposing views between, you know, Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel. So how was it they were able to do it there without animosity, right? I mean, people would tune in to see their opposing views on things. They could -- they could differ on so many things, yet walk away with, wow, this is a team effort, and here is an interesting set of perspectives on one singular thing. I mean, what has happened. What happened in between all that?",

And that's what \"Give a FECK\" is all about. We are a team. We are not here alone. We can do this together.And I have a big idea. I want to take this book and give it to every person in Congress and every senator. So I guess there would be about 650 people. I will five these books away because I want them to do the exercise in empathy journal to see finding the right words for how to speak, finding the right way to reach across the aisle and actually get something done.
