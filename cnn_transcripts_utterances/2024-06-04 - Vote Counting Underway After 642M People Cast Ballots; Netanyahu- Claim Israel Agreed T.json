Well, the votes is now just under four hours -- 3-1/2 hours since the ballot boxes were broken open and that the vote counting began.And the first of the votes in this massive election. They were cast on April 19. So, this has been a six-week election. And according to the official figures, the number of people who cast ballots is much larger than the entire population of many countries, some 642 million people have voted. Now, the question is going to be what could the results be? This is for the lower House of parliament here and there are 534 seats up for grabs. The magic number to win a majority is 272. Of course, Narendra Modi, the prime minister and his ruling BJP, they have been in power now for some 10 years. They are seeking a third term in office. And they went into this massive election, predicting a huge victory, predicting that they would win some 400 seats out of these 534 seats. Well, it is still early hours. We are still looking at preliminary results, but they are suggesting a much more competitive election than this massive BJP wave that had initially been predicted by the BJP itself. That actually, the races are much more competitive, for example, in the giant state, the very -- most populous state of Uttar Pradesh, that may, in fact, in these first hours, be neck and neck. So, this is something to watch very closely. It still does look like Modi's Alliance, his electoral bloc is headed towards a victory and what would potentially be a third term in office, but it does suggest that his party has lost some ground around the country in what I think everybody agrees is a referendum on him and his decade in power.

Admiral Daniel Hagari, the top spokesman for the Israeli military, saying that based on new intelligence, the military assesses that these four hostages were killed a few months ago during their Hamas captivity in Gaza, saying that the assessment is that they were killed while together in the area of Khan Yunis, during Israeli military operations there against Hamas. Now, he doesn't explicitly say that Israeli fire was responsible for their deaths, but he acknowledged that there will be, \"difficult\" questions about exactly how they died. We should note that one of these four hostages, a 51-year-old British Israeli citizen, Nadav Popplewell. Hamas last month said that he had been wounded and that -- in an Israeli airstrike, and that he subsequently died of his injuries. The three other hostages mentioned here are Chaim Peri, 79 years old. There is 80-year-old year Yoram Metzger, and 84-year-old Amiram Cooper. And with this news, the families of these hostages and the families of so many other hostages are now raising their voices, urging the Israeli government to stand by this proposal that is now on the table and to make a deal with Hamas. And they are doing so at a time when we've heard the Israeli prime minister over the last couple of days, focusing on the fact that this proposal will not automatically lead to a permanent ceasefire, will not automatically lead to an end of the war in Gaza. And he's doing so, because since President Biden on Friday put this Israeli proposal out in the open for the public to see to bring a lot of public pressure to bear, two far-right members of Netanyahu's governing coalition, the finance minister Bezalel Smotrich, and the National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, had been threatening to pull the rug out from under Netanyahu, to topple the government effectively over this deal, because they believe it will lead to an end of the war. And Netanyahu, in insisting that it will not, there is now concern that not only is he not being successful in convincing these far-right members of his government to support this deal, but also, the concern being from Israeli government officials, according to two sources familiar with the matter that Netanyahu is potentially undermining the deal itself. Undermining the ambiguity about exactly how you get from a phase one ceasefire to a longer-term phase two ceasefire, undermining the key selling point effectively, that would be made to Hamas. But now, the question is, will Netanyahu have to choose between the survival of his government or this hostage deal? The answer may lie in what Hamas's response will be, as we still await Hamas's official response to this latest proposal. Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Jerusalem.",

Israel made a -- Israel made a proposal in the form of a list of principles and thinks it agrees. President Biden then packaged it, and fearing because, you know, Mr. Netanyahu's tendency to mendacity and manipulate him. He figured that Mr. Netanyahu would oppose to it, and then claim that it wasn't -- it was never made. So, Biden stands up last Friday and makes it public. Israel then is in the predicament, while Netanyahu, rather, he's in a predicament, because he can't pass this, but he can't project. So, what he's doing is procrastinating, which is his modus operandi on everything, and always. Right now -- what -- right now what he's doing, Rosemary, is trying to stall and attach stipulations and conditions in what seems to be an effort to elicit a rejection from Hamas, you know, it's a blame game. So, he could say, well, no, I had my reservations, but I agreed to it. They reject it. I don't think it's going to work.

He knows that he reached a point on the road where he has to, you know, fork that he can, cannot -- can no longer avoid. But he is going to take the deal with reservations, hoping something will happen. Ask the Americans to add the Saudi dimension, meaning that he will give some faint half-hearted commitment to a peace process, loses coalition, make this a caretaker interim government, which cannot be toppled, and then, stall for time until after the American election without really committing to doing anything.

She became part of his team during his three presidential campaigns and in 2018, when he won the presidency, she was elected chief of government and of Mexico City. She pledged to continue the policies of Lopez Obrador with a five- point plan: Increase public safety, free public education, fight poverty through social programs and higher minimum wage, better regulation of water resources, and transition to renewable energies.
