Every -- I cannot find a Republican in a battleground state, particularly Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, who does not feel good about Donald Trump's numbers right now going into Election Day.And part of that's because of the early vote. Part of that's because of traditionally where Republicans are vis-a-vis Democrats showing up on Election Day. I mean, Pennsylvania, for example. You know, often Democrats are walking in with six, seven -- like four years ago it was over 1 million vote advantage going into Election Day. Today it's about 400,000 going into Election Day today. They're very optimistic about the turnout they're seeing. Not to mention the fact that overall high turnout may help Trump. I mean, all the polls we've seen the last few weeks and really the last few months, show that Trump does better with registered voters than he does with likely voters. It means that the voters who are most engaged have an opinion of them, and they don't necessarily like him. It's a little closer. It's those infrequent voters that if they can get them out to the polls, he wins. So, high turnout, that's good for Donald Trump.",

So they've been able to do a lot of the work ahead of time with the secretary of state saying today that puts them in an extremely good position to handle those late incoming ballots that they'll see later on today.And I want to show you just what we're seeing here at a church just 8 miles south of Grand Rapids. When folks come in, they fill out this Election Day application to vote piece of paper. Then they move over here, they check that information with the clerks over -- who are over here. It's quiet now. I just asked people why they think that's the case, maybe because people are out eating lunch. But there has been a consistent flow of people through here throughout the day. Then they take their ballots, what they get over here. They go right over here and they cast the ballots. They pick who they're voting for and then they put it through that tabulator. You can see that black position right back there. This is a process that's moving incredibly swiftly here at this church in Kent County, Michigan. Now, Kent County, I just want to remind folks, is a critical county for both of these contenders, for both Trump and Harris. Why is that? Because in 2016, Trump won it. In 2020, Biden won it. So both the campaigns, Harris and Trump, are eyeing this county as a pivotal county. Now, I do want to know, when it comes to the election results that we are expecting to see here in Michigan later tonight, maybe early tomorrow, maybe midday tomorrow, there have been Republicans who have seized on the possibility that, you know, later results are reasons for questioning the process. But folks that we have talked to here, even those who are supporting former President Trump cast their ballot for him said that they're not worried about that.
