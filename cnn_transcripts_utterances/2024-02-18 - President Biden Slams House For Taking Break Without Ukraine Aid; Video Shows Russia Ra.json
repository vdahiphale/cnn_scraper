Good evening.Tonight sobering images out of the Ukrainian city of Avdiivka, illustrating in stark terms what could be the reality of America failing to continue aid to the war-torn country of Ukraine. In this new video soldiers can be seen raising the Russian flag over that key city after Ukrainian forces were compelled to withdraw. This comes as authorities have reportedly detained hundreds of people across Russia for honoring Alexey Navalny, the prominent critic of Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Russian police, you can see this right here, shoving one man's face into the snow simply for trying to pay his respects to the fallen opposition leader. Here in Washington, there is no sign that lawmakers are close to any kind of a deal that would send more military aid to Ukraine while President Biden has said arming Ukraine would be the best way to punish Vladimir Putin. House Republicans are sitting on their hands yielding to pressure from Trump who has demanded that aid to Kyiv come in the form of loans, as Ukrainian soldiers run out of ammunition and as Putin tightens his grip over Russia. Let's discuss that and more now with CNN political commentator, Republican strategist, Alice Stewart and CNN political commentator and Democratic strategist Maria Cardona. They're also the co-host of the podcast \"Hot Mics from Left to Right.\" Alice, let me start with you. You know, Nikki Haley, she was going after Trump on all of this saying that his NATO comments that we've heard in recent days where he has said that Vladimir Putin and Russia can basically do whatever they want in Europe, if NATO countries aren't spending enough money on defense. She's been calling that chilling, but she seems to be out of step with the majority of her party on this one.",

And look, with the comments he made about NATO and encouraging basically Putin, go ahead and do whatever the hell you want to do with NATO members who don't pay their money, that's absurd and it's dangerous and it's certainly uncalled for.The part of -- the best part of NATO is not that it is a membership of a country club. It is -- and it's not out of benevolence. It is out of our own national security interests. And yes, just some of these countries not pay as much as they should or as much as they could, probably so, but we're all in this united, not for just our national security, but for the security of all of our allied countries. So to do anything other than to support those countries that have been there for us, specifically after 9/11 is certainly wrong. And I'm really disappointed to hear that more Republicans aren't speaking out against him and his comments with regard to NATO, and basically giving a nod to Vladimir Putin.",

A recent Pew poll shows more than 70 percent of Americans actually view the war in Ukraine as important to U.S. interests. I would imagine that that is surprising to some folks here in Washington. The narrative seems to go counter to what this poll number shows. Maria, does the president need to keep leaning into this? I mean, we saw him yesterday come out of mass. He walked right up to the cameras, obviously the White House wanted those cameras there because we got that pool video loud and clear, and he hammered Republicans in ways I haven't seen him this feisty in some time on an issue.

And many of Republicans are doing so as well.And look, fortunately, we have some members of Congress who have spoken out about this. Bipartisan members have spoken out about this. And Mark Warner for one, a Democrat saying that he lived -- this points out more than ever that Vladimir Putin is a blood thirsty tyrant and he has blood on his hands for the death of Navalny.

I think this is bone-chilling because he could not even say -- and it's not a hypothetical.He called it a hypothetical. He says he's not going to answer a hypothetical question. It's not a hypothetical because it already happened, and if he is chosen as VP, he will be put in that position. So to me, it just shows just what a stranglehold Donald Trump has over his party. And not only that, Jim, but what is so disgusting and shameful to me is that people who, in the past, like you said, would not have even thought about this and would have said, of course, that's the role of the vice president. Duh? Today, they have either undergone a brainwashing or a clear ripping out of their spine, and they are listening to their dictator Donald Trump. It's the only thing that they care about.

I went to the military academy at West Point where we were taught a leader does not lie, cheat, or steal, nor tolerate those who do. We cannot tolerate the kinds of lies and the misdirection that Mr. Trump is displaying to the American people. This is just ridiculous, putting himself in the kind of martyr position that Alexey Navalny was in, who is opposing a dictatorial regime and former President Trump saying he's a lot like Navalny because he's been tried on 91 criminal counts and several civil counts and been found guilty? Yes, it is time for us to stop tolerating this kind of individual and it's unfortunate to me that there seems to be a cult in many in the GOP that are following this. And it's causing not only massive problems internally and domestically in the United States, but, as we've seen, and the charts you've shown all day long in terms of the number of people supporting the actions in Ukraine and getting arms back to Ukraine, over 80 percent who feel it's important, and to have the Congress of the United States not representing their people which they are supposed to be doing in voting for this aid, just to me from a military perspective, you're dealing in life and death in Ukraine right now.

One of the most important portions, Page 43, he talks about the testimony of Michael Cohen.
