The markets, they are down, the weather down and these are the stories we're following for you today. The ECB President Christine Lagarde tells the markets we are not finished yet. The US Treasury is now using extraordinary measures to avoid breaking the debt ceiling. And the Dutch PM tonight on this program says they will be sending tanks to Ukraine within weeks. Live from the World Economic Forum, on Thursday, January the 19th. I'm Richard Quest in Davos with my good friend Marty, of course, and together with others, we mean business. Good evening. Tonight, investors get a wake-up call from the head of the European Central Bank. Christine Lagarde was speaking here in Davos and she said, if you think the bank will back down on rate rises, you should reevaluate that position. Madam Lagarde says Europe's economy is holding up better than many had expected and the inflation fight is far from over. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Wall Street is concerned Central Banks could over tighten and that, making the matter worse, the US has now officially hit its debt ceiling. That means that Treasury is robbing Peter to pay Paul, moving the money round as you can see. Now you see it, now you don't, as it goes to different places.

Now, the good news is, we have a mild recession predicted and it's a bit to your point, but think of what happened today. The Fed's problem is the jobs new claims number comes out and it is as low as it's ever been, not as low as it is in recession, as low as it has ever been. The employment is tight, people have money, they are spending, but on the other hand, they're starting to feel the bite of that higher interest rates.

But it's been coming at the back end of when Ukraine once -- the trajectory is there, the armored fighting vehicles that they need to punch through the frontlines, those have been committed recently. So the tanks are really the next piece in that jigsaw puzzle. Let's not forget NATO's view of Ukraine in the future is a country that has NATO compatible military equipment that can be operated the same as in any NATO nation. It may not be a member, but it will be able to do that. This is where Ukraine is moving, and militarily, it needs to fast because Russia is preparing potentially this big offensive.",

(MUSIC PLAYING) WEIR (voice-over):  More tourists and residents take a dramatic toll on the island's natural water resources. But that's not the only concern. MEDEMA (voice-over):  Just in the last 10 years, many, many villages have been noticing their once clean water has turned very, very dirty and no longer usable. We've noticed a very serious water crisis arising in a place where that really should not be the case. WEIR (voice-over):  Tucked away in a forested patch miles inland from the southern beaches, the Green School Bali was built to create the next generation of problem solvers. MEDEMA (voice-over):  Currently on campus, there are 50 student-led projects that have been activated. WEIR (voice-over):  Built from bamboo and other sustainable material, the impressive open-air facilities were designed to inspire imagination and creativity. Each structure, a base for what the school's founders call a living curriculum. MEDEMA (voice-over):  The point is to be part of reimagining education to be something that inspires action-based learning now, all across the globe. We are cultivating an optimistic, thoughtful and positive approach to climate and climate action. We want them to feel hopeful. We want them to feel like they have the skills, they have the ability to engage proactively in the world. WEIR (voice-over):  After a group of students became fascinated with biofuels, the school created a network of biobuses, each running on used cooking oil refined by science. MEDEMA (voice-over):  You're looking at a really wide ranging learning experience, from enterprise, to marketing, to management, because it became its own company and the largest biofuel transportation company in Indonesia. WEIR (voice-over):  Dipta is an 11th grader, driven to find solutions by the desperate need close to home.",
