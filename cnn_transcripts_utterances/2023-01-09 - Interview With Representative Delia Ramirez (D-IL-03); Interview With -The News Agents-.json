I'm Christiane Amanpour in London where British leaders have joined the global condemnation of the assault on Brazil's democratic institutions by insurrectionists. On Sunday, they stormed the country's Congress and the Supreme Court. They also marched on the Presidential palace in the capital Brasilia. Eerily, it happened around the January 6th anniversary of the storming of the U.S. capital. The insurgents are supporters of the former Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, who in turn has modeled himself on Donald Trump. U.S. President Joe Biden sent a message to the country's elected leader, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, saying that Brazil's democracy has Americas full backing. Hundreds have been arrested since the attack, and Lula da Silva vows that all those responsible will be held accountable. Correspondent Rafael Romo has this report. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Supporters of former Brazilian President, Jair Bolsonaro, stormed keybuildings in the country's capital, Sunday, breaching security barriers and temporarily occupying the country's Congress, Presidential Palace, and Supreme Court. Masses of protesters flooded the country seat of power. Many dressed in the colors of Brazil's flag, yellow and green, fueled by anger and distrust over Bolsonaro's defeat in a runoff election last October where he lost by less than two percentage points by current President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Protesters threw objects and scaled the roofs of buildings while clashing with police who responded with tear gas. At least, one protester was seen sitting at Brazil's Congress president. CNN Brazil reports the floor of the Congress building was flooded after the sprinkler system activated when protesters attempted to set fire to the carpet. By evening, police began dispersing the rioters from buildings and arrested hundreds of people who were detained in buses before being taken to the police station. President Lula da Silva, who was inaugurated just a week ago, described the events as barbaric and vowed to punish the people responsible. LUIZ INACIO LULA DA SILVA, BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  Those people we call fascist, we call them everything that's abominable in politics. They invaded the government headquarters and they invaded the Congress like vandals, destroying everything in their path. ROMO (voiceover):  President Lula da Silva also blamed his predecessor for the lack of security in the capital where Bolsonaro's supporters have been camped out for over a week. Bolsonaro, who is currently in Florida, denounced what he called the depredations and invasions of public buildings in a tweet. Adding that peaceful and lawful demonstrations are part of democracy. But critics say that Bolsonaro may have stirred up the crowds by repeatedly saying, without evidence, that he questioned the integrity of the country's electronic voting system. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Quite frankly, a country that willcease asylum seekers, that is part deeply entrenched in who we say we are as a nation that cares for others, that loves on others, that receives those that are seeking an opportunity to survive and to be able to thrive. Kevin McCarthy in his opening speech as he became speaker of our House said that it was a moment for him of history as a son of immigrants was now becoming the speaker of the House. Well, what's different? He is a -- he is the grandson of immigrants from Europe. Are we now going to make classifications, which is exactly what we have done? That it depends on where the immigrant is coming? Asylum seeking is asylum seeking. And I think it's very hypocritical to call this invasion. We are a country. A country that is made up of everyday people, immigrants that have created the economy, the power and ability of this country. Denying asylum to people who are crossing, risking their lives. The number of women that are being raped in those borders just to be able to get here. Tells us that people are not just waking up in the morning and saying, I think I'm bored here in Mexico, in Honduras, in Guatemala, and El Salvador, I will risk my life and nearly die to get to the other side and sleep in concrete.

We have to do that work. But the reality also is that up until 2023, we did not have enough people, like me who actually exemplify how personal the situation is and the impact that it is having on an entire nation. I have hope that with the number of us, particularly the freshman Democrats coming in, that the Hispanic Congressional Caucus, that the Haitian Caucus, the Progressive Caucus, and even the Congressional Black Caucus can come together in a courting effort to move the needle legislatively and in Congress.

You had that amazing interview with Prince Andrew in which he thought he had done so well when you interviewed him, only to see his entire, sort of, public persona collapse. What do you think and what do the British people thinking about Harry's so-called truth-telling? Does -- do you think people here might think that is a betrayal? EMILY MAITLIS, JOURNALIST/CO-HOST, \"THE NEWS AGENTS\" PODCAST:  Yes, I think I'm probably out of step with what most British people think. I think many people here are tired of the dirty laundry, the airing of private stuff in public, the making public. All these relationships that have been kept under wraps for so long. But I think Harry has raised a critical question here, which is about the monarchy's relationship with what you call the voracious U.K. media. And I think what Harry has portrayed is that monarchy is not really a team sport. That they are professionally competitive with each other, even within this family bond and these relationships and the bit of Anderson's interview that has, sort of, had jaws dropping here was when he talked about the bodies, you know, that Camilla had basically made him collateral damage to augment her standing amongst the British public. And I think just for us to have this glimpse of how that works, if that is how it works, or at least how he felt it worked, is really quite shocking, you know. That he, sort of, portrayed himself, yes. He has been talking to the media and I guess there's a lot of people who will say, well, that's pretty hypocritical. You are talking to the media. You are writing books. You are doing the documentary. But he is accountable. You know, his name is on the book and his face is on the documentary.

Race as it existed prior to the early 1700s was simply a -- taken from an old Italian word for tribe, for a group of people defined by geography. And so, they tried to convince us that race is permanent because they say it's always been this way. It hasn't. It hasn't even always been this way in our country, on this soil. You know, this was something that was created by colonial enterprise that was dealing with European indentured servants and African slaves coming together and rebelling.

By making most, the biggest group of poor people invisible, it has definitely hurt public support for addressing poverty. Similarly, we pretended for a long-time opioid addiction was just a problem facing black people. Certainly, up here in Baltimore that was the narrative.
