That, though, is something that's already done. It has happened. It is legislation, and it will stay no matter what is the case. What Harris is going to talk about today is what she wants to do to build on that and the other things from the Biden record, if she wins and is in place as the President next year.",

A lot of people are locked in at lower mortgage rates. So, when mortgage rates are so high, they don't move, and that doesn't release new houses, and that then pushes a lot of people to rent, and that's push rent up.She is coming out with a whole host of options to help first-time buyers with a down payment to try and incentivize home builders to try and produce more, and a plan to get three million more homes or housing units out there for people to available to buy. This is a multi-year plan. It is four years. It's not so simple. Try and incentivize a home builder to borrow money today when they believe interest rates are going to come down. Rahel, as you well know, that's the expectation. It takes time to build houses, ultimately. And a lot of people are saying, even just giving a first-time buyer a house or an element of money to be able to put down, everybody can then do that, and that price goes up that they ultimately end up paying again. I think there is lots of challenges here, and there is not one fix. But, more homes is a good idea.",

That's what Justin Wolfers, the economist, I'm sure you talk to him often as well, Julia, sort of said on yesterday's program that when you throw money at an issue, sometimes it creates more demand, which, of course, creates higher prices. But, I digress.Julia, in terms of just how far back, you talked a little bit about how these things take time. Time is a really important issue when we think about the supply issue. It's an issue that dates back years. It dates back to the 2008 financial crisis in terms of builders underbuilding in the years since then.",

It takes time for the homebuilders and to be willing to borrow the money at decent interest rates, which they're relatively high today, of course. They're going to time it so that hopefully they can borrow at lower rates as they come down. It's a whole host of elements, and it's not something, unfortunately, that you can fix overnight. It requires mortgage rates to come down, which will happen, of course, as interest rates come down. But, the challenge then is, if you've got more buyers out there because they can afford a mortgage, that puts prices up, and try telling people that you're going to try and fix prices when pensions effectively are tied up for those that are lucky enough to own homes in their property.It's just not an easy fix.

This appeared to be a lost cause for Democrats until Harris took over at the top of the ticket. Now, it's a very competitive state. The former President Donald Trump, well, he was in Asheville this week, and his campaign has invested millions of dollars in new ads in North Carolina.From Washington, let's bring in CNN's Chief National Affairs Correspondent, Jeff Zeleny. Jeff, always good to see you. You also were in North Carolina this week. It sounds like everybody is going to North Carolina this week. What did voters tell you? JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Rahel, there is no doubt that North Carolina is back in the list of battleground states. That's how the year started out, but then it slipped away. Democrats really saw President Biden's support waning, as you were saying, but the new enthusiasm and the uptick in volunteers and attention certainly is playing out. And you need to know that not by asking Democrats, but look what the Trump campaign is doing. Former President Donald Trump was in Asheville on Wednesday. He is going back to North Carolina next week with J.D. Vance. But, we spent some time talking to voters, and that enthusiasm and excitement for Vice President Harris was clear. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He said he tried to confront the settlers as they came in. He described a scenario that they haven't witnessed in this particular village for a long time. And he said, never before, in fact, have they ever seen armed settlers coming in, firing live rounds, firing tear gas.And when we arrived in the town here a little earlier on in the day, we were witness to the funeral Cortes of Rashid Sadah, a 23-year-old young man who was shot dead by the settlers. There was a lot of anger in that Cortes, at the settlers, the Israeli government, a lot of pain being felt. This was a young man of the village. He was being carried at shoulder height, wrapped in a Palestinian flag. Young men carrying him, older men watching from the sides. And the funeral service in the graveyard, a little after, the oration there was absolutely powerful and very clear in its message that the people of this village don't feel safe, that they believe that the settlers were acting with the support of the Israeli government. They don't feel in this village protected by the IDF, the Israeli Defense Force. In fact, they allege that the Israeli Defense Force was protecting the settlers. Now, the IDF did stop a second attack overnight getting into this village. The IDF and the Israeli police are investigating the incident. So far, we've heard condemnation coming from the U.S. Ambassador Jack Lew, saying he is absolutely appalled by this, and these attacks must stop. The Defense Minister of Israel, Yoav Gallant, has put his condemnation out as well, calling it radical violence that does not, he said, does not stand up to the values of the state of Israel. Israel's Interior Minister has condemned it as well, calling it violent nationalist riots. Those were his words. So, the condemnation coming from Israeli officials, even from right- wing leaders like Itamar Ben-Gvir, although he did say that the Israeli Defense Force should do more to protect the settlers, and Israel is, from the stone throwers, who he calls terrorists in his -- in these villages, that's his allegation, and he -- but he did say that this is absolutely unacceptable. So, this is strong condemnation coming from Israeli officials, but it just doesn't cut through in these villages. People here don't feel safe. And I think irrespective of what they hear from the Israeli government, they will continue to believe that events like last night, the settlers coming in armed in the village when no one was expecting, killing a young man, injuring others, they think these are coordinated by the government. They're in cahoots together. This is deeply divisive, particularly at the time of these very sensitive talks in Doha about the future of Gaza are going on.

Several weeks ago, there were a pair of strikes that Israel is either publicly behind or is believed to have been behind. One was against a major figure in the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon, Fuad Shukr, he was killed in an airstrike in southern Beirut by Israel. The next day, there was an operation that took out the top political leader for Hamas in the Iranian capital. Israel did not admit that they carried that out, but it is widely believed that they did. And so, now we're in a situation where it is believed that Hezbollah and/or Iran could respond. Now, it's been several weeks. So, we've been waiting to see every single day whether this is going to happen.In the meantime, the U.S. has been assuring Israel that it will come to its defense. It is expected that the Brits and the French would also help in that defense, and the major reasons are, Rahel, not just because they want to protect Israel, but if there were major damage and a lot of deaths in Israel as a result of those strikes, we could expect the situation to really escalate and potentially spiral out of control. So, the U.S. and potentially with the Brits and the French are really trying to avoid that scenario.

All this to sort of bolster what their investigation is, which they're looking into, as far as public corruption and foreign influence.Now, as far as these subpoenas go, they're part of a broader ask, and a lot of these subpoenas will either go from something as simple as asking for more details as to who the mayor or somebody else in his staff has been dealing with, or something larger about like different events that they have been going to, or different things that have been coming, either in or out, or any connection that they have. And again, this is all part of the broader investigation that's being done to sort of identify what links are to either foreign influence or to turkey itself. Now, in response to this, the mayor has been very steadfast in what he said, saying this morning that he was going to turn over every document, and this has sort of been the party line of what the mayor and his office have said, that they followed the rules. They haven't done anything wrong, and no matter what they want, to make sure that they cooperate with the investigation wherever it goes. Rahel.",

You can see her leaving for North Carolina. This is just moments ago. And when she is in North Carolina, she is expected to share ideas on how to lower costs for middle class Americans, including a proposed federal ban on corporate price gouging. She will also discuss a plan to make housing more affordable, especially for first-time homebuyers. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, he was also in North Carolina this week, and while there, he attacked Harris for her economic record, and he attacked Harris for her laugh.With us now from Philadelphia is Michael Smerconish. He is the host of \"Smerconish\" and a CNN political commentator. Michael, always good to see you on a Friday. Let's start with the all-important state of North Carolina, the fact that she is even having this major event in this state, a state that Dems haven't won in a presidential election since 2008, what does that say to you in terms of how they view the race and their chances? MICHAEL SMERCONISH, CNN HOST, \"SMERCONISH\", &amp; CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Rahel, first of all, congratulations to you. I haven't seen you since the big day, and I'm thrilled for your success and your happiness.",

I feel like everybody, including around the globe now, knows these seven states that we keep talking about. Whether North Carolina is in play, is really of interest, because among the seven, it really ought to be most secure for Donald Trump at this stage, and if it's not, it's an indication of him having a problem.Everything has flipped in the last month. Rahel, a month ago, right now, Donald Trump was sitting in the balcony at the Republican Convention looking invincible. He had just survived an assassination attempt. He was leading in all the battleground states. President Biden was looking old and feeble, and there was a move afoot to encourage him to get out of the race, and it looked like Trump could do no wrong. And my God, here we are a month later. It's Vice President Kamala Harris. It is Trump who is behind, or just even in the battleground states, and the entire table has been turned. Who knows what the future holds. Convention next week. I assume that will be a good couple of days for her, and then we're really going to find out when we get to the debate.",

Donald Trump has never enjoyed majority support of the country. There has not been a poll in the age of Trump, a reliable poll that showed that he had an approval rating of 50 percent above. So, as you know, Rahel, we often say he has got a ceiling that's defined. It's 45 percent or it's 46 percent of the vote.Now, he was able to get elected in 2016 with those numbers, but there was a lot of third-party activity. And in this cycle, the third party candidates, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr, have just not been able to generate sustained support. There was a time when Kennedy looked like he might, but his numbers have really fallen. Trump needs a third- party candidate out there pulling some vote away, or his 45 percent or 46 percent, just do the math, is not going to be enough. And what I don't understand, to answer your question, is he nevertheless doesn't seem to be looking at this as a game of persuading. Instead, he views it as a game of motivating, motivation more important than persuading, everything targeted toward his base, instead of reaching people who might not like him, but might be willing to vote for him. And when he refers to her as a bum, when he refers to her as crazy or stupid, as a lunatic, it's like I can just hear the suburban neighbors of mine outside of Philadelphia going, click, click, click, that's not a guy they're going to be comfortable in voting for. SOLOMON: And what about when -- I want to show for you a press release that got a lot of attention yesterday. What about when it comes from the Harris-Walz side? So, this was a press release, obviously very cheeky, where the top you see for planning purposes reluctantly, that would normally say only, for planning purposes only, Donald Trump to ramble incoherently and spread dangerous lies in public, but at a different home.

Has she changed her position on that? Relative to the border, what did she or didn't she do pertaining to the responsibilities that were given to her by Joe Biden? Where does she stand on weed, on other criminal issues? There are a whole number of things that people are saying she has flip-flopped.
