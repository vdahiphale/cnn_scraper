You beautiful people, look at you voting. You've done it through mail or through early in-person voting and good for you. Right now, both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are closing out their campaigns with sharply contrasting messages, urging people to get out and vote. Trump urging his supporters to, quote, save the country. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Kamala, you're fired. Get the hell out. With your vote in this election, you can show them once and for all that this nation does not belong to them. This nation belongs to you.

It's also notable both of them are spending their final campaign day in Pennsylvania, the key battleground that could determine in who wins the presidency. Trump has also added stops in North Carolina and Michigan.In just a few moments, we're going to hear from Kamala Harris in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Let's go straight to our reporters on the campaign trail. CNN's Eva McKend is covering the Harris campaign in Allentown, where Harris is about to speak. CNN's Kristen Holmes is covering the Trump campaign as she's in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where Trump will hold his final event of the night after hitting North Carolina, and Pennsylvania first. Eva, to you. Harris spending her entire day in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, multiple stops, I think five stops in Pennsylvania today alone.

I just spoke to the Allentown mayor, and he says that this is all going to come down to the ground game and that they have a strong operation in Pennsylvania.You know, they started out in Scranton. They'll be here in Allentown shortly. Then they head on to Reading, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and as you well know, these are places with all very different cultures but places that they think that they can capture nonetheless. The vice president training her final argument on unity, not even mentioning the former president by name. I was struck by the comments that Governor Josh Shapiro just made on stage. He said that this election is not going to come down to differences on policy or a single bill issue that it is about the character and the soul of this nation. What you see the campaign doing in Allentown is trying to capture the affection of Puerto Rican voters, more than 30,000 of them in Allentown. Fat Joe is up on stage as we speak and they are trying to uh capitalize on that recent episode at Madison Square Garden. So the vice president trying to characterize herself as a new way forward, a difficult argument to make given that she is currently in the administration, but one that she is making nonetheless. And now, it is time for voters to decide if they believe her -- Jake.",

But then they will actually take action. And that's what you saw in January 6. Look, I've often said this if Itruly believed that the election had been stolen, I would have been there in a different capacity not as a congressman I would have been on the steps of the capital if I thought legitimately the election was being stolen. So when leaders say something, especially somebody with authority who people trust, it has an impact on stability of democracy. And that's where it's the reason I'm so much for Harris is because I think our democracy and the stability of that democracy is really the thing on the ballot and really so important at the same rally in Pennsylvania Trump also said this about the bulletproof glass behind which he was standing.

These are three that we could be in suspense for a while.Nevada for its part has to wait for every poll location in the state to close before it can even transmit results. If voters are still in line, when polls closed at 10:00 p.m., they have to stay open until every voter votes. Plus, Nevada will continue to accept and count mail-in ballots until Saturday as long as they are postmarked by Election Day. Arizona, two things to keep in mind here. One, they have a two-page ballot there and an official in Maricopa County tells me that could really slow things down. Two, they expect a large number of mail dropped off to polling places tomorrow, potentially hundreds of thousands. The envelopes have to be hand counted at the polling place before they are even processes and tabulated. So, until we're going to get the first release, in Maricopa around 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time, of early ballots, and then we'll find out election day votes overnight, and then the remaining early ballots will come in the following days. Pennsylvania, key battleground, the lynchpin in the 2020 election, it can start even processing the 1.7 million pre-election ballots until tomorrow morning, although officials there have put a lot of new technology and efforts in place, lots of lessons learned from 2020 to speed up the count, until we're going to get our first look at a big portion of mail-in ballots in key counties there right around 8:00 p.m. tomorrow night, Jake.",

A Georgia election official tells we can see about 70 percent of Georgia's totals by then. North Carolina has more than 4.4 million early in person votes cast.

County officials say that there were approximately 2,500 voter registration forms that seemed fishy and have been contained and segregated and those applications again registration forms, not -- not ballots themselves they're going through an extensive multi-step review process. So they're not ballots as Trump claimed voter registration forms. CNN just heard from county officials who say only 17 percent of the 2,500 voter registration applications that were segregated were in fact found to be fraudulent. So what more can you tell us about those applications who might be behind it and why there would be 17 percent of these that would be fraudulent.",

Everyone expects -- pretty much everyone expects Republicans to pick up that seat.Then you have Montana and Ohio. That's where Jon Tester, the incumbent senator in Montana. He's going to have to run significantly ahead to the topic of his ticket to hang on to his seat. Sherrod Brown, the Republican -- the Democrat running against Republican Bernie Moreno in Ohio, also in a very difficult race. He runs 6-8 points ahead of Kamala Harris in order to hang on to his seat. That could be a little tighter. And also in the blue wall states. We talk about a lot of the presidential blue wall. Well, there's a blue wall in the Senate as well. Wisconsin, where Tammy Baldwin, the incumbent Democratic senator against Republican businessman Eric Hovde, there are two other blue wall states. Of course, Pennsylvania, all three of those blue wall states, including Wisconsin, you see on your screen, all within the margin of error, Jake, but Republicans have so much opportunity to take back the Senate because they can pick up any of those seats, in addition to the West Virginia seat and they're the majority, and if Donald Trump wins, a 50/50 Senate means Republican majority.",
