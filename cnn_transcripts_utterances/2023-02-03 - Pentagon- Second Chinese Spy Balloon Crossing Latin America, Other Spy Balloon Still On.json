This does highlight what Pentagon has been saying that there have been several instances of these Chinese spy balloons over the past several years.

It's the size of three buses. It has all that surveillance equipment on board. It has those solar panels, so getting shot down from that height would mean a very wide debris field. All this metal clanging to Earth at very high speed, as one US official put it to our colleague Haley Britzky, this is not like \"Top Gun\" where it just explodes and doesn't go anywhere. It is large and it's metal, it would put hundreds of Americans at risk. So for now, Anderson, this floats on in the skies above the US. The Pentagon is saying that this could -- it could stay up there for several more days. Of course, it is subject to the winds, and so that could change with high winds.

We've had all of these cold fronts come through, and so the winds are very strong from north to south, currently. And so it does make sense if you overlay basically where it's traveled, you can track those winds all the way down.But over the next couple of days, the winds -- or the next 24 hours, I should say, the winds really do turn more West to East. So that would make you think that it would sort of drift in that direction. Now you have to take all of this with a little bit of a grain of salt, because winds can dramatically change speed with height, they can also change direction. So based just on the knowledge that we know right now, assuming that it is just drifting with the wind, you would expect for it to take more of a trajectory like this over the next 24 hours or so, and maybe come off the coast around the Carolinas or so or maybe Virginia, hard to tell, but this is what it would look like as of right now.",

The United States has to gather the information on that balloon, the equipment that was used and what its capability was.And frankly, I think Senator Tester is absolutely correct. He is approaching it the right way. Let's get some real answers here. When did the military first decide, this did not pose a threat, a military threat or a National Security threat? And then secondly, were we able to tap into, to hack into whatever technology is on board of that so- called aircraft? And were we able to take advantage and obscure what it was seeing? So I think there are a lot of issues to be raised here, but the most important thing, when people call to shoot it down, I would do that from a military point of view. But the first thing I would ask is the Intelligence Community, what information do you have about their capability? If you have a spy taking place, or someone who is a spy in this country that is about to leave, do you shoot him down? Or shoot that aircraft down? Or do you capture it? Bring it in? Interrogate it and find out what the facts are and what needs to be done to make sure it doesn't happen again?",

Massive differences between this and the satellite. A satellite doesn't have the potential to deliver weapons, a satellite can't necessarily do other things, some of the electronic gathering, some of the sniffing for nuclear materials, for instance, which is interesting as it goes over Montana. So yes, I fully think that the military has to respond to this. I hope that the decision to not shoot it down was only because of concern of potential collateral damage. Because first off, you're over Montana, it's pretty sparsely populated area. So you have to wait, what is the National Security risk to this? And the last thing I'm very concerned about, is that this isn't the first or this isn't the last time because if this balloon is allowed to float free, basically, how many more balloons can China watch?

REP. DARIN LAHOOD (R-IL): You look at China's track record of being deceitful, not being honest, playing by a different set of rules. I have real concerns. SCIUTTO (voice over): In 2017, a plan for China to build an ornate $100 million Chinese Garden at the National Arboretum in Washington, DC, complete with temples and a pagoda was scrapped after counterintelligence officials raised red flags. The pagoda, they said would have been strategically placed on one of the highest points in Washington, DC, just two miles from the US Capitol, a perfect spot for signals Intelligence collection. China also wanted to use materials shipped to the US in diplomatic containers,, which Customs officials are banned from examining. ROBERT O'BRIEN, FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER TO PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And we want to continue to work with the Brits and we may have to go if they're going to have Huawei in their system, we'll go to carrier pigeons or these US carriers with locked briefcases or something we have to, but we're not going to let the Chinese have access -- unfettered access to our state secrets, so that's for sure. SCIUTTO (voice over): Concern also rose in 2019 over cellular towers with Chinese made Huawei hardware atop them near military bases in the Midwest, and in the same area in Montana where their surveillance balloon was spotted over a military base that houses intercontinental ballistic missiles. Huawei is a company that has drawn intense scrutiny from the US government for its ties to the Chinese government, but the company has strongly denied any efforts to spy on the US and said in a statement to CNN, that its equipment is not capable of operating in any communication spectrum allocated to the Defense Department. And in North Dakota, near Grand Forks Air Force Base, a plan for a Chinese company to build a corn mill was halted just days ago, because of security concerns.",

He spoke about the brutal tactics that they used, throwing wave after wave of soldiers into a hail of fire, all to secure small amounts of ground at a time. We should note the head of Wagner responded to that interview. He said Wagner was a, quote, exemplary military organization that complies with all the necessary laws and rules of modern war. Many reports say otherwise. Tonight, CNN's Fred Pleitgen has more on Wagner's role in the war. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): Ukrainian reinforcements on the move around the embattled city Bakhmut. While the Russians have made gains here recently, Kyiv is now sending in some of its toughest combatants. Ukraine's President vowing stiff resistance. We consider Bakhmut our fortress, he says. We consider our soldiers who have fallen here heroes. If we get accelerated weapons, especially long-range, we will not only gain ground around Bakhmut, but we will also begin to de-occupy Donbas. Russia's gains here have come mostly thanks to this man. Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the brutal Wagner private military company, now showing off his group's ever heavier weapons. Wagner has long styled itself as Vladimir Putin's most effective fighting force, often using convicts recruited straight from Russian jails for near suicidal assaults on Ukrainian positions. The U.S. and Ukraine say Wagner troopers who refuse are often shot on the spot, acclaim Wagner has not denied. After taking a small village north of Bakhmut, these fighters even brag about the appalling conditions. The guys swam across the river, he says, their hands and feet froze, some lost their limbs, but they went ahead and did not ask for evacuation. While visiting a new Wagner training center in an occupied part of Ukraine, Prigozhin admitted he wants more fighters. Ruthless, brutal and expendable. Here, they finish their training, he said. First, they make them into baby eagles, and here they become cannibals. But those so-called cannibals appear to be dying by the thousands. This drone footage given to us by Ukrainian forces purports to show scores of Wagner fighters littering the hills around Bakhmut. The drone commander tells me Wagner's assault tactics are extremely wasteful. They mix in prisoners with no combat experience and send them as cannon fodder to exhaust our fighters, he says. Then they send their own special forces to attack our flanks. While Ukrainian troops are on the backfoot in Bakhmut, Wagner's attrition rate might be so high, they can't even find enough convicts to use as cannon fodder, says Olga Romanova of the civil rights group Russia Behind Bars, that keeps in touch with those sent to Ukraine by Wagner. 77 percent is the number of combat and non-combat Wagner losses in the current campaign, she says. That includes killed, wounded, deserted and captured. And though, Ukrainian troops say they themselves are losing too many soldiers, they vow to outlast Russia's mercenaries dying in their thousands on the Eastern front. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

But once again, the jury was kept from hearing about possible financial crimes the prosecutors point to as a motive. Now, as you know, Murdaugh is a disgraced former South Carolina lawyer charged in the shooting deaths of his wife and son back in 2021.Today, a son of the Murdaugh family's late housekeeper testified away from the jury that Murdaugh hid more than $4 million in insured settlement money from her family after her death, stealing it. The housekeeper died a few weeks after an alleged fall at the Murdaugh's home in 2018. But our Randi Kaye shows us what the jury did hear today that prosecutors hope will rule out anyone other than Alex Murdaugh as the killer. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
