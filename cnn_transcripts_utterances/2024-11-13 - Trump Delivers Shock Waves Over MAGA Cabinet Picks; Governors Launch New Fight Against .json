      "sentences": "You know what occurred to me tonight? That we may be seeing the cabinet edition of -- what do you call it? Donald Trump's weave. Starts off with traditional picks, Rubio for state, people follow along, then all of a sudden, it's a former veteran and Fox News host for DOD. And the squinting begins.But then he's off to the attorney general. And this one, this one has even members of his own party struggling to follow along. He has tapped Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz to be his next attorney general. Process that. Now, we know Trump has promised retribution, hasn't he? And this pick, well, it certainly shows that he wants to deliver some aspect of it. Gaetz is a MAGA loyalist through and through, and he is no stranger to this department, but he has now been tapped to run. The DOJ, if you remember, investigated him for three years over alleged sex crimes. It ultimately chose not to pursue charges against him, but that didn't save him from an ethics probe in Congress. That, of course, was ongoing until today, ending when Gaetz resigned to prepare for his A.G. confirmation battle, and it likely will be a battle even though he has denied any wrongdoing on that front. The announcement, actually, it came as a surprise to many, one that some could not suppress. At the DOJ -- quote -- \"the shock is intense.\" At the U.S. attorney's office here in D.C., where I was a prosecutor, absolute disbelief. In the room where House Republicans were meeting for their leadership elections, there was an audible gasp. In the halls of the Capitol, Republican senators totally blindsided. Susan Collins saying that she was shocked. But here's the thing. The blindsided senators might want to revisit this once the initial shock wears off because how big of a surprise is this, really? I mean, what is the Trump rubric? Is he a 100% loyal? Check. Does he hate the DOJ? Check. Is he good on T.V.? Well, Trump would say check. And does he sound like Donald Trump? Check. See for yourself. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): We try to convince ourselves that the Department of Justice is different, that they're somehow exempt from the rules of Washington that say, help my friends and punish my enemies. They aren't. They're probably the worst. January 6 last year wasn't an insurrection. No one has been charged with insurrection. No one has been charged with treason. But it very well may have been a Fed-surrection. I think that the FBI has morphed into a political opposition research organization and a political activism organization more than a law enforcement organization. Listen, I believe that Donald Trump won the 2020 election. Our America is not for the illegal aliens who leave our nation poorer, dirtier, and less safe. (APPLAUSE) They have made a mockery of our laws and illegal aliens have destroyed some of the most critical monarch butterfly habitat in the world. These people are odious on the inside and out. They're like 5'2\", 350 pounds, and they're like, give me my abortions or I'll get up and march and protest. And I'm thinking, march? You look like you got ankles weaker than the legal reasoning behind Roe versus Wade. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

First of all, you know, let me just say I thank you for your service, and I think that when you sign up to do something like work at the DOJ, it really is just that, like, you guys aren't paid a ton of money, you can go out and make so much more money in private practice, and it's really about standing up for the United States. And so, the idea that you're going to have someone that is charged with going into court on behalf of the government, someone who has historically been trying to tear it apart from the inside, remember, this is the guy that made sure to kick out our first speaker. You know, this is a guy that I don't know if he has ever really practiced law. I had to Google to find out if he even had a law degree because I was, like, wait a minute, what are we doing? But more importantly, this is someone who has been under investigation with the DOJ. This is someone who decided that he was going to resign today because on Friday, our ethics committee was going to vote on whether or not to release this report and potentially proceed just like they proceeded against George Santos.

So why would his appointments be qualified? These are people that have railed against diversity, equity, inclusion, trying to say that diverse candidates are somehow not qualified. But the reality is that what they want to do is more of this, is put people that are not qualified in and say, well, you know what, because he's my homeboy, he is qualified. That's not enough.
