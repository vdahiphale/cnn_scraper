Tonight on LAURA COATES LIVE.Well, a judge in New York City today hitting Donald Trump where he lives. I mean, in the wallet. Now, even for a man who claims to be a billionaire, whether or not the math is mathing, this has got to hurt. Former president and his companies are ordered to pay nearly $355 million. Just process that amount, if you will. It was a crushing defeat in a civil fraud trial. But let's actually do the math for a second, okay? Get out your pens and papers. No calculators right now on your iPhones. Three hundred and fifty-five million dollars in that case, plus 83 million, 83 million to E. Jean Carroll -- okay, fine, I had a calculator, but it equals $438 million dollars. Four hundred and thirty-eight million dollars was an order to pay just in 2024. It's only February.

He was making -- he made $51 million that year from being on \"The Apprentice\" and from endorsement deals, celebrity cash.And that money, he used to fill in holes in businesses that he ran that were losing money. As that money diminished, he really started going kind of cash negative. In fact, the attorney general found that in 2017, if he hadn't -- have had this low interest loan that he got through fraud, he would have been cash negative by more than $10 million. He would have had no money at all. And the last couple of years, he has shrunk some by selling some assets off that has generated some cash. Last year, he said he had about $400 million. We know that's true (ph). But any point in time when Donald Trump says he has money, generally, the next month, it's lower because, again, he has many businesses that require constant infusions of cash to stay afloat. So, whatever it was a year ago, it's not that much now. This is now $355 million, as you said, probably another $90 million in interest, and the E. Jean Carroll case is another $83 million. He does not have that kind of cash. And to deal with that, he would most likely have to sell assets off, and that's going to be very difficult because of the sort of structure of his businesses. He has a few businesses that do well. It helps support some of the other ones. It would make sense to sell the ones that are doing well.
