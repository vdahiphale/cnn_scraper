In New York, sensational testimony against Donald Trump just wrapped up for the day, focusing for the first time on the hush money deal with adult film star Stormy Daniels that's central to the case.And here in Washington Trump's historic bid for criminal immunity has played out before the nation's highest court and the justices offered some clues about how they may rule. For the next hour, we'll take you inside both of Trump's high-stakes court cases. Our reporters and experts are standing by to break down all of today's most important developments and look ahead to what's next. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer with a special report in THE SITUATION ROOM, the Trump Trial Today. We begin with all the breaking news on the Trump hush money criminal trial. The defense cross-examination of key witness David Pecker is expected to resume tomorrow after the former National Enquirer publisher addressed some very salacious topics in his testimony today. CNN's Brynn Gingras is outside the courthouse in New York for us. Brynn, the testimony is getting closer and closer to the heart of the case against Trump.",

Defense attorneys really started their cross examination of Pecker going after those catch and kill stories, getting him to admit that buying and burying stories about a lot of celebrities was actually just common practice, that they did it quite often, it was part of their business model and that, in fact, they had been doing it for Donald Trump even 17 years before the 2016 election.This is after the prosecution spent more than six hours over the last couple of days questioning Pecker about the inner workings of those catch and kill stories and how many of them benefited Trump. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GINGRAS (voice over):  Cross-examination of David Pecker got underway in the criminal case against Donald Trump. 17 years of providing President Trump with a heads up about potentially negative publicity? Yes, the former publisher of the National Enquirer testified. Trump's lawyers trying to show that catch and kill schemes, buying negative stories to make them disappear, was not uncommon. We didn't want the story to embarrass Mr. Trump or embarrass or hurt the campaign. One such scheme at the crux of the D.A's case against Trump, Stormy Daniels. Months before the 2016 election, the adult film star and director tried to sell her story of a sexual relationship with Trump to the Enquirer for $120, 000, but Pecker testified he wouldn't buy it. Pecker said he later learned Trump's then-attorney and fixer Michael Cohen paid Daniels out of his own funds. At one point, Pecker testified Trump called him, saying Daniels violated the agreement and owed him $24 million for doing this interview.",

Will they view the Manhattan case that way? Maybe not because it's a Democratic prosecutor. Trump has been very successful with a lot of help from his allies of saying, you know, that one's more political. So, it helps Trump if he can keep these bigger cases. This is about stealing the country. This is about overturning a Democratic election. If he can keep that from happening before the election, it certainly helps him. I'm fascinated by where the court ends up because it was interesting to hear Justice Alito and Justice Gorsuch saying, let's not really talk about Trump, let's talk about the future. Well, the allegations against Trump are pretty consequential that he essentially tried to stage coup, he tried to stay in power, tried to block the Congress from certifying Joe Biden's win. But beyond that, I was struck by Justice Coney Barrett's. You're always looking for the maverick, right? This is a 6-3 conservative majority. So, you're looking for somebody who's going to tip the balance. And her questions, to Elliot's point, sounded like she wants to send it back down, which will help Donald Trump with the delay. But it also sounded like she was very clear that, to me, a lot of this actually should be settled in a trial. That's why we have trials.

Americans compared to last August are more likely to say across all four of Donald Trump's criminal trials here that if the charges are true, it's irrelevant to his fitness for office.And take a look where that is most acute. It's in the hush money payment trial. So, back in August, it was 39 percent of Americans in our poll that said, indeed, if these charges are true, for which he's on trial for in New York, that it would be irrelevant to Donald Trump's fitness for office. That's grown. Now, 45 percent say it's irrelevant. And what you see is across efforts to overturn the 2020 election, across the classified documents case, across the January 6th attack on the Capitol, you see growth for the position that these charges, if true, are irrelevant to his fitness for office. That's welcome news for the Trump campaign. There's no doubt about that. Now, this issue of the gag order in this hush money trial, 42 percent of Americans in our poll, the plurality, say Trump's behavior during this trial, Wolf, is inappropriate. It has been mostly inappropriate. Only a quarter say it's been appropriate. About a third say they have no opinion. Obviously, you'd imagine there's a big partisan split behind these numbers, Wolf.",

Now, I just want to note this 24 percent, about eight in ten of them say they would never considering voting for Joe Biden. So, just reconsidering support for Trump doesn't necessarily mean that's a vote for Joe Biden. But we wanted to dig in and find out what is behind this 24 percent. What does this group of perhaps softer Trump supporters, what does it look like? And so we broke it down here demographically. And I just want to show you here, Wolf. This side here is among those, the 24 percent that would reconsider among Trump supporters if indeed he was convicted of a crime. Nearly two thirds of them are younger. They're under the age of 50. Half of them are people of color. 63 percent, nearly two thirds, believe Biden legitimately won the election, not election deniers, half or political independents or moderates. This is not what you call the Trump base. And that's why they are in the reconsider category. They are softer Trump supporters. Compare that to the three quarters of Trump supporters in this poll who say they're staying with them no matter what. That looks like the Trump coalition, you know, which is that they're older, they're whiter. Only 22 percent of them think Biden legitimately won the 2020 election. So, this coalition is really interesting to look at what that is, that quarter of Trump support that might reconsider if he is convicted, Wolf.",

And I think that you will see that as a theme.But to your point about that picture, there's documentation that backs up what the story that Pecker is telling. There were a lot of references to text messages, to emails. And so the fact that Pecker -- and those are supposed to speak to Pecker's credibility, the fact that Pecker is saying that he, you know, had this conversation with Trump, where Trump was knowledgeable enough about Karen McDougal to ask, you know, how is she doing, I think, could end up being significant. They also elicited the prosecutor's, Wolf, from, from David Pecker, an answer about essentially his motivations, where it was, you know, do you have animus for Trump? And David Pecker's answer was he was my mentor. I'm paraphrasing, but it, he used the word mentor. And he was, you know, doing sort of in sorrow as opposed to in anger. It's notable because the defense lawyers in their opening statements suggested Michael Cohen, who is a key witness in this case, is acting out of personal grievance and they're trying to show that actually the facts that is going to be the same across the board. Now, we will see what Trump's defense lawyers do in terms of trying to question credibility, but today was uncomfortable testimony.",
