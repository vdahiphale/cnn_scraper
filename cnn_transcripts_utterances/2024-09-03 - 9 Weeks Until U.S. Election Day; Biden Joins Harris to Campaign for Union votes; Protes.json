Now, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is facing mountingpressure to secure a ceasefire deal after the killing of six hostages in Gaza. On Monday, Israel saw a general strike and a second straight day of major protests across the country, all fueled by anger over those deaths and the failure to bring the remaining hostages home. Despite the pressure, Netanyahu says he won't make any concessions and is vowing to exact a heavy price on Hamas. Netanyahu is also facing criticism from Israel's closest ally, with U.S. President Joe Biden flatly saying the Israeli leader has not done enough to secure the hostages' release. On Monday, Mr. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris huddled with U.S. officials who have been working to secure a deal. The U.S. president says he's close to presenting a final deal to negotiators. And the cousin of Carmel Gat, one of the six hostages killed in Gaza, says he blames Benjamin Netanyahu for their deaths because the prime minister's delay in reaching a deal. Gat was staying at her parents' home when she was kidnapped during the October 7th attacks. She was one of three hostages who were expected to be released in a potential ceasefire agreement.

The husband and another child, a 13-year- old daughter, are now in hospital with serious wounds. Just a reminder of the families, the people who are really stuck in the crosshairs of this conflict. And as Ukraine tries to hit back at this uptick in Russian bombardment, it's really been an uptick since the invasion of Kursk a few weeks after that. That's really when Russian forces started barreling through with these drones, missiles, ballistic missiles, near daily towards Ukrainian cities and towns. Ukraine's foreign minister is saying, we're fighting with our hands tied behind our back. And he is saying that because Ukrainians are pleading with the White House to lift restrictions on the use of long- range missiles. They want to be able to strike deep in the heart of Russia to hit these sites before they fire that barrage of missiles and drones to be on the offense here with Russia. However, the White House is simply not convinced. There was a meeting last week in which Ukrainian officials provided a target list. President Biden's administration believes that very high-value assets have probably been moved too far to be hit by those long-range missiles. In the meanwhile, you also have what's happening in the Donbas, where Ukrainian troops are outmanned and outgunned. That makes that Kursk offensive look less and less like a shimmering prize if it means that Russian forces still continue to barrel on through towards Pokrovsk, because even President Zelenskyy has admitted that was the goal of entering Kursk, to divert Russian forces away.
