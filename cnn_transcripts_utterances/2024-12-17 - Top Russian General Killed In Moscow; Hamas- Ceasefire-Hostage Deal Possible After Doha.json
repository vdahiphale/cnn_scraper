Jill is an adjunct Professor at Georgetown University's Centerfor Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies. She's also a former CNN Moscow bureau chief. Jill, great to see you. Great to have you on the show. Let me just pick up then where Fred Pleitgen has clearly laid out all the facts for us. This is clearly an ambitious attack as we showed our viewers about just at the top of the show, very close to the Kremlin. And now, we understand from a source telling CNN that Ukraine's security services were behind the General's assassination. How will this, do you think play out in Moscow? Fred was talking how furious they were. JILL DOUGHERTY, ADJUNCT PROFESSOR, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY'S CENTER FOR EURASIAN, RUSSIAN &amp; EAST EUROPEAN STUDIES: They are. So, the person who most quickly came to the fore is a former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. And he said, you know, we have to destroy -- was the word that he used, the people who ordered this attack, who are in Kyiv. And he also said it's not only military, but it's political leadership. So, you can bet that they are going to try to do something, unclear exactly what, but it seems very personal. So, you know, it could be the same thing that they've been doing for quite a while. Attacks on infrastructure, et cetera or it could be something else, but it is, I think, particularly galling for the Russians because not only did the Ukrainians, we believe killed this General, but they did it, you know, in Moscow.",

Thank you, Jill, good to see you. Now, Israel is solidifying its grip on a strategic mountain top inside Syria that it seized after the fall of Bashar al-Assad. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Mount Hermon today, we can see that, which lies within a buffer zone. He was joined by Israel's Defense Minister, who says Israeli troops have been instructed to build fortifications and defenses there in case of a, quote, \"prolonged stay\". Meantime, hopes are growing that after more than a year of war in Gaza, a ceasefire could be closer than ever. Hamas' positive as well as optimistic discussions are underway in Doha, that could lead to a ceasefire as well as hostage agreement. But it says Israel continues to impose new conditions, an Israeli source tells CNN, a deal is still potentially weeks away. While a White House spokesman says the U.S. is cautiously optimistic about the chances for a ceasefire, stressing we've been here before, but never got over the finish line. Our Jeremy Diamond is in Jerusalem with the very latest for you. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, Hamas now becomes the latest party to these negotiations to express some optimism about the prospects of reaching a ceasefire and hostage release deal. We have heard optimistic comments over the course of the last week from U.S., Israeli, Qatari and Egyptian officials, and now Hamas is joining the fray. But as with the others who are expressing optimism, Hamas is also adding a note of caution to their comments. In their statement, they are making clear that, quote, \"Hamas affirms that in light of the serious and positive discussions taking place in Doha today under the auspices of our Qatari and Egyptian brothers, reaching an agreement for a ceasefire and prisoner exchange is possible if the occupation stops imposing new conditions.\" And that if is indeed that note of caution that they are raising, suggesting that Israeli negotiators are making additional demands as this negotiating process moves forward. A second Hamas source said that they view the current state of negotiations as quote, \"positive and optimistic\". And it is important to note that amid this optimism, we are also seeing a flurry of diplomatic activity in the region. The U.S. National Security adviser, Jake Sullivan, just last week traveled to Israel, Egypt and Qatar to try and advance a deal. He said he hopes that he can put the conditions in place to reach a deal within the next month. And that is indeed the target here, appears to be to try and reach a deal before President Biden leaves office on January 20th, and President-elect Trump will then be inaugurated. And we know, of course, that the Biden administration has also been closely coordinating with the Trump administration over this deal as incoming Trump advisors have also been traveling to the region and coordinating closely with the officials who they will soon be replacing. It is important to caution, though, that as we are seeing this momentum, as we are seeing this optimistic language, the reason why we are also hearing notes of caution from all of the parties involved is because we have been this close in the past. We have been very close to a deal and ultimately talks have collapsed, and that possibility still very much looms. But Israeli and American officials who I've spoken to have pointed to a new set of conditions in the region in terms of Hamas being increasingly isolated, Israel having accomplished a slew of military achievements in Gaza, including the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, that might make them more willing to reach a deal now. All of this pointing us in the direction of a potential ceasefire and hostage deal. But again, the deal isn't reached until it's done. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
