Former President Donald Trump has just left court in Florida, his first courtroom appearance since officially clinching the Republican presidential nomination. He was there witnessing his attorneys' effort to get the charges dismissed in his classified documents case. That is his alleged mishandling of classified documents. Meanwhile, in Fulton County, Georgia, we expect a ruling by end of day tomorrow at the latest on whether D.A. Fani Willis will be disqualified from prosecuting Trump in the election subversion case there. Following it all is CNN's Evan Perez. Evan, let's begin on the hearing that Trump attended today in Florida. The judge there had some tough questions it seemed for both sides.",

Look, one of the first things she tackled was this idea that the Trump team is trying to do, is asking her to do, which is to essentially invalidate the law that governs all of this. And she said that it would be an extraordinary step to essentially invalidate the law or two into to dismiss this indictment. I'll read you just a part of this exchange as she had with one of the Trump's lawyers.Judge Cannon says, you understand, of course, that finding a statue unconstitutionally vague is an extraordinary step. Emil Bove, one of the Trump lawyers says, I understand. I understand that is significant, but it is warranted here. That's one of the parts of this argument that went on pretty much all day. And one of the things that the Trump team is asking for was essentially saying that the Presidential Records Act is vague in the way it governs the handling of classified material. The government, of course, says it's not vague at all. And that Trump understood that the documents he was holding onto, including when he was sharing it, and sharing some of that information with -- with writers that he met with at Bedminster, his golf club in New Jersey, that he understood those documents were national security secrets. They were things having to do with nuclear -- nuclear weapons and the capabilities of the United States in case it ever came under attack. Those are the kinds of sensitive documents that are at play here. And the government says, Trump understood that because he even made reference to that in that infamous tape where he says, I can't share this with you because it's still classified. So that is where they ran into some trouble there with the judge. She said in the end, that some of the arguments that the Trump team is making should be more appropriate for them to present to a jury and for a jury to decide whether Trump understood what these documents are about.",

There were 15 boxes return voluntarily.

And then Clinton interceded directly during the 1996 selections with none other than Benjamin Netanyahu was running again, Shimon Peres. In that case, it may have backfired because Netanyahu became prime minister. That's his first bite at the so-called prime ministerial apple. So it is certainly not impressive. I will say though it is remarkable, stunning to me, that it my 27 years of being in government and studying the issue for another 30, I don't think there is an example, certainly have the Senate majority leader calling for the defeat, not just new elections, the defeat of the current prime minister of Israel and inviting the administration to basically exercise its leverage as long as -- I think that's exactly the word Schumer used -- as long as this government remains in power.

We all thought, Jim, that were going to go to trial like in matter of days, weeks, right, as be very soon, they're coming up. Now, at least 30-day delay, could be more.

It's his first visit to the state. It's more than 100,000 voters cast uncommitted ballots and the Democratic primary to protest the president's policy as it relates to the Israel-Gaza war. Vice President Kamala Harris, she is a neighboring Minnesota for her -- to her focus on the issue of reproductive rights. She made history today as the first sitting VP to visit an abortion provider, touring a Planned Parenthood office in St. Paul, though, we should note, Planned Parenthood also provides a number of health services. CNN's Kevin Liptak is traveling with the president. He joins me now. Kevin, president hitting swing states all over the country since the State of the Union a week ago.

He will really need to gather as much support as he can muster in every other area if he is to win this very essential battleground state.And Saginaw County is so important. It's one of the rare true bellwethers. It went for -- it voted for the winner of the last four presidential elections and they're only 25 counties in the entire country that can say that. And so we did see President Biden today talking to his supporters, really trying to oversee the build-out of his campaign infrastructure. And that has been kind of a theme for him as he has hit five battleground states since he delivered that State of the Union Address a week ago today. And the campaign says that they're hiring 300 staffers this month. They're opening 100 offices, Jim. And I think it's important when we talk to voters here in Saginaw, one of the things they say is they're very focused on the economy, but a lot of them say that they just haven't started tuning into this election yet, and they will start tuning in, coming up, but they really aren't paying that much attention I have to say.
