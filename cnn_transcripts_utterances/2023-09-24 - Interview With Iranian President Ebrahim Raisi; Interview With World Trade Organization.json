I'm Fareed Zakaria coming to you from New York City.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ZAKARIA (voice-over): Today on the program, world leaders made their annual journey to New York City this week for the U.N. General Assembly. Among them Iran's president, Ebrahim Raisi. After his fiery speech, he sat down with me for an exclusive interview. I asked him about his country's nuclear program, its place in a Middle East deeply changed by the Abraham Accord, and about women's rights in Iran after the death of Mahsa Amini. And the protests that followed. (On-camera): All these hundreds of millions, maybe over a billion Muslims, wrong? And only the Islamic Republic of Iran is right? (Voice-over): Then open trade has been one of the great engines of progress in the world, lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. Is it now moving in reverse? And is America to blame? I'll talk to the head of the World Trade Organization, Ngozi Okonjo- Iweala, who says the world needs a new vision for globalization. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

They have believed it is an infringement on their rights.RAISI (through translator): But the fundamental issue that today in the Islamic Republic, hijab is a law. And when an issue becomes part of the law, then everyone must adhere to the laws. So it is the same the world over. And now that with regard to adherence to the laws, in reality the Americans and certain European countries are only seeking to cause a bipolar situation in our society. So they conduct their work in this fashion, always. They thought Iran is one of those societies in which they can create two different opposing polls in which women's and the gender issues become against -- set against hijab. But rest assured that through the use of these tools they will not succeed. The people of Iran are enlightened, are people of faith, are spiritual people, and they deeply understand that the United States of America and three European countries don't care about their rights, their hijab. But a life of respect for women has existed for hundreds and hundreds of years in Iran. It's not a development that we have observed in the past few decades. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley said earlier this year that Tehran could have fissile material for a bomb in less than two weeks and a nuclear weapon just a few months later.Last weekend the IAEA said Iran has decided to bar several of its inspectors. Tehran has now removed the technical term as D designated about one-third of the agency's most experienced inspectors who were working in Iran. The IAEA director condemned the act and said it severely affects the agency's ability to do its work. He asked Tehran to reconsider. Here's more of my interview with President Raisi.

And the IAEA says this will cripple its ability to do thein- inspections. The IAEA does say there are many unanswered questions, and I want to raise them because those are the very questions that these three countries ask that you referred to and the question is essentially around two sites which were never declared by Iran as nuclear sites.And yet the IAEA believes that they have traced of uranium there. Why would you not answer that question? Were those sites part of a uranium enrichment facility and if so why were they never declared? RAISI (through translator): All of the questions have been answered. Whether there were questions that were in any given specific time frame or those that are generally post each time when we responded to these questions, we did so officially, in official meetings with IAEA officials, and they were clarified. Any unanswered questions or ambiguities were clarified. So the misunderstanding that or lack of good will that exists, they're not founded in reality. They are simply allegations.",

But let me ask you one that is very simple. Iran is the only country that does -- that has only a civilian program as you claim it is, that enriches to the level you enrich, to 60 percent and higher. Why are you enriching to these high numbers? Doesn't that raise people's suspicions?RAISI (through translator): You see, this action of the Islamic Republic of Iran against the breaking of commitments and the three European countries vis-a-vis the reached accord, in the beginning we're not seeking 60 percent levels of enrichment. They trampled upon their commitments according to multiple IAEA certifications. What the Islamic Republic of Iran did was in response to a breaking of commitment of the signatories to the agreement and it was officially announced that the action that we intend to take is not intended to reach nuclear weapons of any type or a military dimension of any type. But it is a response for the lack of commitment demonstrated by the Europeans. And should they at any time return to a fulfillment of their commitments, rest assured and have no doubt that the Islamic Republic as it has done in the past will fully adhere to her commitments.

That interdependence would be the way to go, not overdependence, but interdependence would bring peace and prosperity to the world. And that developing countries should maintain these open markets.",

I think that given what we're seeing with climate change, the unpredictability of what is happening, concentrating production, either at home or with a few friends, may not build the resilience you want. Let us deconcentrate those and diversify supply chains to countries. Those who are not part of globalization in the first round, but who are ready to receive investment, and many of these are developing countries. It is -- Vietnam is good. Indonesia is good.

And in critical sectors really need to look at this. Rare earths are minerals. We now can look and say where else in the world can we develop this supply chain? In Africa, for instance, there is a golden opportunity to really diversify and develop the supply chain of these rare earth minerals there. Process them in place. Create jobs for young people at the same time as you help manage the decarbonization of the world. It is a like a win-win.",

And if the U.S. turns toward protectionism and industrial policy, I think, everyone else will just follow suit, right? They'll copycat?OKONJO-IWEALA: Well, that will happen. Once one nation starts to subsidize, whether it is U.S., E.U., China others will want to do that. But that's why we are saying that a subsidy race to the bottom is not the right way to go. I do want to say that, you know, what we've been hearing from the U.S. at the WTO is increasingly very supportive and we hope we can push in that direction. I think there is a realization that this system we have, if we allow it to fragment, if we become too protectionist, we might lose it and that is not what we want to do.

And they are going right into Chinese air space and flying kind of solo over a Chinese gas rig that they smash all the windows, sailors are falling into the sea.
