Health officials and aid agencies say patient staff and thousands of displaced civilians are trapped inside Gaza's biggest hospital, Al-Shifa, due to fighting nearby. CNN's Nada Bashir has more on the desperate situation in Gaza hospitals and a warning some of the video you're about to see is graphic. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER (voice-over): These are the sounds of the final gasp from Gaza's collapsing healthcare system. Medical staff in Gaza City, working under near relentless Israeli bombardment for over a month. But now this chorus of frantic voices, seen here working under torchlight, tells its own gut-wrenching story. The El-Quds Hospital, the second largest in Gaza, has now collapsed. The hospital no longer operational, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society. But these scenes are all too familiar across the besieged Gaza Strip, the vast majority of hospitals here are already completely out of service. The Palestinian Health Ministry in Ramallah says, and those remaining now on a cliff edge. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): There is a direct injury in the head internal bleeding. And we can't do surgeries. No surgeries, no oxygen, no electricity. We work manually. We are using a manual resuscitator. It is a clear injury, it needs an urgent surgery, a life saving one. He is less than a year old. BASHIR (voice-over): Remarkably, this baby survived, but his father, who was in the very same building when an Israeli airstrike hit, did not. At Gaza's largest hospital, Al-Shifa, officials say newborn babies had to be moved, and that at least three babies in the neonatal unit died after a generator powered incubators was damaged in an Israeli strike. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment. The IDF regularly says it is targeting Hamas, but doctors here say the hospital is now completely surrounded.",

      "sentences": "So Max, there are disputed accounts about what's actually happening at Al-Shifa. The Hamas controlled health ministry said over the weekend that staff and patients were unable to actually evacuate from the hospital because of the ongoing fighting and that it was under complete siege, in their words.Now as now the IDF says it has opened an evacuation corridor. It did so over the weekend specifically to get people out of that hospital. A specific route, taking them to the main route, heading to the south. It's unclear at this point how many people actually use that. What the situation was on that route. But look, there is still fighting going on in this area. The IDF said this morning that the battle, as the intense battle as they called it, is taking place in the surrounding areas of Al-Shifa, not at the hospital itself. But it is really hard to get even to the latest information on this. The health ministry, the Palestinian Health Ministry in Ramallah said over the weekend, they were unable to update their casualty numbers because they could not reach people at these hospitals in northern Gaza. We heard something similar from the World Health Organization, who said it's lost communications with its contacts at Al-Shifa. So I think that that really gives you a sense of the situation in there, but I think it's very clear, certainly from the report coming out, that this situation with the health system in Gaza, which has been building for multiple weeks now, is really coming to a head and it is really ramping up the pressure on Israel.",

And the French President has sent a floating hospital ship. I've asked the Emirates to send a field hospital. They have. And other countries have done the same. I expect the U.N. to build this. So there's no reason why we just can't take the patients out of there, instead of letting Hamas use it as a command Center for terrorism, for the rockets that they fire against Israel, for the terror tunnels that they use to kill Israeli civilians.We're obviously treading carefully when it comes to hospitals. But we're also not going to give immunity to the terrorists. And so far, even though Hamas has tried to prevent the civilians from leaving, hundreds of thousands have left, sometimes having to go through Hamas gun points and gun fire that wants to keep them in harm's way.

This is an information war and one particular case in point, Israel said that over the weekend its forces hand delivered fuel in jerrycans. They published video, they say that shows this of its soldiers delivering fuel to the Al-Shifa, for hospital. And they then claimed and published an audio recording they say proves this, that Hamas prevented the fuel from getting where it needed to go.Now the director of the Al-Shifa hospital told CNN that, yes, the offer was made, but it was only enough fuel for 30 minutes of running those generators and that his staff were too scared to go out because of the Israeli tanks in the area. So you can see that while the situation is clearly at breaking point in that hospital, the World Health Organization says it's no longer functioning as a hospital. What's happening around it is still quite unclear.",

Population Fund, UNICEF and the World Health Organization issued a joint statement on Sunday saying patients, healthcare workers and refugees alike need to be protected. The World Health Organization has recorded at least 137 attacks on health facilities in Gaza, killing more than 500 people. Their statement reads in part: The world cannot stand silent whilst hospitals, which should be safe havens, are transformed into scenes of death, devastation and despair. Decisive international action is needed now to secure an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and prevent further loss of life and preserve what's left of the healthcare system in Gaza. Joining me now from Geneva, Switzerland is UNICEF spokesperson James Elder. Thank you for joining us, James.

And you hear everything from their own fear in trying to keep their children alive, to those pregnant women, who as one said very clearly, I just want to collapse. But if I collapse, I feel my children will with me now.Al-Shifa, of course, the hospital you've been talking about. That's the largest neonatal hospital in Gaza. All reports and as your correspondent rightly said, mixed messages come everywhere in this -- in this what is now an information war as well. It certainly does seem as time continues to go on and you have premature babies, not in incubators, not where they need to be. They will continue to die. We know that two or three have died. We hear unconfirmed reports that now maybe that number is twice as many. We simply don't know, Max. But what we do know, and anyone who's had a premature baby knows, you want two things there. You want an incubator and a doctor. Ideally you also want a mother for kangaroo care. The mothers had to flee to safety. The doctors can't work. They don't have power. They don't have lights. And the incubators are gone. This is a lethal situation for those prem babies.",

Firstly, requires safety and we haven't seen that. We see images of people who should be in hospital, wounds of war and shrapnel wounds, you know, walking or being wheelchaired through the through the streets. We know you can't move a baby from A to B unless they're in a premature baby at least, Max, unless they're again. In an ambulance or with an incubator. And without these things, and quite simply, those things don't exist right now, what seems to exist on mass is continued attacks. Then without those things, this will continue to cost children's lives. And the reports are we are well into the thousands.So as UNICEF and so many others, Max, have said from day one, humanitarian ceasefire. Let's get a humanitarian ceasefire. Let's pull back from the brink. Let's at the very least save these premature babies and so many other others, the hundreds of children reportedly killed and injured every day. And whilst we have a humanitarian ceasefire, can we get these boys and girls, Israeli boys and girls who have been somewhere in this hellscape, I imagine in tunnels somewhere in Gaza. Get them back to their families. So for a humanitarian organization, I think for a lot of lot of people out there, a humanitarian ceasefire allows everyone, particularly children, a chance to survive, a chance to overcome some trauma. And a chance for the adults, those in power, to hopefully step back from more horrors.",

However, Democrats are concerned that it does not have aid to Israel and aid to Ukraine, and they are criticizing the unconventional approach taken by Speaker Johnson. Some federal agencies would be funded up until mid January, others until early February. This is an unusual type of approach, but one in which Johnson believes can help achieve their legislative objectives. But nevertheless, the question is how many folks on the right will push back, will try to push him out because of the lack of spending cuts? And whether they will actually try to push him out. Recall that just not too long ago, Kevin McCarthy, the former speaker, lost his job because in major part here because he advanced a bill to keep the government open with Democratic support, that did not have spending cuts. I asked McCarthy himself whether or not he is concerned or whether he believes Johnson's job could be at risk by taking a similar approach. REP.
