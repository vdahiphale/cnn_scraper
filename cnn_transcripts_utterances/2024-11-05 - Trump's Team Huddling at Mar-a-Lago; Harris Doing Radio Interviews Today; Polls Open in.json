Congratulations to the mountain west. Donald Trump and J.D. Vance, they will both vote today. We'll stand by to see if that happens this hour. Vice President Harris and Tim Walz, they already voted. Harris is hoping to become the first woman ever to win the White House. Donald Trump trying to repeat what Grover Cleveland achieved some 130 years ago after being voted out of office, being voted back in. We heard from both candidates at rallies overnight. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You get out to vote, they can't do anything about it, we win. In other words, to make you feel a little guilty, we would only have you to blame. KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S. (D) AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Your vote is your voice.

Wisconsin, obviously, one of those blue wall states. The question is, will that wall be broken by Donald Trump or will Harris be able to keep the state? We will see what happens. Twenty thousand people voted to make it so that Biden won back in 2020. And now everyone is waiting as they come through these polls and talk to the poll workers to see what the count is going to be.

That in Cincinnati, Ohio. And now back here in Pennsylvania, polls have been open for two hours now. Pennsylvania is the biggest electoral prize of the battleground states, 19 electoral votes, which is why this is the state, the place that both campaigns have spent the most time throughout the election season. And we're outside Bensalem High School in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. This is a critical swing county just north of Philadelphia where both campaigns are hoping to run up their margin because this could be such a tight race in the end, or not, as we keep saying. We have heard from both Trump voters and Harris voters here at Bensalem High School this morning. One voter we met is Scott Dinkins.

ASHLEY REICHERT (R), WASHINGTON COUNTY, WISCONSIN, CLERK: Right. It definitely has been off the charts, especially for Washington County. We have roughly 57 percent on average turnout for absentee voting. Some communities are averaging over 60 percent, which is something unheard of, even surpassing 2020, which is absolutely fantastic. And for us, we actually made initiatives earlier this year to promote election integrity. One of our initiatives was funding extra extended hours for municipalities to offer in-person absentee voting hours in the evenings or weekends. And our clerks are absolutely amazing. They - every single municipality participated, and they actually added over 300 additional hours of in-person, absentee voting, which definitely can contribute to the increased turnout for us.",
