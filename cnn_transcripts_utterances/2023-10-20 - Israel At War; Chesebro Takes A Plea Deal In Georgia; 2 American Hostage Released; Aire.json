Sometimes you just see the tail afterglow of the rockets coming out of Gaza. But you could see these very clear streaks of amber light flashing through the sky, disappearing as they are at top. And then, they're intercepts with the Iron Dome. It's been a relatively quiet day, in fact a very quiet day until this moment. This is the first outgoing that we've seen perhaps in six or seven hours. There were a few salvos earlier in the day, but there have been really almost no artillery and no Israeli missile strikes going into Gaza today. Very, very quiet. Which really gave the impression that behind the scenes, talks about humanitarian aid going into Gaza, talks about possible hostage release, it all seemed to create an atmosphere that there were talks of some nature going on because that was the only thing, or perhaps unlikely thing that might have contributed to why the situation felt a little quiet. Anyway, that quiet was broken there with that salvo of missiles fired out of Gaza that have now been intercepted.",

You've seen protests in London, Washington, DC, New York, across Europe, but it was in the Middle East, and particularly here in Jordan. This is a cause, an issue that is deeply close to many people across the country where more than half of the population are either Palestinian or a Palestinian descent. And what we've seen is an outpouring of solidarity for the Palestinian people, for Palestinians, in particular, in the Gaza Strip. But also outrage, deep-seated anger being directed towards Israel for continued airstrikes and the siege on the Gaza Strip, but also anger towards Western allies and the United States. Now, we were at a March earlier this morning, which took place after Friday prayers. Thousands of people taking part in that marched through downtown Amman, including families, young children, all wearing the traditional Palestinian scarf, waving Palestinian flags. This is a huge cause in this country. And as we continue to see these airstrikes ramping up, as the siege continues, these protests are only getting stronger. They are not letting up. And where we are right now is where a lot of the focus has been towards. We're quite close to the Israeli embassy, and that is where many of these demonstrators have focused their attention.

Those fake electors certificates. And that conspiracy part of this charge, that's very important because that means that Ken Chesebro, the attorney who was working with Donald Trump and the campaign, Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman and others, the other people charged in this case. He's admitting to being part of that group taking the efforts together.That's quite a significant step forward for not just the district attorney, Fani Willis, but the entire shape of this case. While Chesebro was expected to go to trial today by himself, after his codefendant Sidney Powell pleaded guilty yesterday. That trial is not happening. And now this case is left with Donald Trump and several others, including Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman, Mark Meadows, many boldface names, other lawyers that were working at that same level as Ken Chesebro, Sidney Powell and others, they all will now be going to trial at a later date together. So there wasn't going to be now a trial where Ken Chesebro would be trying his case as the only defendant that the jury would be looking at and maybe pointing to Donald Trump or prosecutors having to speak about Donald Trump with Donald Trump not in the room.",

Ultimately what was going to happen is Donald Trump and others were going to be pointing fingers at the attorneys and saying the attorneys put them up to it. The attorneys blessed this and said it was OK.Now instead of having that dynamic where the defendants are pointing fingers at each other, now the attorneys are going to say we committed crimes, and these people were part of it.

But ultimately, at the end of the day, they had to plead guilty to crimes. Ken Chesebro, the more serious, you know, plea, obviously, he pled guilty to, you know, play a felony.

We've spoken to my colleague Kaitlan Collins.As we know from the Israelis, there had been around 200 hostages who have been held by that militant group, by Hamas since the horrific attacks inside Israel on October 7. What we understand from these two sources is that the two Americans are a mother and a daughter. They are currently we're told with the Red Cross and heading south in the Gaza Strip. There are two crossings in southern Gaza, one that goes into Egypt, the other that goes into Israel. So right now we're not sure about which country they will be going into. We're also unclear on the identities of this mother and child but we are told that they are being released on humanitarian grounds. That's according to a source that I spoke with because the mother is not in good health. Now at Boris and Brianna, this has also been announced by Hamas. A spokesman for the militant group said that the mother and daughter are also being released, they say, on humanitarian grounds, but also because they want to contest the claims being made by Biden and what they call his fascist administration, because there are false and baseless. So we have this mother and daughter, American citizens who have been held by Hamas for much of the past two weeks. Now, we understand with the Red Cross on their way out of Gaza. Guys?",

Kaitlan, is there anything, and I don't even know if there's an answer to this at this point. But can we read into anything at this point if the -- they're being released because the mother is in poor health, could this be an acknowledgement on the part of Hamas that they need to perhaps release people who are not doing well, that they want people who maybe are in good health if they are going to be using them as pawns, as they perhaps later try to utilize them in some kind of prisoner exchange? Can we read into anything at this point? KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHORAnd so, that was the kind of the basis that people were looking at these hostages and the questions over what would happen here. And we've heard Israeli officials say they were not negotiating with Hamas for an exchange for the hostages. But this news is incredibly significant. I mean, these hostages, of course, there has been an open question of what their fate would be what would happen, especially as we are waiting to see that ground incursion potentially happen. And I can just tell you, we have not heard anything from the Prime Minister's office here in Tel Aviv tonight on the release of these two American hostages that Alex and I have reporting on. They have not confirmed it. We are waiting to see what they say about this. We also have not heard from the White House on this front either. But I just want to tell you, this is something that is still every single day here in Tel Aviv everywhere in Israel. This is something that everyone's talking about. Of course, Shabbat happens on Friday evenings, this is when everyone their family, their friends, get together and have a dinner in the Jewish faith. And earlier, we went to this ceremony for all of these families of these hostages. And they had this incredibly long dining table setup with a seat for every person who is believed to have been taken hostage by Hamas, and therefore will not be with their families for Shabbat dinner. And it was an incredibly emotional moment. And so just this news in and of itself, that two of them have been released, that they are alive, it is something that is going to be hopeful to these families who are waiting for any peace, any scrap of information about their loved ones. And so, of course, the question remains, what happens to the other hostages, what does that look like going forward? I think there are still so many questions for these two American hostages that are being released, including where they are going to be released into, whether that's Egypt, whether that's here into Israel, those are still big questions, and we're still waiting for details of what that looks like. And also, Brianna, as you mentioned, what it could mean for the others and how Hamas plans to use them. One other thing I will say that we talked about last night, and this was in an interview with the New York Times. Hamas leader said that they are not even in control over all the hostages, but there are other terrorist groups, obviously in Gaza, and they did not have full control over them. Obviously something that would complicate getting the release of these other hostages.",

      "sentences": "Well, Jim is absolutely right in terms of the pressure being applied from outside. Hamas is considered a terrorist organization, of course, by not just Israel but the United States as well. And that means that those two countries don't have direct dialogue with Hamas. So in this situation, and this has been the case for much of the past two weeks since these 200 or so people were taken, is that it was primarily Qatar that was engaging with Hamas. They are the main conduit for Israel and US to talk to that militant group.Qatar has several Hamas leaders who live in their capital in Doha. So this really has been the portfolio that the US has asked Qatar to undertake. When Secretary Antony Blinken was crisscrossing the region going to all these different Middle Eastern countries, he very quickly went to Qatar. And that was because they have this direct line into Hamas. And so, here this is, both according to the sources that we have spoken with, but also Hamas themselves, the results of this negotiation between Hamas and Qatar. But no doubt the presence of these still around 200 hostages who will still be, you know, in the custody of Hamas and other groups who understand, or subgroups, all across the Gaza Strip that is going to wildly complicate the efforts of the Israeli military, who of course, we believe are going to go into Gaza on the ground any day now. We've been talking about this sprawling network of tunnels throughout the Gaza Strip. We understand that the hostages may be in those tunnels, maybe in the bunkers. And so as Israel goes into try to decapitate the Hamas, military and political leadership, not only are they trying to minimize the civilian death toll on the Palestinian side, but they're obviously trying to make sure that that nothing happens to these hostages and try to get them out. So while Israel is saying that they're not going to be negotiating with Hamas over these hostages, this effort by Qatar will be ongoing to try to get more than just these two Americans out.",

It's also difficult to get a read on just how many hostages there are, not only because of that but according to this spokesperson, because of continued bombing in Gaza.So, does Israeli intelligence, does US intelligence have an actual number? Do they know how many hostages there are still being held captive, and how many Americans specifically?",

      "sentences": "Well, unlike with the death toll that we have sadly seen grow over the course of the past two weeks, the number of hostages has fluctuated. That too has grown. And essentially, Boris and Brianna, this is a process of deduction. The Israelis and other countries who have citizens who have been missing, they have been able to figure out who has been killed, who has surfaced, thankfully, and then who are still missing. And so, they have been able to narrow that number down but haven't put a specific point on it. It is hovering, we understand, around 200.We should also make the point that not only are these hostages, we believe, spread out between Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which is another Iranian-backed allied group, but different groups within Hamas is the belief. So that thing makes things extremely complicated. On the humanitarian front, in this humanitarian excuse or reason that Hamas is giving for releasing these to Americans. Keep in mind, guys, that it is extremely difficult for militant groups, for anyone really to have 200 prisoners. You have to keep them safe if you plan to use them as leverage. You need to keep them fed. It is a big lift. So if indeed this American mother is not doing well, it is certainly a burden for Hamas and perhaps in their interest to allow these two Americans to leave and to hand them back over. But to Kaitlan's earlier point, no doubt that Hamas is going to try to use these prisoners as leverage. Whether it's to release the hundreds of Palestinians who are in Israeli prisons, whether it's to get more aid into the country, whether it's to call for a ceasefire, these are all things that we've that we've heard considered. Certainly Hamas is going to try to use them to their benefit.",
