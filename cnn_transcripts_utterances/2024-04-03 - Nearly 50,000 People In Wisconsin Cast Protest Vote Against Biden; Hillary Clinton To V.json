He handed Biden a letter beforehand from an eight year old orphan girl living in Rafah, orphaned in the last six months. CNN's MJ Lee is at the White House for us now.

One participant, of course, was this Palestinian American doctor who ended up walking out of that meeting early as a show of protest. This doctor saying that he handed the president a letter from an eight-year-old girl who was orphaned during this war.In that letter, the girl begging the president to do anything to stop Israel from going into Rafah.

Yesterday, about 48,000 people voted for uninstructed delegates in Wisconsin's Democratic primary, also known as a protest vote against Biden. Forty-eight thousand in a state that Biden won by less than half that, about 20,000 votes in 2020. Keep in mind, these voters didn't even have to show up to vote at all, given Biden already has won enough delegates to clinch the Democratic nomination.Ben Wikler joins us now.

My hope is that by the time we get to November, we've created change, the crisis has stopped, and that we're in a moment where the activism around uninstructed has become activism to turn folks out and make sure that we do stop another Trump presidency and have a second Biden term, where we're rebuilding in Gaza and in Israel, and folks are living in peace and security.

The thing that will bring voters together is change on the ground in Israel and Palestine and that there's a ton of work to be done towards that goal. And that's what voters are calling for.They're not voting uninstructed in the Democratic primary because they have given up on the idea that any change is possible. They're voting to try to create change in the world. And President Biden's campaign is arguing that we can build a better future. He's working the phones. We just -- you just heard about it from Karine Jean-Pierre to have tough conversations right now. So the goal is to address this crisis, bring Democrats and Nikki Haley voters and Independents altogether and deliver a tremendous reelection in the fall and be able to keep moving the country forward.

And there is a law that says you have to bring these motions 45 days before.Judge also pointing out that Trump knew that this was an option because he had made this claim in the federal case. He had also made the claim of presidential immunity to try to move this very state case into federal court, which was denied. And the judge writing in the motion that all that raises real questions about the sincerity and actual purpose of the motion. Now, Trump -- this isn't his only effort to try to still delay the trial date, he also is filing motions with the judge to postpone the trial because of the publicity around it, saying they will be unable to find an unbiased jury in New York County, that includes Manhattan. The prosecutors are opposing that because they say that this is a former president on trial, it is always going to be a high publicity event. The judge has already denied this motion.

In this edited video by the San Bernardino Sheriff Department, you can see Savannah Graziano, who at the time was believed to have been kidnapped by her father, she follows a deputy's order to get out of the car and walk toward them. Now, we're going to freeze the video right before Savannah's shot, but you will briefly hear audio from a police helicopter.Now, Graziano's father was killed during the shootout with the officers. CNN currently does not have access to the entire video. The California Department of Justice is investigating this deadly incident. No officers face any charges. Sam Levin, a senior reporter for The Guardian, is covering this story. And, Sam, thank you so much for joining us. There's still so much unknown about the shooting.
