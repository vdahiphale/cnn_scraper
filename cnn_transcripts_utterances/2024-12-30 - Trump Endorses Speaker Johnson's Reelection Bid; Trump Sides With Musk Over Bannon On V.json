And you've got people, Andy Biggs, Lauren Boebert, Tim Burchett, Eric Burlison, Michael Cloud.I mean, there's 10, 15 people here. Andy Biggs was just on Fox News right before this show, saying he still wants to talk to Johnson, even in the wake of Donald Trump's endorsement. Take us inside the Trump team. Like, how are they thinking about this? Because he was pretty quiet about this for a while until today.",

      "sentences": "Yes, and I think there was a lot of speculation that it was unclear which way he was going to go, particularly after he and Elon Musk completely tanked the CR that Johnson had worked on.I will say there was a moment after that happened in which Elon Musk came out in support of Speaker Mike Johnson, which gave the appearance, because of the relationship currently between Musk and Trump, that Trump was behind Johnson. He essentially said the Speaker handled this well for what he was given on the table, which in Johnson, I mean, Musk code for Trump, we're going to still stand by him. But he had been quiet. Now, to Carl's point, which I want to just point out here, one thing that we're forgetting is what Trump was doing when the Kevin McCarthy speaker fight was playing out, which was he was going to court every day. And at one point, he actually complained that there was not enough media attention on him because everybody was so focused on what was happening in Congress. Why couldn't we get this done? That's why we saw that Donald Trump was calling almost everyone in the House that he has a relationship with during that time saying, why can't you do it? Why can't you do it? Just trying to figure out how exactly to do it. So to your point, he doesn't want a fight on January 3rd. He doesn't want any kind of a fight leading into his inauguration. He wants this done because he's actually already seen that this is going to take away from him. Now, if you're Johnson, you've got to feel pretty good about what happened. You're twisting in the wind. He's probably out there trying to figure out whether or not Trump was going to come out publicly. This is a win for Johnson. How it plays out? Obviously remains to be seen.",

Depending on the vacancies and filling those vacancies created by Trump's own Cabinet appointments, by the way, you're looking at a speaker of the House having only a one or two vote margin for a significant period of time.That essentially means it's ungovernable. And it's actually remarkable that Mike Johnson has survived as long as he is. It's testament to the fact that there was so much chaos last year that, in a way, people just sort of gave up and went along with him. Will they continue to do so? Donald Trump's instincts here are to bypass Congress. Donald Trump is not -- he's almost the opposite of the kind of president who's going to, you know, invest a huge amount in working patiently, building coalitions. That's just not the kind of politician Donald Trump is. He's the politician of the bully pulpit of the, you know, the -- or the Twitter pulpit, I guess we should call it, you know, of the sort of middle-of- the-night decree. In his first term as president, if you look at the record of that, what did he do? He consistently bypassed the U.S. Senate, for example, on appointments. Essentially said, well, I'll just keep him as actings. And so, he's going to want to act by executive decree, by executive order. And I think chaos in the House will only encourage Donald Trump in those instincts, which is just to say, forget about it. I'm just going to be the imperial president.",

We know privately he had been talking to Musk, talking to the Silicon Valley executives, saying that he supported this program.But to be clear, in that quote that he gave the New York Post, it's not true. He used this idea that he has always supported H-1B visas. If you actually look at what he did during his first term, he limited them pretty severely. And if you look at some of his top aides, particularly those who are going to be working on immigration, who are going to be drafting that policy, have already drafted that policy, they are not big supporters of H-1B visas. But obviously, as we have seen, Donald Trump has changed a little bit of his outlook since becoming so close with Elon Musk. And I will say, it's not just Musk. It's also people like David Sacks. It's also other Silicon Valley executives who have used this program. But he clearly here is siding with that part of his base. And that's not really his base. And that's what we saw over the last week, was this kind of internal fighting. And not just fighting, but really, you know, kind of clawing at each other between Elon Musk and people like Laura Loomer, Charlie Kirk that were out there, saying that these are not -- Steve Bannon, as you said, these are not programs that we support. These people are just coming in, these people being tech moguls, coming in and trying to manipulate the system of Donald Trump when his base doesn't believe this.",

I will go to war on this issue, the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend.\" Now, noted followers of great movies saw a little bit of a hint of the Les Grossman character in Tropic Thunder in that quote, although, I think, he has explicitly said it seemed like that's where he was going.

So, is it safe to predict that this feud will continue? Of course it is. Is it safe to say that Donald Trump's interview to The New York Post, while interesting, is not the final word on this policy debate? Yes, absolutely. Stephen Miller, who is the rare Trump adviser who has been with Donald Trump from the very beginning all the way back to his 2016 campaign when he was on the road with Donald Trump, he is going to be the key adviser in the White House overseeing the administration's approach to immigration. Miller is an opponent not only of illegal immigration, but of much legal immigration to the United States, and he is going to be the key person in this new administration. So I think that this infighting, it's just a tiny hint of the levels of fighting and, you know, dysfunction and chaos that we're going to see in Trump 2.0. Why do I say that?

A couple of things to keep in mind. First of all, he was relatively young when he lost to Ronald Reagan. He was 56 years old.But let's keep in mind, he was always a fitness, not -- not actually fitness buff, he jogged until he was 80 years old. So this is a man at 56 who felt he had a lot more to give. And the question is, what was he going to do? And in the first weeks, he describes this in one of his 32 books. He describes coming back from Washington, not really being at loose ends, not knowing what to do with his life. And he came upon this idea of what would become the Carter Center. And what he decided to do was to take his commitment to public service and Rosalynn's commitment to public service and do it on a global scale. No president had ever done that before. Now, the other president who had a very long post-presidency in our modern history was Herbert Hoover. Herbert Hoover didn't just disappear from the scene. He did come back to provide assistance in reforming and improving government. But Herbert Hoover, who had once had a career, actually as an international humanitarian, didn't do that in his post-presidency. Jimmy Carter decided to do it. And not only do it in one part, one sphere. The Carter Center is known for observing and encouraging democratic elections. He decided to do it in several different spheres. Democratic resilience, public -- international public health, and at home and abroad, building affordable housing. So Jimmy Carter decided to basically not only talk the talk, but walk the walk in terms of international humanitarian service. That was the first time any president had done it. And we're seeing now as presidents who leave office relatively young, they create centers sort of like the Carter Center to do this kind of work. I mean, George W. Bush, for example, has continued his interest and commitment to dealing with the AIDS crisis in Africa. So Jimmy Carter has set a model for the kind of good works you can do as a former American president.",
