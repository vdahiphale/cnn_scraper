It is Thursday, September the 19th, 9 a.m. here in London, 4 a.m. in Washington. Just 47 days until the U.S. presidential election.Now, new polling is giving us a greater insight into which way voters are leaning in three critical battleground states. According to a set of post-debate Quinnipiac University polls, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris is leading her Republican rival Donald Trump amongst likely voters in Pennsylvania and Michigan. Her one point lead in Wisconsin is within the margin of error on the path to the 270 electoral votes needed for victory. Harris would likely win if she carries those three states. The Democratic nominee is set to head to one of those states, Michigan, where she'll take part in an online event hosted by Oprah Winfrey. United for America is set to live stream tonight. The diverse and influential Teamsters union has announced it's not endorsing anyone in this year's presidential race. This is the first time in nearly three decades that the Teamsters have withheld an endorsement. And those since have been in support of the Democratic nominee. Survey data released by the union indicate about 60 percent of its members support Donald Trump over Kamala Harris. The Teamsters include truck drivers, warehouse and health care workers, even police officers and airline pilots. In a statement, their president said this, quote: We sought commitments from both Trump and Harris not to interfere in critical union campaigns or core Teamsters industries and to honor our members right to strike but were unable to secure those pledges. Donald Trump had this reaction. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Since then, rates sat at a 23-year high for more than a year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell says the move is a sign of commitment to keep in step with the ever-changing U.S. economy. But the move wasn't unanimous, drawing the first dissent from a board member in nearly 20 years. One member wanted to see a smaller cut.Here's a look at the U.S. futures as we wait for the markets to open in the coming hours. We're keeping a close eye on the major indices to see if there's any further reaction to the Fed's decision. It did go in the way they expected, but further than expected, which is why they're not down and they're up more than some might have expected. CNN's Matt Egan breaks down the Fed's bold move.

And the Fed, they decided to go big.The fact that they went with a jumbo size interest rate cut, it's telling on multiple levels. First, it shows they're not worried about inflation anymore. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, he stopped short of declaring victory over inflation, but they're all but doing that. It does also suggest, though, that they are worried about what they're seeing in the jobs market. Now, Powell, he said repeatedly that he's not alarmed with the jobs market. He even said at one point, the labor market is in a strong place. We want to keep it there. But there are some economists who are concerned that the Fed is late and that they need to play catch up before the cracks in the jobs market turn into something more ominous. So the Fed has made clear that they've switched the mission. They've gone from fighting inflation to fighting unemployment. Of course, all of this is happening just weeks before this hotly contested election. Now, Powell, he stressed politics played no role here and that the Fed only does what they believe is right. And I asked Powell about the idea from former President Trump that the sitting U.S. president should have a say in where interest rates go. And Powell, he made clear he's not a fan of that idea. JEROME POWELL, CHAIR, U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE: We do our work to serve all Americans. We're not serving any politician, any political figure, any cause, any issue, nothing. It's just maximum employment and price stability on behalf of all Americans. And that's how the other central banks are set up, too. It's a good institutional arrangement, which has been good for the public. And I hope and strongly believe that it will continue.",

Israel planted explosives next to each pagers battery, along with a detonation switch. The New York Times reports, citing U.S. and other officials, thousands of beepers blew up Tuesday, all receiving the same message at the same time. The pagers have the name AR-924, made by Gold Apollo, a Taiwanese company that calls its product extremely robust and durable. Eighty five days of battery life, fully charging in two and a half hours. A senior Taiwanese security official tells CNN Taiwan has no record of Gold Apollo pagers being shipped to Lebanon. Records do show Gold Apollo shipped about 260,000 pagers from Taiwan, mainly to the U.S. and Australia over the past two and a half years. CNN went to the company headquarters in New Taipei City. We saw investigators going in and out. We also talked to the CEO. He strongly denies making the explosive pagers bearing his company's name.
