So, this is a straw poll of business leaders taken by Yale professor Jeff Sonnenfeld, and it finds that 80 percent of these business leaders think that Harris is going to win. Just 20 percent pick Former President Trump.Now, to be clear, this is not representative of all CEOs. These are dozens of business leaders put into a room. Sonnenfeld, who's known as the CEO whisperer. But what's telling here is that even though only a third of these CEOs identify as Democrat and some of them, I'm sure, don't like elements of the Harris plan, they do think that she's going to win. Now, as far as why this is, what's interesting is they were also asked about who's a bigger threat to democracy. And again, not even close there.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, congresswoman from Georgia, saying, if it turns out to be true, she definitely cannot support him.Joining us now is a Reverend William Barber, co-chair of the Poor People's Campaign, one of the country's best known public advocates fighting racism and poverty, and man who's lived in North Carolina for a very long time. Reverend Barber, thank you for coming in. I want to read for you the comments that are linked to the lieutenant governor on a few topics. On slavery, he wrote this. Slavery is not bad. Some people need to be slaves. I wish they would bring it back. October 2010, Robinson stated, I'm a black Nazi. March 2012, Robinson wrote, I'd take Hitler over any of the stuff that's in Washington right now, referring to the leadership during the Obama administration. Reverend, what's your reaction to all this? REV. WILLIAM BARBER, CO-CHAIR, PEOPLE CAMPAIGN AND PRESIDENT, REPAIRERS OF THE BREACH:  Well, certainly these kinds of statements are more than just distasteful. They're ugly. They're untrue. Rooted in racism and hurtfulness and meanness. And it's problematic. The other part of this though, is all people are imperfect. And I believe that people's personal feelings serve in public life are between them, their loved ones, their God, their pastors. But here's the problem. Mark Robinson has spent so much of his public life attacking other people's personal decisions about how they live their lives. Any personal hypocrisy reveals the moral contradiction of a politics that claims God while it neglects the people that the bible says God is most concerned about. You know, he's often talked about his faith in God. But here we see these kinds of things being coming out and these words. And what it does is, as I was talking about those things, but what he's never talked about and should be talked about is 40 percent of North Carolinians who are poor and low wage. What are you going to do about that? The fact that there are over a million North Carolinians, 39 percent of the workforce that make less than $15 an hour of minimum living wage. You don't hear anything about that or the half million people that are still without health care in North Carolina and the over a million people that didn't have health care during the highest part of the pandemic. The problem with these kinds of statements and what your report is shown is it has us talking about those things. Some of them are his personal failings, but not dealing with the issues of that a public servant is really supposed to be dealing with, and it's deeply troubling. And I'm concerned about it because here we are in a state where we have real issues. We have 4 million workers in this state who don't even have paid family leave. That's what a candidate for governor ought to be talking about. We have underfunded public education that his party has spent many times cutting that money. That's what we should be talking about. And this really reveals a moral contradiction, especially when you attack people. And then things come out that show that you are doing some of the same things that you claim other people are doing. And you say about them that they're bad. But now, you have to deal with it yourself.",

Investigators say Letcher County Sheriff Shawn Stines and Judge Kevin Mullins got into an argument in the judge's chambers yesterday. No word on what it was about. The judge suffered multiple gunshot wounds. The sheriff turned himself in and is said to be cooperating.Take a look at this incredible video we're going to show you. This is how it begins, just wait to see how it goes down, a hiker in China slips and falls down the side of a mountain. His own -- oh, God. His own camera recording the entire thing.
