The fact that it is at an historic low when it comes to unemployment, and it is true that people want to make sure that they can get jobs.The challenge for this administration has been over the past, you know, I guess, almost two years now, not necessarily the fact that it is hard for people to get jobs, the challenge has been, as we've been talking about the fact that it is hard for people to afford goods. And that's why that question to him about inflation is so key. Now inflation has come down. And it has come down in a way that has given breathing room to families who need the basics like gasoline, like eggs, like milk. But the question is going to be whether or not the job numbers will send a signal to the Fed that they might have to tick up interest rates, which will change a lot of the of the very delicate dynamics of the economy right now, that will affect and do affect Americans in their everyday lives. It's not to take away from these job numbers. They are a very big deal in covering campaigns for many, many years. I can tell you that on the campaign trail, everybody waits for the first Friday of the month to see where the job numbers are and how it will affect the political reality. And that is still the case. But there are so many other factors right now that are affecting the economy.",

It's hard to call this anywhere near a recession, with the unemployment rate as low as it is. But what really stood out to me and I'll highlight this, again, was the confidence that he exuded here in saying that he was right by going with his gut.And you know, there were naysayers. within his own party, many top economists that said his plan would just spiral inflation out of control. Inflation is coming down the jobs market remains very hot. And obviously there were a lot of Republican detractors, too. How do Republicans respond to this number?",

So that is irrelevant what you just said to what's happening now, because he is saying, look, yes, they did spend a lot of money in the first two years of the Biden administration with the Democrats in control of Congress.

Prosecutors allege Murdaugh killed them to distract from his alleged financial crimes. Joining me now is Ashley Merchant, a criminal defense attorney. Ashley, great to have you on.

And it makes sense, if you think about it, a juror is not going to believe that someone just killed their wife and killed their son.That doesn't make sense to jurors. And so the state really needs to be able to prove why he did it because the normal person just doesn't do that. And so I think that it's really important. The question, though, is whether or not that importance and how valuable it is to the state is outweighed by any prejudicial value. And what that means is that means that the defense is obviously going to prejudice, the defense. This is obviously evidence of other acts. And so that's always going to be prejudicial. So what the judge has to decide is whether or not that outweighs how much the state needs it. And then, you know, once it comes in, is it really going to prove motive? It seems kind of like a stretch to me to think that he would kill his family just to try and divert attention from some financial crimes.",
