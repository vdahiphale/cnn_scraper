This is because Cohen had thought he was going to get a job in the Trump White House, the Trump administration. And he did not get that. We know that Michael Cohen was frustrated by that from Davidson's previous testimony. But this is the first time we've ever heard Keith Davidson express that he was convinced of Michael Cohen's being so distraught as to actually be in the realm of self-harm.And Lanny Davis, this is obviously being cited as an example -- being brought forward as an example of Cohen's instability, his rashness.

This is how he makes money profiting off of this tabloid culture. And people were in a situation like Lindsay Lohan, not in a very vulnerable position. And it appears that they're now going through other instances as well. I think we're going to hear a lot of other really surprising names about to come up.",

You were trying to get as much money, not only for yourself in addition to your client. When you knew someone in this case, then candidate Trump was in an especially vulnerable position may go back to his director where he talked about. How he news Stormy Daniels' story was suddenly more valuable after Access Hollywood tape.And while he says that he testified here on cross that no one talked directly about it as impacting the election. They do later on in the transaction. There are those text messages. Now the defense has moved on to. Here we go. Davidson's work with clients who are paid by Charlie Sheen, asking whether he took steps that cause Sheen to pay his client. Again, bringing up more examples of how Davidson may have targeted people for money. We asserted there were some tortious activity committed and valid settlements that were expected. Now the defense attorney jabs at Davidson, your memory seems a little fuzzy around some of these issues. You and Karen were just talking about that, how he keep saying, I cannot recall. So now, I'm only undermining his credibility just in terms of the type of work he did. And whether it was extortion. But also, the fact that he's not being completely upfront about exactly how some of these deals with other celebrities came to extortion.",
