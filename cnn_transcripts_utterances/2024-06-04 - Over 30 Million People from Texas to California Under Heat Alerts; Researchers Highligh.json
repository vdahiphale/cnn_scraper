There is trapped air and a whole lot of sunshine that is creating a heat dome that's sending temperatures in the West into the triple digits. It's increasing the potential as well for heat related deaths.CNN's Veronica Miracle is joining us now from Davis, California where there's an excessive heat warning that's in place there. Veronica, how are people preparing for all of this?",

Those temperatures and those conditions coupled together can create disasters. As they say, it just takes one spark.And when you have gusty conditions up to like 30 miles per hour today, firefighters are always concerned that that could spread into a wildfire. In fact, just over the weekend, about a couple miles south of us, there was a 14,000 acre wildfire. And that was before the heat wave and before these gusty conditions. So many departments around the area certainly keeping their eye on this and making sure that everyone is prepared in case anything happens -- Brianna.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I'm nodding along while you're saying this.The criteria used to define internet addiction are the persistent preoccupation with the internet, withdrawal symptoms when away from the internet, and sacrificing relationships for time to spend on the internet over an extended period. And here to talk about this more with us is the professor of psychology, Dr. Jean Twenge. She is the author of \"Generations, The Real Differences Between Gen Z, Millennials, Gen X, Boomers, and Silence, and What They Mean for America's Future.\" Thanks so much for being here with us. You know, as we're talking through all of this, it is sobering and daunting, but I think any of us who've spent time around people, you know, all of us probably have a shade of this, but this is pretty troubling, this study. DR. JEAN TWENGE, PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY, SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY: It is. It really shows across a number of analyses that there's a link between spending a lot of time on the internet, feeling those symptoms of addiction, and that that shows up in the brain for adolescents, that it shows up in particular in those areas that are relevant for controlling attention. And this is also relevant because we know that the more hours a day a teen spends on social media, the more likely it is that he or she is going to be depressed. So there's all of these negative downstream impacts of spending excessive amounts of time on social media. And fortunately, Gallup found last year that the average teen in America spends almost five hours a day on social media. So this would be a really broad-ranging problem.",

I mean, tell us a little bit more about what you're actually seeing in the brain when you're talking about heavy internet use, because it sounds like there's actually a depletion of important neurotransmitters and stuff like that.",

      "sentences": "Yes, you know, even though we do have this now, comprehensive meta-analysis, this area of research is still emerging. So we're still trying to figure out what causes what. It could be, admittedly, that there are teens who have impulse control issues and then they spend a lot of time on social media, so it's showing up in the brain.So we really do need some more data to figure out what's causing what. For mental health, we already have a lot of great data showing that. For example, people who are randomly assigned to cut back or give up their social media use, after a week, two weeks, or three weeks, they're happier, they're less depressed, they're less lonely. So we know, at least there, with mental health, there's a lot of good data.",

Studies are just being done.

I do think it is remarkable how many people talk about their social media and phone use using the language of addiction. We've even seen this in a few studies where people are asked to give up or cut back on social media. If those studies last a day or two, people feel worse. It's very similar to the pattern that you see with other addictions that those first couple of days there are withdrawal symptoms.And then after that, it gets better. If people come out of it and use their time in other more productive ways, then that's where you see the reduction of depression increases in happiness.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Jessica and Brianna, startling numbers. Listen, it's a great time to be a CEO. And CEOs, they've made more money than workers forever, right? But it's that pay gap that is so startling and the fact that it is growing. Now here's why that's happening. It's because CEO pay is increasing rapidly, much more rapidly than worker pay.The median CEO in the S&amp;P 500 made just over $16 million last year. That's up 13 percent from the year before. Now the good news is employers are making more money, but at a much more moderate pace, up 5 percent to just over $81,000. Now to take this a step further, that means the annual pay hike for employees last year, it was about $4,300. For CEOs, $1.5 million. Again, that's just the increase. Now these numbers are obviously tough to swallow for workers because a lot of people are struggling with the high cost of living, right? I mean, daycare, rent, car insurance, home insurance. It is very expensive right now. Moody's Analytics found that the average American is spending over $1,000 more than they were three years ago for the same basket of goods and services. Now, workers are making more money, but almost all of that pay hike is being swallowed up by higher costs.",
