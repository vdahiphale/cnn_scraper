      "sentences": "Good evening. For the first time since the October 7th attack on Israel and the war in Hamas that's followed, hundreds of foreign nationals, as well as those with dual citizenships were finally allowed to leave Gaza today. Many more still remain. Two of them allowed to leave are US citizens. Both were aid workers.In a moment, we'll speak to the niece of one of those aid workers. Ramona Okumura, a 71-year-old Seattle resident, who's been helping to make prosthetics for children in Gaza when she was there on October 7th. The State Department estimates there are about 1,000 Americans and 5,000 other foreign nationals in Gaza who want to leave. President Biden said today he expects more Americans to depart, quote, \"over the coming days.\" In another first since the war began, injured Palestinians were allowed to cross Gaza's southern border into Egypt. This is a hospital in north Sinai where some were taken for treatment. Signals have shift in the conflict that for the second time in as many days saw Israeli strike Hamas targets in the Jabalya refugee camp, north of Gaza. According to the UN, it's the largest camp like that in Gaza.   In a statement, Israel says it struck a, quote, \"Hamas command-and- control complex and that,\" quote, \"Hamas terrorists were eliminated in the strike.\" The director of a hospital near the refugee camp says they received 80 bodies. CNN can't confirm either claim. We'll have a full report on the new strike shortly, as well as what this means for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, plus the attempts to release the hostages, which now number at least 240, according to the Israel Defense Forces. First though, Melissa Bell joins us from Egypt on the release of those foreign nationals and injured Palestinians. So what more do we know about Americans who left Gaza earlier today and others?",

Both were doctors there to help Gazan children who found themselves on the wrong side of the border.What we understand is that they're both now on their way Cairo. These just the first of the Americans that are to be released. What we understand is that this is a comprehensive deal, Anderson, that we'll see all foreign and dual nationals eventually getting out of Gaza. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BELL (voice over): A tired smile and a wave from one of the lucky few finally allowed to leave Gaza since the war began. These families, just some of the first foreign and dual nationals finally permitted through the Rafah crossing into Egypt on Wednesday. The result of a deal brokered by Qatar between Israel, Hamas, Egypt, and the United States, that will allow all foreign and dual nationals to leave the besieged enclave. Also allowed to leave under the deal, the first Palestinians, 81 of the most severely wounded, those desperate enough for urgent surgical intervention taken one by one in a convoy of ambulances to a field hospital set up a few miles away and to other hospitals in northern Egypt. Large crowds of foreign nationals had been massing at the border after hearing at the start of the conflict that they'd be allowed out. Families desperately checking to see if they were some of those lucky enough finally to get through. ISMAIL ABU SHAABANE, AMERICAN-PALESTINIAN IN GAZA (through translator): I'm an American living in Gaza. We heard that the crossing was open, but unfortunately, we discovered that it was open for specific nationalities at the moment. And we had to turn back because the cellular network was down and we weren't aware that there was a list. We hope to see our names on the list tomorrow or the next day. BELL (voice over): As the only crossing from Gaza to anywhere other than Israel, all eyes had been on Rafah ever since the total siege of the strip was announced by Israel. And what's gone in has been painfully little, a further 20 trucks arriving on Wednesday, a drop in the ocean, say eight organizations given the needs inside. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

No word yet if they plan to actually do that.Some 240 people are believed to have been kidnapped into Gaza. One of them is a 23-year-old who's American-Israeli named Hersh Goldberg- Polin. He was attending the Nova Music Festival when Hamas attacked. He was last seen in this video. Part of his left arm blown off by a grenade, several of which were thrown by Hamas gunmen into a bomb shelter where he and as many as 28 others were hiding. He was then loaded into the back of that pickup truck. He was presumed to be now hostage. Joining me tonight his parents, Jon Polin and Rachel Goldberg from Jerusalem. Thank you both so much for being with us. Let me just start by asking you when the news that some foreign nationals would be getting released today through the southern border with Rafah. Obviously, it's not people who were being held hostage or who had been kidnapped by Hamas. But did that give you some -- I'm wondering what your reaction to it was. Did it give you some hope that maybe there'd be some movement, particularly since emphasis was placed on people with injuries? JON POLIN, FATHER OF HERSH GOLDBERG-POLIN, ABDUCTED BY HAMAS: So, first of all, I didn't assume that it was going to include Hersh or most of the other hostages. That being said, I think we've talked in the past about how we just got to find hope and optimism anywhere we could find it. So, first of all, sure, any dose of good news coming out of Gaza gives me a small dose of optimism. But also, I'm happy for those individuals.

Just having so much hate thrown at and so much misinformation as well that was going on, just shared on campus and on social media has been challenging.ELLE REEVE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): There's tension at hundreds of colleges across the U.S. At Tulane, a fight broke out after someone tried to burn an Israeli flag. At Harvard and Columbia, a doxxing truck showed up on campus naming students who allegedly belonged to organizations that released an anti-Israel statement. EVE M. TROUTT POWELL, MIDDLE EAST HISTORY PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA: I'm shocked at the temperature on campus. I could never have imagined it would be like this. There's a level of -- I don't want to say hatred -- but anger and fear.",
