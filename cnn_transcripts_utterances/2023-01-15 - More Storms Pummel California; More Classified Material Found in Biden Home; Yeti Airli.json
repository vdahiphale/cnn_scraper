This happened earlier this week when personal attorneys were planning to turn over a classified document the White House counsel, who has security clearance, had come to Wilmington to provide that to the Justice Department and, in doing so, found these additional five pages. Now in a lengthy statement, Richard Sauber, the special counsel to the president said the following. He said, \"The president's lawyers have acted immediately and voluntarily to provide the Penn Biden documents to the Archives and the Wilmington documents to DOJ. We have now publicly released specific details about the documents identified, how they were identified and where they were found.\" Now based on this latest disclosure and CNN's own reporting, we now approximate that some 20 documents with classified markings have been found, again, in private spaces belonging to President Biden. Of course, this has put the White House in a bind, as it tries to navigate this new reality. In a statement, Biden's personal attorneys said that they are limited in what they can share because they do not want to interfere with the investigation.

Why would they not have announced all of the materials that have been located, not just those at the Biden Center in Washington and also at his home and his garage and by his Corvette?
