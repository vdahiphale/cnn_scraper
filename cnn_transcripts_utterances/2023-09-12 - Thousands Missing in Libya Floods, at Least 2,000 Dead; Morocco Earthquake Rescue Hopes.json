Several countries offering aid over what is being called catastrophic flooding and a huge death toll. Here at CONNECT THE WORLD, we are not keen on the numbers game. Like you, we know it is all about human beings and a human cost. But in this disaster, like Morocco's earthquake earlier this week, the death toll is a \"stop you in your tracks\" number. Libyan officials say more than 2,000 lives have been lost after two dams gave way, destroyed by torrential rains and 10,000 people are also believed to be missing. Let's start with CNN's Eleni Giokos with this. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELENI GIOKOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Chaos as volunteers from the Libyan Red Crescent scrambles to save residents. \"Put him in the car,\" one of the rescuers says; \"bring him here.\" A tireless effort but limited by the sheer scale of floods that swept Eastern Libya. The full scale of the disaster, visible in the daylight, the Earth ripped apart, houses destroyed or completely washed away and thousands dead and missing. Apocalyptic scenes stretching farther than the eye can see. The culprit, Storm Daniel, the same that ravaged Greece and Bulgaria last week, it made its way back into the Mediterranean, picking up strength before crashing down on Libya. The downpour several times higher than the rain Libya usually sees in the entire month of September, too much for the wartorn country's infrastructure to handle. In Derna, one of the hardest hit cities, two dams reportedly collapsed, wiping out a quarter of the city. Rescuers have been faced with a catastrophic scene.",

So the infrastructure, particularly those two dams in the Wadi Derna, that normally dry water bed that run through the city that was filled with water, a tsunami of water, that destroyed so much of the city. According to one of the spokesmen for the Libyan military that is loyal to the government in the east, simply washed entire neighborhoods out to sea. It's also -- we are getting more information on the situation. Some people are finally getting through and able to communicate out what the situation is. CNN was able to get through to a doctor from Benghazi, who made his way to Derna. He says that all hospitals are out of service. There are no emergency services. And people are, in his words, \"randomly\" working at the moment to pick up rotting bodies. So the death toll, at this point, we simply do not know. Libyan officials have been talking about 2,000, more than 2,000 dead already. But as we heard, perhaps 10,000 people are missing. Now aid is on the way. Turkiye has sent three airplanes, according to president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, with 167 search and rescue personnel as well as relief supplies. The government based in Tripoli has sent an airplane with emergency first responders as well as body bags to help out with the situation. Italy is sending, is dispatching a team from its civil defense ministry to assess the damage, to see what else can be done to help. But really, the details are only starting to emerge about how bad the situation is. And I, think unfortunately, we can expect more bad news as the situation becomes clearer.",

Now I don't think anybody is expecting any kind of statement or communique from either side. But certainly, what is going to be discussed behind closed doors and what will be decided behind closed doors is of great worry to both Seoul and Washington and others here in the region. So what we know at this point is that Kim Jong-un is in Russia. We have this footage where we can see him descending from the train in Khasan, which is just across the border in Russia itself. Now he was greeted by Russian officials. And you can see there he was greeted by the head of the ministry of natural resources. And he also went inside for a meeting with these Russian officials. So really, the first point of contact for this meeting that we are all expecting with Vladimir Putin. Now we don't know when this big meeting with the Russian president will happen. We've heard from the Kremlin it will be within a few days and that has been what we've been hearing for a couple of days now. We also don't know exactly where it will be. We understand that the train is still moving northwards, not necessarily headed to Vladivostok, according too speculation, but potentially to Vostochny (ph), which is where the space launch center is for the far east of Russia. We also know that this is an area that Vladimir Putin himself has said that he will be going to next after he leaves Vladivostok, saying he has a personal agenda there. So it does appear as though that may be one of the areas. And if it is, it is significant, because U.S. officials have said that they believe what North Korea could get out of any kind of arms deal is satellite technology. They have, a couple of times in the past few months, tried to put a military satellite into space and failed. So certainly it would be very interesting for Kim Jong-un to visit the space launch center, to be able to see the technology that Russia is using. And it would be that kind of interaction and that kind of giving up information that will worry Washington, Seoul and Tokyo greatly, because this is the deal that they believe will be taking place. U.S. officials also worry that Russia will give North Korea core missile and nuclear technology, which sanctions have prevented them from getting for many years. Now of course, when it comes to the other side, the assumption, again, from U.S. intelligence, backed up by South Korean intelligence is that Russia wants ammunition and it wants small arms for its fight in Ukraine.",

Israel's supreme court is the only check on the power, because, although Benjamin Netanyahu says that there are three branches of government, there are really essentially two. The government, the executive, and the parliament, which is run by the same party, and the supreme court. Now it is hard to ascertain how judges are going to rule just based off of what they say in court. They grill both sides but it has been interesting to hear them sort of ask some of these questions. One of the questions asked by one of the judges is, if only the people should decide, they're the ones in power, what if the government decides, we won't have elections for 10 years? We won't have elections for 20 years. Then who can be the check on power? And a key quote so far from the judges is democracy dies in a series of small steps.

Luis Rubiales is being summoned to testify in Spanish court this Friday. This is part of the investigation into his unwanted kiss of Jenni Hermoso at the Women's World Cup. Spain's national court just admitted a sexual assault complaint from prosecutors. Amanda Davies is joining me now. I have to say, suddenly, there feels like there is a head of steam in this once again. And we will see the man in question -- or at least hear from him -- in court on Friday. Amanda.",

And as you rightly said, this is now the latest in a chain of events after the judge admitted the complaint to investigate him for crimes of sexual assault and coercion on Monday. It's pretty much exactly 24 hours later that we are now getting this latest development, which is quite something. The world for the last time seeing him sitting down in that headline grabbing interview, giving his version of events, that the next time he will be seen publicly is in court. And the legal process is very much now going on. Now interestingly, this development has come just a few hours after Olga Carmona, the player who scored the winning goal at the World Cup final in Sydney, has sat down for her first television interview. And we've got some of that coming up in just a couple minutes in \"WORLD SPORT.\"",
