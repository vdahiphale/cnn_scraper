This is \"CNN Newsroom.\" Donald Trump ready to take on the presidency from Joe Biden, begins his transition process for his second term.Another interest rate cut boosts U.S. markets, but economists warn a second Trump presidency won't ease rising prices. (VIDEO PLAYNG) And powerful winds fuel destructive wildfires in Southern California scorching dozens of homes from their path. We begin here in the U.S. where we can finally project Donald Trump will win the battleground state of Nevada. Now that, of course, doesn't change the election outcome as Trump is reportedly reveling in his victory, feeling emboldened by winning the popular vote. Sources and aides tell CNN Trump feels he now has a mandate that most Americans want his policies. Meanwhile, the rush is on for the top jobs in the incoming Trump administration. And according to CNN's Kaitlan Collins, some discussions have morphed into all-out battles at his Mar-a-Lago resort. Other sources say Trump wants a staff that's competent but loyal. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, JR. DONALD TRUMP'S SON:  I'm gonna be heavily involved on the transition. I want to make sure now that we know who the real players are, the people who will actually deliver on the president's message, the people who don't think, that they know better than the duly elected president of the United States. (END VIDEO CLIP) BRUNHUBER:  Now first and perhaps most important of those jobs has already been decided. Trump has named his campaign co-chair, Susie Wiles, as White House chief of staff. The president-elect thanked her during his victory speech early Wednesday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, U.S. PRESIDENT-ELECT:  Let me also express my tremendous appreciation for Susie and Chris, the job you did. Susie. Come, Susie. Come here. Come here, Susie. Chris. Come here, Chris. Susie likes to stay sort of in the back, let me tell you. The ice maiden. We call her the ice maiden. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "More now from CNN's Kristen Holmes.KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday named his first White House position and potentially the most important one naming Susie Wiles, the chief of staff to the White House. She's actually going to be the first female chief of staff in the history of the country. She is somebody who has been loyal to him for years, somebody who served as his co-chair of his campaign, and somebody who was really there next to the former president and when he was -- saw Republicans across the party try to distance themselves from the former president. Now I do want to read you the statement that Donald Trump put out on his naming of Susie Wiles. He said, \"Susie Wiles just helped me achieve one of the greatest political victories in American history and it was integral part of both my 2016 and 2020 successful campaigns.\" President Trump said, \"Susie is tough, smart, innovative, and is universally admired and respected. Susie will continue to work tirelessly to make America great again. It is a well-deserved honor to have Susie as the first ever female chief of staff in United States history. I have no doubt that she will make our country proud.\" The one thing to keep in mind about Susie Wiles is that we have learned from sources that she did have some stipulations in taking this job. Essentially, saying that she wasn't -- she wanted to make sure she had control of the clown car, that they wouldn't have access to the White House at all times. And that is something that we saw in the first administration that these controversial outside figures who cause problems for Donald Trump had free reign at the White House. And something Susie did during the campaign was essentially try and stop that kind of chaos around former president Donald Trump. She always had said to sources that she knew she couldn't control candidate Trump. However, she felt she could control some of the people and circumstances around him. This really sets the tone for what the administration is going to look like. Susie is well-respected across the political spectrum. We'll obviously see how the rest of these namings, appointments, of putting forward candidates goes in the next several days. Kristen Holmes, CNN, West Palm Beach, Florida.",

Mr. Zelensky is there. The European leaders huddling and saying we have to be prepared to defend Ukraine ourselves. We have to step up our defense production, source from others, but all the signals point to United States not wanting to be the main supporter of Ukraine or the world's policeman for that matter. BRUNHUBER:  Alright. So as we heard in that report, Trump has boasted about getting a deal done in 24 hours. Obviously, Moscow, poured cold water on that idea.

I think a couple of things happening on the sidelines.As you know, Saudi Arabia is taking a much bigger role in the region, in the war in Ukraine. They're expected, actually, to hold a peace summit, the next peace summit in Saudi Arabia, for the first time with Russia and China and Ukraine there. So that could yield results, in whatever happens in Washington. The other, Kim, the other thing that gives me a bit of hope is, believe it or not, there are still a few grown-ups left in the room that Mr. Trump could tap and I'm thinking of people like Mike Pompeo, the former CIA director, former Secretary of State, former U.S. ambassador to NATO under George W., Mike -- sorry, Kurt Volker, and Richard Grenell, former US ambassador to Germany and a former Fox News contributor. So if you have, people like that advising him, maybe it'll bring a sense of sobriety and that, you know -- they will hopefully, hopefully convince him that if Mr. Putin is not pushed back, he will go further into Europe.

We saw that, for example, the BRICS summit calling the shots this year and last year.And I do think that if Chinese pragmatism is allowed to enter into this story, they're very, very keen to tap Ukrainian natural resources, to resume trade with Ukraine, and they do have a lot of sway over, Mr. Putin. I have always said if Mr. Xi Jinping called Mr. Putin today or tomorrow and said end the war in Ukraine, it will happen. So, hopefully, with the geopolitical kind of landscape shifting right now, it's not only going to be to a Mr. Trump to decide what goes on, but Trump, again, has to show that America is strong because blurred lines are the worst thing that you could present to a dictator, when it comes to Putin in Ukraine or Xi Jinping in in Taiwan.",

      "sentences": "Donald Trump has been clear that his first order of business is mass deportation. And now we are learning that quietly behind the scenes, Trump allies and some in the private sector have been preparing for exactly that, essentially detaining and deporting migrants on a large scale.Now, a key component of that is detention space. Of course, if their federal authorities arrest someone, they would also have to detain them before repatriating them to their home country. And the private sector is involved because the federal government often relies on contractors to manage these detention spaces. And that is part of the quiet preparations that are happening behind the scenes. And they are expected to ramp up in the days and weeks to come. But current and former officials, I've spoken with say that their -- the challenge here is also the money and the resources. That is why the federal government has not been able to do mass deportations in recent memory, in addition to other concerns, for example, the impact it would have on the economy. But practically speaking, the amount that it costs to apprehend, detain, process and remove an undocumented immigrant, according to some analysis, is nearly $11,000. That's for one individual. Now, a former official I spoke with said that to do something at a big scale the way that Donald Trump has said he wants to do would cost millions, if not billions of dollars and therefore would be difficult to execute on in addition to the need for example, for more personnel. Now, the Department of Homeland Security has reprogrammed funds before, essentially moving funds around to try to bolster their immigration enforcement. But again, doing something as big as mass deportation is costly. All the same, though, preparations sources say, are underway to try to execute on this part of the discussion being to focus on those undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes in the U.S. Another part of the discussion is whether to also include those undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children, known as DREAMers. Now, that segment of the undocumented population has typically had bipartisan support and some are protected, temporarily protected under an Obama-era program. But certainly a lot of discussion underway as to how this first order of business would look like one that Donald Trump has repeatedly talked about and has indicated that he intends on doing.
