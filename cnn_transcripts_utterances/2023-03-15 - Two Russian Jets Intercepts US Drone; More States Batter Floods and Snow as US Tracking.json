What we found is that the men have low and intermediate risk disease live a very, very long time.And the treatment does not seem to affect their survival.

The other thing that we found is that even men with metastasis do not necessarily die of prostate cancer. They live a very, very long time.

And what we hope is that our study provides information, both on the clinical aspects that Freddie just talked about and these patients reported outcomes, so that men can really consider the trade-offs between this issue of reducing the risk of cancer spread versus these side effects of treatments and really consider what's the best treatment for them in the long term, or even to consider whether they should have a test in the first place.",
