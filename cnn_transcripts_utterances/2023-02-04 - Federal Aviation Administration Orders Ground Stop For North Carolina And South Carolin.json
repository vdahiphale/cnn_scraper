A huge area, 20,000 square miles, and that includes the coastline, and of course, what, generally about 14 miles of waterways along the coastline, which is U.S. territory before hitting international waters. And a lot of the airplane activity is flying along the coast, it's not just an issue of flying in and out of an airport, but it's using that space to navigate.",

Florida is a big destination for any airline, especially in the middle of the wintertime. So this is going to have an impact beyond just these three airports. This will impact flights going up and down the coast. But this looks to me, and I'm just looking at the depiction now, that this goes well beyond the borders of international airspace. This starts to actually go into -- from U.S. airspace into international airspace. So the FAA is just trying to make sure that nothing going north and south or under this big box of airspace, including the coastline, could possibly be impacted by a possible targeted shoot-down of this balloon, if that's indeed what we're going to see take place here.",

Because now we're talking about, obviously, domestic airways, but even beyond that, international aircraft that are now all impacted by what is to come. And we still are not clear what's to come.

And when I envision all that you just described about the possibilities, it sure seems like the window would have to be much bigger than that.

So there will be a lot of military aviation back and forth. And the military and civilian aviation, when they're on a mission, don't mix too well. So I would assume that until it is safely down, out of the sky and just simply coming down from 60,000 feet, it takes several minutes. So then they're going to have to collect it. So I would imagine it's possible that the stop might be expanded.",

But it wasn't that long ago when the press pool, White House press pool asked him, what are you going to do about this balloon? And he says, we'll take care of it, if I'm quoting there properly. And now, not long after that, we're hearing about this temporary flight restriction in place, 20,000 square miles impacted.

      "sentences": "Yes, Fred. So the president has been weighing, along with his military advisers, for the last couple of days, of course, since they found out about this balloon, what to do about it. Do you just let it float away? Do you actively shoot it down? Do you try to take it down through some other mechanism and then take it apart and see what kind of equipment it has inside of it?This has been the context and the subject of all of the calls and meetings that he's been having over the last several days with his national security team. And we were told yesterday is that even though he was originally advised against shooting down the balloon because of the risk that it potentially posed to civilians on the ground, that option was actually never taken off the table. But the issue, of course, as has been mentioned, was taking it down over land where it could potentially hit a building or civilians. So now that it seems that it is going over water the president probably felt more confident saying that he was going to take care of it. Now, remember that he has been under intense pressure by Republicans on the Hill to do something about this balloon. They have been calling on him to shoot it down. They have been saying that his administration is weak on China, that this is a violation of American airspace and that it cannot be just kind of swept under the rug and let the balloon just fly away. And so he has been under intense pressure to do something, not only because of the partisan pressure that he's getting from there, but also because of the very rocky relationship that the U.S. currently has, of course, with the Chinese government. The secretary of state was scheduled to visit Beijing and to meet with potentially Xi Jinping there, the Chinese leader. But now we know that they want to do something that is going to send a message to the Chinese that this is not acceptable. So canceling the trip, shooting down this balloon, those are two major ways that the administration can signal to the Chinese, look, we are not happy about this. We know it's happened before, but this time this balloon has been over our territory for way too long, and we're going to do something about it, Fred.",

And look, geographically, especially by driving distance, we're closing to Myrtle Beach and to Charleston, to other airports that have the ground stop right now along the Carolina coastline.Here in Charlotte late this morning is when people started to spot the balloon in the sky. Earlier in the morning, around in the 8:00 a.m. hour, we started seeing people tracking it as it came into the airspace here in North Carolina in Asheville, and we sort of watched it as it has gone toward the east here, down into the South Carolina area. Look, we've seen a lot of people posting it online. It's a very clear day here so they've been able to get very good pictures, some bad little iPhone pictures, but also some very clear pictures of the balloon, of any sort of planes that people have spotted around it as well. We've actually had people who have now been sending me photos from South Carolina near the coastline there, in Conway, South Carolina, saying they're starting to see it in their sky there as well. We've also had law enforcement, of course, some of these are tongue- in-cheek posts, but also asking people, look, we know there's a lot of attention, people are a little surprised when they've seen in. Please don't call 911 and clog up emergency services. They know it. They can look up in the sky, too, and see it. No need to alert authorities locally. And also, again, tongue-in-cheek, but it's real, please do not try and take matters into your own hand. Several different sheriff's departments and police departments, Gastonia in North Carolina, York County, South Carolina, Boone, North Carolina, asking people not to take matters into their own hands. Please do not shoot at the balloon. It is far too high in the sky for you to reach it, and it could become dangerous for anybody on the ground, because what goes up, in the words of York County Sheriff's Office, must come down, including your bullets. So that's essentially what they're doing here, telling people, look, if you see it and you feel the need, post your own pictures, take pictures of it. But there's nothing for people on the ground to do except for essentially look up in the sky and see it pass. We're seeing a lot of interest, though, a lot of posts on social media. We're here in Charlotte, and there are people walking by just a little bit ago talking about how they saw it earlier this morning and wondering what the United States is going to do as it gets closer to the coastline here in the Carolinas, Fred.",

But there it is.And so the fact that the foreign ministry apologized for it yesterday and called it a weather balloon, that's sort of typical miscommunication given by governments when something is done as a secret project and the foreign ministry is not engaged in it.

You could back that up with Naval vessels offshore using one of their surface-to-air missiles.But I think in terms of keeping an eye on things and having a good grip on the circumstances, it's probably wiser to use aircraft. Probably have a couple that come in relatively close, five, 10 miles. Probably have another pair standing off further. This is a big balloon, and normally balloons like this are not as easy to bring down as you think. It's not like a circus balloon where you stick a pin in it and it pops and it's over. This balloon could be self-sealing. It could have extra gas and cylinders in it. It's a big thing. And so we want to make sure we can get it down.

It corresponds to what the Pentagon has been saying. Now, we've been trying to get any sort of official reaction from either of these two governments, Colombia and Costa Rica.

Now that the U.S. confirms and a U.S. official tells CNN President Biden approved this decision, now that the balloon has been downed with its payload, the question, what intelligence is there to gather? The U.S. had said, the Pentagon had said, for that matter, that this was maneuverable, it had the ability to loiter. It had capabilities well beyond what a, quote-unquote, weather balloon would have had. Now it's the U.S.'s turn to do its own series of intelligence gathering, to collect its own information about whatever it can gather from this spy balloon now that it has been downed and fallen from 60,000 feet down into the ocean below off the coast of South Carolina there. It is worth noting there that the temporary flight restriction that the U.S. had put in place around this military operation has expired, so the airspace is open, although there still is a ground stop. That gives you an idea of how carefully this was timed from all the assets, including the military assets we were watching a bit earlier today.

It doesn't look like there is, but obviously we're waiting for more information, and we'll pass that along as it comes in.

[14:55:16] The biggest area of restricted airspace in the continental U.S. So we see exactly why that was put into place here now that we know this balloon was apparently shot down at the order of President Joe Biden. This is a very interesting area as well, because this is not too far away from some really key military bases where many fast fighter jets are placed. That includes Norfolk where the Navy has Naval Air Station Oceana, Super Hornets there. Of course there is also the F-22 out of Joint Base Langley-Eustis. So this is clearly a bit of a strategic move as well, although the goal was by the FAA to essentially protect the airspace below this apparent shoot-down. This balloon we know from the Pentagon was cruising at an altitude of 60,000 feet, which is very high. It's about twice the altitude of a commercial airliner, usually between 30,000 and 40,000 feet. And they wanted to protect that area off the coast of North and South Carolina to make sure that if any debris was to fall from this, it would not fall on airplanes below. There is still a bit of a trickle-down here, apparently, according to the latest alert from the FAA, that the ground stop will remain in place at those three airports until 5:15. So that could have a bit of a trickle-down on flights up and down the east coast as well. A lot of people going to and from Florida on a Saturday in the middle of the winter. We'll see how this impacts air travel going on and going forward. So far, no major delays or cancellations just yet, although we're seeing the layers of coordination that took place here, not only from the Department of Defense, but also from the Federal Aviation Administration, simply to clear the airspace to make sure that this operation could take place in a safe manner.
