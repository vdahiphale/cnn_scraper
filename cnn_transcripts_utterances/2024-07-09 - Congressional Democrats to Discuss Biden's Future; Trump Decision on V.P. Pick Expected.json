Look, I mean, what I'm watching for is Joe Biden. I mean, the -- I think Molly put her finger on it. It's that what the White House wants to treat the debate performance as if it was like Bill Clinton and an intern. An event in the past that will shrink in the rearview mirror as you move on. The problem is the event is Joe Biden. Joe Biden is not going to get better. And the assumption is that, like, somehow he will not have another distressing event in public or around enough people in private that they can't keep it secret. I've watched two parents go at that age or younger. I have lots of friends in similar situation, I have two in-laws who went in similar situations. The idea that Joe Biden can run for president and reassure everybody -- everyone says go out more, do -- go out more, do more stuff, do more live interviews. Every good interview doesn't mean a thing if you know there's one really bad one coming. And the idea that you're going to bet that there's not a really bad one coming from a guy who says when he has a good interview, he needs to get more sleep and do fewer things after 8 p.m., is a wildly irresponsible bet for the country and for the Democratic Party.",
