We are going to give you, when I say we, we have a representative from the FBI, from the Secret Service, from the State Attorney's Office.We are going to give you everything we have. Everything. All right? So when we get done, think about your questions because we're not going to take a lot. And keep them to the information that you heard. Don't get into what ifs and because of this. We're not gonna go there, all right? So keep that in mind and we'll be good. So here we go. All right, 1:30 this afternoon, call came out, shots fired. That was called in by the Secret Service. Because we're in constant contact with them all the time, we were notified of that and we had units here that immediately sealed off the area. Fortunately, we were able to locate a witness that came to us and said, hey, I saw the guy running out of the bushes. He jumped into a black Nissan, and I took a picture of the vehicle and the tag, which was great. So we had that information, our real time crime center put it out to the license plate readers. And we were able to get a hit on that vehicle on I-95 as it was headed into Martin County. We got a hold of Martin County Sheriff's Office, alerted them, and they spotted the vehicle and pulled it over and detained the guy. After that, we took the victim, I'm sorry, the witness that witnessed the incident, flew him up there and he identified as the person that he saw running out of the bushes that jumped into the car. Now, in the bushes where this guy was is an AK-47 style rifle with a scope, two backpacks which were hung on the fence that had a ceramic tile in them, and a GoPro which he was going to take pictures of. So those are being processed right now. The Secret Service agent that was on the course did a fantastic job. What they do is they have an agent that jumps one hole ahead of time to where the President was at. And he was able to spot this rifle barrel sticking out of the fence and immediately engage that individual, at which time the individual took off. So that's what we know about the investigation. We have somebody in custody right now that is a potential suspect. We got a little bit more work to do on it. But as we usually do, as soon as we decide that we're gonna book him into the county jail and the charges that he's gonna be booked into, we'll get those to you and we'll get a picture of him and we'll get you his background. So now I'm gonna turn it over to the representative of the Secret Service and he's gonna make a brief statement.",

And the suspect with this AK-47 style rifle.And we did learn it did have a scope. So even though he was 300 to 500 yards away from Trump, with the law enforcement we just heard from this briefing, that is not a far distance for this type of AK-47 with a scope, which is pretty chilling when you think about that.

What you heard from the Palm Beach County Sheriff, what you heard from Secret Service there, and they basically confirmed CNN's reporting but also gave us a few more details, which is that a witness was later was able to identify the person that they have taken into custody. They referred to him as a potential suspect. They said that he fled from the bushes outside of Trump's course after he was -- after the Secret Service had engaged him.And what they said was that the Secret Service basically, when Trump is golfing, they travel one hole, one or two holes ahead of him in a protective measure. And a Secret Service agent was able to see the barrel of the rifle, that AK-47 that they later found in the bushes, sticking out from those bushes and then engaged with this person who then dropped the gun apparently and ran and jumped into what they said was a black Nissan. A witness was later able to confirm that yes, the person they later apprehended in that Nissan was the person they saw running out of the bushes and Wolf, they said that they found in the bushes, not only that AK-47 gun with the scope as you noted there, but also two backpacks and a GoPro that the sheriff then followed up and said was attached to the fence. So the person apparently intent on recording whatever was happening there in that. And it's just remarkable that an agent was able to see that rifle barrel, to engage with this person before Donald Trump came up to that hole on this golf course. They said the Secret Service did exactly what they should. That person is in custody. And a remarkable statement there when a reporter asked the Secret Service official who was on hand about security measures being ramped up after what happened in Butler, Pennsylvania.

And with a scope, you can actually target someone for assassination. The FBI is now calling this, Andrew, an attempted assassination.

With this point, we still have not unearthed a very clear -- I mean, clearly, he was trying to kill Donald Trump, but a strong ideological reason for doing so they haven't been able to identify that yet. So we'll see if we find that here.But no question, Wolf, you're absolutely right. The presence of the GoPro is an effort to preserve the images of this attack so that the shooter could use that for some purpose in the future. Either to pump up his own image and glorification online, things of that nature. We know that mass shooters do that a lot. It's very important to them to communicate their success, their attack online, may have just been that, or it may have been some ideologically motivated, politically motivated act.

But absolutely, the FBI would be the lead agency.And that doesn't mean they'll do it by themselves. They clearly will work very closely with the Secret Service and also with the Palm Beach County and Martin County Sheriff's Offices. But you will see the Bureau kind of taking the kind of the lead role on the execution of search warrants, the collection of evidence, preservation of evidence.

And what's remarkable about this is they were talking about the three roads that are the access points.The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office is right there to your top right, a little bit above where Hole 5 is. The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office and the jail actually backs up to Donald Trump's golf course in West Palm Beach, Florida. And just to give you a sense of what we were looking at on the ground and how quickly officials were able to move here and they put out that \"be on the lookout\" alert for the person that the witness luckily was able to see a person leaving the bushes, emerging and getting into a black car and then driving, which they apprehended on I-95 just north of Palm Beach County, and what we're looking at here on this image. And so, John Miller, when you look at this and what we've heard from officials, they would not say outright that they have a suspect in custody, but the sheriff said, John Miller, that they have a potential suspect in custody. And so, when that is the case and they have someone that they are obviously questioning, what we were told earlier is that this person has not made any statements yet, but they did describe a calm demeanor earlier when we were hearing from the Martin County Sheriff about actually apprehending this person and turning them over to the FBI, what does this look like behind the scenes right now?",

      "sentences": "Well, he is definitely a suspect and he is definitely in custody. And all the qualifiers that law enforcement uses, potential suspect, person of interest, once the state's attorney took the podium at the press conference and said, we are preparing charges and we are preparing for a detention hearing where they're going to argue that this suspect is dangerous and a flight risk, that means he is on his way to being charged here.Some of the mechanics behind that, Kaitlan, were there was that witness on the scene that we've all talked about. He snapped that picture. He saw that person. And there's a Secret Service agent who may have confronted him and seen him as well. But that witness was brought to the scene and they did what we call a show up where, you know, they have him in a vehicle where he can look out at the person in custody and he's asked, is that the person you saw? And he answered in the affirmative, we are told by law enforcement sources, as he did that show up, and they then took him into custody, impounded that car and so on. Um, there are, you know, two different stories in the forefront here. One, as Jonathan Wackrow really well explained, is a combination of old-fashioned police work, shoe leather, grab a witness, combined with modern technology, here's a picture, here's a plate, put it into the LPR, License Plate Reader system, look for the first hit, it hits on 95. RTCC, the Real-Time Crime Center, is spinning the registered owner of that car, who it belongs to. All of this is happening rapidly. And Martin County, which hasn't waited, it has already flooded 95 looking for that car heading south with units, then does that vehicle containment technique. They block the car in on three sides, come out with long guns. And when the sheriff describes -- the sheriff's (INAUDIBLE) of Martin County describes his calm demeanor, we have to put that in context. When the suspect gets out of that Nissan vehicle, he is looking at multiple AR-15s and hand guns pointed at him from multiple directions in this vehicle containment technique where they've blocked him in on three sides. So, he can be nothing but calm, and he was compliant with the commands they gave him, and then he was taken into custody. So, a lot went right today. A lot came together.",

      "sentences": "There's no question, Kaitlan. You know, Jonathan mentioned this a little bit earlier. This whole setup indicates a very high level of pre-planning. And that is done because this person, whoever he is, clearly had the capacity to engage in that sort of structured and organized thought, which is a big piece of this because that will undermine and that can undermine a lot of different defenses at trial.So, you have someone who had the wherewithal, the financial ability and the kind of cognitive ability to go out and acquire these things: the weapon, the backpacks, the ceramic plates. If those are, in fact, ceramic plates, ceramic plates are used to augment a bulletproof vest to make it resist actually high-powered rifle bullets. So, this is someone who went through a lot of effort to really plan this out. I think we also have to remember that they somehow knew where to go. They had some indication maybe that Trump was playing golf on this day. We don't know that for a fact yet, but that's something that investigators are going to be looking for. Obviously, picked this location as one of tactical advantage, likely because of the cover provided by the -- by the foliage and the bushes that he was hiding himself with. Probably had some advanced knowledge of how the golf courses laid out and where the former president would be proceeding from one hole to another. So, this is all a very high degree of planning, which is great evidence for the prosecution. And finally, just recovering these backpacks with the stuff in them and the vehicle that he was driving in when he was arrested. You have a gold mine of evidence here, forensic evidence, that will tie, likely, this person they arrested to that backpack in that place with the weapon at the same time. So, all those little pieces come together. They all seem to be likely lining up in a very damning way for this person, and that's what the investigators and the prosecutors should be looking at next.",

They said at the briefing that the suspect with his rifle, the AK-47 with a scope, was between 300 and 500 yards away from Trump. But then they said that is not a far distance given the capability of this AK-47 with a scope. You agree with that, that that's not a far distance?",

It's still going to require some degree of training and practice on the part of the shooter, but that's not hard to do in this country, right? A lot of people engage in that sort of stuff, shooting sports and things like that.So, yeah, this is definitely a possible shot for a decently trained marksman. So -- and it has also been done before. Let's not forget that in 2011, you had Oscar Romero Ortega Hernandez, who fired seven shots at the White House from Constitution Avenue or at least he hit the White House seven times and actually hit some of the windows of the residence on the second floor. We don't know that he actually saw any person or was aiming at a human being, may have just been taking advantage of, you know, trying to get lucky. But this idea of shooters trying to waylay presidents from a far-off distance is not something new. We have experienced this before in this country. This is an element of political violence that we are familiar with. And so, yeah, these things are possible. We live in a very dangerous world, as the sheriff mentioned. And the easy ability that anyone has to put their hands on an AK-47 or an AR-15 or a hunting rifle for that matter makes this particular threat very important for people like the Secret Service and other security professionals to think about.",

      "sentences": "Well, Kaitlan, this investigation is still very much in the early stages and very much underway. In fact, just a moment ago, before we came on camera here, there was a Palm Beach County sheriff's crime scene van just pulling out of Trump International Golf Club, which is right behind me there. That's the entrance that you see to the golf club where this all happened today.So, they clearly are still on the scene, still trying to figure out exactly what happened, looking for any clues, perhaps anything that was left behind by this alleged gunman and also perhaps from the Secret Service after they had fired their weapons in his direction. So, still very much underway here in terms of the investigation. But, Kaitlan, I should tell you, this is a 27-hole golf course. So, what stands out to me from that press conference and the information that we're getting is that they were able to -- the Secret Service was able to see that -- the barrel of the gun coming through that fence between sometime around holes five or six. That is remarkable because this golf course is known for its rolling hills. There's certainly a lot of bunkers, but certainly a lot of cover. So, this gunman certainly was somewhere where he thought he wasn't going to be seen, apparently. Certainly, didn't come through the front gate. There's a large police presence here and security at the front gate of the International Golf Club. So certainly, he was along the perimeter of it. And I can tell you that right away, they were able to say, once they apprehended him, that there was no threat to the public. That was very important because there's an elementary school right nearby. There's also a public library right nearby. And as you know, he was apprehended in Martin County, which is about an hour north of here. And we're just minutes away from Interstate 95 so he was able to make that quick getaway. Luckily, a witness was able to tell authorities what his card looked like and even provide those photos, as we heard in the press conference. But certainly, still quite a bit of law enforcement presence. It took me about an hour and a half to get here. It normally takes me about 25 minutes. So, there was a lot of police, a lot of barricades along the way, and that still is the case now even though we know that Mar-a- Lago is just about 10 minutes from here, Kaitlan, and we know that the former president has left the golf club and we watched the motorcade depart here. So, he apparently is safely back at Mar-a-Lago but still certainly a lot -- a lot to be figured out here in terms of what it went down today. Kaitlan? COLLINS: Yeah. Randi Kaye, I was told that the Donald Trump is back at his Mar-a-Lago club. Obviously, as you know, about a 15 to 20-minute drive from where that golf course is. Randi Kaye, thank you for that.

I'm pretty sure that the person they have in custody is the one that they found there at the -- at the golf course. So, all they feel pretty confident around that and that's why they make a statement like that.So, again, it is just very fortunate that everything worked very well. That witness cannot get enough credit because they saw that individual leave the bushes and they had the presence of mind to take a photograph so they have not only a description of the car but the actual license tag. And through Real Time Crime Center, of course, they're able to run that very quickly and put a bolo out. That's how he was captured so quickly. But there are still questions. I mean, when you look at that map, and I'm not familiar with that area at all, but you can see the roadways that go very close to that and that there was no one guarding that perimeter at all. And I just -- it just makes me wonder if that's something obviously in the future that needs to be taken into consideration. It doesn't look like it would be very difficult to do or make a very manpower intensive looking at that sight line, having a couple cars on either end just to make sure no one parks a car, only gets out of a car, or anything like that when you have the former president on the golf course.",
