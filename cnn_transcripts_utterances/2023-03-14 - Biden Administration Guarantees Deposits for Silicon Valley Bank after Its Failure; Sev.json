We have more on that ahead.But we're going to begin this morning with the growing concern for America's banks. We are watching the fallout spread from the biggest bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis. Stocks of more than two dozen regional banks plummeted yesterday even after President Biden came out and took emergency action to ease the panic. We are closely watching Wall Street this morning to see if they can rebound. The credit ratings firm Moody's has now said these six banks that you see here on the screen are on watch for potential downgrades, citing, quote, \"extremely volatile funding conditions.\" Meanwhile, the Biden administration has been scrambling to contain the situation and prevent other banks from collapsing. Yesterday, Silicon Valley Bank customers, as you can see here, lined up to get their money back after President Biden guaranteed their deposits following that bank's failure. Joining us now for perspective on this is Roger Altman who served as the deputy treasury secretary in the Clinton administration and is also the founder of Evercore, which is an investment banking advisory firm, so the perfect person to be here today, and good morning. I want to get your reaction, though, first to some breaking news that we are getting. Senator Elizabeth Warren is now saying that she believes the Fed Chair Jay Powell should recuse himself from their internal review of the regulation and supervision of SVB. She argues that for it to have any credibility he must publicly and immediately recuse himself because he played a role in this, she says, by boosting their profits by loading up on risk directly contributing to these banks' failures. Do you agree with that?",

I don't think Chairman Powell is personally responsible for any of this, though I don't think he should be forced to recuse himself. But the main point that she has been making, which is a different one than you just cited, I do agree with her on. We need tighter regulation, and the decision four years ago by the president and the Congress to lighten up on it and to roll back Dodd-Frank was a big mistake and had a lot to do with this.",

      "sentences": "Well, the term \"bailout\" is, obviously, a loaded one. And I t's in the eye of the beholder. It's like one person's sees something and thinks it is a catastrophe, another person sees the same thing and things it's a small accident. But the main point here is that the rescues of 2008 and 2009 which we all remember so vividly became ferociously unpopular, one of the most unpopular things that the federal government has done in 50 or 100 years. Many people think they led to the growth of the Tea Party and the growth of the MAGA movement, and so forth. And therefore, the administration today doesn't want to get within 100 miles of that term \"bailout.\"Now, what the authorities did over the weekend was absolutely profound. They guaranteed the deposits, all of them, at Silicon Valley Bank. And what that really means, and they won't say it, and I'll come back to that, what that really means is that they have guaranteed the entire deposit base of the U.S. financial system, the entire deposit base. Why? Because you can't guarantee all the deposits in Silicon Valley Bank and then the next day say to the depositors, say at First Republic, sorry, yours aren't guaranteed. Of course they are. And so this is a breathtaking step which effectively nationalizes or federalizes the deposit base of the U.S. financial system. You can call it a bailout, you can call it something else, but it's really absolutely profound. Now, the authorities, including the White House, are not going to say that, because what I just said of course implies that they have just nationalized the banking system. And technically speaking, they haven't. But in a broad sense, they are verging on that. By the way, the shareholders in Silicon Valley Bank, obviously, lost all their money. And therefore, if you are a shareholder at First Republic or some of the other banks that you showed on your screen a few minutes ago, you are concerned because you saw that at Silicon Valley Bank the shareholders were wiped out. But the depositors at those institutions have nothing to worry about because they have just been guaranteed.",

Usually, the term \"nationalization\" means that the government takes over the institution and runs it and the government owns it. That would be the type of nationalization we have seen in many other countries around the world. Obviously, that did not happen here. When you guarantee the entire deposit base, you have put the federal government and the taxpayer in a much different place in terms of protection than we were in a week ago.",

What you are seeing behind me is actually is a salt barn in Worcester, Massachusetts, and this is where they house the salt and brine that treats the roadways across the county within this area. And literally just within this past hour we have gone from a very, very cold rain to very heavy wet snowfall. You can literally see, I could squeeze out droplets of water from this as these dump trucks continue to line the plows with the available salt.Now, the concern going forward for this area is that this -- I am going to step down quickly so my cameraman can follow me, is that this is starting to accumulate so quickly. The National Weather Service saying two to three inches per hour. We are definitely realizing that here. And when you start to combine that with the 50 to 60-mile-per- hour winds that we are expecting, that is when we anticipate power outages to go up. Here are some of the salt trucks right now passing through, again, starting to treat the roadways here. And power outages already topping 100,000 for many customers across New England. We have a ground stop. Let's take you to LaGuardia so you can see what it looks like there. This is because they are busy de-icing the runways and the planes there as the cold air wraps in behind the system and we start to see this transition from what was rain to now these massive snowflakes that are piling up very fast and very furious. Just talking to the local meteorologists here on the ground, and they are concerned about that sharp gradient about who gets the impacts and who doesn't. Boston, your rain likely to stay rain the majority of this event. But you move inland and that's where the snow piles up, up two feet north and west where I am located.",

They are suing Rite Aid, arguing that they have violated the Controlled Substances Act by filling hundreds of thousands of prescriptions improperly for controlled substances, including opioids. They argue that the chain was ignoring red flags.

They say specifically, the chain ignored what is called the Trinity. Prescriptions for excessive quantities of opioids such as oxycodone, and fentanyl.
