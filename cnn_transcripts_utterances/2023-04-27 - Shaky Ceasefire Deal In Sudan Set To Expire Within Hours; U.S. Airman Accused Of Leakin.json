Saudi Arabia's U.K. ambassador joins me here in London to discuss evacuations as well as diplomacy. Then, the U.S. Airman accused of leaking classified information is in court right now. What we've learned from prosecutors. And then remembering a cultural pioneer. Jerry Springer changed the face of talk television, he's passed away at the age of 79. But first this evening, we start in Sudan, because there are just a few hours left of course before a ceasefire deal expires in the country. And although international diplomats are trying to broker an extension, every truce so far has been shattered by gunfire as well as explosions. And this is what ceasefire meant. Have a listen.

Witnesses are reporting new clashes between Sudan's army as well as paramilitary force.But many fear with no truce in place at all, the violence could spiral into an all-out war that could destabilize, and this is very important, the entire region. Remember foreign governments are still racing to evacuate their nationals in what's become one of the biggest such efforts since Afghanistan fell to the Taliban back in 2021. But for many Sudanese who want to escape, they are on their own. This group walked through the desert to reach Chad, other Sudanese and foreigners are heading east, to the Port Sudan, where they're awaiting evacuations. One Syrian man says it's been a terrifying ordeal. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  We were living in Khartoum, the situation there is extremely bad. So bad. Thank God we managed to get out. We just want to leave safely and to go to Jeddah or to Syria. We just want to get out of Sudan. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Saudi Arabia's ambassador tothe U.K., Khalid bin Bandar al Saud who is with me now. Ambassador, thank you very much for taking the time to speak to us. This time roughly yesterday on my show, we showed exactly those images of so many people arriving in Saudi Arabia, the kingdom welcoming them there with sweets and flowers. It's a huge -- been a huge operation. The majority, from what I saw were either Saudi nationals or foreigners. Is Saudi Arabia going to welcome Sudanese refugees? KHALID BIN BANDAR AL SAUD, SAUDI ARABIA AMBASSADOR TO THE U.K.:  Evening, Isa, thank you for having me. (CLEARS THROAT) We're working on that now, and working on the details. Thus far, we had the last ship arrive about an hour ago which brings the number now to just over 2,700, roughly just over 100 have been Saudis. So it shows you the majority are actually international citizens and from all sorts of nations, over 76 nations now we've evacuated people from. It's obviously more complicated dealing with Sudanese nationals and what government are you dealing with at the time? That's part of the discussions and negotiations we're having.",

It seems to have happened possibly at some point in March, as far as we can tell in Medvedivka, in Crimea, unclear if it's emptied out, because the Russians are concerned that key assets might be cut off in Crimea if indeed Ukraine's counteroffensive is successful in moving south and potentially cutting that peninsula off from the rest of occupied Ukraine or, as simply, as you said, they're being moved towards the frontlines to potentially assist Russia in their defense here. You mentioned also too, suggestions that Russia's armed forces are in fact, larger than they were at the start of the war, that's possibly true. We don't have a clear readout as to how the mobilization campaigns in Russia have actually been successful. But it's a case of really, I think quantity versus quality. Yes, it's quite likely, Russia have managed to send to the front tens of thousands, possibly of convicts working for the Wagner Mercenary Group and then many freshly mobilized individuals too. But do they have training? Do they have equipment? And do they frankly, have a plan that leads them potentially towards success? That's long been Russia's problem since the beginning of their invasion well over a year ago now. There are things they thought they could do, they've not been able to do. And so, as we see evidence growing that Ukraine's counteroffensive may be imminent, nothing said publicly at all, but signs in the attacks that have been reported in the east of the Dnipro River in Kherson region by Ukrainian forces, and also suggestions to in the area of Zaporizhzhia where I am, that things may at some point soon be afoot. The ultimate question is Russia's mass of forces poorly equipped, possibly poorly commanded as they are with the extraordinary elaborate array of trench defenses they've dug to try and keep Ukrainian forces at bay. Will they find that sort of older type of defense successful against Ukraine's military? Which have been supplied a lot of higher-end NATO weaponry at this point. NATO training as well, is Kyiv essentially able to capitalize upon that and execute something successful in  the months ahead, or are we going to see a slow, brutal, and bloody battle of attrition in the weeks ahead?

You know, it is rare that a foreign leader is able to address a joint session of Congress, Yoon was only the second one during the Biden administration, he was the first South Korean president to address Congress in 10 years. And you really did hear him describe the importance of the United States to the history of South Korea. And that's so important because some members of his audience, particularly Republicans, there is this growing strain of isolationism within that party. And I think he really tried to emphasize how much the United States played a role in South Korea's development over the last 70 years. He talked about, you know, missionaries going in the 19th century. He talked about the Korean war and the importance of the United States' intervention there. And he even brought it up to today, talking about all of these cultural references, like K-Pop, like the movie \"Parasite\", to really describe how the United States had helped advance this country over the years. And of course, his message was not without current meaning. Of course, the United States, the big part of his visit was emphasizing its commitment to protect South Korea from its neighbor in the north, from North Korea, that was part of the agreement that he signed yesterday with President Biden at the White House. And so, I think, you know, North Korea does have a general bipartisan consensus that it needs to be countered in Congress.

OPPMANN (voice-over):  Elsewhere in the country, violent crime is on the rise, too. The U.N. says crime has more than doubled in the past year, with gangs controlling large parts of the country, including residential areas.

ENVOY TO HAITI:  Children are among the victims of the most heinous crimes, including killings, kidnappings and rape. Over the last three months, school children have been hit by bullets while sitting in their classrooms and kidnapped when being dropped off at school.
