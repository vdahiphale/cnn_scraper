As you can hear around me, there's a protest that has started here in the last few minutes as same organizers who have been involved in the protests over the past couple of weeks that ultimately culminated in the NYPD coming onto campus at the request of the school last night, arresting more than 200 people.You asked about those outside agitators that the mayor claims are leading a lot of the efforts as part of this protest. I interviewed one of the protesters who was handcuffed last night just outside of Hamilton Hall where we're standing. She told me, that is a lie. That she is a student here at Columbia, a grad student she says. The vast majority of the people that she has been in contact with her fellow protesters are also affiliated with Columbia. We just heard a press conference here led by faculty of Columbia who were extremely critical of the administration, and the president of the school saying that they should never have called in the NYPD, that they were not negotiating in good faith with the protesters. And they claim what happened last night was police brutality. We are seeing a lot of signs you can see criticizing Shafik, the president of the school, as well as signs that say cops off our campus. Clearly the message is that last night and the NYPD's actions did not end the protest action here at Columbia. So we'll see what the coming hours bring here. To be clear, this is a peaceful protest. We're on a public sidewalk. I do want to show you, walk over. Where we are standing, there were a lot of NYPD officers here just a few minutes ago when you can see they're standing by. This is happening in public, it is peaceful, but they have been called in by Columbia. And they will remain here until May 17th after graduation to maintain the order as the school and the city has put it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And, of course, the six week point of a pregnancy is before many women even realize that they are pregnant.A new CNN polling out today shows how Americans are feeling about abortion laws nationwide. Nearly two years after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade rolling back federal abortion rights. The polling found a two thirds majority of Americans, 65 percent, oppose the decision. And if you go ahead and break this down by party, nearly all Democrats disapprove and so do a large swath of Independent voters. Now, when it comes to how Americans feel about abortion laws in their own state, a little less than half say the laws are currently about right. But in the states where abortion is currently banned, more than half of adults between the ages of 18 and 44 think that their state abortion laws are too restrictive. CNN's polling also found a majority of voters are unhappy with President Biden's handling of abortion policy, although his approval grows to 62 percent among those who want to see abortion access protected nationally. Nearly half of Americans, 49 percent want to see federal lawmakers protect access to abortion nationwide. And most Americans say they believe that Biden will work to enact national laws ensuring access to abortion if he's reelected, while the majority say they think Trump will be leaving abortion laws to the states, if he wins. And in an interview that Trump just did with Time Magazine, that's exactly what he suggested could happen. He was asked about if he would veto a Republican proposed bill saying the right to life extends to the moment of fertilization. He said, \"I don't have to do anything about vetoes because we now have it back at the states.\" What is clear, though, is that abortion is going to be a factor in the 2024 election. You probably already see that but we're knowing it here, 55 percent more than half of voters say abortion is one of several factors that will be affecting who they choose at the polls. And for nearly a quarter of Americans, it is going to be a decisive factor. They say that they will only support a candidate who shares their views on abortion, Alex?",
