Now he's paying a price legally in the courts. And here's why, Michael, Jack Smith was asking the Supreme Court to take the case direct from the District Court. That's a rare proceeding. It's not never done, but it's rarely done.But as such, Jack Smith legally bore the burden of proving two things. One, the case was very important. That part was easy. That part was uncontested. Of course, this case is very important. But number two is that there's a specific need to expedite a specific need for speed. And because Jack Smith remains stubbornly unwilling to say, I want to try this case before the election. Instead, in both of his briefs, his first brief and then his reply brief. He's just left with this sort of mealy mouthed gibberish, where he says, well, delay is bad, and speed is good, upmost importance and that kind of thing. And Donald Trump's team seized on that they said he has failed. He has failed to meet his legal burden to give a specific reason why expedition is necessary. And we don't know exactly why he lost. We got a one line ruling out of the Supreme Court, but they denied him.",

Because in the prosecutorial platonic ideal, Jack Smith would not be thinking about the election date at all, because to consider the election date violates long standing DOJ policy and practice written and unwritten. But given the obvious reality, which any common sense person can see that he is thinking about the election date. My advice would be and he can take this or leave this, admit it. Let's just drop the subterfuge and the artifice.Let's just say what everybody knows you're doing. And I think the most palatable way to phrase that, the least political way is to say if Donald Trump gets elected under long standing DOJ policy, he can't be tried. And that means we would have this trial put on hold for four years until January of 2029. In at which point, we would lose witnesses, we would lose evidence. I mean, a four year delay, it makes it really unpalatable to try a case in 2029. So I think given the position Jack Smith has put himself in, he should just acknowledge it, and he should phrase it in terms of legitimate DOJ prerogatives.",

Look, they've picked up on the wink-wink from Jack Smith. They're not making him say it. They're giving him expert -- super expedited review. I think they'll rule certainly by the end of January.Jack Smith's next move is going to be to seek what you call on bonk review, meaning ask the entire court of appeals to hear it. That is rarely granted. And then Jack Smith, well, if you -- if he -- well, whoever loses there will go to the Supreme Court. But here's the thing, if Donald Trump loses in the Court of Appeals, and it seems quite clear he will, technically he has 90 days to go to the Supreme Court to seek certiorari. So that puts us out into the middle of spring, if Donald Trump's team loses, they may choose to take all 90 of those days, which completely blows out the March 4 trial date that we have right now. Now, there's other ways the Court of Appeals can let the district court sort of start to do their work again without trying the case. But this puts Jack Smith in a real bind if he's hoping to get this case and forget about March. March is, in my view, off the board now. But even any time before the summer, and at a certain point, you just get too close to the election to try the case at all.",

But no -- make no mistake about it. As soon as we the people allow the courts to decide who we can vote for that, will truly be the end of democracy as we know it because it won't stop. The point being made by this individual, Elie, is that Donald Trump criticized as being undemocratic, tried to overturn the election, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Now, plays the card and says, look how undemocratic this is. They're trying to deny the voters from an opportunity to elect me. Very, very political. It's the issue of the election, I think. HONIG: Yes, I -- but I think -- and this is a problem for Jack Smith, because if his position is, well, we're worried about what Donald Trump might do if he really takes office.

In the Des Moines Register polling, you saw that a plurality said that the poisoning, the blood comments made them more likely to support from. At the same time, a plurality of those same Republican, likely caucus goers, said that Trump's talk of possibly terminating parts of the Constitution made them less likely to support Trump. So, you know what could explain that difference?I don't know. It's pure speculation. But we do see that on the underlying issues that voters are more likely to trust Trump and Biden on the issue of immigration. But on the issue of defending democracy, voters are more likely to trust Biden than Trump. So, I'm not sure but I think some of that, you know, may reflect voters trying to comment on the underlying issue.",

And I think that underlying those legal maneuvers is a political judgment. There's a conviction among many people, I think, including many viewers of the show that Trump, you know, represents a radical departure from politics as it has been, that he's a threat to democracy. The suggestion of my essay is that he may be less of a threat than thought.And I ground that argument less on, you know, Trump's own intentions, which I can't really look into then on the views of your median voters who support him. So the fact that Trump is getting, you know, 40 percent plus of Hispanic voters in current polls, that he's getting 20 percent plus of black voters, very high numbers for our Republican, suggests to me that Trump's appeal for those voters who can deliver the race to him doesn't have to do with white supremacy, doesn't have to do with dictatorship, but instead has to do with, you know, response to his moderate take on entitlements.

I think the network brass were surprised when then I pitched my idea, hosting a weekly book club.We filmed it beginning with me back at home on Market Street in Philadelphia. Well, that show never made it to air but today, 17 years later, a holiday gift, at least for me, I decided I would speak with five authors of books that made an impact on me this year. David Brooks has been an opinion columnist for \"The New York Times\" for 20 years. His latest book explores the most important skill for people to possess and lead happy, health lives. Free speech advocate Greg Lukianoff co-wrote the bestseller \"The Coddling of the American Mind.\" And with cancel culture wars tearing apart university campuses all across the country, he's now back with a well-timed follow up. It's \"The Canceling of American Mind.\" Sheila Johnson was the nation's first female Black billionaire. In her memoire, she recounts hardships she faced along the way including institutional racism, losing a child, emotional abuse, and depression. And Robert Rubin was the former secretary of the treasury, co-chair of Goldman Sachs. His latest is about what he has learned on how to make the best decisions in an uncertain world. [09:55:05] And perhaps in complete contrast, Robert Sapolsky is a TED Talk phenom. He's a professor of biology and neurology at Stanford University. He argues in his latest book that we really don't have any power to decide anything. That there's no such thing as free will. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
