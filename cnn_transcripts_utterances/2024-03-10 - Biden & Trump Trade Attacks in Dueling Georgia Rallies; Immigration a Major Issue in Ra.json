So immigration seems to be the campaign issue in 2024. What did you make of President Biden's seemingly harder line on immigration in the State of the Union in terms of signaling how he's going to deal with this divisive issue during the campaign? SANDRA SANCHEZ, SOUTH TEXAS CORRESPONDENT, BORDERREPORT.COM: Thanks for having me. Yeah, you know, his State of the Union address was very similar to what he said when he came to the South Texas border exactly a week before. And frankly, it was -- it was a bit disappointed. I feel like it was a missed opportunity. He came down, he touted the Senate border bill. He did the same thing in his five minutes of excerpts relating to border and immigration that he said on the State of the Union. But he didn't give examples or humanize or really tell the American public what he saw on the border and how it impacts communities here and -- and how and why he wants this money to change immigration policies and how it could really affect the future. I spoke to several people who said that, you know, it was very similar rhetoric. He clearly went to the right. He -- he clearly had an emphasis on law enforcement when he was here. And that was great. But there were things that I think he could have told the American public that he saw.",

That's according to the Palestinian hospital officials who say the strike hit a building in the area on Saturday. And we have to warn you, the next video you're about to see is disturbing. Some children were apparently wounded in Saturday's strikes as you can see in this footage from the al-Aqsa Hospital obtained by CNN.It shows hospital workers scrambling to help a child amid chaos after the strike. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment. The Israeli military says it's operating to dismantle Hamas military and administrative capabilities. All right, you're looking at the latest air drops of humanitarian aid in Gaza that happened moments ago. Now, this is on the heels of similar operations by the U.S. and Jordan yesterday when tens of thousands of meals and aid were delivered. Some humanitarian workers dismissed those drops as a band-aid measure saying they're degrading and ineffective. Gaza's Health Ministry says two more people died of malnutrition and dehydration on Saturday bringing the total to 25. For more Nada Bashir joins us from Cyprus. So Nada more efforts to get aid into the region while the death toll from famine grows. How quickly might we actually see more aid? NADA BASHIR, CNN PRODUCER: Well, Kim, there is certainly a growing sense of urgency in terms of getting more aid into the Gaza Strip. And, of course, we are still seeing those delays. We've seen attempts continuing to get those trucks across Gaza's land borders continuing calls from aid agencies for international leaders including U.S. President Joe Biden to pressure the Israeli government and authorities to allow more trucks into the Gaza Strip. They say this is the most accessible way for people to get aid directly. And of course, we heard from the U.N. earlier in the week saying that some 40% of their aid missions trying to access Gaza via land were either denied or obstructed by Israel just last month. So continuing pressure on that front. But as you mentioned we are still seeing those airdrops of humanitarian aid and assistance taking place by countries including the United States, Jordan, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. This is, of course, has provided some respite. But it has also drawn criticism from aid agencies and also Gaza's civil defense force. We've heard from aid agencies saying this is simply a temporary measure that it has limited impact in terms of providing enough humanitarian aid. And also comes with significant drawbacks as well. And, in fact, the Palestinian civil defense has said that more people have been injured as a result of those airdrops. But of course, we heard from the civil defense last week confirming that five people at least have been killed, many others injured as a result of a malfunctioning airdrop where the parachute hadn't actually opened up as those airdrops were distributed. Of course, there is continued pressure for international partners to provide more aid. The U.S. at this stage has provided more than 100,000 meal equivalents to Palestinians in Gaza through these airdrops. But the focus now is very much on this new maritime corridor which has been inaugurated. Those humanitarian ships are set to depart from here in Larnaca, in Cyprus heading towards Gaza's coast. We know, of course, that the equipment for a temporary pier to be built by the U.S. military is now on its way to the Middle East. This is a crucial development. The hope is that this will provide a significant uptick in the amount of humanitarian aid and food getting into Gaza. Crucially as we know some half a million people in Gaza are now facing starvation according to the U.N.",

They've changed the game. They've certainly taken in thousands of more members, more diverse membership, more international membership. And, you know, this is reflected in a, you know, pretty diverse range of the -- of the 10 films here. So, yeah, there's been some progress. And, you know, it'll be interesting to see how this affects the kind of movies made in Hollywood. I still think that the bottom line is probably what rules everything. So, you know, if it's going to make cash, that's probably going to be the leading cause of, you know, in this -- in this risk averse studio system, which still exists to a certain extent.
