Even more institutionalist senators, someone like Senator John Thune or Senator John Cornyn, they've been critical of so-called recess appointments in the past.And just to remind our viewers of what this is, typically the Senate goes through a confirmation process. It's constitutional, of course. It's a vetting process. There's a background check, confirmation hearings, votes in committee, votes on the floor. That's all normal, and the Senate Republicans will have the majority. They have 52 seats, maybe 53 seats if Pennsylvania turns their way. So they can actually confirm these nominees along straight party lines, but it takes some time. And if there's problems in the process, maybe they lose some Republican votes. And at that point, if there's a problem, that's when the recess appointments typically come in. They have not been done for many, many years. Senate majority leaders for the past 15 years or so have taken steps to block presidents from installing recess appointments. Now Trump is saying change that practice altogether. Allow them to essentially install these nominees, short-circuit the confirmation process altogether, and install them without having the traditional vetting process. And already we're seeing John Thune, John Cornyn, Rick Scott, the potential majority leaders here, all saying, sure, that's fine, let's do it. And that is obviously a total change in protocol and practice, but one in which the Republicans are saying, OK, that's fine.",

It's a secret ballot election. These things typically go more on relationships. What have you done for me lately? What committee assignments are you promising? How much fundraising have you done for me over the years? And we know Cornyn and Thune, Cornyn in particular, has done so much fundraising for his colleagues for many years.Thune has done a lot as Republican whip to develop those inroads to a lot of his members. Rick Scott, not as much, which is why we are seeing and we expect that Thune and Cornyn are the heavy favorites. Even though Scott is liked by MAGA World, Elon Musk came out and said he supports him. Others on the right wing of the party are saying they should support him, but they don't have votes in the United States Senate. And they don't influence a lot of Republican senators, which is why the betting is right now that it's going to be Thune or Cornyn who are likely to prevail here and why Trump is probably saying maybe not the best decision to endorse right now because he could go the wrong way if I do.",

It's a big deal, but it's not enough, according to my next guest, Steve Kennedy, who is an Iraq War veteran, the organizing director of the People's Parity Project, and a leading advocate for upgrading so-called paper, bad paper discharges for thousands upon thousands of veterans.And, Steve, I also want to mention you successfully fought for an upgrade of your own bad paper discharge not related to Don't Ask, Don't Tell and spurred a successful class action case in the process. So talk to us a little bit about this, because on its face, these Don't Ask, Don't Tell upgrades seem like a move in the right direction. Why do you say it's not enough? STEVE KENNEDY, ORGANIZING DIRECTOR, PEOPLE'S PARITY PROJECT: Yes, I think it's definitely a move in the right direction, and it's an issue that previous administrations really have not taken enough action on. So in that sense, I would absolutely commend the administration for providing this pardon to the segment of veterans that it did. I think the issue is that the way that it's defined is very narrow. So even within veterans who were discharged for their sexual orientation, there's only a pretty small population under really specific circumstances that qualify. And then on top of that, you have to also apply for this and have a review, which is not so different from what you do going through the normal discharge upgrade process. And what we've seen over the last several decades between Vietnam veterans, post-9-11 veterans, is that the more roadblocks we put in front of people, the more veterans end up getting left behind. And what we know, you know, in the case of people who are discharged under Don't Ask, Don't Tell or previous discharges based on sexual orientation, is that it's very difficult for people to kind of overcome some of those obstacles. And if we want to make sure we're actually taking care of all of the veterans who, you know, need the services that the VA can provide, that they can only get if they get the right discharge, we need to be more accommodating, basically. So the more restrictions we put on this and the more we try and focus on, you know, capturing the people who, you know, so-called people who don't deserve it as much, there are many, many more who served honorably, who need these benefits and who are dying in the meantime.",

They're ultimately, and you've educated me about this over the years, they're ultimately due to misconduct that can be traced to PTSD, to traumatic brain injury, even military sexual assault, who are really the folks who obviously most need the benefits, especially the health care benefits that an honorable discharge would afford them. So what does President Biden, in your opinion, need to do with the time he has left? And what do you want to see the incoming Trump administration do?",

      "sentences": "I think what's one of the things that's really difficult is that being a veteran, like having served in the military, becomes such an integral part of your identity that once that is judged as something less than it is really difficult to deal with. So, as you mentioned, I like I received a general discharge after going AWOL and which was related to my PTSD and depression. But that wasn't properly considered.And for years, I had to kind of deal with that. It makes Veterans Day complicated. Under certain laws, you're not even considered a veteran unless you have the right discharge. You could have done, you know, multiple deployments, but then something happens after you get out. And now legally, you're not even a veteran anymore. So these days can be really complicated for people like that. So I think on top of, like you mentioned, just the practical issues, trying to reintegrate after having served, there is a huge stigma around it that people carry around for the rest of their lives in some cases, because even for me, I have every benefit, every resource available to me to try and fight this. It took something like eight years and a class action lawsuit to actually get the discharge that I earned. And there are tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of other veterans who will never get that opportunity if we don't do something.",

      "sentences": "Well, Boris, we got an update just a short while ago from fire officials across the river in New Jersey. That is where a lot of the fire activity is taking place. So far, 5,000 acres of land between New York and New Jersey have already burned, and fire officials there say 20 percent of the fire has been contained so far.But they've been battling really difficult conditions over the past several days. The reason for that, as you said, is that we have been experiencing a significant drought here in the northeast. In fact, we don't usually hear about wildfires burning in this part of the country, but that is exactly what we have been seeing here for several days now. So officials are warning residents to not leave any open flames, to not burn anything outside, and just to be extremely careful because this drought situation here in New York and in New Jersey has essentially created a combustible situation that's making conditions and firefighting very difficult. Sadly, one person has been killed so far, a young firefighter who was out there trying to fight the flames. So officials, again, warning about the conditions. Now, I also just want to mention this drought that we are experiencing. Here in New York City, we also saw a fire in Prospect Park. That's right in the middle of Brooklyn, and a size of land of about two football fields burned there on Friday night. That's something that we don't really see as New Yorkers here in the city. So officials asking New Yorkers to conserve water as much as possible, to be mindful of how they run the tap, to be mindful of how they run their appliances, because the city needs to conserve water right now. If this continues to extend for many more days, the city is considering having to increase that drought watch into a potential warning -- Boris.",
