Now, low demand and competition, low demand for EVs, competition from the U.S. and China VW says it might shut some of its factories in Germany and workers there are afraid of their futures. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AXEL WENZEL, VOLKSWAGEN EMPLOYEE (through translator): Miserable, everywhere. People are scared of losing their houses. That they will be fired. I have been working at the plant for 38 years. TIMOR YILDIZ, VOLKSWAGEN EMPLOYEE (through translator): We don't know what the future holds. Who knows? Maybe we will soon all be unemployed.
