More than 200 law enforcement officers are currently searching for the man they say murdered five people on Friday night at a home outside of Houston, Texas. Police say they don't have any real leads, 38-year-old Francisco Oropeza. Sources tell CNN that federal officers patrolling the southern border have been told to be on the look out in case Oropeza tries to flee to Mexico, he is after all, a Mexican national. And a government sources he had been deported from the U.S. at least four times before. Survivors of the attacks say Oropeza shot up his neighbor's house after they asked him to stop firing his weapon so close to the property because their baby was trying to sleep. The murdered included nine-year-old Daniel Lazo Guzman and his mother Sonia. Police say all of the victims appeared to have been shot execution style. CNN's Ed Lavandera starts off our coverage from Cleveland, Texas, where the other innocent victims have also been identified. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  It is day three of the manhunt for 38-year-old Francisco Oropeza, accused of shooting and killing five people in Cleveland, Texas, on Friday night.

It was a day of -- was how quickly it escalated. That was because you really have far more of those black block, the extreme left wing protesters who come out seeking confrontation with the police, but also what we saw was very heavy-handed police tactics, at least a couple of times, very elderly women being manhandled as they were taking off into police vehicles. So, the events of today here in Paris really would have done nothing to calm the minds of anyone. In fact, the unions are now working out what to do next. They'll be meeting tomorrow morning to decide whether the next big day of protests will be Wednesday or whether they will wait until June 8th, which is when the opposition parties come together to work out how they can get this pension reform repealed. But that is their point. That they keep getting people on the street show that the amount of popular anger that has been excited by the manner in which this pension reform has been pushed through, is here to stay and will continue to make things difficult as the unions can for Emmanuel Macron going forward -- Jake.",

He is seeking to reduce the child support payments that he had previously agreed to a settlement, payments for his four-year-old daughter Navy, whom he has never met, and whom the Biden White House, as far as we can tell, has yet to publicly acknowledge. Biden's lawyer claims he is paying the child's mother $20,000 a month, totaling more than $750,000 so far.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SARA MURRAY, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   The president's son appearing in an Arkansas courtroom today. The hearing related to a year's old fraternity dispute, after the mother of a child, London Roberts, accused Hunter Biden of ignoring earlier corridors in withholding evidence. Now, the judge says Hunter must answer more questions about his investments, art sales and other financial transactions as part of the child support case. He will also sit for a June deposition, where he will be questioned under oath. You can't say, these are my tax returns. Good luck. You figure it out, the judge said, ordering up details on his taxes. This cryptic, hide the ball game isn't going to cut it when we get to trial. What began as 2019 fraternity case, morphing into a battle over Hunter's overseas business dealings, the now infamous laptop, and other financial issues, all as Hunter faces scrutiny from both criminal and congressional investigators. Republican lawmakers have launched a sprawling probe into the Biden's family business deals, seeking many of the same financial records London Roberts is trying to access. REP.
