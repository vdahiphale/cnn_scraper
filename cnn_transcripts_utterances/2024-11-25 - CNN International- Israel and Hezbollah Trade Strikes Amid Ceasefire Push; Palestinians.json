It is 04:00 p.m. in the Lebanese capital. It is 06:00 p.m. here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Eleni Giokos. I'm in for my colleague, Becky Anderson, this is \"Connect the World\". Also coming up this hour, authorities here in the UAE have arrested three Uzbek nationals in connection with the death of an Israeli rabbi. At least one person is dead after a cargo plane crashed at a Lithuanian airport. And the Menendez brothers are set to make their first public court appearance in nearly 30 years. Well, let's check in on how the markets in New York are set to open around 30 minutes from now. All in positive territory, as you can see behind me, looking pretty good. All in the green, about half a percent up for NASDAQ and S&amp;P and as you can see, the DOW Jones, eight tenths of percent to the good. This is on the back of news that President-elect Donald Trump's pick for treasury state secretary, Scott Bessent, is sending markets much higher. A lot of optimism of what he could bring to the table. And as you can see, market participants are showing their views through the numbers that we're seeing this morning. We are going to check in on those overall numbers in around 30 minutes from now. So, moving on, and big developments coming out of Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has approved, in principle, the outlines of a ceasefire deal that's being discussed with Hezbollah. That's what we're hearing from a source familiar with the matter. The source also saying Israel still has reservations over some details of the proposal. Now all this comes as we're seeing an uptick in air strikes. The Israeli military said on Sunday, it struck 12 Hezbollah command centers in Beirut's southern suburbs. And this video shows Israel's air defenses intercepting Hezbollah projectiles fired from Lebanon. We're live in Jerusalem with CNN's Nic Robertson. Nic, great to have you with us. We've seen an increase in rocket fire, frankly, from both sides of the border. This while we're hearing that perhaps a ceasefire could be imminent, that there are close to a deal. What is it going to take to get it over the line?",

Serious consideration still remain principle among those as we understand at the moment. We don't know the details of discussion, but they've been that Israel wants the right to strike back at Hezbollah if it breaks a ceasefire deal, the terms of which call for a 60-day ceasefire, and that perhaps is the largest sticking point, but the language around it is clearly what's going to settle their minds or not on in this case. A regional source has said that they believe that this is getting close. So, I think the indications are from both sides of the equation here that this is moving in the right direction. It's the closest it's been in since the absolute sort of increase in hostilities began in the middle of September. So, it's a moment, it appears of opportunity, a moment for diplomacy. But meanwhile, as you say, from the military front, a real uptick. 250 missiles, 7 injuries incoming from the -- or incoming those 250 incoming missiles from Hezbollah yesterday, causing 7 injuries inside of Israel. And as you said, an increase in the fire from the IDF going into Lebanon as well. Targeting has been actually hitting the Lebanese army as well, for which the IDF apologize, killing a Lebanese army soldier and injuring a couple of others. This is not uncommon to see an uptick when you get close to it. When you get close to deal, go back to 2006 that was the last time Hezbollah and Israel was sort of at a full front war, right? And then again, as you got close to the ceasefire, the level of strikes, counter strikes, went up, and that appears to be where we're at now. Caveats, in a way, we've been here before. Details still to be worked out, but it does seem to be a positive moment.",

And then exile be speaking about this with Anat Saragusti, Press Freedom Director of the Union of Journalists in Israel. Egyptian authorities say 17 people are missing after tourist boats sank in the Red Sea. Officials tell the Associated Press that 28 people have been rescued so far. Some were airlifted to receive medical treatment. According to the Red Sea region governor, the boat named the sea story, was carrying 45 people made up of tourists and crew members on a multi-day diving trip when it went down near the coastal town of Marsa Alam. It's not immediately clear what caused the boat to sink, but the Egyptian meteorological authority on Saturday warned about turbulence and high waves on the Red Sea and advised against maritime activity for Sunday and Monday. Authorities in the UAE say they have arrested three Uzbek nationals in connection with the death of an Israeli rabbi in the United Arab Emirates. The White House is condemning the killing of Rabbi Zvi Kogan and says it is working closely with Israeli and UAE authorities.

This is Scott Bessent, who is someone who could immediately get some respect and influence with financial markets, and he's already getting some positive reviews. Jeff Sonnenfeld from Yale told me that there is great relief over this election. JP Morgan, CEO Jamie Dimon thinks highly of Bessent and thinks that this is an excellent choice. Also heard from Jay Timmons, the manufacturing CEO who's been critical of Trump in the past. He called this an outstanding choice. And even Anthony Scaramucci, the fierce to the -- hedge fund executive who fiercely opposed Trump's reelection, he called Bessent, a great guy, safe and stable pair of hands. And we are seeing this play out in the stock market, with the U.S. market opening significantly higher. This does seem to be about some relief, some optimism over the selection of Scott Bessent hearing a little bit more about his resume. He's a hedge fund executive. He has deep knowledge of global markets. He's actually worked with some of the most famous investors on the planet, including Stanley Druckenmiller and George Soros. And in the past, Bessent has backed both Republicans and Democrats. And I think that the hope here from investors and from CEOs is that Bessent can be a moderating influence against some of the more aggressive campaign promises from the president-elect, especially on trade. Sonnenfeld told me that Besant is a supporter of using tariffs as a negotiating tool, but he's not going to be all about blanket tariffs, because he knows history and he knows that Smoot-Hawley tariffs back in 1930 actually exacerbated the great recession, and Sonnenfeld said he doesn't want a second Smoot-Hawley. Of course, at the end of the day, a lot of these decisions are going to be made by Trump himself, but it does appear that at least one of the voices in the room when those decisions are going to be making is going to be a more moderate one, Eleni.",

The brothers also set to appear before a judge in Los Angeles later today to discuss next steps in their case. CNN's Jean Casarez is following the story for us from New York.

This is so ironic, because inthe final days of his campaign, he brought this front and center, telling all of Los Angeles County that he wanted them released. And its life without the possibility of parole, which is the highest count, the highest conviction you can have, the most serious conviction in California. And next week, the new DA is going to come on board, so it's a little strange. But today is a status hearing, and this is a normal thing that is done in court. As you proceed to the final hearing, it's just, where are we now? What are we going to do? What do we have to do? But you never know what's going to happen in a hearing. And I think the main thing here is that the Erik and Lyle are going to be in court. We believe virtually from prison. The judge can change that at any minute, but they will be attending this hearing, which is very, very significant. Now, the reality is that there are two pathways for them to be released from prison. One is a habeas corpus petition, which alleges the sexual abuse that they had, according to the district attorney and to Lyle and Erik back with their father, Jose Menendez. It involves a letter that was written shortly before the murders, and then also a former member of the group Menudo, has come out saying that he was sexually abused by Jose Menendez. But the other route, and the DA seems to be really focused on this, is rehabilitation, because there's a law in California that says, if you have been rehabilitated to a point that we believe you will be safe in the community and add value to the community. We will release you. Now, Lyle Menendez has gotten his bachelor's degree from the University of California Irvine. Some of the courses that he has instituted for inmates are beautification, also adverse childhood experiences, also an ally for those that are younger, that have gotten life without parole. And then Erik Menendez, Associates Degree sign language course he's developed in prison for inmates who are profoundly deaf. And then also hospice victim's empathy and a 12-step program. So that, I think when we get to that hearing said at this point, for December 11, will be the focus of getting them out. And then the question is, does it go to the parole board? Does the judge maybe lower the conviction, reduce it to manslaughter, where they could be out immediately? There are so many different ways they can go on this, but we need to follow it all, because it's extremely significant.",
