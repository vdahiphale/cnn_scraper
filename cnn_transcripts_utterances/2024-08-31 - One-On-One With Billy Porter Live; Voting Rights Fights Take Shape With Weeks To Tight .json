They say people turn it off. It's too complicated to follow. Don't get bogged down. But sometimes it's necessary. And in the national election rules, what someone may do versus what they shall do can swing the election. Just see, January 6 and Pence is roll after the 2020 election for that. Now, with 66 days left until votes are counted this cycle, there are debates happening over new election rules. In a moment, we'll talk about Nebraska and a voting rights fight that you may not know is going on. We're going to zero in on a group fighting for their right to even register to vote. But first, I'm starting with the tension over election rules here in Georgia. At the center is Georgia State Board -- election board, I should say. They passed new rules recently. One would allow election officials to conduct quote, reasonable inquiry before certifying election results. Another would permit members of county election boards to investigate ballot counts. They sound benign, but Democrats are suing. They argue the rules would cause chaos in Georgia weeks out from the election, and they want Governor Brian Kemp to do something. Now this is not just a clean-cut fight between Democrats and Republicans. Let me read you this quote. \"These misguided last-minute changes from unelected bureaucrats who have never run an election and seem to reject the advice of anyone who ever has could cause serious problems in an election that otherwise will be secure and accurate.\" That's from Georgia's Republican Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, and just this week, he added this. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Do you feel like what's happened in the state election board is a direct result of the aftermath of the 2020 election, and some of the election lines that were brought on? BRAD RAFFENSPERGER, (R) GEORGIA SECRETARY OF STATE: You'd have to ask in each of them all really upset is that the state election board is a mess. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

He's gone straight to the public.

So there's no indication that they're going to break the law, or that they can break the law. What we're saying is that the information that the election offices have, that information should be readily available to the election board, so that when they're signing this document that says that the results are perfect, that they're accurate, and that there isn't any fraud, that's the documentation that they have to sign. It's a legal affidavit, and if they inaccurate, they could be punishable by getting a felony.So we're just saying that, you know what?

      "sentences": "All right. So there's another decision looming that could have a huge impact on the outcome of the election. Let's go to Nebraska now, a state law passed in 2005 restored voting rights for formerly incarcerated felons. One condition, they have to wait two years after their sentences end to register. Now in April, the state legislature removed that requirement, but two days before that new law was going into effect, Nebraska's Attorney General said the new law and the 2005 law are both unconstitutional.He argues the state's pardon board does not legislators, rather, have the power to restore voting rights. And as a result, the Secretary of State of Nebraska told county election officials to stop registering people with felonies on their record who have not been pardoned. The ACLU sued on behalf of three people impacted, and one wants to register as a Democrat, another as a Republican, a third as a nonpartisan. Supreme Court had a hearing this week. A ruling is now pending. Now Nebraska is a red state, but Nebraska is also unique. It allocates electoral votes by district, and in Omaha's second congressional district, former President Donald Trump won by just a little more than 6500 votes in 2016. 2020, President Biden won the district by 22,000 votes. This one district could swing the race in a close Electoral College count. According to the Voting Rights Restoration coalition, 7,000 formerly incarcerated Nebraskans could be eligible to vote. This context matters too. People who are incarcerated in Nebraska are disproportionately Black, Hispanic or Indigenous. Analysis from the Prison Policy Initiative found the rate of black people in prison in Nebraska in 2021 was more than nine times higher than white Nebraskans. Aaron Pettes is impacted by this. He has a felony on his record after spending 16 and a half years in prison. Aaron now works with a nonprofit in Nebraska called RISE, which helps with reentry. Aaron, thank you so much for being with me. First, just the ramifications of not just removing the tooth the two-year waiting period, but now saying anyone with a felony on their record, reverting to a 19th century law would not be able to register to vote.",

And so the goal was to try and get it resolved at the lowest level possible without having to escalate anything.Promises were made that things would be corrected by the middle of July, and when that didn't happen, tribal leaders decided they needed to escalate. And so going up the chain and reaching out to their congressional contacts is really what happened. I think it's just representative of, you know, a previously fraught history with the government to government and trust responsibility that tribes have expected but been frequently disappointed in with their federal counterparts. So it's good to see that there are -- is some progress being made. There is some resolution occurring. And the other thing is, there's been a lot of disparity. Some tribes have been significantly more impacted than others. Others have been able to manage more due to increased higher levels of capacity or resources within their own communities, being able to shuffle things around.
