He praised the alliance as stronger than ever under his leadership and announced plans for new air defense systems for Ukraine.Democrats in the House and Senate have wrapped up their first meeting since the president's poor showing in his debate with Donald Trump, and they're no closer to consensus on whether Mr. Biden should stay in the race. But the White House is praising the president's NATO speech, saying it hit the mark. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: This remarkable progress, proof that our commitment is broad and deep, that we're ready, that we're willing, we're able to deter aggression and defend every inch of NATO territory across every domain, land, air, sea, cyber and space. Our friends, it's good that we're stronger than ever, because this moment in history calls for our collective strength. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He's been defiant.The polls have been, they haven't been great, but they also haven't cratered. So it's clear that he's made a decision that he's going to stay in the race. He's the strongest candidate to beat Donald Trump. And they are now rallying support in the Democratic caucus. Yes, you have a handful of Democrats who have expressed publicly their concern, but it's a very small amount. None of the leaders of the Democratic Party have come out against Joe Biden staying in this race. And there's a reason for that, because they recognize that it is impractical, logistically risky, and politically unprecedented to ask a president of the United States to step aside as the nominee at this point in the election cycle, and which would probably lead to him stepping down as president of the United States as well, because politically, he wouldn't be able to do one and not the other. And they're looking at this and saying, Joe Biden has delivered for the American people and he'll deliver for them again. And we're going to stick with him. So my answer to that question is, yes, I think he can recover as long as he continues to have good public appearances, strong public appearances like he has so far during the NATO summit and doesn't have a faltering appearance like he did at the debate again.",

The Olympics are coming up. They're not fully focused on this, but that's why you run a campaign. That's why you run a race. And thank goodness for the Biden campaign. From their perspective, they have a couple more months to get it together and get people to consolidate behind President Biden because he's got a great record to run on.

The optimism level for this round of talks isn't what it was even a few days ago.You have to remember that both sides have come into this with their own set of non-negotiables. And one of the toughest to get past has been the Israeli insistence that the war will continue until Hamas is completely destroyed. And Hamas' insistence that any ceasefire that's agreed to is a permanent one. Obviously, those things are at odds with one another. But over the weekend, Hamas made clear that it was willing to forego that requirement, and many figured that could be grounds for a real breakthrough and a real chance at a ceasefire. But then the Israeli prime minister moved the goalposts. Part of the problem is that some far-right members of his own government are not in favor of this peace proposal from the U.S. that Israel is also supposedly on side with. And so agreeing to this peace proposal could perhaps threaten to bring down his own government. The other problem is that ramped up attacks in Gaza in recent days have really gotten rid of any twinkle of goodwill that may have existed. As you pointed out, there have been four strikes on schools in Gaza in the last four days. The most recent one was that one outside of Khan Younis that killed 25 people and wounded dozens more people. The State Department spokesperson was asked yesterday on CNN whether the U.S. is comfortable with that level of civilian casualties. And the answer was very clearly, no. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATTHEW MILLER, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON: I think it's important to note that civilian casualties have come down dramatically over the past few months from the really catastrophic levels that they were at earlier this year and, of course, late last year. But we want to see civilian casualties completely go away. And that is why we are pushing so hard, have people in the region right now working to try to achieve a ceasefire that would secure the release of hostages that would alleviate the suffering of the Palestinian people that would allow us to surge humanitarian assistance.

Of course, when you're doing it from a teleprompter, you're not going to wander off into a strange direction the way he did 12 days ago in the debates. But did they get strong leadership from the U.S.? And the answer to that, we won't know until November 5th, because there are issues on which you could describe Biden and Trump as having shades of difference. But when it comes to NATO, they are in polar opposite camps, with Biden believing that the United States is strengthened by its alliances that it's not a burden, even if we're paying the lion's share of the NATO budget and we no longer are. Or you believe what Trump believes, which is America should just withdraw to its own borders, put up significantly bigger walls. And if anyone comes and messes with you, you whack them.

We've beaten back the Russians, as he said the other day. We've checkmated China. I'm not sure we've checkmated China, but -- but in any case, certainly pushed back on China and that NATO would fall apart without Biden there.
