We have another projection from Pennsylvania right now as well. Let's get that up on the screen if we can.Yes, there you see it. Susan Wild, the Democratic incumbent, she is going to be reelected. We cannot project even though it says too early to call. We're projecting that Susan Wild will be the winner defeating Lisa Scheller as well. Let's go over to John King at the magic wall. So we got two more projections in the House of Representatives. So set the scene for us. What that says to you?",

At the moment, this is significant to watch. As this number climbs, that's her number climb because Joe Biden won Clark County by nine points. Sorry, I hit the -- I got the cufflink too close to the end there. But if you come down here back to Clark County, Joe Biden wins this county by nine points. Masto right now it's winning it by about four points a little less than that, a little more than that, a little more than four, a little less than five. That is absolutely significant.As the new as the other ballots come in, Democrats are saying, it's a lot of mail-in ballots. They think they will spread this here. That becomes absolutely key in the game of Senate chess, it's not a game. But in the art of Senate chess, those two Western seats now absolutely critical to understanding. Will Georgia be for the majority again? Or will the Democrats protect the majority out here and Georgia will be, can they get to 51 math to do today and tomorrow?",

Fetterman was one of the few people who would have him. Fetterman is one of the few who, you know, came out on top and it was clear, and we knew that relatively early while we're still awaiting other races in which Biden was not present.

And the thing about politics is so funny is that Biden actually did everything possible to deliver on the promises he made for voters in 2020 on the campaign.And so in 2022, you're actually seeing people say thank you showing up for those candidates. I think we will still see what happens in these other races. I think these Democratic Senate races they're going to pull it out. Georgia, we all said it was going to go into a runoff. It probably is. I still think Warnock will pull it out. But Biden's popularity, I think was overplayed this cycle. The agenda and the policies that he is pushing is what people in America want. BURNETT: OK, so let's talk over. This is the -- this is going to be the crucial question to figure out, is what Ashley is saying true? Is this a pro-Biden agenda? Or was this an anti-election deniers, MAGA? LT. GOV. GEOFF DUNCAN (R-GA): Yes, I think it's an anti-election. I think there's folks that wanted to flee away from Donald Trump and Joe Biden. I mean, just their travel schedule in the last few weeks was enough evidence to know that folks didn't really want them there. Now, Pennsylvania, he showed up, and some other places President Trump showed up. But at the end of the day, this was an economy question. And folks felt the real economy and it's hard to explain inflation. It's hard to explain layoffs. It's hard to explain drop in the equity markets, but it's real. People feel their paycheck and they feel the anxieties in their community. This was a direct reflection on the economy with some nuances, right?

It didn't -- yesterday, he won by 20 percentage points. Why? Because he gamed the system, because he turned Florida into an unleveled playing field, they changed the election laws making it harder to vote by mail. They paraded a bunch of people, black people that they arrested for voting fraud and paraded them in front of national media. He created an election police.
