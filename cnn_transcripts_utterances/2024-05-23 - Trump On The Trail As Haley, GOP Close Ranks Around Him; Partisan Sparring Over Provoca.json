We're breaking down new shows of GOP deference to Trump as the campaign and his criminal trial are entering new phases.Also this hour, partisan sparring over U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, and whether he's crossed ethical lines amid growing controversy over politically provocative flags flown at his homes. And a powerful message about abuse from the former girlfriend of rapper Sean Diddy Combs, Cassie Ventura speaking out for the first time since CNN exclusively obtained a 2016 video of her being physically assaulted by Combs. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room.

I believe the state that he was, was Arizona, though we know there were objections to multiple states as that day played out on January 6th.And so this is a key issue because it's kind of become this question that has become for some reason increasingly difficult for Republicans to answer just a yes or no question. Marco Rubio, Tim Scott, you saw those are vice presidential hopefuls, of course.

Of course, what's important here, the crux of this is there was no material fraud, nothing that would out change the outcome of that election. And that is something that was attested to by multiple Republican governors, the attorney general, Bill Barr, dozens of courts, even the Supreme Court rejected this idea that Trump had been cheated out of power.And, of course, the danger here is that there are a wide -- there's a wide swath of the electorate that does believe the election was stolen because they were told not only by Donald Trump but also by multiple Republicans at that time, that there was reason to doubt the election, even though we heard from multiple officials that there wasn't. But I do think this is a notable trend, Wolf, because it's not just happening among people who want to be vice president to Donald Trump if he wins the election or want to be in his cabinet. We're also seeing it among other U.S. lawmakers who won't outright say that if it is a free and fair election, that they will accept the 2024 results.

He has a track record of discriminatory, hateful language. And so it did not just happen when he said there was very good people on both sides during Charlottesville. It happened around the exonerated five, it happened during his discriminatory housing practices. And I think it's important for the Biden campaign to remind voters.

They want to know what policies are going to make their lives better.And if you want to point at Donald Trump and tell voters what policies made their lives worse, do that.

Now, it's hard to know, what the appeals court will ultimately do with this, Wolf. These were, you know -- one of the criticisms of this case is it was complicated. There are dozens of defendants and some pretty complicated racketeering charges. So, it's hard to know what the appeals court will do, but to Evan's point, this will slow things down.

Now, Wolf, since this 2016 video is outside the statute of limitations, the D.A. in Los Angeles has said that they cannot press charges. So, it has created this entire conversation of whether that statute of limitations is benefiting the abuser or the victim. Now, I also want to note, lastly, that you may have noticed that neither Cassie or Diddy mentioned each other in their respective statements about this video.

She was empowered to do so. She filed her suit. And the response that we're seeing, even though there's still some people who are saying, oh, maybe we don't know the whole story, I think, overwhelmingly, people supporting her is starting to shift the tide, which says that just because you're a man of power, just because you're a person of power, a person who's wealthy, it does not mean that you should be able to get away with things like this.

So, it is not clear to me at all that he is out of legal jeopardy as it relates to some kind of criminal accountability.

The New York Times has reported that a flag that was on display among rioters at the Capitol on January 6th was flown at Justice Alito's New Jersey vacation residence at least four times last summer. According to the Times, that flag, with a green pine tree and the words, an appeal to heaven on it, was flown at Alito's summer home two years after an upside down American flag, a symbol used by Donald Trump's supporters who challenged the results of the 2020 election, was flown at Alito's house in Northern Virginia. That flag, on display in 2021 just after the January 6th attack. Top Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee today openly concerned about the conservative justice's displays. SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL): You start to wonder, is this just a chance in discretion, or is it a conscious declaration of his MAGA loyalty? SEN.
