Just ahead, China's President Xi Jinping is in Moscow to meet with Russia's Vladimir Putin, the first such visit since Russia invaded Ukraine. Former U.S. President Donald Trump says he expects to be arrested on Tuesday.We'll look closer at why he says that in the political implications of it happen. Now and the jittery markets as well despite UBS agreed to take over embattled Swiss Bank Credit Suisse. The markets are very unsettled, the latest on that coming up. Chinese President Xi Jinping has arrived in Moscow for a three-day visit where he set to meet with Vladimir Putin during the next hour. Upon landing, the Chinese Leader reiterated his willingness to work with the Russian President to \"safeguard\" the international order. In his first visit to Moscow since Russia, so-called special military operation began. Let's bring in CNN's Matthew Chance; he is in Moscow a huge moment here. What to both sides hope to get from this, do you think?",

      "sentences": "You're right, Max. It is definitely a huge moment not just isn't the first time that Xi Jinping has visited Russia since the invasion of Ukraine. But it's also just a few days remembered since Vladimir Putin was indicted by the international criminal court for war crimes.And so this is a huge show of support from China to Russia, at a time when the Russia leadership in particular really needs that. And I think one of the things they're going to emphasize is the close relationship between the two countries, a relationship that's been growing in stature over the course of the past several years, but has really intensified over the course of the past 12 months or so. And the two leaders say they're going to work on ways to deepen that friendship, and that economic relationship, which has been burgeoning, as well. What everybody is watching, though, is whether China is going to take the step of offering military aid to Russia, which is much needed from the Russian point of view, they need ammunition. Like the Ukrainians, they've been running short of supplies on the front line, and in fact, to seek ammunition from other places like Iran, and North Korea, but China could really step up and provide munitions in that way. But of course, that would be crossing a red line; the Chinese have been very reluctant to do that so far. And there's this concern, they may be considering it. And so all eyes are going to be watching very closely to see what steps if any Xi Jinping takes during the state visit.",

      "sentences": "Well, I mean, look, what the Russians are saying is that that shows we're not isolated on the international stage, that there is a whole group of countries for most China, that are willing to stand side by side with Russia and stand literally next to the Russian President, even though he's been indicted for war crimes at the ICC.And I think many Russians will look at that, and be relieved by it and grateful for it. But also, crucially, a lot of countries around the world will also see this strong symbolism that Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader has come to Russia despite the sanctions against the country and despite the indictments that the war crimes caught. And so that's, I think, going to be a very, very potent symbolism. There's another issue as well, which is China is on a diplomatic high at the moment, it's already come out freshly out of sort of forging agreement in a, you know, a deal, a diplomatic agreement between Saudi Arabia and Iran, in the Middle East. And it's looking to forge some kind of peace process for Ukraine as well. Last month, they issued a 12-point peace plan, which called for negotiations, but stopped very short of calling on Russia to withdraw from the territories. It's concord and so it's received a lukewarm response but nevertheless, this peace plan, this initiative is something that the Russians and the Chinese are expected to talk about over this three day visits.",

Silicon Valley Bank sort of set off this chain reaction in the banking system where suddenly everyone's looking for the next shoe to drop the next vulnerability and amidst all that, came those announcements about Credit Suisse last week problems with their financial reporting their biggest shareholder not wanting to put any more money in.And, you know, I think if the Silicon Valley Banks and the experts that I've spoken to have said, if the Silicon Valley Bank issue hadn't happened, Credit Suisse might not have ended up in this position. So soon, even though of course, they had problems. But look, we've got the central bankers have come in with coordinated action. The markets have turned around a little bit, they're still volatile, Europe's looking a little bit more positive, but we're still seeing major issues with the banking stocks there, UBS, off its lows, but still lower. I think there's a recognition that this is going to be a complicated, messy acquisition for them. That's going to be layoffs, it's quite clear. And they've said that they don't expect to turn a profit until 2027. Now, off the back of this, you can see that Europe has turned around a little bit. U.S. futures that are had turned higher, they're looking a little shaky now. So still a volatile situation, Max.",

Over the last week, they were down 30 percent on Friday; they're down another 20 percent pre market.So people are looking for sort of the weaker links in the system. But we also have the regulator's who've come in the Central Banks, we've got, you know, the Swiss who orchestrated this takeover, saying essentially to the market, we are prepared to do what it takes to stabilize the system. We are not going to have a bank collapse. They did not want to let Credit Suisse go bankrupt. So I think that is why potentially we're seeing some recovery in the markets also perhaps because this weakens the argument for the Fed to raise rates this week. FOSTER: We'll be watching Clare, thank you so obviously New York where speculation is growing over a possible indictment of the Former U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump says he expects to be arrested on Tuesday in the Stormy Daniels hush money case, and he's calling on his supporters to protest. A grand jury is set to hear testimony today from Robert Costello, a Former Attorney for the prosecution star witness and Former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen. More on that story just ahead on the show in the next few hours, Francis government will face to no confidence votes. It comes after President Emmanuel Macron has a decision to push through unpopular pension reforms without a vote in parliament. The move has sparked anger amongst opposition groups and Fury from the public with large groups of angry protesters back out on the streets this weekend. As you can see soon as Melissa Bell joining me from Paris, is there any progress here? Are the protesters in any way going to stand down?",

He is, you know, been saying that this investigation is to try to stop him from moving forward in this election to try to interfere with the election post some made some new statements overnight, about the Manhattan District Attorney, Alvin Bragg's that he is actually trying to interfere with the Presidential contests.
