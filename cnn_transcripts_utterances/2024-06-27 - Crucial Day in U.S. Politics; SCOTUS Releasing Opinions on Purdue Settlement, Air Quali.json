Time stateside on the East Coast is 10:00 am and the historic presidential debate just hours away. Now. We'll, have all the details on what to expect and how Donald Trump and Joe Biden are preparing. First up though and happening this hour, the Supreme Court set to release a number of opinions. We are still waiting on a presidential immunity ruling.

Could this give us a clue as to what we could hear from the high court? So any minute now they will post that first opinion of the day. We do know opinions will be coming both today and tomorrow. And there, are as you noted, a number of blockbuster cases still pending. One of those has to do with Idaho's incredibly strict law on abortion. A document about that case was mistakenly posted on the court's website for a short period yesterday. In the document, this was first reported by Bloomberg News, suggests that the justices are poised to temporarily allow abortions in medical emergencies, not just if the life of the mother or the expectant mother is in danger but if her health is in danger. That had been a state picking -- big sticking point, rather. So, Becky, we're watching for that and some of the other cases and we should get those -- decisions should start dropping soon.",

And so what's going to happen is in Idaho, where there's a very, very strict abortion law that says abortions can only be done in emergency situations, if the mother's life is at risk. So that put doctors in a real conundrum. It was a huge problem because what if something was a serious health concern and an abortion would have resolved that? Well, that could put them in a position where they would face criminal liability. So this is all part of the Biden administration's argument. But the argument was bigger than just this law. It was about a federal emergency care law which, if the Supreme Court adopted, would have said that these laws across the country have to be extinguished. That medical care needs to be given, not just when a mother's life is at risk but when there is risk of a serious medical condition. This draft opinion, what was posted yesterday, seems to fall short of actually addressing that key issue. So it seems that, as you said the last hour, it's more of a kick the can, that more cases will come to the Supreme Court with different factual scenarios. And at some point these issues will have to be addressed, because medical providers don't know what the line is in states where these laws are so limited with abortion rights.",

Also it was going to go with those were bringing claims regarding opioids against that family. And so that amount of money was going to serve as what we'll call colloquially settlements, right? It was going to be payouts relating to those claims. Now they're not immune to those lawsuits. Very, very similarly, the Boy Scouts of America actually has a very similar statutory setup, where there is a bankruptcy, a bankruptcy proceeding. And the victims who made claims against the Boy Scouts of America are going through that proceeding. So it's not really just in isolation that this was something that Purdue Pharma was using to resolve these claims, to resolve litigation and to keep their damages basically capped at whatever that amount of money was. It's also going to impact other similarly -- similar statutory schemes that have gone through the bankruptcy courts. So it's going to have a much broader impact. That's one of the situations where a similar setup has been -- has been done by the bankruptcy court.

But it's -- the Biden administration wanted to jumpstart this Good Neighbor rule and allow it to go into effect, which strictly limited emissions from these power plants in states like Ohio, Indiana, West Virginia, in favor of some of the downwind states, who are being affected or negatively affected by these emissions. And so the Biden administration wanted to put this plan into place despite ongoing litigation fighting the plan. And what the Supreme Court is saying today in this 5-4 decision is that Biden administration, EPA, you cannot put this plan in place like you wanted to. And we're going to have to let the litigation play out. This is significant and possibly very detrimental to this plan because it is likely now that this plan will not go into place before the November election. And then, of course, if Joe Biden doesn't win the next election and it's a different administration, the Trump administration, it looks like complete death for this Good Neighbor plan.

I mean, if you think about what the EPA does, it actually helps regulate between states these things about air quality and water and all the things that make life livable. And so what the liberal justices are saying is, essentially, when you're gutting what the federal government can do, you're essentially saying that it is left up to the states to kind of figure that out in an area specifically where we all breathe the same air, where water is a sort of universal right. And so it really does make the situation much more difficult. Beyond that, when we're thinking about the broader context, this is a bad day for the liberal justices. I mean, we are seeing ruling after ruling coming down in which the conservative majority is making its case felt. And I think that's why, politically speaking, you are going to hear tonight, while maybe not referring to these rulings, you are going to hear in the debate discussion of the Supreme Court.

Wade two years ago. And the American public saw that the law of the land since the 1970s had suddenly been overturned just because Donald Trump had appointed three new justices. And that is really when we start -- we started to see the confidence in the Supreme Court and the approval of the Supreme Court by the American public really falter. It was sort of this, wait a minute here; just because these justices, who Donald Trump said that he wanted to appoint, that were anti-abortion or who would, would pledge potentially to strike down Roe v. Wade, that actually happened. And in the past two years, we've seen this just constant -- we've seen these constant low poll numbers. I will say, however, that despite the fact that many of these cases have been bad for the liberals, we have seen some justices, maybe that we least expect, plowing some middle ground here. And we saw it with the mifepristone decision, with the abortion pill, the fact that they dismissed it for standing, meaning the abortion pill can remain status quo, it is fully available now to women across this country. And the majority of women use this in getting abortions, often in states where they don't have easy access to abortions. And if we get that other abortion ruling that we saw previewed inadvertently yesterday, we also saw them take a sort of middle ground here, saying, OK, we shouldn't have heard this. The Idaho law can remain frozen as these -- as this litigation plays out. And we're actually seeing the Justice Amy Coney Barrett, play a role in sort of pumping the brakes on some of these issues. We saw it in the gun case that came out in the past few days or last week, saying that, no, we're not going to rely solely on history and tradition to decide these cases. And they injected -- the chief justice injected some common sense in that gun case, saying, OK, there might not be a completely identical law that we saw in the 1700s at the founding of this country. But it still makes sense to keep violent people, who are -- have these domestic violence restraining orders from having guns. So sure. We have a 6-3 conservative majority that, two years ago, overturned Roe v. Wade. But at the same time, we're also seeing this push and pull where they're not going full throttle because maybe, back to your point, Becky, maybe they're understanding that the country at large, their confidence has been shaken in the Supreme Court.

So the takeaway for everyone watching at home is that this very restrictive Idaho law, that was a basic near-total ban on abortions that has been in effect for several months now, actually ever since the Supreme Court let it go into effect in early January of this year. It is now halted and the Supreme Court isn't issuing any final ruling on the Idaho law or whether or not it conflicts with this federal law. But they're saying that they sort of jumped the gun when they -- when they allowed this law to go forward in January. Now they're pulling back. They are reinstituting a pause on this law while the litigation about this potential conflict plays out because you'll remember, the Biden administration had brought this lawsuit, saying, wait a second, Idaho. You have this law that says that doctors can only perform abortions when a woman's death is imminent. However, there's a federal law that says, in emergency rooms that receive federal funding, doctors have to take all necessary action when even the woman's -- when the woman is at risk of severe injury. It doesn't have to go to death or imminent death but even if the woman could be severely injured in that, maybe her future fertility could be impacted. And if the doctor in that -- in that situation feels that an abortion needs to be performed, this federal law allows for that. And because of that conflict, that's why the Biden administration sued. So at this point, the Supreme Court isn't weighing in on that broader issue. But they're saying we stepped into too soon in January to allow this Idaho law to continue, despite the arguments from the Biden administration. So now we're going to -- we're going to halt that Idaho law and let this litigation play out. I will note, Erica, that there are actually several other states that also have these near-total abortion bans with similar provisions that a woman needs to be near death. Those laws are still in place. So it's going to be, as Justice Jackson said in her concurrence here, she put it this way. Today's decision is not a victory for pregnant patients. It's just a delay. So the pregnant patients in Idaho, they're going to get a reprieve on this but it's not the end of the story and especially not the end of the story in other states that have these very restrictive abortion bans as well.",

They could go to prison, they could lose their license, their families could have to deal with all the fallout from this, right? They can be sued.

But instead we continue to kick the can down the road, demonstrating, yet again, that we're not really serious about addressing maternal mortality, that we're not serious about supporting healthy families. But the thing that we apparently continue to be really serious about is the apparent disposable nature in which we see women in this country. I can not even begin to explain the degree of moral injury that physicians are experiencing. Most doctors that I know went into medicine to take care for people and are now repeatedly being told that, despite having the tools, the knowledge, the skill set, that they can't. And in some cases, they can't at the expense of somebody's serious health and potentially even life. It really is an unsustainable situation.

CNN's Jeff Zeleny joining us now from Atlanta. Jeff just walk us through what we can expect tonight before we talk about who's going to turn up, which Donald Trump, how Joe Biden is going to perform. Let's talk about what we're going to see.",

      "sentences": "Look, I think that President Biden has the most to gain perhaps and the most to lose perhaps in tonight's debate. He is eager to get thecountry, get voters to focus on the contrast between him and former president Donald Trump. He's going to remind voters of the Trump administration and warn them of the second term about democracy and other things he believes that a Trump presidency would be a danger. For president Trump's part he is going to try and make this all about the Biden record, the Biden economy, the Biden immigration challenge, the Biden foreign policy. That is probably the biggest difference overall from their last encounter four years ago. Yes, the coronavirus pandemic is no longer raging. That was the centerpiece of the conversation four years ago. Now it's about Biden's record. So the question here is, can President Biden avoid being mired down in the defense of his record and draw this contrast with Donald Trump? But the reason this is so significant, it's certainly the biggest moment of the campaign. It's been essentially locked in place. Donald Trump has had a small lead perhaps but basically it's too close to call in a margin of error race. This could be a moment that focuses minds. And both candidates have a lot to lose and perhaps a lot to gain as well, Becky.",

CNN Politics' senior reporter Stephen Collinson joining us now from Washington. Stephen, you said, tonight's debate has a good chance of becoming the most fateful presidential debate in U.S. history.

      "sentences": "Well, I think, first of all, it's remarkable that Donald Trump is there at all. This is the thirdelection cycle in which he will be a presidential nominee. That very rarely happens. But I think it would've been very difficult if you had said on January 6, 2021, that Donald Trump be standing on the debate stage for the next election. He tried to steal the previous election in 2020 and had had his mob ransack the U.S. Capitol. We've seen an extraordinary turnaround. Trump has rescued his political career; he has reestablished control over the Republican Party. He has made millions of people who support him believe that the election in 2020 was indeed stolen from him. Looking forward, Trump is advocating a very hard line program that could transform the United States. That is why President Biden will warn tonight that Trump threatens the freedom and democracy and the liberty and the ability of Americans to decide who they want to be their leaders, citing the fear that a second Trump term would further erode democracy and the rule of law. So these are massive issues that have never really been taken up in a presidential debate. Most times, if a Republican or Democrat wins, the republic is not likely to  deeply changed. That could be very different depending who wins this election in November.",

      "sentences": "Well, abortion and the access to it is one of the very few issues in which President Biden leads Donald Trump. He is down on theeconomy, on immigration, on foreign policy. Remarkably, there was \"The Washington Post\" poll yesterday that found that in swing states, voters think Biden is a bigger threat to democracy than Trump. So abortion is a key measure. I think it was important that this abortion case, for Democrats at least, was not decided on the merits but was on procedural grounds. That allows them to argue that the threat to access to abortion is still very much real in this election. They believe that this is an issue that can get moderate voters to the polls, can induce turnout among women voters, even in places where Republicans would be favored. The key districts in this election will be suburban areas around big cities that can go either to Democrats and Republicans in a handful of swing states. Abortion is an issue that really allows Democrats kind of access those voters. Trump, his position is that abortion should be left to the states, which seems like a sensible political position. Except, every time there is a hardline, anti-abortion decision by a state legislature or a conservative court in one of the conservative states, that allows Democrats to stand up and say, this is what Donald Trump has wrought. He created this Supreme Court majority that is allowing all this to take place. So it's a very powerful issue for Democrats.",

So questions about how he is going to perform over 90 minutes standing with Donald Trump, debating beside him. Nobody knows who's going to turn up, which Donald Trump, which Donald Trump of course, is going to turn up. This is going to be a very much more controlled former president. Or is this one he is going to let loose? What's your sense about the -- Joe Biden's, Joe Biden's potential to lose this because of his perceived fragility at this point?",

It's usually the first thing a lot of voters bring up, including Democratic voters, thequestion of whether Biden is fit enough to get through a second term that would end when he's 86. It's uncomfortable but the president has clearly slowed and aged during his first term. A lot of voters are looking at that and saying, well, can he be in command? Can he show strength inside the United States and on the global stage for another four years? That is something that Republicans have been stressing over and over again. Having said that, there have been occasions when the president has been energetic and vital; for instance, the State of the Union address. That's the president Democrats are hoping to see tonight.",

A number of important decisions posted in just the last hour or so,including an important ruling when it comes to a very restrictive Idaho abortion law. It essentially bans abortion in all cases, except if the life of the mother is at risk. Well, this decision by the Supreme Court to dismiss the case and to allow it then to play out will allow doctors temporarily to continue to perform an abortion in a medical emergency if, in fact, the patient's health is at risk, not just the life of that patient. Also, this morning, decisions on a massive multi-billion dollar settlement agreement dealing with Purdue Pharma, which, of course, is the company that many pointed back to a lot of these lawsuits going to the opioid epidemic and addiction in the country, in the U.S. The settlement had actually shielded the Sackler family, the family behind Purdue Pharma, from further lawsuits. That was rejected and the court is signaling more decisions will be released, not just come tomorrow but that the term will now extend into July, into next week. All of this, of course, happening on a very big day politically. We're just hours away from the historic presidential debate, the first debate of this presidential election season in 2024. Joining me, CNN political analyst and historian Leah Wright Rigueur, who's with me now. I do want to touch on a couple of different things. Let's, really quickly there, talk about abortion if we could. What was interesting to me is Justice Jackson writing, this is not a victory; it is a delay, saying she disagreed with the decision to dismiss this case because she feels that, since the court decided to take it up, that there was even more need to address the questions. She said it's only increased in the intervening months. Interestingly, Alito, Justice Alito dissenting here, saying he was baffling (sic) that the court decided to dismiss this. He thinks they should have ruled on it and they should have ruled in Idaho's favor. Those two sets of commentary, I think, Leah, really give us a close look at where this court is, which is not where the majority of the country is as we know from consistent polling.",
