CNN's Natasha Bertrand has the details from the Pentagon. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: A key part of the U.S. military's floating pier off the coast of Gaza that was meant to serve as a launching point to get humanitarian aid into the besieged enclave is now not operational after being damaged in heavy seas over the weekend. It is being moved back to the port of Ashdod in Israel where it is going to be undergoing repairs that are going to take at least a week according to the Pentagon Deputy Press Secretary. Now, this pier project has been really beset with issues since it became operational just over a week ago. It was originally delayed because of bad weather conditions and then last weekend army vessels that were attached to the pier were actually also impacted by heavy seas and bad weather conditions and were beached along the coast of Israel and Gaza. And so this has been a very complex mission, one that involved over 1,000 U.S. troops constructing it over the last two-plus months off the coast of Gaza and it only became operational a little over a week ago and in the span of a short amount of time really the Pentagon insists that they did manage to get over a thousand tons of aid into Gaza, something that they say made the project worth it alone. But still this is a very expensive mission costing over $320 million and of course a very risky one involving this 1,000 plus U.S. troops right there off the coast of Gaza and potentially in harm's way. So it remains to be seen just when this pier is going to be back up and running but the Pentagon says they do expect to put it right back where it was over the last week and hope that it becomes fully operational again within the next several days if not about a week from now. But again, you know, this is a mission that aid groups were deeply skeptical of. They want to see those land routes open rather than just this maritime corridor, but the Biden administration for its part insisting that this maritime aspect of this humanitarian mission was always meant to be supplemental to those land routes and not replace them entirely and as of right now they say it is working at least partially to get much needed humanitarian supplies into Gaza.

Some of the comments from those who heard the argument by the defense team is that it was a scattershot, that Todd Blanche was all over the place, that he made inconsistent arguments and that at times he seemed to be making the prosecution's case. So again, based on everything that's been reported out, I would have to go with what the pundits are saying, which is that the prosecution made a more cohesive and perhaps more compelling argument.",

But a hung jury just means that the jurors could not come to a unanimous decision.The prosecutor has an opportunity to retry a case if there is in fact a hung jury. So it's not a victory by the defense. As I said, we can expect Donald Trump to spin it as such if there is one, but it just simply means the prosecution has to decide whether or not it will try that case again. And we know there are lots of cases where there's a hung jury on the first go round, but then a prosecution comes back and gets a conviction.",

The testimony that Stormy Daniels gave was so compelling. She had details, the details of which would be almost impossible to make up. So if you as a lawyer tell the jury that you're going to prove something in your opening statement and you're not able to prove it, you will be held to account for that. So I think that was a huge mistake and an unnecessary mistake on the part of Trump's team. I think as it relates to the prosecution, the prosecution had to deal with Michael Cohen. And Michael Cohen, as you know, is a liar. He's a convicted felon. But I think the prosecution did a very good job in the summation of dealing with that, saying, look, we didn't choose him. We didn't go to witness role and pick him out. He is a key witness in this case because Donald Trump chose him, and he chose him for the very same reason that the Trump team is attacking him. He chose Michael Cohen because he was pretty ruthless that he would do anything to prove his loyalty to Donald Trump. So again, prosecutors don't always choose their witnesses. And of course, anyone would have preferred a witness that didn't have the kind of baggage that Michael Cohen had. But I think jurors are smart enough to recognize that this case isn't just about Michael Cohen. It's about all of the other evidence, the testimony from Hope Hicks, the testimony from David Pecker, the written documentation that was submitted, all very compelling evidence that the jurors can rely on despite what they may think of Michael Cohen.",

We've watched the coverage of the closing arguments tonight. Unlike the jury in New York City, I've grilled these people about their politics. I've asked them who they're going to vote for in November because we want political diversity in this group. I feel we've succeeded because five of you say you're going to vote for Joe Biden. Five of you say you're going to vote for Donald Trump. And two of you are undecided. The first thing I want to ask you though, a show of hands, who feels, think like a juror now, who feels that Donald Trump has been proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt? Raise your hand. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Who thinks that Donald Trump is not guilty? Raise your hand high. 1,2,3,4. We have one undecided person then. Who's undecided? You're undecided. Okay.

Trump was indicted for bringing classified material from the White House to Mar-a-Lago after he left office and for resisting the government's attempts to retrieve those documents.
