Those aid workers were killed Monday in an Israeli airstrike. Their group, World Central Kitchen, is one of the few aid organizations providing desperately needed food in Gaza. Right now, the group for the time being is now understandably paused its operations there.Joining us now is Cindy McCain, Executive Director of the United Nations World Food Programme. She's also the former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. agencies for food and agriculture. Director McCain, thank you so much for joining us. Thanks for all your important work. We are all grateful to you.

It's the first time they've spoken since November.Our White House correspondent Arlette Saenz is joining us now. Arlette, what do we know? What did they speak about? ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, we learn moments ago, that President Biden spoke by phone with Chinese President Xi Jing ping this morning. Their first communication since they met in person at a summit in California in November. Now, this comes as the U.S. has really sought to defuse tensions between the U.S. and China, one thing officials have repeatedly stressed is that they want to ensure going forward that there aren't any misunderstandings in the relationship. President Bide, after he met with Xi in California said that one goal that they had was to be able to pick up the phone and call each other more often to talk about certain issues. And that is what happened today. Now, this call is coming amid a very turbulent time on the global stage, in the wars in Gaza, as well as Ukraine, and North Korea's nuclear capabilities were expected to be part of this conversation. They were also expected to speak, quite frankly, about the tension points between the U.S. and China. That includes China's approach to Taiwan, the provocations in the South China Sea, as well as human rights. A senior administration official had said that the U.S. was also planning to discuss efforts by China to potentially hack into U.S. infrastructure. There's also areas of agreement that the two leaders were expected to touch on. Things like climate change and artificial intelligence. But really, what -- this phone call between the two leaders is the first since they met back in November. The last phone call had been all the way back in the summer of 2022. And it really makes good on the president's intention to try to manage this relationship, clear up any misunderstandings or prevent any misunderstandings from unfolding. And it's not just this high-level engagement from President Biden with President Xi. We're also learning that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is set to travel to China a bit later, in the coming days. She'll be meeting with her Treasury counterparts in the country as well as business leaders and students, all signs of the U.S. efforts to try to ease into few some of the tensions between the two superpowers, something that President Biden has said he would work towards as he's been in office.",

As for Donald Trump, he'll be stomping in both Wisconsin and Michigan today where he set to deliver remarks on what he calls Biden's border bloodbath. All this comes as yet another judge is trying to rein in the former president's rhetoric by expanding a gag order to protect the families of court officials involved in the New York hush money trial.Let's discuss all this and more with CNN political commentator and Republican strategist Alice Stewart and CNN political commentator and former senior adviser to Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, Karen Finney.

Look at what happened to Nancy Pelosi's husband. I mean, look at what happened January 6.And a feeling that family members, particularly ones who are not in the public eye should not be brought into the ire -- you know, Donald Trump free speech is free speech. But you don't need to use that speech to attack people who have nothing to do with the case as a way to certainly try to intimidate people. And I think there's a real concern that that's the impact that could have. And so, look, I think as these cases go on, and judges, they take it very seriously and they're looking at ways to let's keep it focused on the merits of the case.",

In a new memo, the Biden reelection campaign says they think Florida is now a winnable state for President Biden after the state Supreme Court upheld Florida six- week abortion ban, but also let voters have the final say in November. Do you see Florida as potentially now in play for Democrats? STEWARTLook, that decision from Florida Supreme Court yesterday was -- in one decision was a victory for the pro-life community in terms of saving innocent lives. But the fact that now this is on the ballot in December or in the election, this will rally Democrats. And I think Republicans and the pro-life community needs to change the language, stop talking about abortion, and put more emphasis on abortion limits because that is something that more people can agree on. And the bands are certainly energizing Democrats.",

And states like Florida -- majorities of the Floridians actually supported Roe v. Wade and oppose the six-week ban.I think what's important about this ad, though, is holding Donald Trump accountable for his record because one of the things we've seen him do particularly on this issue is to try to have it both ways on both sides of the issue. And the reality is a ban is a ban as a ban. And we've seen time and again, when Republicans have tried to soften that language and say it's a limit. Americans understand. The problem with that is that every woman has a different situation. And you can't have a one-size-fits-all government solution to our most personal private healthcare decisions. And so, look, I do think at this point, it'll be interesting to see does this put Florida in play? Maybe at least for now. We'll see.
