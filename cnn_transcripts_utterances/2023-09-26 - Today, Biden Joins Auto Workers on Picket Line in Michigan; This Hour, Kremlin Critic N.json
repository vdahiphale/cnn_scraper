This is labor dispute and it's a significant one with broad macro economic repercussions, obviously repercussions for the labor union and the big three automakers as well.But the politics is something you simply can't avoid, and that's going to become very acute over the course of the next 48 hours. And here is why. President Biden, of course, won in 2020 in large part because he rebuilt the blue wall. We're talking about Pennsylvania. We're talking about Michigan. We're talking about Wisconsin. Why does that matter in this case in particular? Well, I'll tell you. I think the important thing to note is when you actually move into Michigan here, Biden winning the state by 154,000 votes. That's obviously a very big deal, right? Well, something to keep in mind is track back to 2016, and we'll explain to you why this all matters and why these two visits over the course of the next two days are so significant. Look at this blue wall here. Pennsylvania is red. Michigan is red. Wisconsin is red. In these three states, in particular, the union vote is larger of a share than it is in most states throughout the country. Those are the voters, particularly white working class voters, particularly those without a college degree, that shifted heavily towards Trump in 2016, Biden working very hard to pull them back in 2020. So let's take a look at Michigan. Look at how close this race was. It was a stunning, stunning result for Hillary Clinton and her campaign. Trump winning the state by 10,704 votes. So, let's actually pull up the exit polls on what the union vote was in 2016. Union households, Clinton had 51 percent, Trump had 42 percent. That's pretty significant, right, a nine-point victory in union households for Hillary Clinton. No, it wasn't. It was a significant drop-off from where president Obama had been in 2012. It was a focus that the Biden campaign had trying to rebuild that blue wall in 2020. So, what happened in 2020? Well, let's pull back out and go into 2020 and pull that back up. Biden winning Michigan by 154,000 votes, a much larger margin of victory than Trump had in 2016. Where did the union vote land? Well, Biden enlarging it significantly, 62 to 37 percent. This right here, this is critical in a state where one in four households for voters are likely aligned with unions. That's why Biden is there. He is aligned with the UAW leadership. He wants that UAW endorsement. Shawn Fain, the UAW president, will be with President Biden on the picket line, doesn't have the endorsement yet. But that is why this is such a political battle, so much as it is a policy or a labor battle. Poppy?",

That constituency is not shared because he's backed electric vehicle production. Trump is talking about how that's going to wipe out your jobs because they need less union workers to produce those kinds of cars. They're shipping those jobs to China. That's exactly how he won in 2016. He's recreating that.

So, certainly, when this negotiation does end, and I do believe that these workers have a very strong position and significant momentum, there's an argument to be made that the Biden administration will receive more credit this time and the UAW's endorsement, because although the UAW has said they will not be endorsing Donald Trump, they're still very open to endorsing Joe Biden.",

So, they may be very helpful on the battlefield, but if you're talking about 30 tanks, it's not realistically going to make a widespread difference.My guess is that they will use them together to make a real push in one area, but the broader issue on the ground is that this counteroffensive is moving slowly. And that is what President Putin is counting on. He can keep grinding and keep the Russian people suffering for as long as he wants to. President Zelenskyy has to keep his allies on board. And we are heading into the season. It's called a rasputitsa. It basically means it gets very rainy, it gets very muddy then it gets very cold, the ground freezes over, it becomes that much harder to push through those fortifications. And the Russians at this stage, it's important to remember, they're playing defense.",

There had been reports that perhaps a very high ranking official had been killed.Just in just moments ago, Russian Ministry of Defense has now put out a video appearing to show the commander of Russia's Black Sea fleet suggesting he's alive despite those claims from Ukraine that he was killed.

The Ukrainians understood that this was kind of their superpower. And you have this strange juxtaposition of a war that is being played out in the trenches, reminiscent of World War I, but at the same time is implementing some of the most sophisticated technology that we have ever seen on the battlefield.Again, though, the Russians are starting to play catch-up. The Russians are buying lots of drones from the Iranians, they're stockpiling them. And as we head into this so-called rasputitsa season, right, where you might see fewer or less movement on the actual physical battlefield, I think you're going to see a lot more drone attacks coming from both sides in Ukraine and also beyond.",

But there has been a shift, particularly among House Republicans, but also some shifts in terms of how the American people feel about the funding. When -- if you're the international community, if you're the Ukrainians who -- you've mentioned Zelenskyy needs his allies desperately at this moment, talk about what this battle on Capitol Hill means more broadly.",

They understand that if the Republicans decide to really pull back on this funding, if the American people are really starting to tire of this war, it is going to be next to impossible for Ukraine to win it. They desperately need this funding, not just in terms of the weaponry, not just in terms of defense spending. I'm talking simple things like paying government salaries.Ukraine's economy is effectively being underwritten at the moment by the U.S. and by the Europeans as well. And if there's any sense that that support is starting to wane and that there's a kind of malaise kicking in, that is going to be setting off alarm bells. I think it already is setting off alarm bells in Kyiv. And that is exactly coming back to my original point, what President Vladimir Putin has been betting on from the beginning. We can keep grinding. We were born for this moment, whether it's two years, five years or a decade. But the West does not have the same appetite for suffering. And the west, of course, in general, has to answer to its voters.",
