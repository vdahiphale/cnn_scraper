      "sentences": "Yes, I'm glad that you asked that because this was a brutal 24 hours where Southern California was lashed with rainfall that is unprecedented and has produced catastrophic flooding in a number of areas all the way from San Diego northward. The mountains were hit the hardest. The video that you're looking at behind me from Rancho Mirage, which is just to the south of Palm Springs area.All right, for all intents and purposes, tropical storm Hilary. Now 24 hours ago this hurricane is lashing the north and south Baja region. But now it is moving across Southern California still capable of producing catastrophic wind and rainfall. And it looks like it's going to linger into Monday and then gradually taper off throughout the day. But in the meantime, look at the staggering rainfall totals. The heaviest being in the mountains, this Mount San Jacinto with more than 200 millimeters of rainfall. And I have to hand it to the computer models because they really focused in on just how much rainfall some of these areas would get. And they're nearly perfect. Some of the coastal areas between one to three inches of rainfall or 25 to about 75 millimeters of rainfall, a record amount of rainfall in Los Angeles where typically, Los Angeles would see almost none. But now we've got flash flood warnings out across a good portion of Southern California from Los Angeles, these densely populated areas extending all the way over into the border of Nevada. The rainfall continues tonight. So what we've already seen with these record rainfall amounts, there's going to be more so this is in fact, epic. They've already closed some schools. We've seen power outages just about 70,000 people in the state of California, reportedly without power. Also we've seen road damage. We've seen mudslides. We've seen debris flows. It is just widespread and epic. That rainfall is going to continue to move towards the north in the vicinity of Washington, Oregon, also into Idaho, but it's going to be a remnant area of low pressure as we go into the next 24 hours. There you can see it still tapping in the moisture even though this is just a tropical storm. It is still capable of producing that catastrophic flooding and we'll have some gusty winds. One other thing and that is Franklin now Tropical Storm. Its impact is going to be across Puerto Rico, and Hispaniola but it's going to make a rather dramatic turn toward The North as we go into the next 24 hours but we'll keep you updated on that. Laila. [01:05:02] HARRAK: Thank you so much Karen. Thank you for that. Well, meantime at least a nine people were rescued from a riverbed in San Diego. Officials say they're looking for any more residents who may need help and as CNN's Kyung Lah reports the city has never seen a storm like this before. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KYING LAH, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): San Diego's mayor says the city is simply not built to handle a tropical storm, Hilary. So what the city has been doing is trying to prepare the best that it can. What you're seeing throughout this area of Mission Valley is main thoroughfares like this one completely shut down. The reason for these barriers is because the street behind me, this is an area if you're familiar with San Diego, Mission Valley, that is a known flood zone. There's a San Diego river over there. And then all of the hills you see some of the desert area, all of that that funnels down here into the water and the infrastructure needs to hold. What the mayor has said is that there's approximately three to four inches that have already come down and expected over the next 24 hours three to four times that much. That's why the San Diego Unified Public School District has delayed the start of school by a full 24 hours. It was scheduled to start on Monday. That will push by one day. The Navy in fact has moved 10 of his ships out of the bay further into the sea to try to protect those 10 vessels just in case the storm were to create any sort of damage but what the city has seen so far is that it has been able to withstand Tropical Storm Hilary. The rain still coming down. It will be very much what happens in the overnight hours. Kyung Lah, CNN, San Diego. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Leftist Luisa Gonzalez and businessman Daniel Noboa will face off in the second round on October 15. They comes after legislator and former investigative journalist Fernando Villavicencio was gunned down as he left a campaign rally earlier this month while Ecuador is in the grip of murderous drug gangs that have carried out brazen killings, extortion and other crimes, and a country that was heralded for its stability not so long ago.While polls predicted Luisa Gonzalez would finish strongly in Sunday's election, but Danielle Naboa is a big surprise. It all comes as the nation struggles against waves of extreme violence that only seem to be getting worse. CNN's Rafael Romo has that part of the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Pollsters didn't see it coming Daniel Naboa was not among the leading candidates in the weeks before Sunday's first round. But after a solid performance during the presidential debate held exactly a week before the election, voters gave the 35-year-old businessman and former member of the Ecuadorian National Assembly, the right to go to the second round. Daniel Naboa was the son of Alvaro Naboa who was also a member of the assembly and ran unsuccessfully for President three times. He will face Luisa Gonzalez, the protege of former Ecuadorian firebrand President Rafael Correa, a leftist who governed the South American country for 10 years starting in 2007. After her win, Gonzalez said Ecuador urgently needs peace, jobs and security, and repeated what she has said during her campaign that our return to the policies of Correa would allow the country to get out of a wave of insecurity that has made it one of the most violent in the region. In his first remarks after winning the chance to go to the second round, Naboa emphasized his platform focuses on security for Ecuador and employment. He's hoping to rule a country that has been shaken by multiple acts of political violence. On August 9, Fernando Villavicencio, a 59-year-old investigative journalist and former lawmaker was gunned down when he was leaving on rally in Quito, the capital and then on Thursday, Naboa himself said his own campaign was attacked as the candidate traveled with his entourage in the city of Duran in Guayas province. Hundreds of inmates have died in the last year during clashes inside prisons between local drug gangs with the government's seemingly unable to put an end to the violence. Ecuadorians will again go to the polls on October 15 to choose a precedent between the two winners of this Sunday's presidential election. Rafael Romo, CNN, Atlanta. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And so they see joining the BRICS as a possible one option that they would like in order to have alternatives in terms of international relations. They see having access to China as important.

India is in the midst of a revolution, a transition towards adopting electric vehicles. This transformation is being led by small vehicles -- scooters, motorcycles, and vehicles like this. Two-wheeled vehicles vastly outnumber cars on India's roads. With more than 15 million units sold last year, experts say this country is home to one of the biggest two-wheel vehicle markets in the world.

The data from the automotive software company Cox shows U.S. consumers bought nearly 300,000 electric vehicles in the second quarter of this year. That's a new record.Some states have also set a future date to outlaw the purchase of new gasoline-powered vehicles by 2035. But even with tax cuts, price cuts, and excess supply, experts say electric cars probably won't overtake traditional vehicles anytime soon. According to Cox, one big concern is access to a charger. And right now, nearly 30 percent of all public charging stations are in just one state, California. More than 1,050 people are still unaccounted for after the wildfire disaster on Maui. That's the latest estimates from Hawaii governor Josh Green. He says it will take search and rescue teams several weeks to go through all of the rubble. And he's warning families to brace themselves, saying the fires burn so hot and the damage was so extensive the remains of some victims may never be found. Later today, U.S. President Joe Biden will travel to Maui to survey the devastation for himself.

Public broadcaster NHK said Fumio Kishida urged officials to ensure appropriate safety measures were in place. That's as space runs out to contain the contaminated material.
