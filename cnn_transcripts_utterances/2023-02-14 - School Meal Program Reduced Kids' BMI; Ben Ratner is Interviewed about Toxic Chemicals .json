A new study shows the school nutrition standards that were put in place in 2010 actually significantly decreased the body mass index of kids and teenagers.Joining us now with the story is CNN's senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen.

As you said, it brought down children's BMI. You could see it in schools when they put these in place.Now, does that mean that any one child lost a lot of weight because of these? No. But there were enough small changes that if you look at it across the entire U.S. population of children, it really does make a big difference. So, let's take a look at the changes that were put in place starting in 2012. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act said lets have more whole grains, more fruits and vegetables, more low-fate dairy products, let's have less sodium and fat and let's have age-specific serving sizes so that we're not just overfeeding children. And so these things seemed to have made a real difference. This is a huge study of, you know, many, many, many millions of children. Kaitlan. COLLINS: That's kind of fascinating for a lot of teachers and parents who are paying close attention to that. Also, Elizabeth, it is obviously Valentine's Day. I'm wearing pink. You're wearing red. But you're learning something new about chocolate, which is often a gift that people get, as the FDA is now allowing for some health claims to be made on the food labels of certain chocolate products.

So, not necessarily chocolate, but actual cocoa. And there's a -- several different labels that they can put on. Let's take a look at one example. Cocoa flavanols in high flavanol cocoa powder may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. This is the interesting part. Although FDA has concluded that there is very limited scientific evidence for this claim.So, that's sort of FDA speak. I'm going to do it in plain people speak. There's some evidence that these flavanols are good, that they can lower blood pressure. But there's not overwhelming evidence for this. But the bottom line is, if you are going to eat chocolate this Valentine's Day, go for the darkest chocolate you can find. That appears to be the healthiest, not just for blood pressure, but for other types of heart health as well. Kaitlan.",

One of the bigger ones that were lost was the petroleum lube oil. Each tanker carries about 30,000 gallons of that. And there's two tankers unaccounted for.
