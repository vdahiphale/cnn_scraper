They've subpoenaed it several times. They've requested that they preserve records several times. What we don't know is whether or not this was an intentional flooding, or if it was genuinely a mistake. But the maintenance worker who was the one who drained the pool in October, which is a busy season at Mar-a-Lago, also I should note is someone who has caught the eye of the prosecutors here. They've seized his phone. They've talked to him. He is someone who is seen on surveillance footage that they have moving boxes at Mar-a- Lago. We don't know exactly which boxes, but he was moving boxes with another Trump aide. But when it comes to whether or not the role that he played here, they have a lot of questions about this, because we are told that someone has testified to these prosecutors that nothing was damaged when this flood happened in this room where these servers were stored, they kept the surveillance footage, but they view it as suspicious, and they've been asking witnesses about it and raising questions about it. And of course, they're investigating whether or not there was any obstruction in their investigation. So, I think it's just an odd instance that has raised a lot of questions.",

We know that they've had questions for the security guys who were running and in charge of the surveillance footage. So there have been questions among that nature of what exactly was turned over. Trump attorneys have said that everything has been turned over.

I'm told Jack Smith, the special counsel who is investigating the classified documents and January 6 was in that meeting. They've requested a meeting from the Trump side with Attorney General Merrick Garland. They wrote him a letter. They allege that there was some prosecutorial misconduct here. They didn't really say what, it was pretty broad strokes. We know obviously, though, typically, before someone is indicted, their attorneys would like to meet with them. That's not what we're told was the content of this meeting today. I think it was raising questions about the special counsel's investigation. They certainly had some broad complaints, nothing really specific about how this has been handled, but they were inside the Justice Department for about 90 minutes today. I think what's most telling is what Trump was saying after because he was posting, why should he be charged when no other presidents have been charged? We don't know that they told him he was going to be charged for anything, but he was certainly referencing it.",

[20:05:08 ] The defense attorneys request to come in and basically explain to DOJ why an indictment would be a bad idea. It's a bit of a Hail Mary pass like you would see at the end of a football game, one last ditch effort to avoid disaster. What happens is the attorneys come in and they say, you know, they'll make an argument that, you know, the case is weak that it shouldn't go forward, they have compelling evidence of innocence, and then they'll usually argue some level of it would be unfair to go forward against their client if justice was were to do so. You typically don't hear anything said on the other side of the table. DOJ will usually listen to the presentation, give the attorneys all the time they've requested, and at the end of the presentation, say thank you very much for coming. We'll give you a call if we have anything to tell you. It is a long shot strategy. It's worth the effort if you're a defense attorney, but it's certainly not worth pinning your hopes on.",

I think it's highly unlikely that they have significant evidence of misconduct simply because so many elements of this investigation have been ferociously litigated between the two sides.So you've had a lot of judicial intervention and oversight already in this investigation. We had, of course, a search warrant that took place. Justice went back in front of the judge and requested sanctions against the Trump attorneys. They've gone in and, and pursued an effort to pierce the attorney-client privilege to get evidence from Trump's attorney, Evan Corcoran. So there's been a lot of judicial intervention, it would seem that if there was actual misconduct that would have come out. But my suspicion here, Anderson, is that Trump's attorneys know the only way to get an attorney general to really weigh in and remove or stop a special counsel has to be on finding of misconduct. Under the special counsel regulations, that's really the only way you can turn off, an attorney general can turn off the special counsel effort, so if they claim that the special counsel engaged in misconduct, they can essentially fire him, but they have to report that to Congress.

These meetings with defense attorneys trying to basically plead their case before it is indicted, usually come at the very, very end, right before the prosecutor goes before the grand jury and asks them to indict the case. So I think we can see that happen really anytime now, and certainly within the next few weeks.We've also seen all the major witnesses that we're aware of -- most of them anyway -- we know have already been in front of the grand jury. We already understand there's a lot of evidence they have to work with here just from the things that have been publicly reported, like we have much more than that.

In this case, with the witnesses already saying that the flood didn't really damage the computers, it is hard to say.

That is a dangerous, offensive, disgusting message to send to our young people today that the only way to succeed is by being the exception.

Now, I think, first of all, Nikki Haley is a very deft campaigner, did a great job on your town hall, showed her experience, showed her unflappability and this just shows, she is kind of a normal Republican, a little bit of a throwback. Now, you know, is that going to appeal to Trump base voters? Probably not. But there's room for others in this race, and Tim Scott, by the way, has a lot of potential appeal for Iowa and Iowa, as we know, can completely shake up this race. And you know, what people should be focusing on is not the national polls, but what's happening in Iowa, and Tim Scott has got a very sunny Reagan, George Bush, compassionate conservative optimist kind of message. And by the way, the thing I like about that is an interesting debate on the issue that Bakari was talking about, that we'll talk about during this election, but what I liked that he is doing is that contrary to DeSantis and Trump who wants to claim that they are victims and their voters are victims of everything, Tim Scott is saying, I'm not a victim and I like that, and I think a lot of Americans like that. They like that kind of Reagan, you know, you can be anything in this country. Now, again, as a debate we can have it, whether or not it is fair to everybody, but it's a good message and it appeals to you know, old-time establishment Republicans, and people out in Iowa like me, is that enough?

So just to take a step back for a second, there has been a steady drumbeat inside Russia of these attacks over the last year targets, on targeting oil depots, railways other facilities that are useful for the Russians for their war effort in Ukraine.And now we're learning that those mysterious attacks may have been carried out by these sabotage cells that Ukraine has actually cultivated inside Russia over the last several months and even year ever since the war began. We are learning that U.S. officials and Western officials believe that these are a mix of pro-Ukrainians sympathizers as well as agents who are pretty well trained in this kind of warfare, and that U.S. officials actually believe that that attack, that drone attack on the Kremlin that happened last month with those two drones that hit the Kremlin Senate palace, that was actually carried out. U.S. officials believe by those pro-Ukrainian operators inside Russia. We are also learning that they're getting drones from the Ukrainians. It is unclear how the Ukrainians are actually getting those drones into Russia, but we do know that they have a pretty well-established drone manufacturing industry inside Russia and they're somehow smuggling them. U.S. officials believe into Russia. Now, we did as Ukraine for comment, and we got a pretty colorful response from Ukraine Security Services who said, we will comment on instances of cotton only after our victory. Cotton has been burning, is burning and will continue burning. And cotton is a Ukrainian slang term for explosions in Russian territory, Anderson.",
