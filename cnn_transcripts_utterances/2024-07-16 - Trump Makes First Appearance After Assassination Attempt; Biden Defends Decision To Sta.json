A white bandage covering his right ear, a reminder of just how close the would be assassins bullet came. I mean, just listen to the crowd when he emerged.On that stage next to him was his newly chosen running mate, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance, the one-time self-proclaimed never Trumper turn now forever Trumper. Somewhere the bumper stickers are being printed right now. Trump-Vance 2024, or for those who still have a Pence one, just do what Don Jr. posted Sharpie out the P for a V and the E for an A and voila. Vance, tonight shrugging off his well-documented critiques of his new boss. In fact, he thinks that those critiques are going to help the campaign. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. J.D. VANCE (R) VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I said some bad things about Donald Trump 10 years ago, but I think it's actually important to be able, again, to admit that you're wrong. You can make a good case to the American people, people who may have been skeptical of the president back in 2016. You can be skeptical now that we've seen the results. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But the race make no mistake about it is still tight, and there are plenty of voters and plenty of days left for the election, and those who reject Donald Trump and what he stands for irrespective of whether or not he's chosen his running mate.The question now is whether the new Trump-Vance ticket can appeal to those who are undecided voters like here in the battleground state of Wisconsin or as they say, Wisconsin and beyond. Well, joining me here in Milwaukee, former Trump administration official Matt Mowers, CNN political commentator and former national coalition's director for the Biden-Harris 2020 campaign, Ashley Allison, national reporter for The Bulwark Marc Caputo and CNN senior political analyst Mark Preston. Gosh, we're going to challenge all the diction tonight with all the different can we have less, it's him and him and her and him. OK, as we're doing right now. So listen, first of all, we now know that he's picked his running mate. It is Senator J.D. Vance from Ohio, somebody who on Saturday came out to say that the rhetoric of President Biden directly contributed to the assassination on Trump. Meanwhile, Trump is saying he wants take a step back a message of unity. What do you make of this thick?",

First and foremost, certainly injects youth into this campaign, we have had a lot of conversation about the age of the top of the ticket on both sides, certainly injects youth when the youngest vice presidents we could ever have in American history, if he's elected.Certainly also brings a humble upbringing. I mean, everyone's now read Hillbilly Elegy. I'm sure every DNC staffer was required summer reading to learn all about him and everything he's ever written. And so I think he's going to bring that to the fold as well. And so, you know, I think his rollout clearly was done in a Trumpian fashion held to the last minute done in front of an adoring crowd here at the Republican National Convention. I remember being in Cleveland eight years ago, and Donald Trump waited 48 hours before the convention to dominate Mike Pence. Today, he actually did at the convention, and I think it really sends if this was the Trump convention, right. I mean, every speaker we saw tonight show that was about the working class. You had that President, the teamsters union night. That's all amplified by J.D. Vance. And that's the message the campaign's clearly trying to get out there. Right.",

You know, Matt was talking about the party and how things have kind of changed a little bit. I got to tell you, just sitting in the bowl tonight and watching people walk around and around and around.Again, I have spent a lot of many years covering campaigns. I got to tell you, I had a very hard time knowing very many people in there. The party has changed so much from 2016 to where we are now in the folks who are actually active in the party and participating party. That doesn't mean that there still isn't, you know, this Mitch McConnell wing of the party, but clearly we saw what happened to that Mitch McConnell wing of the party, they're getting booed out on. It has become -- it is no longer the GOP. It really is the MAGA party. COATES: Well, more on this and much longer. I want to hold on because I'm going to who does know who we're talking about Senator JD Vance. Let's bring him J.D. Vance's former college roommate or law school roommate at Yale Law School, Josh McLaurin. He's also a democratic state senator in Georgia. Senator McLaurin, thank you for joining us this evening. First of all, are you surprised that he is now the running mate of Donald Trump? JOSH MCLAURIN (D) GEORGIA STATE SENATOR: Hi, Laura, thanks so much. No, I totally expected this. Because I know J.D. to be an angry person. I think he controlled his anger more in law school when I had the chance to know Him. But it's really been unleashed now. You heard it yourself just a minute ago. He didn't say let's elect Donald Trump and make things better for people. He said, let's elect Donald Trump to punish Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Now that framing is vindictive. It's about revenge. And he's unapologetic about that. Now. I think the comments I heard on the panel basically track my experience, which is he is in this to vindicate anger. And that's the thing I want Americans to understand the most about JD. It's one thing to be a hypocrite. Look, politicians flip flop, right. It's another thing to play that role of a tech dog with such a viciousness, that something really different is going on.",

So now we got to go with him. But how many people really texted their former roommates to say, this guy could be Hitler? I mean, clearly, J.D. has some kind of insight. I mean, he's a student of history. He's a very smart guy. I remember having thoughtful conversations with them. It's not like he didn't get this. He got it, not just back in 2016. But back in 2010- 2011, when he was forming relationships with a lot of law students and graduates who are now you know, very liberal, some of those relationships he maintained for many years after that.So it's not like he's not capable of getting the right answer. It's just that he has decided to forego all of that insight, all of that emotional intelligence, and direct his intelligence and his skill at this agenda. This goal. I have to think, and again, I've been talking about a long time, but you see how publicly angry he is and filled with contempt. I think he just realized in 2016 that when the Republican Party went the direction of the content of Donald Trump, that he had to go along with it. I mean, he's got interviews where he says, I just had to suck it up and support Trump. And I think what would it mean for him personally, is that all that anger he's carrying around, he gets to bring that to bear in being vindictive being that attack dog and making Trumpism an even more potent of form going into the second term.",

The traditional role of the vice presidential nominee is to be the attack dog, you then have a presidential nominee you can kind of rise above it, they can be the unifier.And so in a lot of ways, Donald Trump has taken the opposite, right. He has never found a ball going by him that he has not been afraid to swing it himself. If this now gives them a chance, especially after what happened on Saturday. Lots of eyeballs will be looking at watching that speech on Thursday, they'll be looking for tone as much as substance. They're going to try to see is a softer, gentler Donald Trump to some degree, and then he's still a J.D. Vance out there, who's going to go out there and be able to articulate the case against Joe Biden, who's then also going to be able to fire up the base, that time that maybe frees up Donald Trump to reach out to some new voters he hasn't had in the last few cycles.",

He's very used to talking about the dispossessed white working class and issues that are very important to white people. Yes, in 2016.

They were stationed on the second floor providing overwatch of the rally crowd.This new information coming as Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle insists, quote, \"the buck stops with me\" and that she plans to stay on as director. But questions are swirling around how a shooter could have gotten about 130 yards away from the former president of the United States with a rifle trained in his head. President Biden asked tonight if he feels safe under their protection, his answer yes. Now as for the investigations with the assassination attempt, there are still more questions than answers. The FBI has successfully gained entry into the phone of the alleged shooter and have collected hundreds of (INAUDIBLE) with his family and also his friends. So law enforcement sources say they still have not found a motive. My next guest is a survivor of an alleged assassination attempt that happened in 2022 in Louisville, Kentucky when a man walked into Craig Greenberg's campaign headquarters. Greenberg and his team were having their morning meeting when they asked the man if they could help him. At that point, the man pulled out a gun aimed it right at Greenberg and started firing. Now, Greenberg and his staff emerged from the shooting, mostly unscathed. That is until Greenberg later realized a bullet had gone through his sweater and t-shirt. He is now the mayor of Louisville, Kentucky. Mayor Craig Greenberg, thank you so much for being with me this evening. Louisville, one of my favorite cities.
