It's raising concerns over long-term prospects for winter tourism.Meteorologist Jennifer Gray has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JENNIFER GRAY, AMS METEOROLOGIST (voice-over):  No skiers on this ski lift in Kosovo, just a nice view of the surrounding hills where there is little to no snow. At this time of year, this resort would normally be filled with people hitting the powdery slopes, but not this January. With many places in Europe experiencing above-average temperatures, it's melting vacation plans for winter sports enthusiasts. Weather experts warn this could be a trend. The World Meteorological Organization says over the past 30 years, Europe has warmed at about twice the global average rate -- the highest of any continent in the world. The warmer temperatures resulting in less snow, which can also increase temperatures locally as the dark ground absorbs more of the sun's heat compared to the reflective white snow.

PETER HABERL, SKIER (through translator):  The ski slope is relatively narrow, and in the normal winter you're always able to have a good time in the deep snow. But this winter you keep hitting the grass and stones beneath your skis. GRAY (voice-over):  Even parts of Switzerland, known for its picturesque snowcapped peaks, are looking a little greener. One Swiss cable car operator says the warmer days are affecting business, with usage down 35 to 40 percent in the first week of January compared to last year. Many resorts are offering alternative activities, like hiking and biking, to occupy visitors during the dry patch. And many places are pumping out artificial snow, which some people say isn't really satisfying. ROBERT, SKIER (through translator):  There's artificial snow but it's too warm. It doesn't work. Nevertheless, I'm going skiing. I hope I have a few nice hours that I can ski a bit. GRAY (voice-over):  Mother Nature could be, soon, extending those hours on the slopes. Temperatures are expected to fall by about 10 degrees Celsius next week with average to below-average temperatures for much of France, Germany, Switzerland, and Austria by the middle of next week.

Scientists say the sprawling capital of Indonesia, home to more than 10 million people, is dropping below sea level at alarming rates, mainly due to excessive groundwater extraction. The government of Indonesia has a plan to carve a new capital city called Nusantara out of the dense jungles of eastern Borneo. At an estimated cost of more than $30 billion, it's being designed as a futuristic smart city and touted by government officials as the world's most sustainable. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  The development of the new capital has to become a move towards building cities that are healthy, efficient, and productive. That are designed to be a place where the people are close from any destination. Where they can bike and walk everywhere because there are zero emissions. STOUT (voice-over):  Officials describe the new capital as a sort of Garden of Eden built along the contours of the natural landscape. Nusantara is expected to be completed in 2045 and the government says it will be more than 3 1/2 times the size of Singapore and home to nearly two million people. Officials and developers claim it will have minimal impact on surrounding rainforests that are some of the oldest in the world.",

UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  The area is unique with its natural habitats and native species. And if its mangrove forests are destroyed, all the native species will be gone, too. And the next generations can only hear the stories about the species because they don't exist anymore. STOUT (voice-over):  There is another concern about the project -- the potential displacement of indigenous tribes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  The land and the farms are inherited from our ancestors. The land is the biggest asset of our tribe. For us, the farm is the source of life. If our land is taken away, how could we farm? How could we live? STOUT (voice-over):  To that, the government has said it will compensate landowners. And there are also some critics who say Indonesia should concentrate on fixing the problems in Jakarta, arguing millions of residents will remain the current capital struggling to cope with pollution, traffic, and worsening floods.",
