During the search for the last few days, search that was conducted by hundreds of states, local, federal officers they were able to locate some camp sites and various stockpiles that they believe were directly linked to Burham.

I mean, you have shootings that occur in grocery stores. We have them at block parties and, you know, concerts. And this happens to be one where you've got four victims so it falls under the definition, but it doesn't mean that it's a random act. Again, I doubt if it's random. I think that there is some relationship here. Because they were able to I.D. him so quickly, tells me that somebody knew this individual and someone probably knew why.

Now, this entire region, like so much of the world right now, is undergoing a heatwave and there is actually a heat advisory warning for the Sea of Galilee. The prime minister saying yesterday in a video statement he spent the day out there without a hat, without water, saying it was not a good idea. On Saturday he began to feel dizziness. That's when he went to the emergency room where they started to undertake a series of tests and he was initially diagnosed with dehydration. But then he was kept overnight and he was kept through this morning. It's now about 1:20 here, and he was just released in the last 30 minutes or so, and they continue to do extra tests. And then this morning is when we received word from the hospital that while they were continuing the tests, while still say that the reason for his hospitalization was dehydration, they decided to undertake a series of extra tests. And while they didn't find any sort of heart arrhythmia or anything, they did -- they did decide that in order to continue routine monitoring they decided to use a subcutaneous halter. This is a very small -- about an inch, inch and a half, sort of long device that is implanted under the skin and it provides continuous heart monitoring of the heart. So, although they say that there was no unusual tests come out of any of the tests they did on his heart or anything of his system, doctors did think it was necessary to implement this sort of heart monitoring device. Now, he has been discharged. They say he is in good condition. Benjamin Netanyahu has no known major previous health conditions. But he is 73 years old. There is a heatwave right here. He has been taken to the hospital for feeling unwell in the past. Obviously, it's also a very stressful and eventful time in this region with the rising violence across the occupied West Bank in Israel, an internal political strife that Benjamin Netanyahu is facing. But as of right now, he has been discharged from the hospital but does now have this heart monitor on him. Guys.",

Joining us is Akayla Gardner, White House Correspondent for Bloomberg News. We want to get into those as well, but Kayla, let me first talk about this event that happened in Florida. DeSantis did not attend. Trump spoke for two hours. It's customary for officeholders who were running for another office to be out of the state to be campaigning. President Trump did it in 2020 when he was running for reelection away from the White House, of course. But this event was in Florida. Does the governor lose anything by not being there with Turning Point USA?",

He was in DeSantis' home state in Florida, a place that he also spends time basically touting himself as the front-runner. He showed himself to be confident. He basically called for DeSantis to get out of this race and stop wasting time and money that could be used to defeat Joe Biden. And he also implied he wants other candidates to do that as well.Another thing I think is important to know is this is an event for Turning Point USA, one of the most influential conservative groups, a youth activist group. And they had been in recent months closely aligning themselves with DeSantis, particularly its founder, Charlie Kirk. And that had caused some tension between their camps with the Trump camp. But him being the headliner here definitely is an affirmation of Trump being the person to beat in this race, and it shows that Charlie Kirk is aware of where the base is and that's firmly behind Donald Trump.",

But he was still $15 million short from what Trump pulled in at 35. So, that's a pretty significant difference there. And you -- as you mentioned, he's sort of cutting staff here because a big concern right now is whether he could face bankruptcy. Insolvency is certainly a question here because he's only pulled in about 15 percent of donations from small donors, and that's a huge difference again from Trump whose average campaign donation is $34, just $34.And that's a huge difference here is Trump has certainly showed his ability to get grassroots support, and DeSantis is mostly relying on top dollar interest. And that's certainly a contrast because most of DeSantis' support and as part of his appeal is his ability to bring in these big donors, but it seems like most of his support is coming from the establishment, from big donors, and from the elite whereas Trump is getting voters which ultimately you need to win an election.",

But he's still ahead of Mike Pence who we were almost certain was going to get into this race. So, that's one thing he has into his advantage as well.But it certainly undermines some of his claims that he has overwhelming big-ticket donors. A third of his donations notably came from small-dollar donors, which shows he has some broader appeal. But he still needs to get more money. And it sort of undermines his approach here. His approach is that he is the loudest critic. He's the person who's willing to take on Trump, and it shows that there might not be as much appetite for that as he hopes. But one thing for sure that's notable, he's reached that $40,000 individual campaigns. That's going to get him to the debate stage. And that is something that he believes is going to make Donald Trump get on the debate stage. Trump has yet to commit to doing that.

And Asa Hutchinson who says that former President Trump is disqualified from being the nominee because of his actions on January 6th.Is there something to glean from the most aggressive critics of the former president are at the other end of the spectrum?

And they're polling is doing better, and it seems like that approach is one that is one, getting them more dollars, but also getting them better polling numbers is to be as sort of neutral as possible, or at least very careful and targeted when they choose to criticize Trump.And of course, there's also the race here for the Vice President. Trump is still considering who he's going to pick for that slot.

Now if the heat stress subsides, corals can recover from bleaching. But the real issue is even if a coral doesn't die from bleaching, it has very downstream negative impacts that can last for years.

Now, a recent study by NOAA and the U.S. Geological Survey has found that about 70 percent of the reefs in Florida are already net erosional, and this was before this heat stress.
