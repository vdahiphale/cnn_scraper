If you're just join us, let me bring you up to date with our top stories this hour.U.S. National Security adviser Jake Sullivan has wrapped up a news conference in Tel Aviv just a short while ago, after meeting with Israel's President. Sullivan says Israel will transition to a new phase of the war in Gaza in the coming weeks that focuses on precise targeting of Hamas leadership. Meanwhile, in Brussels, the EU is kicking off the 2nd and final day of its leader's summit. It comes after an historic decision on Thursday, with the bloc announcing it would begin membership talks for Ukraine as well as Moldova. We'll have more on both these stories in the coming hours. A dark shadow looms over the festival of lights this year, as many Jews in the U.S. struggle to celebrate Hanukkah in the wake of rising anti-Semitic incidents since the October 7th Hamas attacks in Israel. CNN's Omar Jimenez has the details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The week of Hanukkah is supposed to be a time of joy, but for many Jewish Americans, some of that joy has been replaced with fear. In Greensboro, North Carolina, a man was arrested for vandalizing a Holocaust monument. It was defaced with graffiti that included a swastika inside of the Star of David at the base of the monument, according to the local nonprofit that built the monument. In Oakland, California, the city's largest menorah was destroyed and pieces of it was thrown into a nearby lake, according to images and video from the Jewish Community Relations Council of the Bay Area. The words free Palestine were also sprayed in Arabic around the edges of an amphitheater, near where the menorah had been standing.",
