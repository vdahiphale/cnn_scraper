We begin this hour with some breaking news.As the U.S. begins, humanitarian airdrops today over Gaza, we're now learning that Vice President Kamala Harris will meet with Israeli War Cabinet minister Benny Gantz on Monday in Washington. And it also comes as a senior U.S. official tells CNN that a six-week ceasefire has basically been accepted by Israel. And they're now waiting on a response from Hamas. Now, earlier today, three C-130 Hercules cargo planes dropped a total of 66 bundles of aid in Gaza. They included mainly food, but no water or medical supplies. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is in Washington. Now, Priscilla, President Biden weighed in on the airdrops a short time ago. What is he saying?",

It says, quote, \"The amount of aid flowing to Gaza is not nearly enough. And we will continue to pull out every stop we can to get more aid in.\"Now, senior administration officials earlier today did describe these drops as successful and the way they came to that conclusion is that they have been monitoring where they dropped this aid and they have seen civilians approach it and start to distribute it. Now these were locations that were chosen based on assessments that people were sheltering in these areas and that these people were in need of aid. Now, here's what we know -- you're seeing the images there of what was dropped. It was 66 bundles dropped. This was in combination with the Jordanian Air Force Base, and in total, it was 38,000 meals. Now, those are meals. There was so water or medical supplies that was included in this drop, and administration officials described this as, quote, \"flooding the zone.\" It's sending these humanitarian aid through these drops. They're also exploring a maritime corridor to get more aid in. But none of it is a substitute for the land crossings. They continue to say that those land crossings need to be opened up as well so that aid could come in through there because as you have seen, Omar, and described, it is a dire situation in Gaza. U.S. officials are keenly aware of that and they are trying to scale up the aid that they provide to people in that region. And they have maintained that in the coming days we may see more of these humanitarian aid drops, but it all goes to show how desperate the situation has become that they have resorted to this and are still exploring other avenues to get even more in.",

They have come under fire for what is playing out in Gaza, for the dire situation, for the ongoing ground the by Israel. And they have faced a lot of pressure from voters in the United States who have been calling for a ceasefire. And so the Biden-Harris campaign knows this. They recognize this and oftentimes they mentioned, when confronted with this, the domestic accomplishments of President Biden and also the fact that he does hear these concerns. But what today's event really underscores is that this is an issue that isn't going away anytime soon.

The same poll also shows 40 percent of those surveyed think they have personally benefited from former President Trump's policies.

That's what happened in 1968 when Democrats nominated Hubert Humphrey, even though he didn't participate in a single Democratic primary. And following that nomination, the Democratic Party created what was known as the McGovern-Frazier Commission that really pushed the nomination process into the hands of voters, and they tried to make it a more democratic process.And they've continued to do so since 1968. And I think that having a candidate that is not Biden nominated at the convention when no other candidate participated in the primaries, or at least not a candidate that got any significant support would be a mistake because it would be a move away from democratic values and the will of the people.

Donald Trump appears to be on his way to winning the GOP presidential nomination, but Nikki Haley hasn't dropped out and she continued to draw 30 percent to even 40 percent of voters in these primaries. Some of them are Republican races or only Republican voters can vote, but some of these have been open primaries. So in theory, independents or even people who identify as Democrats could vote for Nikki Haley. All of that said, if those Haley supporters that we have seen to this point stay engaged, is that a concern or warning sign for Trump and the Republicans, as you may try to coalesce Republican support in a general election?",

Clark needs just 18 points to pass Pete Maravich's all-time college scoring record. She's averaging over 32 points a game so she should easily get it. Now, on Thursday, Clark announced that this will be her final season at Iowa and she will enter next month's WNBA draft where she's expected to be the first overall pick by the Indiana Fever. And Clark told reporters on Friday that she wanted to get the speculation about her future out of the way before tomorrow's game. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
