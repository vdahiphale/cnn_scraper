The president -- of course, that summit did get off to like a bit of a tension, after Ukrainian President Zelenskyy voiced his displeasure with some of the items that he had seen regarding whether NATO would set a timeline for Ukraine's entry into the alliance or what pathway they might create for that. Ultimately, the president was able to put aside some of these concerns. And, again, here in that press conference in Helsinki, he once again stressed that the U.S. and its allies do see a future for Ukraine within the NATO alliance. But the president also had some very tough words for Russian President Vladimir Putin. He views the war against Ukraine as having backfired on Putin, partially based on the fact that they were able to expand the NATO alliance, the fact that they were able to rally allies to continue to offer long-term support to Ukraine. You heard the president giving his assessment there that he believes Russia has already lost this war. I also asked the president if he thought there's any chance that Putin might resort to using nuclear weapons. He said that he doesn't think that's a prospect for this moment. But the president is heading home today feeling that he's accomplished everything he has set out to do in this summit and three -- four-day trip to Europe.",
