There will be a parade procession to the Elysee Palace followed by a working lunch. In the evening the Macrons will host the Bidens at the Musee d'Orsay for a state dinner. It's coming on the heels of the 80th anniversary of D-Day. Well, President Biden honored the Allied troops of World War II during a speech on the cliffs of Normandy on Friday. He evoked the legacy as he called on the world to defend democracies under threat. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  They're not asking us to give or risk our lives but they are asking us to care for others in our country more than ourselves. They're not asking us to do their job. They're asking us to do our job, to protect freedom in our time, to defend democracy, to stand up aggression abroad and at home be part of something bigger than ourselves. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He has been there, it will be probably -- by the time he leaves, expected to leave on Sunday, he'll have been there for five days.I don't think a U.S. president in recent history has spent so much time in one single country outside of the United States for some time. This is a relationship that's important to President Biden. He needs strong allies and partners in Europe. It's a relationship that's important to President Macron who courted Donald Trump when he was president, hosted him -- the dinner I think it was in the Eiffel Tower. So Macron has always been careful to try to have a strong working and solid relationship with U.S. presidents. Particularly now Britain is outside of the European Union. France is one of the strongest partners. If you will, that the United States can look to, to have influence in Brussels within the European Union. There are differences, of course, between the two countries but today will be full of sort of ceremony and the symbolic nature of that relationship, attending a ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe, a parade then to the Elysee Palace, a working lunch and then back for a state dinner at the Elysee Palace in the evening. So this really is the French state, the French president laying on the best of what France has to offer to visiting world leaders. So President Biden is really getting the treat of the French today.",

      "sentences": "Well, when you talk about Gaza, there are obvious differences between President Macron's position and President Biden's position. A stark contrast can be seen.When the International Criminal Court, the ICC, called for -- the request for arrest warrants for prime minister Netanyahu and Hamas leaders, the United States condemned that. Even there was talk from within the United States of a challenge to the ICC. But what we heard from France, which is a signatory to the Rome statutes, which supports the ICC, what the ICC is doing. And if there was an arrest warrant for prime minister Netanyahu, if he was to go to France, then the French would be obliged to arrest him if that was to happen. So and the French said that they supported the move by the ICC. So clearly President Biden and Macron see differently on Israel. France is much more forward leaning and wanted to see a ceasefire in Gaza. But it supports the United States' position that, calling for an independent Palestinian state or recognizing an independent Palestinian state. Right now it's not the right course of action. And on Ukraine as well, President Macron is more forward leaning than the United States. He wants to form a coalition of countries that will send international military trainers, military trainers into Ukraine to train NATO, to train Ukrainian soldiers. No NATO nation has done this, at least publicly, yet. And this is much more than the United States wants to do. When Macron has talked about this in the past, the United States has been very careful to say no. That's not where we are on this. So will it, how will it change and shape that? Well, Macron is going to do his best to push the United States forward. But we know that President Biden is constrained not just by his own world view but by domestic politics at home. He is unlikely to take a strong position that France wants on the war in Gaza. And he's going to be very cautious about how he approaches involving U.S. troops potentially on the ground in Ukraine. The domestic appetite for that is perhaps not in the same place as domestic appetite in France is.",

And certainly what we're seeing on our screens, what we're hearing from the ground is, yes, many children have been killed as a result of this war in Gaza, where the death toll is approaching 40,000. And therefore it's not necessarily a surprise. It was a surprise to the Israelis. The chief of staff of the U.N. secretary general, Antonio Guterres, called the Israeli ambassador to the U.N. to inform him before this announcement was made. The Israeli ambassador recorded, video recorded that conversation and described the Israeli army as the most moral army in the world.

Essentially, what Putin did in his keynote speech is he outlined what he believes could be a new world economic border with, of course, Russia being at the helm. Now as far as the war in Ukraine is concerned, Vladimir Putin once again pointing out that he believes Russia right now is on the offensive. He said that Russia, since the beginning of this year, has managed to take from Ukraine some 47 towns and settlements near the front lines. So clearly he believes that the Russians right now have the momentum. Some other key developments as well, he says right now there is no need for more mobilization on the part of the Russian military because, of course, he believes that they have enough troops for the front lines and also for the rear echelons as well. The other thing that we also saw was Vladimir Putin, once again, essentially telling Western nations that Russia has a huge nuclear arsenal and to be aware of that. [04:25:00] But he did also elaborate on some remarks that he had made earlier, where, in light of the fact that Western nations, some of them are now saying that Ukraine can use Western-supplied weapons to hit Russian territory in a limited way, that the Russians, he believes, could also have the right to supply the same classes of weapons. As he put it, to adversaries of the West, to put them under military pressure. The Russian president now qualifying that somewhat, saying that that is not something that is imminent -- his exact words there. That is not something that's going to happen, quote, \"tomorrow\" -- Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Berlin. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
