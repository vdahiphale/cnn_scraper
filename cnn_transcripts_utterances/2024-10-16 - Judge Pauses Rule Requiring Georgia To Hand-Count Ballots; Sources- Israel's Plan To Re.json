The judge said it's too much too late. CNN's Zach Cohen is joining us now. What else did we hear from the judge?

There's been bipartisan criticism over this new rule and the judge in this case really taking issue with the fact that the Trump-backed Republicans on the State Election Board in Georgia were trying to change the rules about how votes were counted so close to Election Day.The judge writes that it would have caused -- this new rule would have caused \"administrative chaos that runs counter to the entire mission of ensuring a safe and fair election.\" And he goes on to write that \"Because the hand-count rule is too much, too late, its enforcement is hereby enjoined while the court considers the merit.\" He writes invoking January 6, 2021, \"This election season is fraught; memories of January 6 have not faded away, regardless of one's view of that date's fame or infamy. Anything that adds uncertainty and disorder to the electoral process disserves the public.\" Now this is something we've also heard from election officials in Georgia, including Secretary of State Brad Raffensberger and his top deputy Gabe Sterling. Gabe Sterling warning also too that practically speaking, this new rule -- they view it as illegal, and they also don't have the infrastructure in place to support it. Take a listen to what he said after this ruling -- or about this ruling. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GABRIEL STERLING, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, GEORGIA SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE:  Not enough monitors. There wasn't enough processes put around this. It's just -- it's a bad idea to ever change rules this close to an election, especially on something that can open up the chain of custody like that, which we think is really against the law.

And, you know, Sara, he says he hasn't looked at the entire case, but you can tell he's really leaning toward this. Now, we've got to remember 1996, second trial. A jury found that the brothers premeditated the murder of their parents. And the facts are they had many discussions about murdering their parents. They had to get guns though, so they went to Orange County, California from Beverly Hills. They couldn't get the guns -- there was a waiting period -- so they went to San Diego, County -- it's about three hours away from Beverly Hills more or less -- and they were able to get these shotguns. They took them. The parents were watching television one night and they went in and there weren't just a couple of shots. They blew their heads off. And when they didn't think their mother was dead, they continued to shoot the mother until she was dead. Now, the defense was that the father was sexually assaulting the two sons. That was the defense. It really came out in the first trial, which was a mistrial. It didn't come out that much in the second trial. But now the defense is saying they have potential new evidence. We say potential because a judge has to determine this is actual new evidence. And it's a letter that one of the Erik Menendez wrote to his cousin. Here are some excerpts from this letter. It didn't come out in the trial. \"So now I'm stuck here all alone. I've been trying to avoid dad. It's still happening Andy, but it's worse for me now. I can't explain it. He's so overweight that I can't stand to see him. I never know when it's going to happen and it's driving me crazy. Every night I stay up thinking he might come in. I need to put it out of my mind. I know what you said before but I'm afraid. You just don't know dad like I do. He's crazy.\" And Gascon is also relying upon a California law on rehabilitation, as I said, which is interesting because prisoners want to rehabilitate. Now remember, the sons -- even before murdering their parents, they went around Beverly Hills at night burglarizing very, very wealthy homes and people with thousands of dollars of things.
