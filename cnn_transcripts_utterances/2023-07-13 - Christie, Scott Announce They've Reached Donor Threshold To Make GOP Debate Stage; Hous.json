      "sentences": "This is just into CNN. We've learned the House Ethics Committee has revived an investigation into Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz and allegations he may have engaged in sexual misconduct, illicit drug use, as well as other misconduct.We're told investigators have started reaching out to witnesses in recent weeks. CNN's Paula Reid has been covering. I wonder, at this point, do we know why this has been revived, particularly since the Justice Department decided not to pursue allegations previously? Do we know what they're asking witnesses about? PAULA REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Jim, this is not a new investigation into the congressman. Earlier this year, the House Ethics Committee quietly reopened its probe into the Florida congressman. We've learned for the first time that they have begun reaching out to witnesses to begin gathering evidence about his alleged activities. Now these are not new allegations against the congressman here. In 2021, the House Ethics Committee publicly announced it was going to investigate Gaetz and allegations of possible sex trafficking, allegations that he had shared inappropriate videos and images on the House floor, as well as allegations about improper use of campaign funds and other alleged crimes. But that ethics investigation was deferred at the request of the Justice Department that investigated the congressman from late 2020 until earlier this year. When their investigation into possible obstruction of justice, possible sex trafficking and allegations of engaging in sex with a minor, that investigation was closed earlier this year. The congressman was not charged. And the congressman has always denied wrongdoing. But now, the House Ethics Committee reopening this is resurfacing a lot of these allegations. We know at least one witness was asked about possible lobbying violations by the congressman and some of his associates. A source familiar with the committee's work tells CNN that the Justice Department's decision not to charge the congressman has no bearing on what the committee will or will not investigate. But those are the legal technicalities. These are also -- they're happening within a political reality. The fact that the congressman is increasingly at odds with the leadership of his party. This is a Republican-controlled committee. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said he doesn't know anything about this ongoing investigation. And the congressman gave us a statement in response to our new reporting. He said, in part, \"The Ethics Committee has never found me to be in violation of House rules ,though they've been investigating me during my entire seven years in Congress.\" I will note that this investigation was on hold for the past two years. He goes on to say, \"It's not something I'm worried about. I'm focused on the work.\" In response to the possibility that this investigation could be part of some possible retaliation, the congressman tells CNN, \"I always like to think the best about people and prepare for the worst\" -- Jim?",

So the real trend here -- and this is something that leaders at main airlines point to -- is that climate change is really contributing to more extreme weather events. That is what causes thunderstorms when we see delays and cancellations. And of course, that's what causes big turbulence events like this. So of course, the NTSB is trying to get ahold on this.
