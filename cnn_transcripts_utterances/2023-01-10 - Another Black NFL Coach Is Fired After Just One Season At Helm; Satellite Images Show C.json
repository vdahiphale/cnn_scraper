Smith ended his run on a high note by pulling off a last-minute comeback to cap off a 3-13-1 season on Sunday. But the victory cost the team a chance to secure the first overall pick in this year's NFL draft, which goes to the team with the league's worst record.So, Smith is the second Black head coach fired in Houston in as many years, and the franchise let go David Culley last year. ESPN's Stephen A. Smith says the Texans have not been fair. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEPHEN A. SMITH, ESPN ANALYST:  The Houston organization -- the Houston Texans organization are an atrocity. They are an embarrassment. And as far as I'm concerned, if you're an African American and you aspire to be a head coach in the National Football League, there's 31 teams you should -- you should hope for. You should hope beyond God that the Houston Texans never call you. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And it looked really bad while the league was being sued for discrimination about its hiring practices with coaches. What then happened is Lovie Smith, who has an impeccable resume, wound up getting the job. But nobody was going to give him that job in the -- anybody else was going to give him a head coaching job.

But rarely do the individual details matter that much. It's a big, grand, macro-tracking issue that gets us to where we are with the lack of coaches of color in the NFL, which is better I think now than it was maybe three years ago but probably not as good as it was about 15 years ago.

This comes as Beijing continues its battle with an unprecedented wave of COVID infections following its dismantling of pandemic restrictions.Selina Wang has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  I'm Selina Wang in Beijing. Satellite images show crowds at China's crematoriums and funeral homes as COVID cases explode across the country. The images, taken by Maxar in late December and early January and reviewed by CNN, show lines of cars waiting outside of funeral homes in six Chinese cities. The images appear to show that a funeral home on the outskirts of Beijing has even constructed a brand-new parking area. Now, this confirms what I've seen at crematoriums in Beijing and it is consistent with Chinese social media footage that shows overflowing funeral homes. When I visited crematoriums last month, I saw a long line of cars waiting to get in and yellow body bags piling up in metal crates, and workers loading more in. I spoke to families who told me they were waiting for days to cremate their loved ones. All of this suggests China's COVID death toll is far higher than the government's tally of only 37 COVID-19 deaths since December 7 -- a strikingly low number. The World Health Organization and the U.S. have accused China of underrepresenting the severity of its current outbreak. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
