Those remarks are intended to tie together the deep U.S. and Angolan relationship, which has a long, complicated history. This museum overlooks the ocean, where many Africans were then shipped as slaves to America. So President Biden is expected to speak about that dark part of the history. But also the way forward. Now on Wednesday, the president will be focusing on some of the U.S. investments when it pertains to infrastructure in this country. He will be touring the Lobito Corridor, as well as visiting a food processing facility as he's trying to highlight food insecurity as well. A major part of this trip is highlighting that investment in the Lobito Corridor. That is an 1,800-mile railway project, which has yet to be finished, that's trying to connect interior Africa to the western ports to try to export critical minerals. This is all moves being made in the face of Chinas growing influence in the region, with many experts saying that those investments from the Chinese, the billions of dollars that they've poured in here, is really leaving the U.S. and other countries to catch up.",

      "sentences": "Well, Omer Neutra was a tank commander in the Israeli military, and he was one of the first to respond to Hamas' October 7th attacks.And the Israeli military is now confirming that he was, indeed, killed on that day, more than a year after the incident happened. And his body has been held hostage by Hamas in Gaza ever since then. For his parents, of course, this was devastating news. They have held out hope for the last 14 months that their son was still alive. Going to the White House as recently as within the last month, speaking with President Biden, advocating for the release of their son, who they hoped would safely return home. This now leaves four out of the seven American hostages still being held captive by Hamas confirmed dead by the Israeli military, three of them still perhaps believed to be alive. We heard from one of those Americans over the weekend, Edan Alexander, when Hamas released a hostage video of him in which he urges President-Elect Trump, as well as President Biden, to reach a deal to free him and the other hostages in the Gaza Strip. And indeed, that is now where the attention is turning. In the wake of this fragile truce that has emerged between Israel and Hezbollah, there is increasingly a growing hope from Israeli and American officials that perhaps now Hamas will feel increasingly isolated and that a deal can be struck for a ceasefire and a hostage deal. We are hearing now from President-Elect Trump, who seems to be trying to weigh in with an added layer of pressure as those negotiations appear to be restarting, although quietly. President-Elect Trump saying in this Truth Social post that, \"If the hostages are not released prior to January 20th, 2025, there will be all hell to pay in the Middle East.\" And for those in charge who perpetrated these atrocities against humanity, he is vowing that, \"The United States will hit them harder than anybody has been hit in the long and storied history of the United States\" -- Boris, Brianna?",

You know, a lot of big questions here, namely, how this woman was able to slip past at least part of TSA security screening and then slip through Delta gate agents.We now know that the TSA has reviewed security video of this incident on Tuesday from inside of John F. Kennedy International Airport. The TSA says, after reviewing that video, the woman was able to slip through the first step of TSA screening, the facial recognition I.D. scanners, known as cat two scanners. Luckily, though, the stowaway's bags were screened after that. Nothing dangerous found there. Just two bottles of water. But right now, the TSA says it's preparing a civil case against the stowaway.

It can refer or suggest criminal charges to the Justice Department or local law enforcement.What remains a mystery right now is how this person was able to slip past a Delta gate agent at JFK and get down the jetway and onto the plane. A source familiar with the incident tells me that the stowaway was able to evade detection on the plane by the flight crew, since the flight was not all that full. Though, a passenger told CNN that the woman was able to hide by moving between the plane's bathrooms. Still not clear when this woman will come back to the United States. The stowaway is between 55 and 60 years old. She has a Russian passport. And will soon be sent back to the United States, according to an airport official in Paris. That airport official in Paris also tells us this woman is detained and could be detained for up to 20 days. But they hope that they can convince her to come back willingly. If not, they may need to detain her and escort her. Our CNN team in Paris has learned. Right now, not fully clear when that will happen. This woman was booted off that return flight by the flight crew for that second flight to come back here because she caused another disturbance.",
