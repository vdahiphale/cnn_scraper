We'll hear later from Michael Cohen and others. But what you have there is the elements that he's established of the prosecution case -- hey, Donald Trump arranged a scheme to pay people off to benefit his campaign to avoid scandal, so, he could win the election.

I also, though, want to bring in Katelyn Polantz, who has been following this story for us and covering this for us. Katelyn, as we were talking about, look, we've seen direct examination to this point that will likely continue after this lunch break.We started to get a little bit into the Stormy Daniels portion of it all. What more are we expecting to hear today and what more is left for us to hear as far as the gag order goes? KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER:  Well, we don't have an order from the judge on the gag order. The fallout that Donald Trump should face now. The prosecutors say he's broken that order, not to talk about witnesses, jurors, and others in the case. They say 14 times he's violated that, we're waiting to see what the judge does there. That's one thing. Separately, the other thing that's going on is more discussion with David Pecker, more testimony from David Pecker on the witness stand today. We have a little bit more from the prosecutors where he is, Omar, going to be still talking to the jury about that \"catch and kill\" scheme as it relates to Stormy Daniels. He's laid out the three \"catch and kill\" situations where people came forward with alleged affairs with Trump or about them to the National Enquirer\", and then the \"National Enquirer\" got in touch with Michael Cohen, knowing that the campaign would suffer and that Trump would suffer as a presidential candidate if those stories were made public in this circumstance. David Pecker is putting Donald Trump in the room on some of these conversations about caching stories and burying them. The Stormy Daniels one, he is going to be painting the picture of all of the conversations he had with them. So, Omar, that is what we expect to hear as the testimony wraps up as prosecutors are asking questions. But then, there will be a defense cross. And that is when the defense team stands up, they'll ask David Pecker  additional questions to try to -- what's called impeach him or destroy his credibility, hurt some of the statements that he made before the jury -- have the jury reconsider, how they think about what he testified to. We'll have to see how that goes. We do know that he has a plea deal or an immunization deal with the government as someone who's being forced to testify in this case. And also on top of that, we know the defense team wants to highlight for the jury his motivations as a newspaper publisher in these stories and handling of them. So where that goes, it's almost certain David Pecker won't be done on the stand today.",

But the bottom line here, Jim, was that it really was a mixed bag from the Supreme Court. It appears based off of the tone and tenor of the exchanges and the questions, it looks like the Supreme Court is prepared to reject Donald Trump's sweeping that incredibly broad immunity claim. But at the same time, there are also -- it appears not yet ready to give a complete green light to special counsel Jack Smith to move forward with this 2020 federal election subversion case as the indictment is currently written, as the case currently stands. It looks like they may be looking for a middle ground, Jim, where they would send this case back to the lower courts to adjudicate out which of these actions were official, which of these actions were unofficial. There are also some other options that the special counsel could use to try to leap-frog that and slim down the indictment and just focus on the stuff that everyone agrees is unofficial to try to move this along. But Jim, I want to play for you a clip from the oral arguments. It started with a lot of skepticism heading in the direction of Donald Trump. But by the second hour of arguments, the tide definitely turned. and there were some really tough questions for Michael Dreeben, who represents the Justice Department, represents the special counsel. He is a seasoned veteran. He's been at the Supreme Court so many times, and he faced some really sharp questions from none other than Justice Alito, one of the most conservative on the bench.

And another story we're following closely from coast-to- coast protests spreading on college campuses across the U.S. as students demand an end to the war in Gaza and freedom for the Palestinian people. It's happening so fast, it's almost hard to keep track of just how many schools are seeing protests and encampments like this one pop up on campus. The protests that began at Columbia University in New York have now spread to Harvard, Princeton, Georgetown, Northwestern, and many other campuses, including on the west coast. Authorities have arrested hundreds of people as some schools are calling out police to clear those demonstrators. This chaotic scene happened at Emory University in Atlanta. Law enforcement wrangling protesters to ground, put them in zip-tie handcuffs, they also used pepper spray. Emory says the protesters were not affiliated with the school and were trespassing. At least two, though, are professors. We want to go live now to CNN's Polo Sandoval. He's on Columbia campus in New York, Ed Lavandera, he's at the University of Texas where riot police broke up peaceful protests, made dozens of arrests. We saw them knocking a lot of people to the ground. Polo, first, if I could begin with you, tell us what the latest is on the Columbia campus. Has any agreement been reached between the protesters, we should note include both pro-Palestinians, but also many Jewish students who have joined them.

He's not used to having to sit there with everybody watching him. I mean, with court reporters in there who are describing his every move. You know, that is exhausting for someone. So, now they're trying to plan these kind of campaign events that are local. Bringing the campaign trail to them. That's what we saw this morning, 6:00 a.m. He comes down to a construction site. He meets with construction workers, as well as union members. That's a group that he's really trying to court that generally vote Democratic. And that is where I asked him the question about David Pecker. Now, what's interesting, we talked about these two things, kind of, coming together is that as soon as we got here this morning, the prosecution used that answer to the question that I asked against Donald Trump. Saying that he had violated the gag order once more. So, overall, it's really interesting to see these two worlds intersect in a way that they had thought it was happening before when he chose to come to court appearances --",

And Areva, I'm curious from how you've been following what we have seen so far in the testimony from David Pecker. Obviously, the prosecution is trying to build a case that these payments were illegal in the sense that they were trying to influence folks before the election. Do you think Pecker's testimony has been effective for the prosecution so far?",

He's answering very straight -- in a very straightforward manner. And some reports are that he's built a significant rapport with the prosecution on that always bodes well for the prosecution if the questioning is fluid if the person appears credible.Now, of course, we've not seen him cross examined yet by Trump's team, and we expect that to be a pretty, very -- you know, vigorous cross examination. We know Trump's team is going to go after him on his credibility on the, you know, immunity deal he has with the government. But so far, he has been describing very, very salacious details of stories about catching and killing stories to support Donald Trump in his effort to become president of the United States.",

And by far, David Pecker has been a strong witness for the prosecution.I think what makes him so strong is that personal relationship you just talked about. He was a friend of Donald Trump, so this is not a foe. This is not someone who Republicans can point the finger at and say he's, you know, had it in for Donald Trump. That he's been an adversary for years. This is someone that he has worked with for a very long time. They've worked on lots of projects together. He was killing stories for Donald Trump even before he decided to run for president. So, to hear someone's friend come out and testify in the way that he -- David Pecker has can be very, very persuasive testimony for a jury. So, I think the prosecution has done what most good prosecutorial teams do, which is to start their case with a very strong witness, a witness in some ways that cannot be impeached. And that we're going to hear, not only from Pecker, on these stories of catch and kill, but then you're going to hear from Michael Cohen, who's going to come in and, in many ways, you know, support what has been said by Pecker. Then we're going to hear from Stormy Daniels. So, you're going to hear this cascading of testimony all supporting each other. That's going to be very, very powerful for the prosecution.",

So, if they know a particular witness has some vulnerabilities with regards to his testimony, they want to bring those out first.They don't want the jury to first learn about any of those vulnerabilities from the cross examination. So, it's likely that any area where this prosecution team believes that David Pecker is weak, they are going to get that testimony out first. They are going to give him an opportunity to talk about those weak -- weaknesses. Because on cross -- on direct examination, you have more leeway. You get to tell a story. You get to answer the questions, open-ended questions and give more narrative. A really strong cross examination is going to hold you to very short, very concise answers, sometimes just yes or no. So, I would expect that the prosecution before they rest with this witness, any issues that they think could be a problem, we are going to hear about them first from this prosecutorial team before the cross examination from Donald Trump's team. What we're going to be looking for there is they are going to go after him pretty hard on the issue of was this done to influence the election or just to avoid embarrassment to his family.",

Today, what we heard was a majority, it seems, that does not like the breadth of the lower court decision regarding immunity. The fact that the lower court did not discuss the difference between immunity for official acts, however you describe them, and private acts disturbed the chief justice. And I think it's important to look at the chief justice because in a case like this, the chief justice is going to try to have as much consensus as possible and will likely want to write the opinion. So, the Chief Justice, Roberts, seemed very -- it would seem very concerned with the broad rejection of the Trump lawyers' arguments by the lower courts. That's not to say that this court can't come up with some kind of test as the lower court did in 1974 that would allow the trial to go forward.
