That means at least 15 people have been killed since Israel launched a massive incursion across the Palestinian territory on Wednesday. The U.N. secretary general is calling for an immediate end to the operation, saying the developments are fueling an already explosive situation. Palestinian Red Crescent reports a severe shortage of drinking water in the cities of Tubas, Jenin and Tulkarem where the Israeli military is present. CNN's Nic Robertson is with us, joining us from Tel Aviv with the very latest. So Nic, Israel saying that it's trying to root out militants. They're trying to thwart future possible attacks. The Palestinians in the West Bank believe that they're, instead, just trying to broaden and expand the war that exists in Gaza. Walk us through what you're hearing and seeing on the ground.",

They say that they have killed a terrorist leader from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group. A commander in Tulkarem, they say, was killed along with four of his fellow fighters. The same group, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, has actually put out an acknowledgement, that what the person that they call their battalion commander from Tulkarem was killed. There are various videos of him. They essentially say that, although the IDF may have killed him, that they just will not be able to stop their group and other groups from resurfacing and coming back at the Israeli forces. They say that it's absolutely, for them, not a defeat. It's very clear though that the Palestinian population is caught up. The Palestinian Red Crescent say they've lost communications with their headquarters office in Jenin. They say that there's no internet, no hard phone lines, no landlines, if you will know, no cellular phone connection and several -- and several telecommunication providers in the northern part of the occupied West Bank say that their services are all down. So it's hard to get a clear picture. But what we're hearing from groups like the Palestinian Red Crescent is that civilians in these areas can't get out to get food for children. The elderly can't get out. People can't get out to get medicines. So it's an unclear picture precisely what's going on. But the IDF say that one of their operations was initially described as being inside a mosque but then sort of backtracked a little bit, said that it was around and inside a mosque. But they claimed to have found various amounts of military equipment -- machine guns bomb-making material as well. They say that they've discovered a number -- and defused a number of roadside bombs. But we've also seen social media video coming out from the West Bank, which appears to show some of those heavy mechanical diggers that the IDF is using, being hit by explosive devices. But so far at least only one area of this massive operation seems to be being wound down by the IDF; Al-Faraa, they say, that area. Now that operation was over within 24 hours. How long the rest of the operation goes on, saying really isn't clear.",

According to the U.N. until Sunday, from October 7th until this Sunday, a couple of days ago, 622 people had been killed inside of Gaza. And until Sunday, 135 of those were killed in airstrikes. Well, before October 7th, there were almost no airstrikes whatsoever, drones or aircraft inside of Gaza -- inside of the West Bank, rather. So those figures, 622, was inside the West Bank and East Jerusalem. So there is a quantifiable change since October 7th, both in terms of the death toll, both in terms of what we're hearing, that the experiences of Palestinians living inside the West Bank. And they are concerned that this is an extension of the front in Gaza. And they're concerned -- they talk about a Gaza vacation, that this is what they can face in the future, that what's happening in Gaza -- I mean, look, for example, they would say, of what's being done to the roads. These huge mechanical diggers seem to be part of most Israeli operations into the West Bank, where they literally go in. They put a sort of a gouge on behind the digger. It's an armored digger. And then it grinds up the road, churning up the tarmac on the road, without apparently being part of surrounding a particular building or an obvious part of a military operation. And in this way and in terms of the increased numbers of deaths, the Palestinians in the West Bank say that this makes them look and feel like it's Gaza. Like that their communities are getting physically destroyed as well as -- as well as all the deaths and killings, Zain.",

She's going to come up in this interview with some pushback to some of her answers, some demands for better ideas about what she would exactly do as president. And the Trump campaign has been really goading her into doing this interview because it believes that some of her performances in her 2020 primary campaign and as vice president, when she has been put in spontaneous situations, have caused her to stumble into gaffes and be very imprecise on policy. I think what will be very interesting to see is -- now she's the nominee; she's making her own case and not President Joe Biden's -- is whether she's evolved as a political figure.",

Republicans are accusing her of using Walz as a crutch,although it's not at all unusual for a candidate to come out of a convention with a new vice presidential nominee and give a joint interview. In fact, Donald Trump did exactly that with JD Vance a month ago. Harris did it herself with President Joe Biden in 2020. And going back through all the presidential races. So it's not unusual. I just think the paucity of her exposure to questions and to journalists is exacerbating this idea that she's perhaps more comfortable with someone to help her out during the interview than not. But this is also I think a big opportunity for Harris to try and make some kind of emotional connection. If you look at a lot of the polling and focus groups, you find that she got a hearing because she was so successful rolling out her campaign. The convention was an appealing event last week. But there are still voters -- moderates and independents and swing voters -- that need to be convinced. They'd like to know a little bit more about Kamala Harris. So while we in the media are demanding more details on policy and trying to box her into exactly what she would do as president, there is also an opportunity for her to try and reach out to some of these voters. And continue that momentum and set herself up, I think, for the biggest event of the rest of this campaign, the presidential debate on September 10th.",

Under the Biden campaign, for example, in Nevada and Georgia, most Democrats thought that they were already gone. And they were going to go to former president Donald Trump in November. That left Biden with only one route to the 270 electoral votes needed for the White House through the blue wall states of Pennsylvania and Michigan and Wisconsin. Most campaigns, when you need to run the table like that on a very narrow route, you lose. So what Harris has done so far is to expand the political battlefield and give herself more options. I think those figures are quite troubling to the Trump campaign. Not necessarily. We don't know if they're brought out by other polls.

And that's the larger story here, that this could keep risingwith climate change, at least according to United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby. He said just a year ago that, with climate change, it creates more heat. He calls it Thermodynamics 101. That leads to more thunderstorms and, ergo, more turbulence. And we keep seeing this over and over again; 71 people injured on a Singapore Airlines flight not long ago; one person killed because of severe turbulence on that flight. There was a severe turbulence incident on an easyJet flight not long ago. Also on an Air Europa flight; 30 injured on a flight between Spain and Uruguay. So this keeps making headlines over and over again. In this case, this United Airlines flight on its way from Cancun, Mexico, to Chicago O'Hare at 34,000 feet, United Airlines said, encountered this brief period of severe turbulence. That was over the state of Louisiana. So the flight crew decided to divert to Memphis, Tennessee, where the plane made a relatively uneventful landing there, although you can see the curlicue approach there into Memphis. This happened during a time when this continues to grab headlines. And the NTSB says that the turbulence is the top cause of injuries onboard commercial flights in the United States, that causes of turbulence are pretty well known. Often thunderstorms, that could be a cause. The FAA and the National Weather Service here in the United States also says that it could because of mountain wave; essentially, when wind hits the side of a mountain and causes air to rise. There's also clear air turbulence, which can be very invisible. So pilots have no warning. Then there can be also wake turbulence from another airplane in front of another airplane, causing essentially like riding in the wake of a boat. So there can be different causes of this. And it's something that the airlines are keenly paying attention to. They're pouring tons of money of investment into trying to forecast and avoid turbulence. There's more and more investment from the private sector as well. A company called ForeFlight, even putting boxes on planes, of private airplanes, to try and detect turbulence as airplanes are flying, to report it to pilots ahead. The old school method may be best. Pilots do something called PIREPs, pilot reports, where they report turbulence to the planes essentially behind them on the same route. So the technology is getting better, although these problems keep happening over and over again, Zain. The big thing here is that United Airlines says that the seat belt sign was on during this brief period of turbulence that led to those seven injuries, one taken to the hospital.",

In Sudan, the death toll has risen to at least 100 after torrential rain caused a major dam to burst, just another disaster for a country already plagued by civil war and major food shortages as well. CNN's Paula Newton has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA NEWTON, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Dozens dead as floods ravage an already crumbling Sudan. MALEHASHIM MOHAMED, FARMER (through translator):  We lost everything and we could barely rescue our families. The water washed away our farms, vehicles, livestock and crops. It's the worst waterflows I've seen in my life. NEWTON (voice-over):  Locals are burying their neighbors as more than 100 people are found dead due to severe floods. According to government officials flash floods in the country caused a dam in eastern Sudan to burst. It swept through villages, destroying more than 12,000 homes. The U.N. says the death toll could still be higher. Many people are still missing under the rubble. ABU ALI AHMED, ARBAAT RESIDENT (through translator):  The situation is catastrophic to be honest. We have children, families and elderly and others that need continuous medication and this is the fourth day. The water came onto them and destroyed all the villages. And we don't know the circumstances they are going through now. NEWTON (voice-over):  The aftermath of these floods could be more fatal still in Sudan, a country already plagued by civil war. A new independent report found that more than 20,000 people have been killed in Sudan since the start of the conflict in April 2023. The country is suffering from a humanitarian crisis. According to the U.N., more than half of the population faces acute hunger. The growing crisis affects the education of millions of children as well with schools in Sudan either destroyed or shut down. ASRAR SABER ESSAM, DISPLACED STUDENT (through translator):  I have lost my normal life and my dreams have been shattered. I aspire to become a doctor. But with the school closed I feel as though my future and the meaning of life have slipped away.",

The convoy of food is a short but much needed relief to the thousands of people at the brink of this tragedy. Now in the eastern part of the country, thousands are reeling with the aftermath of floods.
