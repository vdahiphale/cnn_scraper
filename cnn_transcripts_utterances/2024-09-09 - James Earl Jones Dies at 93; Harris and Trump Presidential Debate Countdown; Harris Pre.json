Now, in just over 24 hours' time, the first and perhaps onlypresidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and Former President Donald Trump will take place in the crucial battleground State of Pennsylvania. The highly consequential face off couldn't come at a more pivotal time, with new CNN poll of polls showing the race for the White House is a dead heat. 49 percent for Harris to Trump's 48 percent. It also comes as the latest New York Times/Siena College poll shows 28 percent of voters still want more information about Harris compared with just 9 percent saying they need to know more about Trump. The Trump campaign on Monday previewed some of the perhaps lines of attack their candidate could use during the debate saying, Harris', quote, \"owns everything\" from the Biden administration, and that includes the illegal immigration crisis and the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. And in a radio interview with the vice president released Monday, that also gives some insight into her thinking too.

She is set on the very difficult task of trying to turn around an election that the Democrats thought they were losing. She said -- she had, as you suggested, a very good convention. She had a surge of momentum when she took over the ticket from President Joe Biden. But so far, she's not been able to ride that surge to a clear path to 270 electoral votes that are needed to win the presidency. In fact, if the election were held today, I think it's more likely that Trump would win than Harris would. So, this debate is critical for her to build a platform that she can then use to go after that 28 percent of voters who want to know more about her in the eight weeks before the election.",

At the same time, she's creating this overarching narrative that Americans don't have to go through all that chaos and bitterness that Trump represented in his first term and which he may manifest on stage on Tuesday night.

Now, leaders of the Venezuelan opposition who left Venezuela in the past have almost become unknown. They've lost all of their political capital. It remains to be seen whether the strategy of having a double fight, one abroad and one led by Mario Corina Machado inside Venezuela could bring some results, because after more than a month since that election, the government is yet to release the data that everybody has been calling for, and Maduro is very much in charge and happy in his presidential palace in Caracas.

The worst week on Wall Street, in fact, so far this year. All the major averages rising well over 1 percent. Tech the driving force. Boeing rallied more than 3 percent too on word that it's reached a contract deal with its machinists union, and that should take a threatened strike for them later this week off the table. But shares of Gucci parent company, Kering, fell to a seven-year low on new fears about slowing demand from China. And speaking of China's stocks there fell too as new data fueled disinflation fears. Japan's GDP growth was revised lower too, perhaps complicating the central bank's push to raise interest rates further. And Apple's artificial intelligence future came further into focus on Monday with the unveiling of its new iPhone 16. The phone, which goes on sale later this month, is built with a brand-new chip to help power Apple's new A.I. features, which were announced earlier this year. The features include personalized emojis and images and ways to use A.I. to search for pictures and other information on your phone. It will also help proofread documents and beef up Siri, among other things. Apple's hoping that its new A.I. offering will help jumpstart an upgrade cycle and boost slowing iPhone sales, especially in China. But while Apple confirmed that English versions of Apple Intelligence will launch next month, Apple Intelligence in other languages won't be available until next year.

I don't get the sense that either A.I. capabilities are good to go as soon as you buy this phone. It just feels like it's going to take some time and I'm not sure this would encourage me necessarily to get an upgrade. How do you feel? SCOTT STEIN, EDITOR-AT-LARGE, CNET:  I felt the same way in that, you know, a lot of it feels very similar. Of course, better camera tech, slightly larger screen on the nicer models, promises of some better battery life, which does matter to some people, but very similar proposition, but Apple's doubling down a little more on some of the camera features with that dedicated camera button. And they're promising a lot with generative A.I., even though, like you said, that's coming later this year, and it's not even available globally. It'll be in sort of a beta status in the U.S.",

You're also going to have to pay up for those. It's kind of similar to what they did with the Apple Watch Ultra last year, where they finally gave more battery life to the Apple Watch, but at a premium. So, that's pretty frustrating to me, because that's -- that is one of the main things I look for. I'm curious about the camera button, but that really feels like something you'd have to test out and use, and it's kind of -- feels to me like a doorway to visual A.I. on your phone.
