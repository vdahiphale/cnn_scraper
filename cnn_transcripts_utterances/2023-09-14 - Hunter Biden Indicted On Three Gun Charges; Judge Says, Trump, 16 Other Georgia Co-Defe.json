The president's son now facing potential prison time for allegedly buying a firearm while addicted to cocaine and lying about his drug use.Also tonight, new developments out of Fulton County, Georgia, where a judge rejected the district attorney's plan to try Donald Trump and all of his co-defendants together next month. What it means for the case against the former president and the timing of this election subversion trial. And we're now just six hours away from a potential auto worker strike that could have devastating economic consequences here in the United States. Is there still time for the union and the automakers to reach a deal? Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. Let's get straight to the breaking news in the Hunter Biden case, three federal charges against the president's son unveiled today by the special counsel. The indictment stems from a firearms purchase he made in 2018 while struggling with a drug addiction. CNN's Kara Scannell is on the story for us. Kara, what can you tell us about these criminal charges?",

      "sentences": "Yes, this indictment alleges that Hunter Biden had violated three federal laws relating to the purchase of a revolver in 2018, one count of him falsifying or making a false statement on an ATF form that he was required to fill out to purchase this gun.And on that form, he said that he was not using or addicted to illegal drugs at the time. Hunter Biden has been public in a memoir that he wrote about his drug use and his addiction to crack cocaine. A second charge of repeating that false statement on a form that was given to the gun dealer and then also another charge, a felony charge of possessing a gun while he was using or addicted to cocaine. So, three serious criminal charges. And this is a real reversal from what he initially had struck a deal to avoid any prosecution on the gun charge if he had met certain conditions for a period of 24 months. That deal was widely criticized by Republicans and under scrutiny from a federal judge, it had fallen apart. Then the special counsel, now Special Counsel David Weiss, he was the Trump-appointed U.S. attorney overseeing this five-year investigation, he asked to be elevated to special counsel status. That brings us to where we are today with this new indictment. Now, Hunter Biden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, has slammed the indictment and the political atmosphere around it. Here's what he said in his statement. The evidence in this matter has not changed, but the law has and so has MAGA Republicans' improper and partisan interference in this process. Hunter Biden possessing an unloaded gun for 11 days was not a threat to public safety, but a prosecutor, with all the power imaginable, bending to political pressure, presents a grave threat to our system of justice. Now, Lowell is saying that they are going to fight these charges. He's saying that he believes the deal that they struck, that non- prosecution deal, is still valid, and also saying that the gun charges today are unconstitutional because of important Supreme Court rulings and subsequent rulings by federal appeals courts. Now, these are serious federal charges, and if convicted, Hunter Biden could face prison time. The statute of the maximum penalty on one of the charges alone is the maximum of ten years in prison, although that is at the high end. That's not something that a first-time offender would likely face, but certainly the possibility of Hunter Biden going on trial next year when his father is seeking re-election. Wolf?",

And based on the information that's already in the public record, it appears there's a factual basis for them. So, it doesn't appear that the that the grand jury didn't have a reason to vote for this indictment.However, the question is why, when we look at the fact that charges are very, very rarely ever brought against defendants on circumstances like this, particularly when the gun that is allegedly unlawfully possessed wasn't involved in another crime. By The Washington Post report today, they did an analysis of all federal firearms charges for unlawful possession from the period of October 22nd -- October of 2022 to March of '23, charges under circumstances like these comprise only 3 percent, 3 percent of all unlawful possession charges. So, with the rarity of this circumstantial basis for these charges, it raises some very serious questions about why they're being brought in this case.",

Hunter's lawyers say that's still enforceable and he's been performing under the agreement. They've told the court that they are going to move to enforce that. So, you can expect that they'll file motion papers to say, hey, we have a contract, you're breaking it, and that is a significant hurdle that prosecutors are going to have to overcome.",

Let me just say for the record, there is no evidence of that. And these gun charges are completely different from that.

And there were no limitations at that time on gun possession in connection with drug or other substance abuse. So, we've had not only the Supreme Court speak, we just had this identical law struck down by another court of appeals, there's also a bad decision in the Third Circuit, the court of appeals that covers Delaware, while not directly on point, it signals that they're dubious.

But the other 17 defendants, including former President Trump, their trial will be pushed back, and they'll talk about scheduling at the end of the year.But, Wolf, if the reason this is significant really for the country is that if you look at the calendar for next year, it is impossible to find a block where you could place a four-month-long trial among the former president's other legal obligations, his two other potential federal trials, and at least one other criminal state trial and a civil trial. So, it appears this decision means it is highly unlikely that former President Trump will face criminal trial in Fulton County before the 2024 election. I mean, that's really the big headline out of today and it's unclear when other people may be tried, but it appears he wants to keep the other 17 together as a group. Now, as you also mentioned, defense attorneys expressed an interest today in talking to members of the special grand jury. And the judge said, okay, I'm open to that but this has to be something that is voluntary and he wants defense attorneys to submit questions so he can kind of vet what it is they're asking about. I say they're interested in exactly what happened during that process. They want to talk about witnesses, other things that happened. And prosecutors had expressed some reservations because of what this special grand jury has already been through. We know many of their identities or what purports to be their identities have been posted online, they've been doxxed, they faced threats, and prosecutors just really don't want them to have to go through anything else. So, to really compromise here, the judge says, look, you can ask them questions, defense attorneys, submit them to me, but this has to be voluntary. They have to be willing to talk to the defense attorneys.",

I think when we listened last week to the hearing and to the questions that the judge posed and to the concerns, frankly, that he raised about scheduling and just the logistics of trying to do this trial, you could see this coming. And I do think the preview will be important for the former president or other members of the defense team as they think about their case.It still remains to be seen if there's a possibility that some of these defendants might be broken off into smaller groups and tried separately. But as it stands right now, I think Paula is right, that the likelihood that the case against the former president is tried before the election, those chances grew pretty damn today.",

What's unique is not just the request but the fact that we don't use special grand juries in Georgia hardly at all. I mean, it is they rarity to have a special grand jury in session and to have the ability to go and to question them, to see a transcript of those proceedings, criminal defendants just don't get that opportunity. And so here, this is important to the defense and we'll see what they glean. I think the judge is probably handling right. And I will say, as far I've been impressed with his rulings and with the way he moves the case quickly, he's decisive in what he does, but it tells me that this case will continue moving on some pace. But we'll see how the questioning of the special grand jurors go. There's nothing new from the special grand jury being able to talk. You remember the foreperson that special grand jury made sort of a number of media appearances right after that. So, I expect they'll find, as they knock on these doors, some open doors of willingness to at least relay some of the information that went on in the grand jury. They will not be allowed to speak on deliberations and such as that, and, obviously, that deals more, you know, in a general sense with a regular criminal grand jury.

And they're held to a higher standard than their male colleagues. And then you add race as a factor. So, this is a conversation we've not had as a nation about how women leaders are treated differently. But here's the reality. I think this situation is overblown.

I would also say I think there's a relative question for Biden. Hunter Biden is in trouble. He's indicted today. He may get indicted on other things in the future.
