That suggestion came from the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, a man who has been openly supportive of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.And even said in a sermon after the war began that military duty washes away all sins. And so Ukrainians are, not surprisingly, reacting with plenty of cynicism to Russia's announcement of a ceasefire. The Foreign Minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said that this ceasefire should not be taken seriously. And President Zelenskyy said that Russia is trying to use Orthodox Christmas as a cover to resupply the front lines and to regroup its troops. You'd be hard pressed to find very many ordinary Ukrainians who believe that much of anything will change along the front lines this Christmas. And even the head of the Donetsk People's Republic, one of the Russian occupied territories in Eastern Ukraine, said that the ceasefire does not mean that Russian troops won't return fire or will allow Ukrainian troops to freely move around and improve their positions. So, Russia may have declared unilaterally a ceasefire for 36 hours. But at least for the Ukrainians, it appears this Christmas it will be business as usual along the front lines.

That works well for Putin domestically, because he looks like a religious man who is, you know, following the dictates of the head of the church.And then it also plays into, I think, that image that Russia wants in the world, that they are morally the best people in the world, they're peace loving. And, you know, in this situation, let's say that the Ukrainians and the Ukrainians said they're not going to abide by this, then the Russians can point the finger and say, the war mongering Ukrainians are not going along with this ceasefire.

We are told at CNN that Kevin McCarthy did put pen to paper and made a concrete offer to the critics and to the holdouts that he hopes will give them enough concessions, even more than he already has, in order to get him the votes for speaker.Now, critics were hauled into his office and were invited to come review the offer. However, leaving that meeting, a number of the holdouts were very tight lipped and they have not said whether they have changed their vote. So it is likely that we could see some movement today as people have time to really process and digest what this offer actually is. But sources are cautioned to CNN that this could potentially only move around 10 votes, 10 out of the 20 votes against Kevin McCarthy. So, if you do the math, that still leaves Kevin McCarthy short of the 218 votes he needs to become speaker. And perhaps more problematically for Kevin McCarthy is that there could be anywhere between four and six Republicans who will not vote for Kevin McCarthy under any circumstances. And he can only afford to lose four votes. So, it could still be a tough road ahead for him. And meanwhile, senior Republicans are worried that he is giving away concession after concession and he might not get anything in return. So that's the state of play as we head into the next vote today. Congress will adjourn at noon. We'll see whether Kevin McCarthy can show some momentum. Melanie Zanona, CNN, Capitol Hill.",

You know, this has been a world that I've lived in running airport testing and other types of testing. And this bothers me because it all depends on the accuracy number one of the tests being used. And I cannot find any solid data that is going to show that we are going to get a very accurate test coming out of China. We all know those little rapid antigen tests have limited utility unless you use them frequently. The other thing is the PCR tests. It depends on the lab. It depends on where the lab set its threshold for positive and negative. And the final thing is when you have such a rapid spread of disease, you know, and so many people are traveling.

We all see that spike coming up. Right at the top is the suction cup. Well, this new variant has mutations that specifically allow this suction cup to be about 60 to 80 percent more effective in latching on to the ACE receptor on our cell. And that is a simple explanation for it. It is an omicron type of recombinant which is also scary. Two different omicron B2s came together probably in one individual, fused and created a variant. So now this is spreading just dramatically. And if you look at all the other omicron variants and their contagiousness which we know from last year at this time, very contagious. They are here.

We have no monoclonal antibodies which was our real tool where you could get that ID or that shot. Fortunately, we still see the Paxlovid, the pills are quite effective. And that is very important that we use. Then we have a medicine called remdesivir.

I have said this on your show before. It really bothers me when we lead with our health experts in different countries talking about severity. Severity is very individualized. And if you had five vaccines and you've had the bivalent, your chances of having these severe disease because of the amount of immunity you have even with this variant is just so negligible. Now, if you are someone who has no vaccination just like with China right now. These people are naive to this disease it's going to be just as severe as COVID was at any given time. So it is all dependent on the individual. Can a certain variant have a little more infectivity and then hit your organs a little more -- a little bit.
