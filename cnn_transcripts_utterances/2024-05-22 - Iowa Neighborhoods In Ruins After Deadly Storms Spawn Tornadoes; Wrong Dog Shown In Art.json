We're less than two weeks away from the first-ever criminal trial of the sitting -- the son of the sitting president.There'll be making history in Delaware where Hunter Biden is charged with possessing and purchasing a gun while addicted to illegal drugs. It's against federal law for a drug addict or a drug user to buy a gun. So the prosecutors, special counsel, David Weiss, spelled out in some recent court filings who they're going to put on the stand to demonstrate the Hunter Biden was, indeed, using drugs when he bought this gun in 2018. And it's going to be a very personal family affair here, guys. They have three of his former romantic partners lined up to testify against him, his ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, the widow of his brother, Bo Biden, whom he was also in a relationship with, and Lunden Roberts, who is the mother of one of his children. According to prosecutors, they say that these three women will be able to describe Hunter's crippling drug addiction at the time when he bought this gun. Now, he has been very open and public and honest about his mental health struggles. But he says this was basically the worst period of his life. This was his rock bottom. And the prosecutors say that it was not only rock bottom for him, but it was a crime for him to by this gun while addicted to drugs. Guys, it's going to be a very difficult month upcoming for the entire Biden family.",

There are some texts where he's hitting up dealers in Delaware and California to get crack cocaine. And then on the other hand, there are also texts where he's fighting with his family members, some of the women that I just mentioned, about his difficult struggle to get sober. So they're going to use the laptop. They're going to use the texts. And it paints a very troubling and personal story that he's been very public about, but it's going to be under the national spotlight and a national spectacle in a way that that he has never seen before.
