Tonight, Iran's supreme leader vows Hezbollahwill never be defeated, describing the October the 7th attacks as a legitimate act. Meantime, Israel strikes on Lebanon continue with a major road out in the country left impassable. We're live for you in Beirut. Plus, hundreds dead and hundreds more missing in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, we'll bring you an incredible story of survival. We begin though this hour with a show of defiance in Tehran, despite the threat of an Israeli retaliatory attack that could happen at any time. Iran's supreme leader is vowing in public that Hamas and Hezbollah will never be defeated, saying Iran and its allies will not back down. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei led Friday prayers in Tehran today for the first time in years. Iran's Foreign Minister meantime is in Beirut meeting with government officials even as Israel escalates blistering airstrikes on the southern suburbs. And Israeli official tells CNN, a possible successor to Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, one -- was one of the targets, his fate though is unknown this hour. And some Lebanese civilians have been fleeing into Syria on foot to escape the violence as Israel expands evacuation orders. But a key border crossing is now closed after an Israeli strike destroyed a nearby road. The IDF says it targeted what it called an underground tunnel crossing to prevent weapons from being smuggled into Lebanon. I want to get more now from our Ben Wedeman, who is in Beirut for us this hour. And Ben, more strikes, more evacuation orders. And now this main crossing used by civilians to get out of Lebanon to Syria has been hit. What more can you tell us about this?",

So, that is why you had so many journalists there wanting to pepper him with questions. He started by talking about the U.S. job numbers, of course, it's important to point out we're what? Thirty two days or so until the U.S. election. He started talking about how those numbers, 250,000 jobs added in September, expectations were 150,000, and that really blew all the expectations. And we're seeing how the stock market has been reacting to that. But he did say more work needs to be done on keeping prices down. He talked about the port strike that has been averted, but a lot of the questions that you heard there were in terms of not just how Israel may respond, what the U.S. would be OK with, and how to tamp down the current crisis in Middle East. He said there -- Israel hasn't concluded what they will do, if I were in their shoes, I will be looking at alternatives to striking the oil fields. He was asked whether he's worried about Netanyahu is trying to influence the election, and he said that no administration has helped Israel more than he has. He said that sanctions on Iran are under consideration, that is interesting. He was also asked questions about the election in the United States, whether he's confident that it will be free and fair, but then don't know whether they will be peaceful. Listening to this, we have our Julia Chatterley. Julia, let me go to you first, on the economy. Important because, you know, we haven't heard from the President, you can see how excited the journalists were ever in the White House briefing room in during his presidency. But he really started -- he was very strong on the economy and those job numbers, with an election of course, around the corner. This is an important message.

And a lot of what the analysts are pointing to now is saying if Israel really wanted to take out Iranian oil facilities, what they target would be the Kharg Island export facilities that take up to about 90 percent of the exports. I mean, that would involve a phone call to the Saudis to say, look guys, OPEC needs to replace the oil if indeed Iran is taken out. I think there's a relative degree of complacency actually in the oil markets, but the investors have been burned before, if you react in news flow like this without actually having concrete damage on oil facilities, then you can get called out anyway. But we have seen an 8 percent to 9 percent rise over the past week or so in oil prices, we could perhaps see another $5 to $10 if we did see some kind of direct retaliation.

Let's get more on all these strands. I'm going to bring in our diplomatic editor Nic Robertson who was with us in Tel Aviv. And Nic, I'm not sure whether you heard President Biden speaking just now in the last few moments at the White House Briefing Room, but he was peppered with questions about how Israel may respond following Iran's missile strikes. And he said something that was very interesting. He said over questions of whether Israel would target Iran's oil facility. He said if I were in their shoes, in Israel's shoes, I would be looking at alternatives to striking oil fields. He also talked about sanctions on Iran and that may be under consideration.

But what President Biden indicated there is it may be some more time even yet he said he thought that Israel was still considering what it might strike. He said that the United States, the White House was in permanent contact, more than 12 hours a day in contact talking with Israeli Partners over this. It's clear that the discussions have been pretty intense behind the scenes. It's not clear why he said that he thought that if he was in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shoes that he would say -- that he would choose not to attack oil installations inside of Iran. We have heard from the deputy military commander in Iran today indicating a retaliation from Iran. He said look, Iran is a very big country. We got essentially -- you know, we've got a lot of resources, a lot of -- a lot of availability to continue to produce power, continue to produce oil. That's what he was implying. But he pointed at Israel and said look, this is a country that's got three principal power generating facilities and a couple of oil refineries and we can hit them all in one go. So, he's clearly talking about retaliation there apparently in the oil sector as well. So, it's very hard to know what's happening behind the scenes here, but the length of the conversations that seem to be going on -- going on between United States and Israel are interesting at a time of extremely heightened tensions. And the fact that they -- you know, that President Biden said that he wouldn't go into detail about what's being discussed is just an indication of how sensitive it is. We know that -- we know and understand from former officials here there's huge pressure for Israel to strike at Iran's nuclear capabilities. So, the potential for escalation is huge and perhaps why there's this huge pressure from the United States on a pause.",

So you know, the -- it's created the impression that Biden is weak, that the White House is weak, that the United States can't influence the Israeli Prime Minister and the decisions he takes. So, there's that. There's also the under -- very clear understanding that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu far prefers Donald Trump to win the presidency than Kamala Harris previously when it looked like being Joe Biden in the running for it -- for him as well. Netanyahu would rather have Trump. And the reason he'd rather have Trump is Trump is much more hawkish on Iran and has a lot more people around him who would advise hawkish positions on Iran. And that's exactly what Netanyahu wants. He wants Iran's influence in the region to be diminished and he would see Trump as being more effective perhaps -- scattershot and chaotic about it but more effective in achieving that. But you know what President Biden here is saying is a help for those who would who were trying to make up their minds whether or not to vote for Harris in the United States, pointing out that that he and her have been strong allies of Israel, something Kamala Harris continues to reinforce whenever she's speaking about this issue.",

And Lebanese have lived through these tragedies before for but that doesn't make it any easier. And the vast majority of them are victims as are many Israelis who are sheltering during these times.

They have established the control over the deterrence ladder -- I'm sorry the escalatory ladder. And they've beginning to reestablish deterrence. And so, I don't think they should be stampeded into one course of action or the other. They should be thoughtful about how can they continue with our support by the way which has been pretty significant militarily to continue to tighten the noose around Iran and its proxies. And I don't think running after targets in Iran is necessarily the next best step. Although if they have a clear shot at the military target there, who would argue against that?

You could have a lot of damage in the Gulf, but I think that we've demonstrated with our Israeli allies and our Arab friends that we have the upper hand and we should not be too fearful of the Iranians.

First reports said Jihadis shot dead 300 people here in rural Burkina Faso in August. But CNN has obtained a French government security report that says up to 600 were murdered slowly here, echoing survivor accounts. Civilians, women, and children all told by the military to dig a trench like this to protect their town, Barsalogho, from jihadists. The men shot dead for doing so by those same jihadists. The shovels laid down, you can see here, as civilians then lay face down in the dirt themselves, suggesting they surrendered before being shot. Al-Qaeda-linked JNIM are raging unchecked across this area of Africa, the Sahel, where the French military were kicked out after military coups. Here, before the attack, locals were filmed being told to take charge of their own security and dig the trench network. You can see on these satellite images how vast it is.
