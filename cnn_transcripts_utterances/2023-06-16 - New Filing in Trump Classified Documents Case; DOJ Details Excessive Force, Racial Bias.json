We're getting new information right now on the multiple fronts in this Trump investigation.Also tonight, the U.S. Justice Department details systemic violations by the Minneapolis Police Department, saying the problems of excessive force and racial discrimination led to the murder of George Floyd. And dozens of guilty verdicts against the gunman behind the 2018 massacre at a Pittsburgh synagogue. Now that a federal jury had its say, will the killer be sentenced to death? Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You are in The Situation Room. We begin this hour with a new request by the special counsel in the classified documents probe. The filing reflects prosecutors' fears Donald Trump might go public with information about the investigation. CNN's Senior Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid is joining us right now. Paula, walk us through this protective order, as it is called, this request.",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, this is a request from prosecutors that we would very much expect in a case like this. They are asking the judge to approve some ground rules that both prosecutors and defense attorneys have agreed to in terms of how both sides will handle some of the sensitive evidence that's going to be shared throughout this case.And we're not talking become classified information. We will get to that in a minute. But, soon, prosecutors are going to have to start sharing some of their evidence or all their evidence with defense attorneys as this moves closer to trial. So, they are asking that defense attorneys do not share any of that information with the public and they also have some ground rules for the defendants, former President Trump and Walt Nauta. Now, among restrictions that they're asking for, they don't want Trump or Nauta to have any of these materials to take them out of the room to be given copies, even if they take notes, they need to be stored by the lawyers. They are effectively saying that their lawyers should be supervising any and all interactions that Trump or Nauta have with this sensitive evidence. Now, there's another sentence that might catch some people's eye. It says the materials also include information pertaining to ongoing investigations, the disclosure which could compromise those investigations and identify uncharged individuals. Of course, we know, Special Counsel Jack Smith is investigating the former president and many of his associates for their alleged roles in the events leading up to January 6 and whether the former president should be charged criminally in relation to what happened leading up to the election, leading up to January 6th and in the days following. So, we also know that many of the witnesses who were interviewed in the Mar-a-Lago probe were interviewed in that case. So, that's really what's being referenced there. And in terms of classified information at the heart of this case, over 30 documents the former president allegedly took, well, they haven't quote gotten there yet, because the defense attorneys need their security clearances. And yesterday, the judge has told the attorneys, look, let's get that process started so you can get your clearance. They are going to need active clearances, Wolf, in order to view those classified documents. And the attorneys for former President Trump, Chris Kise and Todd Blanche, have both reached out to the Justice Department begin that process, which could take weeks.",

Here, they use the term sensitive but unclassified information. That is a category of government information that is entitled to heightened protection. But given some of the allegations that have been made over the years about Donald Trump and how he reveals information, addresses witnesses, they have a heightened concern here.Now, Trump and Nauta have consented to this protective order. And, to me, the biggest message is, things are moving very quickly. That's the reputation of this Southern District of Florida. It's known in legal circles as a rocket docket.

They are doing the same type of thing, Wolf, in New York, in the state case. There's a protective order similar to this. I think the crucial thing here is the words from Jack Smith that there's an ongoing investigation, that's Jack Smith talk for, I ain't done yet. And he can also, I think, bring additional charges in D.C., in Bedminster, and then there's January 6, which he is also investigating. And I think an indictment there is coming too.",

They subpoenaed everyone, from the I.T. worker all the way up to the chief operating officer. So, they want to make sure that their witnesses are protected, that their evidence is protected, there's no effort to interfere with what is arguably one of the most high-profile cases. Now, then they will go into a more unusual phase, which is the classified materials. But before that happens, all of the defense attorneys need active clearances. Now, we know his current lawyers are in the process of getting those clearances, but I'm told as of this morning, they are still looking for an additional lawyer, an additional defense lawyer in Florida.

And I think that can happen very quickly. But it is more time, absolutely, because of the nature of the case. Now, I do think it will be important for the special counsel to try to put in these guardrails of protecting this information, and that's the way that they can protect their case and even hold Trump accountable if he violates those rules.",

The courtroom was silent, Wolf. You could hear a pin drop. And is should that Robert Bowers, the defendant, he was fairly emotionless in the court as those verdicts were being read off. But then once the 22 capital offense charges were read, and, again, the verdict was guilty, then a little bit of the air was left of the room and you could hear some of the family members and survivors start to sniffle and really feel the emotion of that moment. But, again, Wolf, I just want to go over those charges specifically. I said 63 federal charges, Bowers found guilty of all of them, including the 22 capital offenses that we have been talking so much about. And the primary one here is the obstruction of free exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death. Basically, the jury found Robert Bowers guilty of killing 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life Synagogue back in October of 2018 while they were exercising their religious belief.

Well, just as the -- as it's now predictable almost, Kyiv came under a sustained attack with Kinzhal missiles, six of them, six of the caliber cruise missiles in a very targeted effort to try to break through the defenses of Kyiv, which is yet another sign that the Russian president, in fact, he even said as much, could, he said, have targeted Kyiv in a more aggressive way but are choosing not to. That is not our experience here on the ground where these 12 missiles were shot down. But it wasn't for the want of trying of these missiles to get through. And, possibly, as a consequence of the success of the Ukrainian air defenses, Vladimir Putin has re-upped his nuclear threat. This is what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes, Wolf. This is a really sprawling global cyberattack, cyber campaign that has impacted hundreds of companies across the U.S., seen millions of people have their personal data, including social security numbers, exposed, and has actually impacted federal agencies, including the Department of Energy, as well as universities, including Johns Hopkins and Georgia's statewide university system.Now, it is still unclear exactly what has been taken from the federal government agencies, but U.S. officials did tell us that they don't think the hackers were able to actually obtain anything significant. But the hackers are being extremely aggressive in their demands of the people that they are trying to extort. They are posting online threatening the victims, saying they want their money essentially in order to release their data before they post it elsewhere on the web and expose it further. In one instance, a source told my colleague, Sean Lyngaas, that they have demanded $100 million from one corporate entity to try to get their data back. And so we are told these hackers are Russian-speaking hackers who are basically specialists in this kind of ransomware. And while they have not contacted any federal agencies and insisted that the pay to get their data back, it is still unclear, of course, whether they obtained anything that could be significant and could potentially expose U.S. government information, of course, that the government doesn't want out there. So, it remains to be seen how this plays out, but it really goes to show how one software vulnerability used by such a wide swath of entities can create such a devastating situation, because what appears to have happened is that this was a software that was widely used by many corporations, entities, state and local governments, that was a file transfer software. It's fairly mundane, while the company that owns that software says that it has discovered not just one but two vulnerabilities. So, this could actually expand into an even a bigger hack than we thought, Wolf.",

So, clearly, she's going to play a prominent role in the campaign and taking a prominent voice in attacking Republicans.But I do want to point out one interesting note here. While Jill Biden is taking on Trump and kind of painting this as a choice between Biden and Trump, this is also what the Trump team is doing. They want to paint this as a choice between Biden and Trump. I reported earlier that this is part of their legal strategy, trying to shift the public opinion by changing the narrative. They want this to be political. They want to say all of his legal problems are political. They do that by saying Biden doesn't want to run against Trump, essentially, bypassing the primary. He has not become the nominee yet. It's interesting that they are taking on almost a similar tactic in terms of making this a choice between the two candidates.",
