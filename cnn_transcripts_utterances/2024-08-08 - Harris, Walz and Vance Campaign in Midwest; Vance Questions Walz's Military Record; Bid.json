TIM WALZ (D-MN), DEMOCRATIC VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I left in April of 2005, and this was what -- you know, for me, it was just short of 25 years. And it was -- it was to run for this office. We were really concerned that we were going to try and do both. There's always the Hatch Act and some of the things that you have to be very careful of. (END VIDEO CLIP) HUNT: Walz, of course, referring there to the Hatch Act. That's the law that limits political activities for federal employees, including those who are in the service. Joining me now to discuss: Isaac Dovere, CNN political reporter; Karen Finney, CNN political commentator; and Republican strategist Doug Heye. Welcome to all of you. So, Isaac, this of course, has been a high-flying time for Harris and now her newly-minted running mate, Tim Walz. That overwhelmingly positive rally rolling him out. They are -- and this is sort of the question that I've been having all the way along. I mean, it is inevitable that this campaign is going to start to kind of hit the ground. There's going to be -- there are going to be bumps in the road, right? And we're starting to see that. She gets interrupted by protesters. We saw, you know, a first glimpse of how she's going to handle that, in this high-profile way. And of course, there are going to be attacks from the other side.

No. 1, the top of the Republican ticket not only didn't get out -- you know, got himself out of Vietnam, got himself out of any kind of service, never wore the uniform of the United States; called John McCain a loser; has a pretty wretched record when it comes to treatment of veterans and our men and women in uniform, particularly those who have been captured or injured. But here's the last thing I want to say. You know, Walz served honorably for over 20 years. So, few, less than 1 percent of Americans, ever serve in our armed services. So more importantly, we should honor that service, but we should not lose the thread of what he was actually talking about in terms of gun safety and the idea that you can be a hunter and be -- support the Second Amendment and believe in common sense gun safety measures. HUNT: Certainly, part of what the Harris campaign, I'm sure, wants to bring to the table. Doug Heye, bottom line here? Who do you have a view?

      "sentences": "And good morning to you.Yes, this video from yesterday, near the Pender/Sampson counties line, you can see that tornado in the distance back there. Again, this was one of perhaps a couple of tornadoes yesterday, not just in North Carolina, but spread out over the country. And we still have a tornado watch for today. This valid until 1 p.m. Eastern Time today; again, encompassing portions of North Carolina, as well as Virginia. We do still have some active tornado warnings. They've been off and on throughout much of the morning. That's likely going to continue throughout the day. And it's not just tornadoes, but also the flooding component of this. You can see a lot of that really heavy rain spreading now into cities like Raleigh, as well as Charlotte, North Carolina. And look at all of these red shaded areas. Those are flash flood warnings taking place. And this one with the white outline, that is a flash flood emergency. They've had already up to eight inches of rainfall in that area. And even more is expected, not just in North Carolina, but you can see pretty much up and down the Eastern Seaboard widespread four inches of rain.",
