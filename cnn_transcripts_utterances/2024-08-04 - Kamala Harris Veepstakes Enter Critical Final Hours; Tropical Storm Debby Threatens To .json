There isn't sort of a Democrats for Trump.But this Republicans for Harris effort is basically aimed at leaning on a network of Republicans to talk to other Republicans about why it's OK and significant and important for them to uphold democracy by supporting Vice President Harris. And they said that they're going to make an investment in this campaign. They have a unity ad, a digital ad, that's already out now, and that is aimed, for instance, to appeal to Haley supporters, people that supported Nikki Haley in the Republican primary. So they see this as a key part of the electorate that they have to appeal to these disaffected Republicans that might not necessarily want to support Trump, and that they have to do all that they can to bring them into the fold -- Fred.",

It's heartbreaking to see. Now businesses and homes being inundated by another round of storm surge from a passing tropical storm that's well 100, over 100 miles away from the coast of Naples, for instance. This is just incredible, six to 10 feet, though. That is our greateststorm surge potential across the Big Bend. We call that the catcher's mitt of Florida, really accumulating all that water in the shallow waters of the eastern Gulf of Mexico and that will of course bring dangerous, life-threatening storm surge. But we already saw it impacting businesses well to the south here in Naples and into Fort Myers Beach. The storm getting its act together. We're waiting for that 5:00 p.m. update from the National Hurricane Center. This is the latest radar. There have been pop-up tornadoes, short-lived tornado warnings that have occurred across the state and into the peninsula. Could see a few waterspouts as well. We have a tornado watch that's valid through 8:00 p.m. this evening. But of course, that's not the only threat going forward. I want you to pay attention to this forecast path. This storm could be a high-end category one by the time it makes landfall early Monday morning. That means 90-mile-per-hour winds sustained. We have tropical storm watches along the coastal areas of the Carolinas and Georgia. This system will stall out, lose its steering currents, and sit over an extended period of time across this area. So here is our greatest flash flood threat today, tomorrow, and then I want to advance this into Tuesday where we believe the heaviest of rain will occur and fall across the coastal areas of South Carolina and parts of Georgia. Heads up, Charleston, you know you're prone to flooding. Savannah, Georgia, you as well. We get the inland flooding and rainfall potential and then that matches up with the potential of storm surge.

This has been a confrontation that the U.S. has tried to put off and stop ever since the Gaza war really started. And so far, the U.S. has been able to hold back Iran and its proxy groups.

There are no real talks happening beyond intermediaries, but so far we've been able to get our message through to Tehran that we think that any sort of direct confrontation between Tehran and Jerusalem would not just be bad for the U.S. and its allies, it would be bad for Iran as well.I think Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have again said publicly that they do not want to see U.S. troops back in the Middle East.

They just have to change their lineup, as a result of the triathletes getting that gastrointestinal illness.Now, for the time being, neither Belgian authorities or the Swiss directly link the illnesses of their triathletes to their participation last week in the triathlon events, both men and women. But, clearly, this raises a lot of questions. Of course, it was always a big gamble, on the part of French authorities, to go ahead with these swimming races in the river. It's a (?) huge operation, Fredricka, to get it cleaned up. More than $1.5 billion were involved. But, of course, the weather conditions affect the bacteria levels, in a sense. So, each day, before either training sessions or actual events, the water is tested and a decision is made in the early hours about whether it can go ahead. Last week, a couple of training events were canceled because bacteria levels were too high. The men's triathlon event had to be postponed until the next day. It took place on the same day as the women's in the end. Where authorities decided, even though it had been raining, that the bacteria levels were sufficiently low. That this could go ahead. The latest that we've heard is that the mix triathlon relay event will go ahead tomorrow morning. Paris 2024 have made that announcement. But, of course, without that Swiss triathlete and without the Belgium team all together. So, we've been pressing up Paris 2024 for more answers on what they believe could have caused these illnesses. Whether there might be any link. For now, we've had no answer. But, clearly, a lot of questions being raised about just how clean the water was and whether indeed it was safe -- Fredricka.",
