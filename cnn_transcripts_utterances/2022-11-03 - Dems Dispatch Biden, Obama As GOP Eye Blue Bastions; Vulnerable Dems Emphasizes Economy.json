But I won't be surprised already if you hear from the more far right members of Congress saying we don't need any more surveillance, why are you doing this. And the far left debating, we cannot fund the police any way shape or form.ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: You just mentioned a good point as well, which is that for the public, when they see security details, they think of the Secret Service, right? But the Secret Service isn't just out protecting a building, not just even out protecting just their branch protecting a member of Congress, they also have an intelligence arm that is sharing information, also speaking to local police departments to gather information on emerging threats. I'd covered the Department of Homeland Security in this way, they would always say when you talk to them that this was also a pivotal part of the organization. Does -- is the Capitol Police going to get something like that, because in the meantime, until Congress acts, the vulnerability is still there. And it's not just Pelosi as well. You've had members of Congress that are now dipping into their campaign budget at times to get private security details because of this void insecurity for members as well.",

You can of course, go up to the President if you see Joe Biden in a rally.

You have to go back to Ronald Reagan's days to find red out there on the West Coast. Nevada, increasingly Democratic and presidential elections. You see here, New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona as well, blue, blue, blue, right? Well, this year, let's come forward to 2022. And you look at the map when it comes to Senate races. Republicans think we might be able to take away a Democratic seat in Arizona, maybe take away a Democratic seat in Nevada. That's the one they're most confident about. Republicans say watch.We might have a shot in Colorado, maybe out in Washington State. Is that over ambitious? We'll watch. But we do know those campaigns are in play and Democrats are nervous. Now let's look at the House. This is the current House of Representatives. In the rural states up here, a lot of red but look at California, Oregon, Washington State, a lot of blue there, blue in Arizona blue in New Mexico. Look at the competitive races though. When you look at the competitive seats, Democrats are on defense in a lot of the west across the country they are. But look out west and all these states and all these competitive districts, Democrats on defense, which is why Kevin McCarthy, the Republican who thinks he would be speaker, he's from California, of course. He looks at the entire map, but especially out here, and he says, wow. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), MINORITY LEADER: This is exciting. You're seeing places we haven't seen before, very competitive. I'd watch Oregon, Nevada, Rhode Island, Connecticut, we're playing in seats where you're watching Democrats now funneling money to seats that Biden won by 20 points. That is unheard of that they're worried. They're worried about coastal seats in California. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But look at this map, this is from AAA. Sometimes we overcomplicate things. That's a pretty simple way to look at it. The darker, the deeper the red, the more the gas prices are above the national average. That means the entire west coast. That means, you know, Nevada, then you look still high out there. You can come to the Midwestern battlegrounds in northeastern battlegrounds too where prices are higher. But if you just look up and down that West Coast, you think, oh, OK, now I get it.

And also if you look at the districts along the west coast, everywhere in America, but especially those California districts that this step of Oregon, they hit the suburbs, right? They hit the suburbs, and that has been the tug of war, the suburbs revolted against Donald Trump came for the Democrats, but inflation and crime issues driving some back.Look at this poll of \"The Wall Street Journal,\" which economic plan makes life easier amongst suburban white women.

The GOP is quote, going to get the Senate next Tuesday. President Biden asking voters to think again, making his case last night that Republicans are a threat to democracy, and that Americans should make that paramount when filling out their ballot. Is Senator Ernst right? Can the President turn the tide this late?Let's ask two strategists who know what can and cannot be done in a campaign's final days. Republicans Scott Jennings, Democrat Paul Begala are here with us. Scott Jennings, let me start with you. Joni Ernst, now the latest Republican to say we're going to be in the majority she's going to be in the majority. That's the map of the competitive races. Republicans are hoping to keep Pennsylvania, the incumbents not running and hoping to flip Georgia where Herschel Walker is the candidate, a candidate many would concede has some flaws. Those are the two you're still nervous about?",

So I think if there is a runoff, it's likely Walker would have finished ahead of Warnock. The Atlanta Journal Constitution this week, their final survey had Joe Biden 37 percent. It strikes me it would be very difficult for a Democrat incumbent to outrun that number, if you believe that number.And in Pennsylvania things are tracking the correct way for Dr. Oz. But again, it's an incredibly close race. So if you're a believer in the macro wins of politics, and you'd rather be the Republicans, and if you're a believer in the micro issues that these campaigns have, maybe if you're a Democrat, you feel a little like you're still on the game there. So knife's edge, I'd rather be us than them.",

But first off, just notice how much smarter Scott Jennings is than Joni Ernst. I'm sure she's plenty bright, but she's either dishonest or dumb when she says I know we're going to carry the Senate. Nobody knows anything. And it's a little bit of an insult to the voters.I think what the President did last night is motivate a lot of Democratic base voters who I think quite rightly are worried about the existence of our democracy if these Trumpy election liars get in. And it creates a permission structure for a lot of sensible Republicans to say, well, yes, I don't want that. I'm not happy with inflation. I'm not happy with crime. But gee whiz, I don't want to turn out. So you always want an issue that can unite your base and the swing voters. Again, it's not going to be outcome determinative.

And you know, I'm a little skeptical of it myself, these days, you can tell a lot about what the parties are doing by where the money is going, Democrats moving money to very blue areas, and Republicans moving money into places where they think they've got a real chance now, such as even Washington state, which is if you talk to Republican strategist today, it's live and they think it's a tied race. So what he's doing right now is talking to his donors, and I'm sure and telling them that there's a real chance for Republicans to put a check and balance on Joe Biden's agenda. And ultimately, that's the closing message really, for the Republicans is, if you don't like the direction of the country, they control everything. We control nothing.

The Democrats now are doing just what Scott said, though, triage requires that you first defend your own before you advance. So they're trying to protect, Democrats who are already in office from getting swept out in this way. But you're right, we lost 53 seats in the Clinton midterm.By the way, Obama lost 63, Trump lost 42. So this should be with inflation higher and the president less popular, this should be 70, 80, 90, it's not going to be because Mr. Trump has fallen into so many of these races and disgraced the Republican brand in the eyes of so many Republicans. Yes, will it be enough to help the Democrats to hold on? I don't know.
