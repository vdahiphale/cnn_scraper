We're going to bring that to you, live, when it happens.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) MAYOR JOHN WHITMIRE, (D-HOUSTON): -- Houstonians and our neighboring communities that our first responders were on the job providing our safety. We all know that we had a tragedy at Lakewood yesterday evening when families were coming together to worship and to prepare for America's number-one sports event. We all got calls. It was a tragic scene. It's an ongoing investigation. But I can assure everyone that -- (COMMERCIAL BREAK VOICE-OVER INTERRUPTION OF PRESS BRIEFING)",

Chief I'm Kevin Lily, chairman of the Texas Alcohol and Beverage Commission. First, I'd like to offer my sincere condolences to the congregation of Lakewood Church and to greater Houston. As the mayor said, our places of worship are both sacred and safe. And all Texans grieve what happened at Lakewood Church yesterday. And, indeed, when the sanctity of a church is violated or any house of worship, that is an attack on the very foundation of this nation. And we are so grateful for the action of our Houston police officer involved, as well as TABC agent, Adrian Herrera, who were the officers on the scene, and their actions working together to neutralize the suspect, as the FBI said, saved lives. The term \"hero\" has been used today and sometimes it's said flippantly. But I think what happened yesterday was the personification of heroism and valor, in which a total disregard for your own safety saving others before yourself cheap. I was talking to a couple of your deputy chiefs yesterday, as well as some the FBI agents. And they spoke almost in great respect of the fact that these two officers held their ground. They held their ground in the face of rifle fire at point-blank range. And they continued to fire until the proprietor -- the perpetrator was neutralized. And they did not yield and they remained there as a wall. Agent Herrera and the HPD officer involved were gauntlets. They were a wall that existed between worshipers and terror, between freedom of religion and murder. And we should all be mindful of the sacrifices that our men and women in law enforcement make every day. It is a profession of the highest honor. I just thought this morning that if your son or daughter came into your living room tonight and said, mom, dad, I want to be a cop, I want to be in law enforcement, you should receive that request with reverence and respect. Because these individuals place their lives on the line for us. It is an act of service, unlike any other. And so I would like to thank Chief Finner for your excellent work. I'd also like to thank our mayor. I have known Mayor Whitmire for many years. And he and I don't always agree on everything politically, and we've been on other sides of the fence. But I will say this. For as long as I've known him, he has always honored and respected law enforcement. Public safety, ladies and gentlemen, is one of the most critical things that we have. And I would say this. To elected officials that want to defund police, to elected officials that want to demonize law enforcement, I say they do so at their own political peril. And so we need to unify as a community to defend our men and women in the thin blue line. So I would just like to thank all of you here. And to all the brave men and women to defend our city.",

We learned some new details in the case of this Lakewood Church shooting. One of the big outstanding questions had been, what was the motive of this shooter, of this woman who went into this church between services and opened fire with an A.R.-15? I'm getting a bit more of a clear picture there. Perhaps there had been a familial dispute, we learned there from police, involving her ex-husband, the ex-husbands family, some of whom are Jewish. They think this may be part of the reason why this is all -- this may be part of the motive. They say they found anti-Semitic writings as well in the home of the shooter. And of course, so many questions. And we don't know yet the identity of what we learned of a seven-year-old who she had taken into this church, who has been shot in the head during this process. A boy in critical condition fighting for his life in the hospital?",

      "sentences": "Yes. That's right. Questions, of course, as to what the relation is between this young boy in critical condition and the shooter, who authorities there identified as 36-year-old Genesee Moreno, a Hispanic woman.Interestingly, they said that, in the past, she has used both male and female names. But felt confident, based on a driver's license, that this is a woman who his name is Genesee Moreno. They noted that back in 2016, there had been an emergency detention order and that Mareno has a history of mental health issues. As you said, Brianna, there is some evidence of anti-Semitic writings. The officer there, the commander of the Homicide Division, also saying that, on the rifle, the A.R.-15 that was used, there was a sticker that simply said \"Palestine.\" And that was one of two weapons that Mareno had in her possession. The second one was a .22 caliber rifle. So they didn't go so far as to say, we believe that anti-Semitism is the motive or politics is the motive, but they did say that there is this history of mental health issues, of anti-Semitic writings. And that the ex-husband and his family are Jewish. And that some of what we saw play out yesterday at Lakewood Church could have stemmed from this relationship. It appears to have fallen apart between Moreno and her ex-husband.",
