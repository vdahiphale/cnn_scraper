It put 20 million guns in a lot of the first-time owners hands just in that first year.When there are more guns around, there are going to be more shootings. That is something that the numbers bear out. In 2021, we had more shootings on record, 49,000 nearly. And maybe it's worth asking, should this be on legislators? Where are the gun companies in this? They are silent when these tragedies happens. But they profit from gun sales and benefit from weakened gun laws. This is a corporate ability issue. They could be setting basic standards tomorrow. They could regulate who they sell their guns to. But they are not. I think we should be asking them why.",

What does that mean? He is providing a motive, providing specific details, or how do you read that? CHARLES RAMSEY, CNN SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: Yes, you will get a clearer motive. And I thought that this is one that they could establish a motive relatively quickly, because when he was captured, he had gone to the police station or the substation, which is not what an average mass shooter would do. So that indicated to me that he wanted to turn himself in. And if he turned himself in, he would want to cooperate. S they will have a lot of questions answered as a result of that. It won't change the fact that seven lives were lost in that event, in that incident, and so the tragedy is still there. And very quickly, when you are asking about, you know, the mass shootings, it should not be a surprise. I mean, we have got millions of guns on the street. We're awash in guns. Many are semiautomatic, some are assault rifles, all capable of firing multiple rounds very quickly. It's not unusual from crime scenes where you've got 40 or 50 shell casings on the ground. And people are not just hit one time but hit multiple times. They are hit multiple times. You have people with multiple gunshot wounds from very devastating weapons. That is why the numbers are where they are. And it's not going to down, they're going to continue to rise, unfortunately -- (CROSSTALK)",

I also talked to Senator Mark Warner, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee. And he said, quote, \"Holy heck.\" And followed up saying, \"I would have thought that a year ago when this started coming that anyone who had one of these jobs would have gone back to check.\" And then he, half joking, said, \"Check your closets.\" He's still fighting to try to get briefings and information about how classified information was handled. We also know Lindsey Graham is arguing that potentially there's an issue with overclassification happening. This is what he said at a press conference earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): I don't know how this happened, and we need to get to the bottom of it. I don't believe for a minute that Mike Pence is trying to intentionally compromise national security. And I can't think that about Biden and Trump. We clearly have a problem here. So hopefully, when this is all said and done, maybe we are overclassifying things. That may be part of the problem.
