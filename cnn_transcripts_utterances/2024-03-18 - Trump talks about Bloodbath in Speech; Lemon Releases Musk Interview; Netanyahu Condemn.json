And you're not going to be sell those guys (ph). If I get elected. Now if I don't get elected, it's going to be a bloodbath for the whole - that's going to be the least of it.

(END VIDEO CLIP) SIDNER: In a post on Truth Social, he claimed he was only referring to what he thinks will happen to the auto industry, not the country as a whole. But his opponents say this harkens back to the dark rhetoric he's used in the past. The Biden campaign latched onto the word \"bloodbath,\" saying Trump wants another January 6th.

      "sentences": "Well, Sara, actually, right after Donald Trump had made those remarks on Saturday, we did hear from the Trump campaign, which had rushed to clarify Donald Trump's comments, arguing that he was warning of an economic bloodbath and the impact on the auto industry.And today we heard from Donald Trump himself for the first time since giving those remarks, and he basically said the same thing. I'm just going to read a part of what he posted on his website, Truth Social. He said, quote, \"the fake news media, and they're Democrat partners in the destruction of our nation, pretended to be shocked at my use of the word bloodbath, even though they fully understand that I was simply referring to imports allowed by crooked Joe Biden, which are killing the automobile industry.\" Now, Sara, I was at that rally on Saturday. I can tell you, one, it was very windy. And Donald Trump was really using - or being -- gave a free-wheeling kind of rambling speech because the teleprompter was blowing in the wind. And it was hard to understand what he was referring to. But here he is trying to claim that he was definitely only talking about the auto industry. Of course, his critics have argued otherwise. Now, I also just want to point out that in other parts of that speech he did use dark rhetoric. He did really paint this dooms day picture of America if he were to lose the election. At one point he used dehumanizing language to talk about migrants and immigrants who have been imprisoned for violent crimes that they committed. He also repeatedly vowed to free those who were convicted for their role on January 6th. He referred to them as hostages. A term we have heard Donald Trump use repeatedly in the past. But he's received a lot of criticism for that to, including from his former vice president, Mike Pence, who argue that that term is just not acceptable, especially when you consider there are many American hostages still being held in Gaza currently.",

Also, Republican strategists Rina Shah.And, Chris, I want to start with you, and remind people, you are the Democrat on this panel right now. And you think that thinking that this bloodbath comment will somehow stain Donald Trump is a mistake for Democrats. Why? CHRIS KOFINIS, FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF FOR SEN. JOE MANCHIN: I mean, I'm not trying to make an excuse for his rhetoric, but we've been dealing with how many years of his outrageous, offensive rhetoric. I mean how many hours and days we've spent talking about how ridiculous Trump is, how offensive he is. All may be justified. Something is not happening with voters though, because what we've seen, especially over the last six months, national polls, in almost all the key battleground polls, is that Trump is in a better position now than he was in '20, or even '16. So, the question is, why, right? And we have to kind of - Democrats have to tackle the why. And the why, in my opinion, is, Democrats have not made a strong enough case about what President Biden has done and accomplished, all the positives, and what he's going to do over the next four years. If -- I think the concern I have is, if we simply believe that, you know, that Trump is going to either destroy himself, are we going to destroy him, and that will be enough to win the election. I just don't believe it. And the polls, at least as of right now, don't show that's a winning strategy.",

He always says what he means and means what he says. And so his use of violent language is purposeful. Whenever he injects a word that is charged, that is meant to scare people into submission.So, this is a situation in which two things can be true at the same time. Yes, the word bloodbath was taken out of context. I'm somebody who listens to a lot of financial and market talk and that is a word, when used with the auto industry, that has been done before. But again, the former president knows what he's doing with language and therefore we have to take him very literally when he uses certain words because he wants people on his side to have a sense of being riled up, being angry about a media narrative that's out there, for example, that doesn't square with what they thank works. And so you'll see a lot of his side really draw - really direct their ire at media sources. And I think that's essentially what we're looking at here is the start of what will be continually really, really dangerous language. And Trump likes it. We know this.",

So, every time you are able to paint the picture of what a second term for Trump would look like and for who, then that's when you win.But again, you can only do it with words for so long. And I've seen Biden do it. And I think it's falling on silent years, frankly. Sorry, ears that aren't listening. So, the silence essentially from Democrats on exactly how lives will change, I think is - is actually a negative in their -- their columns. So they need to start to really up the ante and again be very depictive, use pitchers, use imagery, visuals, anything to get people to understand what is at stake, what rights of yours will be on the line if Trump gets a second term in the White House.",
