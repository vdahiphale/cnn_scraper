And you see some houses where there's a Harris sign on the lawn and the next house has a Trump sign. [TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY] 2016 and 2020, and you see a lot of Trump signs there. So you can tell just from looking around, before you talk to anybody, that this is really close.And then you start talking to people and everybody gets the sense that this is yet again, like 2016 and 2020, going to be a photo finish. I have a little treat for you on the road. We've never done this before, but here we are on the Detroit riverfront. I just want to show you, we're in Wayne County, right? That is Detroit. That is absolute key for Kamala Harris. Why did she come here to do 'Charlamagne tha God', because she needs to turn out the African American vote here in Wayne County. But then you go from there into the suburbs and that's the complicated math. That's why we're on the road, trying to figure out can she match the Biden Coalition? Can she overperform where Hillary Clinton was in 2016? Will Donald Trump in his third time on the ballot. He's won in one in Michigan, won it in 2016, lost it in 2020. This is the tiebreaker.",

You look at all that red on the Michigan map, right? Trump runs very strong in the rural areas. That's a surprise to nobody. That has been his building block since 2016. So you just mentioned Flint, right? Flint is in Genesee County, right there. Genesee County is absolutely key for Joe Biden. He got -- for Kamala Harris.Now, Joe Biden got 54 percent there last time. He outperformed Hillary Clinton by just a little bit, by about two points. She lost; he won. Then you come down. Pontiac is in Oakland County. When I started doing this, it was red. It was a Republican suburb, but it is the blue suburb now. That again, Joe Biden won Pontiac -- look at Oakland, he won Oakland County with more than 56 percent of the vote, again, about two points better than Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton lost; Joe Biden won. This is a state and a race nationally that's going to be one on the margin. So when you see these ads targeting different places, they're almost always running in places now where Harris is trying to match or exceed the Biden Coalition. Let's say, for example, that she does lose some black men in Wayne County. Can she make it up in the suburbs like Oakland County? That's what this is about. At the end of the campaign, everybody is trying to do the math within the narrow margins.",

KINGIn the union halls now, you hear a lot of people saying, Stellantis, which owns Chrysler and Jeep, just laid off about a thousand workers here. Kamala Harris has nothing to do with that. That's not good for her. You have workers going out -- blue collar workers going out saying, what just happened to my job? So we're always talking about October surprises Sometimes there's a big national dynamic. When a car company lays off 1,100 people and they're a little grumpy, that's one of the things. I try to do the math out here, but the union workers are interesting. Joe Biden got 56 percent of union households in 2020 here. Can Kamala Harris match that or come really close? It's critical. And Donald Trump has, you see it, you feel it and you hear it. He's made inroads with those blue collar union auto workers, some pipeline workers around here. So, we're in a fight to the end. 20 interesting days ahead to say the least.",

It just means that these states are still counting and they do it in different ways.

And as the night goes on, it may start looking better for Republicans. In a state like Pennsylvania, we saw last time around, the whole Red mirage.
