We'll have more on all the details on that in just a moment's time but first to Pakistan. The Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has been shot and injured. His party says an unidentified gunman opened fire to rally putting his foot. They are calling it an assassination attempt. This video was released in just the past few minutes showing Khan being helped into a car. Let's go straight now to Sophia Saifi, who is in Islamabad for us. Sophia, what more do we know about his health? And who else perhaps was injured in this attack too?",

He's beentaken directly to the main City of Lahore, one of the largest cities in the country, which is close to Gujranwala. We also know by members of his party, the PTI that there has been one death one person has died. In the shooting that took place on his convoy, we've seen images of Senator Faisal Javed, who is a close associate of Imran Khan, who usually travels with him on these rallies. He's been shot in the face. He's asked for people to pray for him. But we've also been told that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, the PTI. Imran Khan's party has put out a statement that this was an assassination attempt against Imran Khan. And we're already seeing the charged speeches and visuals coming out right of the back off this attack on the convoy that was moving in the province of Punjab towards the capital City of Islamabad, Khan launched this rally this long march. But a week ago, calling for early elections, and he had said that he fears for his life. And we've seen for virtual Apple, former Information Minister, Senior Party Leader of the PTI making very charged statements that while their party is a party of peace, that there will be revenge for this. The blood of their workers has flowed; the blood of their Leader has flowed. And it's a very politically charged atmosphere in this country, which is already very polarized because of the various political developments that have taken place here in Pakistan over the past couple of months. We're waiting for the Interior Minister to start a press conference to explain who was behind the attack, what actually unfolded? There have been visuals that have been splashed across all local channels, which is trying to figure out what's actually happened. But there is, without a doubt, the fact that the convoy of Imran Khan, a hugely immensely popular politician and Former Cricket Player here. And in this country, his convoy has been attacked and one person is dead with at least three others injured apart from Imran Khan, Julia.",

It has a jet engine that is maneuverable. But it does stay inside the atmosphere, which makes it easier to shoot down. So cruise missiles are not banned by the U.N. Security Council.

In fact, kind of a bleak assessment about where things stand right now from the governor ofthe Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, let's look at some of the numbers. First of all, with inflation at a point of more than 10 percent Bailey felt there really was no choice but to increase interest rates again. And more rates are likely; he cannot rule them out, but perhaps at a smaller increment. But then there is this bigger economic picture, a narrative that complements these numbers. First of all, Bank Leaders feel that economic growth looking forward will either be flat or could even fall. And on this topic of recession, which you've just talked about with Christine, in a report just released the feeling from the Bank of England is that the U.K. economy is expected to remain in a recession throughout 2023 and into 2024 with GDP expected to recover only gradually they're after. Now as far as what is contributing to this economic slump, no real surprise. Obviously, the interest rate hikes are going to have some kind of an impact. But then there's also the war in Ukraine whose impact still cannot be discounted, especially when it comes to fuel prices and when it comes to food costs. And that is something that came up over and over again in the Bank of England briefing. If we look ahead, though, November 17 is a day that I'm sure you have circled on your calendar. That is when the new administration, the Rishi Sunak administration will basically, unveiled the government's budget announcement. That will look at spending plans, tax plans, and how things will move forward?

Police say the male suspect had a pistol and two empty magazines when he was arrested. The shooting happened at a political rally. One person was killed in the shooting and five were injured, including Imran Khan. If we get any further news or developments on that we will bring them straight to you. For now let's take a look at what's happening in the U.S. market price action. And stocks are up and running and extending the sharp losses we saw in Wednesday's session following Fed Chair Jerome Powell's hawkish message on rates. Powell saying the Federal Reserve will continue raising borrowing costs, even if the severity and size of the moves at these individual meetings slows down over time. What's key, of course here is the Fed is still unclear over just how high rates will have to go if inflation persists? And all this will create more uncertainty for financial market investors and consumers of course, too. It also means investors and the Federal Reserve will be laser focused on future data, which will start coming in fast and furious, beginning with tomorrow's big U.S. jobs report. And of course, we have fresh U.S. inflation data out next week, too. Now it's been more than two years since the start of the pandemic. Remote working has revolutionized the way many companies still operate. That's something the appropriately named Remote wants to keep capitalizing on. It helps firms of all sizes; manage remote talent all around the world, directly handling issues like payroll taxes and compliance in more than 60 different countries. And that very impressive entrepreneur joins us now. He's Remote's CEO. We got Job Van Der Voort. Yep, fantastic to have you with us! Now, we lost a bit of time, because what we were going to do is introduce you with the Royal recommendation that I know you've got and how we were originally introduced and our regular viewers will know that. So congratulations on that front. Just explain your mission because it's about I think simplifying the process of hiring talent, wherever they are in the world.",

They're taking notes indicating what they are finding on this beach and why maybe it's dangerous for the marine life in this area? This is at least an eight week program. It's part of its education. Part of it is then learning to surfer and to swim and to respect the ocean. Here in South Africa, particularly and around the world there is a sense that many communities don't benefit from the ocean. This is near a kind of millionaire's mile where very wealthy people live. And often the communities that flank this bay don't feel part of this. I spoke to an ocean educator here who says it's important that everyone feels connected and learns about this great asset.

It's a very remote very wildand rugged coastline full of green forests, rainforest has lots of glaciers through rivers, lakes, and the coast is very steep. The marine life came from deep waters, but also from adjacent areas. And so the diversity we find in Fjords is elevated compared to other coastline. My name is Vreni Haussermann, I'm a Scientist Working at the University of San Sebastian, and I'm studying the Marine Biodiversity of Chilean Patagonia. Diving in Patagonia, we found many species that haven't been described before. The coastline is more than 100,000 kilometers, which is twice around the world. There are only a handful of scientists working there. So even if we studied our main areas, they're still most parts that we don't know yet. Chilean Patagonia was free of human impact for a long time but in the 80s when aquaculture moved in, it started to be impacted. Life in the Fjords has been reduced in abundance. There are species we don't find any more. Impacting an area where we know very little about, we always have the risk that we are damaging ecosystems and the equilibrium of the ecosystems is lost. I hope that humanity understands the need of protect our planet. I hope humanity understands the need of protecting the oceans, and our lives and the lives of all future generations depend on a healthy ocean and a healthy planet. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
