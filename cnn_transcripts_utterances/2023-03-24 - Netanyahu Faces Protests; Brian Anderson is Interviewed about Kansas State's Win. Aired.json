And he seems to not be, at least according to the attorney general of Israel, adhering to that agreement, by actually taking steps to weaken the judiciary. The move that just happened, obviously, makes it tougher for judges, for judiciary to remove a prime minister. And actually he now, after that law passed, and Netanyahu said that his hands are no longer tied. So, there is a brazenness about this, and I guess we'll see how it plays out in terms of Netanyahu trying to weaken the independent judiciary in Israel.",
