The national broadcaster also saying that there's just so many questions around the safety of the railway. Sixty-six people are injured, seven of whom are currently in critical condition. The prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, was just at the crash site, saying that there will be no efforts spared to figure out why this happened and to ensure this doesn't happen again.

But it is notable that Chris Wray kind of came out and said this, because we have not heard from him directly on this subject since the FBI, of course, did conclude, according to our sources, with moderate confidence that the pandemic emerged from a lab leak. So hearing him say that and saying that the FBI has -- has thought for quite some time, indicating that they have not actually changed their position over the last nearly two years, is quite notable, especially as you said, after the Department of Energy concluded with low confidence that this emerged from a lab leak.

And then you have the Department of Energy and the FBI, who believe it was a lab leak. And then others are still undecided, right? They believe that both hypotheses are plausible, but there's just not enough evidence to figure it out definitively. And so I think that the IC has pretty much concluded here that, without more on-the-ground information, it is probably just going to be impossible to say, moving forward, how this actually began.

Air-traffic controllers told the Learjet to line up and wait as that JetBlue flight approached. And the Learjet pilot even read those instructions back clearly but, for some reason, began to take off instead. Flight Trader [SIC] says that the planes came within just 565 feet of one another.

That's from Rupert Murdoch's bombshell deposition before lawyers for Dominion Voting Systems. The billionaire owner of FOX News making it very clear money was a factor in letting false claims of election fraud populate his airwaves. Dominion is suing the network for defamation and is seeking $1.6 billion in damages. Lawyers for FOX have called the lawsuit -- and I quote here -- \"dubious.\" Let's discuss now. Former \"Baltimore Sun\" media critic and professor of communications and media studies at Goucher College, David Zurawik is here; and CNN political commentator and co-founder and editor in chief of \"The Dispatch,\" Jonah Goldberg, joins us, as well. Jonah, a caveat here: you used to work at FOX, and should note that you have been subpoenaed and deposed by Dominion on this case. So you can't speak on your own deposition, unless you want to.

So who knows? And we should also note that all media companies that aren't nonprofit are in the profit-making business. The difference here is that, if you read these -- these documents, what comes across blisteringly clear is that FOX management thought that the competing issues here have nothing really to do with serious journalism and telling the truth.

But one of the things that he knew and understood was that the credibility of FOX News as a network depended on the credibility of the FOX News division. I know too many people who work in the FOX News division to this day who are serious, honest, and sincere journalists trying to do the job right. There are too many people, including who work at CNN, who got their starts or worked at FOX for a while and -- and have warm things to say about it, to just say it was always a political operation. I think the problem that happened at FOX was that the opinion side was allowed to run free. Everyone likes to think that this was some grand policy, the transformation of FOX, set from above. It is really the lack of leadership under Suzanne Scott, the CEO, to reign in, curtail, discipline the primetime people in any way, to the point where the opinion side basically became the dog wagging the tail instead of the other way around. And the news side just became sort of this cleanup crew. Even in the Dominion filings, the news division comes out OK in this. Bret Baier and \"Special Report\" fact-checked this stuff.
