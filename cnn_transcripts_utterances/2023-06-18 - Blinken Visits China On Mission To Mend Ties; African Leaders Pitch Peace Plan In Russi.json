I'm Laila Harrak.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken meets with the Chinese foreign minister in Beijing. We'll have a love report from Hong Kong on the diplomatic state of his high-profile trip. And African leaders visit Russia hoping to help end the war in Ukraine. What Vladimir Putin is saying about that possibility. And U.S. President Joe Biden hits the campaign trail, his first official rally for re-election as president. This hour, the U.S. Secretary of State is holding talks in Beijing to try to mend ties with China. Moments ago, Antony Blinken began the first of several meetings with the country's foreign minister. U.S. officials say Blinken's main goal is to re-establish lines of communication with senior Chinese leaders, especially in the military. High-level talks have been disrupted in recent months, but U.S. President Joe Biden says they can get back on track. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  I'm hoping that over the next several months, I'll be meeting with Xi again and talking about legitimate differences we have, but also those areas we can get along.

VICTOR SHIH, HO MU LAM CHAIR IN CHINA AND PACIFIC RELATIONS, UCSD: Thanks for having me. Yes, I expect that there will be some very difficult conversations. We saw a preview of this when Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, met with Wang Yi in Vienna a month ago. They discussed for over ten hours. I think that's quite a figure. I think the work meeting tonight with Chinese officials likewise will last for a very long time. These difficult issues, as mentioned, include Taiwan Strait, Ukraine. But on the China's side, some very important issues include all the sanctions and export bans that the U.S. has imposed on Chinese firms and also even U.S. businesses during -- trying to sell technology products in China. So, I think those will be discussed.",

And if Blinken were to be able to establish some kind of communication channel with Chinese counterparts during these times of tension, I think that would be quite an accomplishment.

So, I think there is some willingness there to de-escalate, although I think some of these export control policies are rolled out as part of a multi-year strategy for the U.S. to compete with China.

These seven African leaders from Congo, Uganda, Senegal, Comoros, Egypt, Zambia and South Africa surely went to Kyiv, went to St. Petersburg with the best of intentions, because more than half these countries actually abstained from the U.N. vote condemning Russia's invasion at the outset of the war. And so they went here with some legitimacy as honest brokers.This is a lane that we know that Turkey and other countries have tried to sort of carve out for themselves, maintaining good relations with both Moscow and Kyiv in hopes that they can broker a peace deal. But on Friday, when this group of delegates went to Kyiv, they really realized how difficult things might be. They came armed with a ten- step peace plan. While they were there, though, there was actually a Russian missile strike on Kyiv that ended up injuring at least four people. It is hard to see how they could even get past step one of their peace plan given that President Zelenskyy's position has been that, look, there ought not to be any negotiations until every single Russian soldier leaves Ukrainian territory, something that seems pretty unlikely, if not impossible at this stage of the game. And yet they continued on going to St. Petersburg to meet with President Putin, where they continued their message of negotiation. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa insists that there is a, quote, common position that can emerge, and he says now is the time to negotiate. And at least on the surface, President Putin seemed pretty receptive to that message, listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT:  I want to stress again, we are ready for constructive dialogue with everyone who wants peace on the grounds and justice and legitimate interests of all sides.

And for the Russians, well, we can guess what those legitimate interests are, because, of course, they believe that a wide swath of the Ukrainian territory is legitimately Russian, belongs to Russia.And so it's pretty easy for the Russians to say that they're open to peace talks, they're open to negotiation, when the reality is that Ukraine's position makes all of that a nonstarter, given that Russian troops still remain in the country and they're not going anywhere any time soon.

We know that the Wagner group is helping supply weapons and fuel to the RSF through Libya and possibly even through Chad as well.So, they are, I think, on the margins of this conflict, aiding the RSF to the best of their ability, but we haven't seen them playing an active role like we have seen in other places, like in Syria or even Ukraine, where they are active belligerence. We're not seeing that active level of participation yet. But I think that because these armies in Sudan, the RSF and the Sudan Armed Forces, are so evenly matched that a group, like the Wagner Group, could really be the difference-maker in tipping the balance in this conflict. So, if we see them getting more involved, I think that's going to be greater cause for concern.

The crowd was revved up over the course of his remarks, providing enthusiasm and expressing their support for the president.And it has already been clear through their endorsements that they stand behind him. The AFL-CIO had already endorsed the president, and that is their earliest endorsement of a presidential candidate.

It's a state where the president has political ties and personal ties, both of which he was trying to capitalize on during his remarks on Saturday as his campaign really kicks into gear in earnest.

This was King Charles' first Trooping the Colour.He left Buckingham Palace for the procession on horseback, a sight not seen for nearly 40 years, and wearing the regimental uniform of the Welsh Guards, the regiment whose color or regimental flag was being trooped this year. Cheers from the crowds who gathered on the mall. Also for the royals that followed close behind, Prince William, now the Prince of Wales, also in Welsh Guard uniform as he is the regiment's colonel now, a position he inherited from his father. He was joined by Princess Anne and the duke of Edinburgh in their respective regimental uniforms. And then behind in a carriage, Queen Camilla, the Princess of Wales, with the ultimate crowd-pleasing trio of Princes George, Louis, and Princess Charlotte. Unlike the coronation, this military ceremony focuses on the household division of the British Army. The five regiments of the Foot Guards take turn to troop their color each year with the two household cavalry regiments performing the king's escort. The national anthem played as the king received his final salute marking the end of the ceremony and the return of his majesty to Buckingham Palace. Guns sounded across London before the king and other members of the royal family made it out onto Buckingham Palace's iconic balcony to watch a flypast. 17 aircraft took part to the delight of many, especially Prince Louis, whose expressions were as expected. It culminated with a flypast by the Red Arrows. Plumes of red, white, and blue smoke, a British flag emblazoned across the start to mark King Charles' official birthday.

First, she ran right through a stop sign, then she hit a few curbs and then suddenly she sped right into a light pole and flipped the car. The 63-year-old woman suffered minor injuries and was taken to a hospital. Officials haven't said whether or not she passed the test.In F1 racing, Max Verstappen sped through a wet track to grab pole position in Saturday's qualifier for the Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal. This is the 25th time in Verstappen's career that he'll lead the pack at the start of a race. The Red Bull racer is trying to win his 41st career race and has won five out of seven races this season. If Verstappen wins later today, he'll tie for fifth place with the late Ayrton Senna on Formula 1's all-time winners list, and it would be Red Bull racing's 100th victory.

Families of other wrongfully detained Americans who helped Griner during her imprisonment were also there. Now, robots already play a role in our lives. They're bartenders, restaurant servers and even drivers sometimes. But tech researchers and developers are working on ways to put robots in even more places and to fulfill even more of our human needs. CNN's Eleni Giokos shows us. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELENI GIOKOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  Emotional robots, pet robots, heavy-lifting robots and a crowd of tech enthusiasts. You're looking at the next generation of robots on display at tech fairs in Europe. Despite widespread concerns about artificial intelligence, developers say these robots were made for good. Ergocub, for instance, was built for helping people with difficult physical tasks. Picture it bringing in grocery boxes, taking out the trash, working in warehouses to reduce physical stress and the risk of injuries to workers. Ergocub is being developed in Italy.",
