Israel believes there are still 145 hostages in Gaza who were taken October the 7th. This latest pause comes as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has returned to Israel for his third visit to the region since October the 7th. He met with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier, and is also visiting the West Bank for talks with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.Let's bring in Matthew Chance.

      "sentences": "Well, that's something that's obviously being discussed. In fact, Secretary of State Blinken has been meeting with the Israeli Prime Minister in order to discuss, amongst other people as well, discuss the next phase in the operation. But, whether that means more hostage releases or resumption of Israel's military activity in the Gaza Strip, I think is still to be decided when and where that would begin.Meanwhile, there has been more tension boiling over in Jerusalem and in the West Bank as well. Earlier today, there were three Israeli civilians killed by Hamas gunmen, as well as seven people, according to the latest figures who were injured when two Hamas gunmen opened fire in what looks like a bus stop in Jerusalem. Within the past few minutes, there has been an acceptance by Hamas that their fighters carried out that attack that, saying that they were a direct response to the crimes of the Israeli government. Its activities in Gaza. Its treatment of Palestinian prisoners. And it's basically it's harassment of worshippers at the Al-Aqsa mosque as well as the activities of Israel in the West Bank city of Jenin, where there has been a military operation underway for the past few days. So, Hama, they are saying that their fighters carried out that attack, which again killed three Israeli civilians and injured another seven. The two Palestinian gunmen were shot down by bystanders, two of which I think we're off-duty members of the Israeli security services. But, it all underlines, Max, just how tense the situation is, now as we head into the seventh consecutive day of the pause in the fighting in Gaza and the hostage releases in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners and aid relief being allowed in trucks into the Gaza strip. That's going on to the seventh day. Now, there is a list that's with the Israeli government, but it's still unclear whether it's going to go into an eighth day. As I say, those negotiations to try and determine that are currently underway, Max.",

Already, there was controversy over that the list for today, which is meant to have 10 people on it. The Hamas saying that Israel rejected a proposal from their side, saying that they will be able to give seven live Israeli hostages plus the bodies of three others. Israel rejected that apparently, saying that, no, they want 10 live hostages. But, there is still no clarity today on whether there were 10 people on the list to be released later today or whether there is going to be kind of dead Israelis included in that release of people to Israel later day.But, again, yes, it's becoming very difficult. And obviously, the next phase and Israel's intention is to get all the hostages released. But, the next phase is going to be looking at male adult, male Israelis that are held as hostage inside Gaza. And then, of course, members of the Israeli security forces as well. And there are dozens of them, we understand, that are being held by Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza since October the 7th.",

Time running out to prevent, what is this, irreversible harm of climate change. We need to act and we need to act now. That is the message being sent here, and that we need to find a consensus on solutions.Well, a short time ago, delegates here formally adopted a climate damage fund to help countries hit hardest by the climate crisis. Well, that loss and damage fund is a big move on the first day of COP that hasn't been without its controversies leading up to this day from the appointment of Dr. Sultan Al Jaber, the head of ADNOC, the national oil company here, as the president of the gathering to leak documents suggesting the UAE delegation offering visiting officials oil and gas projects. But, in his opening remarks, Sultan Al Jaber was adamant that he wants this to be a consequential COP and made virtue of the fact that he is including fossil fuel producers in the talks. Well, earlier, I spoke with the Director General of COP28 Majid Al- Suwaidi about what else we might expect to see from this event. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MAJID AL SUWAIDI, DIRECTOR GENERAL, COP28: Unfortunately, we know today we're not on track. What that means is we can't be doing the same thing we've been doing years and years expecting a different result. So, that's why the global stocktake is really important. We, as a COP presidency, have said from day one that we want to keep 1.5 within reach. That's our north star. How do we get there? We need to get there by addressing the 22 gigatons in emissions reductions. Let's focus on the science. Let's focus on the technology. Let's focus on the actions that we need to do. Let's make it about real world implementation that we need to make happen. And we believe that if we all come together as a global community, we know we have the political will. Now, we need to deliver the action on the ground. If we can all come together in places like this, then we can really deliver on that 1.5 degree.",

And it needs to happen very quickly.This is critically a climate change conference where they're doing a stocktake, which is like a report card. They already know the results of the report card, and it's not an A. Let me tell you, we are way below the curve, as I said. If we go on the emission standards that even countries have pledged, we will blow past at 1.5 degrees Celsius increase of the Paris Agreements. We will go even way beyond that. So, there needs to be deeper commitments from countries to cut their emissions. And I think that's what the COP presidency will be hoping for.
