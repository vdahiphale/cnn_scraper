I think I'm getting the impression that if McCarthy really wanted to make a deal at this point, he probably could.So, in terms of the contours of what we are hearing right now, there is possibly a deal in the work to raise the debt ceiling for years and issue spending cuts for two years. So, that's good news there. I think that my concern is even if they reach a deal, right, this is what I was talking to you about earlier in the week, even if they reach a deal, even if you have McCarthy and Biden sort of coming together and reach a deal, he -- McCarthy still has to sell it, right? And that is the issue. He still has to sell it to the House Freedom Caucus. And there is a section of Republicans, a faction of Republicans that are going to condemn whatever deal that comes out. And so that is the issue. There's a belief that, of course, they need Democrats at this point to make this work, but I think what is good about this particular deal that's being talked about right now is that either side possibly can frame this as a political win, right? So, Republicans say, look, we actually, you know, cut spending quite significantly, and Democrats can say, no, we protected the worst of spending cuts from actually happening. Both sides can frame it as a win. So, I am cautiously optimistic. We're not out of the woods just yet, especially because of the timeline. That is what I am concerned about. Seven days, 72 hours to review that lawmakers have, plus it is going to get through the House, plus it is going to get through the Senate as well, president's desk. I am concerned about the timeline, but I think that I am far more optimistic now than I was, say, yesterday.",

Bold move by Fitch, certainly, I think it was necessary though. I am still looking at the markets and I'm wondering why they are so muted, why there is sort of no reaction from the markets in terms of this. I mean, this is significant.I think one of the issues is that this is the second time, right? So, we already experienced a downgrade, S&amp;P downgrading U.S. debt 10, 12 years ago. And so, the second time around is not a shocker. I think there's also this belief that, listen, maybe this warning by Fitch will actually give lawmakers the nudge they need to reach an agreement.

It took the market six months to come back. I don't think we're going to see that this time, though. I think that, you know -- I mean, I actually thought that what would we would see is a deal to make a deal, but it seems as though one of the good things and the sort of silver lining in all this is that Biden is not going to have this hanging over his head during the elections, that this is a two-year deal, which I think is fantastic just politically for both sides but especially as he's up for reelection.

Obviously, that's a nightmare.But on top of that, bond holders not being paid would be catastrophic for global financial markets. By some calculation, if it is a protracted default, the stock market will lose about 50% of its value. And on top of that, eight million more Americans could be out of a job.

Again, another suspicious flag for the Petito family. That said, to give a little bit more context on this letter, I want to read another part of this letter. There's the \"burn after reading\" part that was on the outside of the envelope. Another part of the letter says, I just want you to remember I will always love you, and I know you will always love me. You are my boy. Nothing can make me stop loving you. Nothing will or could ever divide us. No matter what we do or where we go or what we say, you will always love each other.

I don't want to say that they would not have cracked it, but literally, a YouTuber happened to drive by, happened to have his camera rolling on this van, happened to drive by the van, their van, in the Tetons. And because he knew about the case, went back and look to his footage, and was, like, oh my, God, there is the van. And because of that, likely, the search for investigators really narrowed as opposed to trying to search across the vast national park that is the Grand Tetons.

Let's take a look at the first one. The first one is about universal background checks. Basically, what is in this particular law is, you can see right here, these background checks will basically mean that all firearms purchased regardless of size, you will have to get a background check. Basically, the law right now on the books in Pennsylvania is any handguns, smaller size, the barrel-sized guns, you have to have background check. Anything over that, larger shotguns, rifles, you don't. And this also applies to license retailers, private transactions, and gun shows. A lot of Democrats were excited at the prospect of closing what you hear often, this gun show loophole. That's the first one that passed. And then there was a second bill that passed which was on red flag laws. These are laws that a lot of folks in the gun control community have been talking about for a while. They are known as technically extreme risk protection orders. Basically, if this were to be enacted, family members or loved ones of the people who are close to them, they can call law enforcement -- they can ask a judge to hold a hearing to disarm someone if they think that they're in a moment of crisis. We've seen a lot of different states enact and start to bring up those laws all over the country. So, those two laws that we are talking about this week, again, something that would not have been thought to be possible in Pennsylvania 5, 10 years ago.",

Some of the Democrats bristle at that a little bit, but other advocates were saying, listen, it's already illegal for an undocumented person to purchase a gun, so, okay, if that has to be the extra claws to get this across the finish line, that's okay in our books. I think there may be some more wiggle room than perhaps otherwise we might have thought.
