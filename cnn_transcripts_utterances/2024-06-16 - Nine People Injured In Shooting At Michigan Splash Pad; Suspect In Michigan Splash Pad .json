We know that the eight soldiers killed we have had details from the IDF about that particular incident that happened in the Tal al-Sultan neighborhood in western Rafah where we have been hearing of some very intense fighting between the Israeli military and Hamas and other fighters over the past couple of days. Now, according to the IDF, they say that there was an armored vehicle with Israeli soldiers on board and it exploded. Now, they say they are in the preliminary part of their investigation. They believe it was either an explosive device that had been planted in the area or this vehicle may have been hit by an anti-tank missile. But they say they were explosives on board as well this particular vehicle which then detonated. They say that shouldn't have happened so they are investigating that particular incident.Now, we heard from Hamas claiming responsibility. The IDF has not said who they believe is responsible at this point. But Hamas said that it was a complex ambush that they had staged. Saying that it was a military bulldozer that was then on fire and they attacked it and they attacked also the rescue crews coming in. So, we expect to hear more details from the Israeli military on that particular one. But we do know that there has been, as I say, intense fighting in this area. We've heard from the Rafah -- Gaza civil defense officials saying that they have had calls from people asking for injured to be removed, asking for bodies to be retrieved from the area. But it is very difficult for them to get to that area because the fighting is ongoing. They say that a family of five was killed. They managed to retrieve two of the bodies and came under fire themselves. So then have to withdraw. Now, we've heard from the IDF that in this particular area they have uncovered a number of tunnels. They also say that they have uncovered passageways between the homes in this very densely populated, very cramped conditions of this area of Rafah. They say they believe that was created by Hamas to be able to move through this area undetected and easily. So, we do know that fighting is ongoing in this particular area. Israel had said that they had to do this operation in Rafah given that is where the remaining Hamas battalions are. It had come under huge international condemnation though as, of course, this is also where much of the humanitarian aid comes through into Gaza. And around a million people already displaced have had to move elsewhere to try and find safety.",

And then we've seen the rise of ISIS-K and other ISIS attacks, at least we saw in Russia. There have been some arrests in Europe. And so, the worry is that, of course, they'll be able to enter the homeland and attack. This -- some of this has to do with the Israeli-Hamas war and the radicalization, in particular, based on the imagery of that war, the results of that war, the ongoing nature of that war. And some of it just has to do with reasserting themselves at a time when, you know, basically the last we heard from them was in Russia earlier this year.

We've seen in some of these contested primaries President Donald Trump actually endorsed an incumbent Republican over a more right-wing MAGA challenger. And people close to Mike Johnson say, that's the calculus Mike Johnson made.He went directly to Trump and said, hey, Mr. President, I know you might not like what this member said, but he's one of my guys. He's a House Republican. And if you want to be successful, if you elected, we need more House Republicans who are loyal to the team to come back to Washington. So, I think that's definitely part of the calculus that Trump will do somewhat Johnson wants on endorsements, on protecting some of that Republican incumbents, and then that in exchange for Johnson saying to Trump, we will do what you want on the investigative front.",

So, we have both bases very energized. But as you saw in L.A. last night, Democrats have access to huge amounts of money. And there might not be the same energy on the Democratic side but there's a huge fear of what Trump could bring, as our previous guests were mentioning, and that's going to fuel Democratic fundraising. So, both sides are going to have a lot of money. We expect the Democrats to have the edge, but I think the Republicans are closing this a little bit.",

      "sentences": "It does actually. Yes, yes. But we've also got some raindrops because we not only have the heat, but we also have some flooding to talk about. So, let's get right to it. Let's start with the heat because everybody's pretty much feeling it right now because it's pretty widespread. Areas of the South, the Midwest, the Northeast all going to be feeling that heat over the next several days. We also have severe thunderstorms in the Central U.S., the potential for flooding not only in the Midwest but also along the Gulf Coast.But here we take a look at all of these temperatures. Again, it's not just five or 10 degrees above average. Most of these areas are looking at 15, even 20 degrees above normal. That means a lot of records. Over 170 of them possibly breaking those records over the next five to seven days. Take a look at some of these. Now, places like Atlanta and St. Louis you're going to finally start to see those temperatures come back down by Wednesday. By that, I don't mean back to normal but at least maybe not as hot as it has been. But D.C., New York, Boston, those temperatures are just going to keep going up as we make our way through the week. Look at Chicago for example. The average this time of year is only 81. You're going to spend more than half of the week in the 90s. So, you're talking 10 degrees above average there. Same thing, Philadelphia, Albany, well above where they would normally be this time of year. The few cool spots are really going to be along the Gulf Coast. Take a look at this, watching not one but two separate potential tropical systems. This one just off the coast of Florida, only has about a 30 percent chance of developing into a tropical system in the next seven days. This one right here though just off the Yucatan Peninsula, 60 percent. But the intriguing part about this one is regardless of whether it gets an name, as it moves to the north, it's going to bring a tremendous amount of tropical moisture. So, you're talking about the potential for some flooding here not just one day but multiple. Look at this, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday -- especially Tuesday, we get Houston back into a moderate risk for flooding. This could in turn be a lot of rain. And remember, just a month ago, we talked about how much rain Houston got from that previous system. Now, we're going to be adding even more rain on top of it, and a lot of it. Take a look at this. This is just through Friday. You see the red color and the pink? You're talking six, 10, even a foot of rain in just the next five to seven days. And remember, a lot of these places are still trying to dry out from the previous system that we had a month ago. So, probably the last thing these areas need is a little bit more rain but they're likely going to get it every single day this week.",
