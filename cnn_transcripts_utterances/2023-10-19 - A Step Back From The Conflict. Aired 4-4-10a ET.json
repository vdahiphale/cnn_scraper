There is strength in numbers and thatwhen we recognize that we are not alone. We are not the only ones who are feeling upset. And our upset is not a -- a demonstration of weakness, but part of who we are as human beings. That actually allows for substituting, a feeling of helplessness with some very real, small, but critical ways of taking action. When we`re able to actually translate our vulnerability, what it is that makes us human into empathy identification with others, it actually allows us to move from feeling isolated, to reaching out to one another, to actually reminding each other, that there are normal reactions that are not pleasant, and that we are here for one another.",

Well, Gaza is a narrow strip of land west of Israel with a population of around 2 million people. It`s around 25 miles long. And only seven miles wide. That`s just over twice the size of Washington D.C. While we watch this war unfold from home, there are students just like you living through this war. In fact, CNN 10 producer, Maya Blackstone spoke with two siblings from Gaza, 11-year-old Mohammad and his older sister Afaf. More than a week ago, their family left their home in Gaza city to stay in what they hoped was going to be a safer United Nation sanctioned hotel, which was nearby. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We`re in a really important place because of the equipment that you see behind me. That military equipment there, that doesn`t look like much. It looks like kind of a rectangular box. That`s the iron dome, but it is probably the most important piece of equipment to save lives here in Israel. No president since 1967 has recognized -- In 2012 and 13`, I lived in Jerusalem. I was here for work. It has been pretty constant. We heard it early in the morning. But I`ve never seen anything quite like this, where Israel has actually officially declared war. When you`re doing coverage of a war, you don`t sleep much. And it is pouring rain suddenly, which seemed like out of nowhere. And so when that happens, the crew has to figure out what to do. So they have created -- just kind of creating a big thing to cover all the cameras. And this is -- this is Tel Aviv CNN temporary headquarters. We came in from New York. Averio (ph) and I, and my photographer came in from New York. We met with a producer who came in from London. They`re basically a reporter that that is not on television. Their role is to help facilitate things and make sure that everything is ready and available so that when you see me on television, all of those other things have been taken care of. So it is the best possible shot with the best possible information that we can get to you. 60 hospital beds are now filled with victims from the Hamas attack. Mentally you prepare before you get into the country as you`re packing. So you have to remember to get a helmet, to get a flak jacket. You have to sort of just get yourself in a very quiet place and very much pay attention to what`s going on around you 360. There are five incoming right now. Can you guys get me my helmet, please? You have to do a lot of reading. You have to do a lot of studying about what`s going on, where things are happening, a and know a lot about the country that you are in. And I don`t know about you, but I learn better when I`m there in person. And I get to see things and touch things that feel things, and you make relationships with people. I have Israeli friends. I have Palestinian friends. I have friends who have -- have left Gaza. When you get home, and you think about what could have happened, or you think about the images that are in your head. Um, the horrible things that you`ve seen, those things tend to stay with you for a lot longer. At least that`s what I`ve found. So talking to -- to someone professional, talking to your colleagues, your -- your family, it is really, really important. That`s how I deal with the intense stress that comes from this. But while I`m on the job, I`m -- I`m really focused on what I`m doing. So writing a story or interviewing someone or -- or talking to camera about what we`ve seen and experienced and trying to get those stories out, it helps you concentrate and it doesn`t -- it doesn`t make your stress worse. It actually helps you lessen your stress because you have a focus and a reason to be here. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
