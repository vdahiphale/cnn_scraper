Live at the table, Scott Jennings, Mondaire Jones, Coleman Hughes and Madison Gesiotto. Americans with different perspectives aren't talking to each other, but here, they do. (END VIDEO CLIP) PHILLIP (on camera): Good evening. I'm Abby Philip in New York. Let's get right to what America is talking about. It's Tech Bros versus the MAGA base, as President-elect Trump looks to enact an aggressive immigration agenda, tech billionaires Elon are defending H- 1B worker visas. And in particular, it's Ramaswamy's comments about American culture venerating mediocrity, in his words, that is rallying up the far right and MAGA base. Nick Fuentes wrote on X, the H-1B push has nothing to do with American culture but about whether we want 500 million Indians to move here. Laura Loomer writing, stop watching Boy Meets World and turn on Bollywood so you can watch rape culture steal your job culture. And someone else calling India a filthy third world hellscape and writing, if it's so exceptional, why doesn't its tech talent want to stay there? Notable also that Laura Loomer and some of the other people making these comments have a long history of racist, xenophobic comments about immigrants, but about a lot of other people. And now it's out in the open, Scott. One of the things -- one of the people who's been kind of at war with Laura Loomer over this is Elon Musk, and he commented on a post today, the contemptible fools that he's referring to in a previous post are those in the Republican Party who are hateful, unrepentant racists. They will absolutely be the downfall of the Republican Party if they are not removed. Has this debate revealed that there are, in fact, a lot of people in the, you know, MAGA coalition who just don't want non-white people to come into this country?",

Certainly there are hardliners on immigration who have supported. He himself has been a hardliner, but he has also said repeatedly publicly that he wants immigration reform, that he wants to do something for the DREAMERs. He has also talked about the need for people to come in to the country to do certain kinds of things.And then you have these other new supporters of Donald Trump who understand that if you're just recruiting like the top 0.1 percent of the best and most talented, you know, say, engineers from around the world, that's probably a good thing. I think where there's great alignment is on the need to eliminate the fraud in the program. And I think some of these visa programs are being used to bring people in for no other reason than to displace American workers and to do things more cheaply. So, I think that the common ground and the way forward is bringing the people who are the GOATs, you know, of engineering from around the world, bring those people here and then focus on American workers, American students for everything else.

When we talk about H-1B visas, we're talking about 85,000 a year of legal immigrants, okay, legal immigrants. So, there are plenty of Republicans right now who are waging an internal war within their party, not about illegal immigration, not about millions of illegal immigrants, but about fewer than 100,000 legal immigrants a year?

You look at Elon Musk being a great example of someone who came here on an H-1B visa himself. And so I think this is very important that we continue to have the H-1B visas. We want to be competitive in the global economy. But the reality is, and President Trump has also talked about this on many occasions, we don't want to see people coming here being educated in our institutions being that top 0.01 percent that Elon Musk or that Scott mentioned earlier in engineering or in other fields and being sent to work for Chinese companies are being sent to work for these other companies.And so we want to make sure that we can continue to have those people coming here, working here and helping us grow, which helps American workers. But at the same time, we've seen a lot of issues with the H- 1B visas. We've seen these workers exploited and American workers hurt in this process. And so I think there's a lot of things and a lot of questions that are coming up in this debate that are legitimate questions. And so I think on both sides, there's a lot of positive coming out of this and I think it's something that needs to be hashed out, not just by Republicans, but by people across the country.",

Meaning, are we using it and other visa programs to get the absolute best and brightest engineers? That's the occupation that keeps being thrown out.So, to me, the way forward for Trump is very simple. I want to eliminate the fraud in any of our visa programming. I want to absolutely control the southern border because I think Coleman is right, that's where the major problem is. We can walk and chew gum at the same time here.

So, you've -- we've got to look at zoning laws that are unnecessary. We got to look at multi-family housing and that's going to upset people. You know, it's difficult to run on that because I've got a nice view out of my apartment and I don't want them building a Skyrise, you know. So, I support those laws that disallow people to build.

They -- you know, increased I think 11 percent last year and the federal money given to the states, but yet we saw that 18 percent increase.

One of the people that RFK reportedly is considering for a job in the federal government is his raw milk supplier Someone who is an advocate for raw milk. This is not funny, Coleman. I mean, this is a real thing.I think the question here is, are we going to have, you know, a public health regime that is going to be controlled by people who don't believe the basic science that's actually done a pretty good job thus far of keeping us safe.",

I think RFK is a very scary nominee to lead HHS and I've been a little surprised that his nomination has -- hasn't gotten more attention. I think it's been sort of subsumed or whatever by all the attention on Hegseth and Tulsi Gabbard. But you want to talk about a guy who can actually in impact our day-to-day lives through Implementing any one of his crazy ideas that are at odds with the scientific research. That's RFK at the Health and Human Services.",

If, God forbid, there were a bird flu, Public Health would depend a lot on getting a really fast hyper speed vaccine.And RFK -- whatever you think of him, his priorities are exactly in the opposite direction. He would want a slow roll of vaccine to make sure it's perfectly safe and to put tons of red tape in front of -- before the rollout of the vaccine, which would -- it's not the set of priorities I think you want in a pandemic. But we don't even really have to go to RFK to see the mismanagement because there's already been mismanagement. Correct me if I'm wrong Meg, but the first case of cow to human transition for this was in March, right? And yet, they let eight other states see similar cases before they said let's stop selling the cows Interstate which again seems like a very -- it does seem like a kind of repeat of -- of the kind of complacency we saw in the early days of COVID.
