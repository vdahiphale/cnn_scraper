He's working out the framework of a possible hush money deal, what we ultimately know now as a hush money deal to keep Stormy Daniels' story out of the public -- out of the public view while \"Access Hollywood\" is breaking. So he brings us into a situation -- and this is brand new what we saw as far as I'm concerned. He describes this meeting, either a meeting or a phone call when he first briefs Trump on the Stormy Daniels scenario. I believe it's on or about October 10th, three days after \"Access Hollywood.\" He describes an angry Trump confronting him, saying, I thought you took care of it. I thought you had this under control. And then Trump going on to say, according to Michael Cohen, this, meaning the Stormy Daniels scenario breaking, is a total disaster. Women will hate me. Guys will think it's cool. But this is going to be a disaster for the campaign. That's almost the last -- one of the last things the jurors heard before the lunch break. And I can tell you, as I was keeping an eye on jurors and making my notes, they seem to me to be riveted by this testimony. This is so crucial because one of the main goals for the prosecution that Michael Cohen has is to establish a motive and intent directly on Donald Trump that would cause him to take the steps that ultimately led to the $130,000 payment and be involved and be knowledgeable about it. So, to me, by far, Wolf, that was the most compelling testimony of the day.",

I mean, things are about to get a little more intense.Because they've just started telling the story of what happened. How did Michael Cohen pay Stormy Daniels that $130,000? The lengths he went to, taking out, you know, a lien against his own home, getting that home equity loan, not telling his wife. But then, more importantly for the criminal case, how he was reimbursed and any direct communication that he received from the defendant instructing him to falsify, write these business records. This is the meat of the case. Now, I would expect they also, at some point, likely have to revisit some of the really negative stuff that is going to constitute the heart of the defense's cross-examination. Not only his previous convictions, four campaign-related crimes, but also lying to Congress, lying to banks, and lying to the IRS. And then also his six-, seven-year vendetta against the defendant, making a living of books, podcasts, and public appearance where he attacks the defendant. At some point, the prosecutors are going to want to get out in front of that. They touched on some of it, but they have to get out in front of it. So I think, this afternoon, this is going to get a lot more uncomfortable.",

I want to bring in Brian Stelter, who I know has a lot to say and who has been covering a lot. He's also somebody who has had a big history. And now is a correspondent at \"Vanity Fair.\" Brian, someone like yourself, who is sue knows so well about the role that each of these men had played in the media attention and landscape, I wonder what you have made from this testimony today. BRIAN STELTER, SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT, \"VANITY FAIR\": I find it astonishing that we are still learning new pieces of this story, Laura, even though this is nearly a decade old, even though this has been litigated with Cohen in the past, even though we wrote a book and he has a podcast and all the rest. We are still hearing new information and maybe that's the power four of the criminal courts. Maybe that's the power of being under oath and taking the stand and feeling all of that pressure. Certainly, Cohen feels that pressure because he's acting unlike the Michael Cohen that we all know. Last time I was talking to Michael Cohen on his podcast, he was the host. And he said more than I did -- he barely let me get a word in. That's the kind of guy he is. He wants to give speeches. He wants to rant and rave. And the fact that he's been able to restrain himself so far today is breathtaking, Laura.",

Focus to help your credibility.But I do wonder how media and the MAGA world is treating this testimony because he has been catnip for the MAGA world. STELTER: I think this is an important part of the story. It's related to J.D. Vance and Tommy Tuberville being there today. It's related to Donald Trump finally having some of his friends show up for the most difficult, most emotional days of testimony. You know, this trial is his -- his pro-Trump media has tried to ignore most of this. But they can't ignore it anymore. And Michael Cohen is, in some ways, catnip. He is -- he is the villain for pro-Trump media. And he is, of course, a convicted liar. So he plays right into this narrative that this is a sham, Trump's narrative that this is all a sham and a witch hunt. It's frustrating, Laura. It's kind of like the Liar Olympics you know?

They know figures like Cohen. You know? And so it might play differently to a jury in another -- in another state, another part of the country.

So it helps establish Donald -- Donald Trump. Number two, the pattern of suppressing stories and having them not get out also helps the prosecution here. Because of the fact that, even -- whether we're talking about politics or personal stories or whatever else, Donald Trump had interest in seeing stories suppressed. So this isn't a smoking gun, great evidence that's going to -- the case is going to rise and fall on this sentence.

And you have all of these people in different places who were out to protect Donald Trump. It was David Pecker and Dylan Howard and -- and Michael Cohen who worked together.
