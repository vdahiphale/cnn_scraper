Kate and Sara are out today. I'm John Berman with Fredricka Whitfield. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. All right, this morning, the breaking news, divers are in the water trying to recover bodies. And the black box is now on shore. The chair of the NTSB just told us investigators were able to get on the DALI, the vessel that crashed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge overnight. They are analyzing the black box data right now, and later today, they do expect to have some answers as to what caused the crash. They also told us they will begin conducting interviews with those onboard the vessel and people on shore who might have information about what happened. Some of what has been mentioned publicly, officers say the ship experienced a total blackout, we've all seen the video footage of that. They also say there was engine failure. And an official told \"The Wall Street Journal\" the smell of burned fuel was everywhere.

Right before getting on with you, I got an update from my fire chief, and they had just broke the meeting with the divers as they went back out to do their incredible work. And as has been noted already this morning, that work is already dangerous, but will be even more so today with the expected rain, the choppy waters, and we all know about the debris and other things that they'll be dealing with.

I mean, just in September of last year, he received the Global Icon Award at the MTV Video Music Awards. Then you fast forward two months and he is hit by this lawsuit.He is responsible for launching the careers of people like Usher and Mary J. Blige, and yet, we have not heard anything, anyone defending him, right? The silence is very, very loud when you are looking at all the people that Diddy knows, all the people that he has worked with. Nobody is coming to defend him and that is because these allegations are incredibly serious. His team can continue to deny them and they are and again, at this point, they are just allegations there has been no arrest. There has been nothing criminal at this point. But there is a pattern here. If you look at all of these five lawsuits, these are people who do not know each other, who worked with Diddy or came across Diddy at different points throughout the years, and there are very similar accusations of sexual assault, of abuse, of grooming, of drugging women, of minors. So there are some patterns here and I have covered many stories throughout the #MeToo Movement, John, and just because there is one allegation doesn't mean that's not true, but certainly when you establish a pattern of behavior from different accusers, that leads you to believe that when there is smoke, there is fire.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think there are two areas that they got a little bit of traction on. One is easier than the other.The first is they're going to argue that really the prosecution is flawed because they had reached an agreement previously. We remember that plea agreement that rather spectacularly crashed and burned and they want to argue that Hunter Biden didn't do anything to violate that agreement, which involved diversion on the gun charges and all of these other charges. That one is probably not going to fly with the judge. But the second one, which is really a selective prosecution issue, saying that he is not being treated the same as similarly situated people facing tax evasion charges who have already paid the money back. That's going to have a little bit of traction. I don't think it will ultimately succeed, but in making his arguments, they're going to put the Special Counsel David Weiss, under a lot of pressure because it is really going to be opening up the history of this case. It has been over a half decade at this zero point, so Weiss is this going to have some tough questions to answer before the judge and is probably going to preview some of the difficulties Weiss is going to have in prosecuting this case at trial.",

It doesn't matter because at the time that the crime was committed, if he failed to file, if he failed to evade, they simply show in the indictment probable cause that that happened and now they have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it happened.So technically, it doesn't matter whether you paid it back or not. The problem for David Weiss is that numerous prosecutors, including myself have noted that it is rare when a defendant has paid back the money, that they would still go after them criminally, unless with some really ginormous amount of money, which this is not, I think it is about a million or so. So that makes it an unusual situation, and worse for Weiss, there is going to be a big jury nullification factor, which is it is so well- known that Biden's notoriety is one of the main reasons why he is being looked at for over half a decade, that that's going to make an uphill fight to get the jurors to want to convict you.",

He may be a little bit more careful here at this point, having experienced that before. I think the order itself is very reasonable. It is very similar to the other ones that have been imposed on trump. And again, the order does not include Trump's \"remarks,\" the really disparagement of the actual judge or the actual prosecutor. I don't think that's right. I think it shows a lot of disrespect and taints the system for Trump to be talking about the judge and the prosecutors. It is one thing to say I disagree with the ruling, it is another to come out and call people names and claim that they are corrupt. That taints the jury pool.
