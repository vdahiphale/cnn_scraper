So, what will happen now with a third possible indictment of former President Trump looming? That's \"Tomorrow's News Tonight.\" Plus, Trump's former personal attorney Rudy Giuliani has admitted he defamed two Georgia election workers. Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Shaye Moss, suffered with threats to their lives after he and others made wild and utterly false accusations of vote tampering. Will Giuliani face consequences for the damage he has done? Plus, a stunning day in court today for Hunter Biden. He thought he had a deal, and then it all fell apart. The judge even questioning whether the deal was constitutional. So, what's going on now? And paging Mulder, and Scully, the X-Files comes to Congress. Three retired military veterans testified today at a House hearing on UFOs. They say they are a national security problem, demanding the government stop keeping all this under wraps. I have personally spoken to a Navy pilot who told me for a while he and other pilots would see UFOs on a daily basis. Objects like this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNKNOWN (voice-over): Whoa! Got it!

But instead, three hours later, he left with his plea deal hanging in the balance and pleading not guilty to two tax misdemeanor charges.The plea deal began to unravel when Judge Maryellen Noreika scrutinized what exactly was covered under the terms. That revealed a disagreement between prosecutors who argued it gave Biden immunity to other tax, drug use, and gun charges, but Biden's lawyer said they thought it was more expansive. After a brief recess, Biden's team came back and agreed to the prosecutors' narrow immunity deal. But then that agreement broke down again when the judge questioned the constitutionality of a diversion agreement for a felony gun charge. That deal would allow Biden to avoid a felony charge for possessing a firearm while he was addicted to a controlled substance. The judge said it was not straightforward and she questioned whether it was constitutional. This after more than three hours the judge told Biden she was sorry, but she couldn't let him plead guilty to a deal he didn't understand, and she said she wasn't willing to rule on the divergent agreement on the fly, so she's giving both sides 30 days to brief the case.

I actually presented an amendment to the FAA reauthorization bill that just said if an airline pilot sees a UAP, UFO anomaly in the air, in the report they make to the FAA, that they would have to make issue that report to Congress. Well, the intelligence community, not the intelligence committee, but the intelligence community block that bill. I wasn't even allowed a hearing on it. It was not even voted on, ma'am. So, you have unelected bureaucrats in our military industrial complex who are telling your Congress what to do. That's a very chilling effect. And this -- this committee today was bipartisan.

After a brain injury, which is what a concussion is, a mild brain injury, people even months later could have some consequences of that, including seizures. So, was this a mini-seizure?

They're looking at the big blood vessels of the heart, they're looking at the muscles of the heart, they're seeing if there's any kind of anatomical problem with the heart. It's something that he may have had done again while he was in the hospital. But he had this done a couple of months ago. What we heard is that it was normal. That's a good sign. He also had an EKG, which a lot of people have heard of that, but that's basically looking at the electrical patterns in the heart, make sure there's not an abnormality, and at least that snapshot EKG that he had a couple of months ago were told also was normal. So, that's a very good sign. If you add to that, Sara, that he was in the ICU, but then let out of the ICU very quickly, that's another good sign. It basically means that he was stable and that they didn't find any sort of permanent or sort of longstanding consequence on his heart. His heart function was normal at the time that they let him out of the ICU. So, these are all good signs. They still got to figure out exactly what happened here and that probably means putting a longer-lasting EKG sort of monitor, something known as a Holter monitor, to look at his electrical pattern of his heart over a longer period of time to see if there are some abnormalities that isn't caught on a snapshot. But that's probably what's happening now. But the picture is increasingly looking better for him. Not out of the woods. Still got to figure out what exactly happened here.

JOAQUIN CASTRO (D-TX): Well, what you see is that border crossings have gone down 70% in the last few months since the end of Title 42. And the Biden administration has tried to do a few things. First, they have offered a way for people to apply for asylum from their home countries and other places before they make the dangerous trek to the US-Mexico border. And they also improved an app that quite honestly was having a lot of problems at the beginning. But what we're also seeing is Republicans taking barbaric actions in their treatment of asylum seekers. Greg Abbott has put out what I consider death traps and drowning devices in the Rio Grande, razor wire literally that is invisible to people until they run into it, and has also put out these barrel traps that have netting that people get caught in. On top of that, he has instructed DPS troopers not to offer water to anybody, even people that are dying of thirst in 105, 110- degree weather.
