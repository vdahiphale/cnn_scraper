It's the Sheikh Zayed Jabalia Beit Lahia Beit Hanoun area which is in the northern part. We understand from reports from inside Gaza that several private homes have been struck. No word at this point about any fatalities this day.But the activity has been fairly intense. We've been hearing drones all afternoon. Normally, what we've seen is that there's a lull in the midafternoon, and as the daylight comes to an end, there's another several volleys coming -- of rockets coming out of Gaza. But as all of that is going on, there has been violence in the West Bank, in the northern city of Nablus in the West Bank, in the Balata refugee camp which is just south of that city. There was an Israeli raid that resulted in the death of two men there according to Palestinian medical sources. Hamas put out a long statement about that. That's significant in the sense that in this current conflict, Israel has focused almost exclusively, in fact, exclusively on striking targets affiliated with Islamic Jihad. Hamas has by and large stayed out of this fight, but it's still very much part of the landscape. Of course, Hamas is the de facto ruler of -- de facto ruler of Gaza, but Israel seems to be focused, as I said, only on Islamic Jihad.

They said that they would be arrested and they would be deported quickly. So we saw a lot of fear on those last migrants that made it to this point. However, Mexican authorities are saying that now they are concerned that as more migrants are being deported, and many of them might end up in Mexico, they are going to see another surge on this side, because there are also migrants coming from Central America trying to get into the United States. And the question is, what are they going to do next? They were turning themselves in at points like this. Will they now try to find other places, avoid the Border Patrol, and get into the United States in a more difficult situation?

There is also reports that those missiles were fired from aircraft over Kramatorsk, which is very close in aviation terms to Luhansk, so that would have been a kind of grotesque waste of the capabilities of the storm shadow cruise missiles that the United Kingdom has given to Ukraine. These are intended for use over 300 miles or so distance. They are designed to fly very low and avoid radar detection, not to be dropped effectively as a guided bomb.So it's possibly unlikely that they were using British cruise missiles, but the Ukrainians also have their own manufactured long distance missiles, their own cruise missiles, indeed, and our capabilities. So it's not the only type of ordnance that could be used against Luhansk. What is significant there, everybody got the word of the authorities there that those children were injured, is that the industrial zone was hit, and now we've had further attacks overnight. And I think with these really will be seen as part of the shaping operations ahead of what President Zelenskyy says is a coming offensive, but one that his troops are not quite yet ready to prosecute.

In this case, it was a Kinzhal or \"Killjoy\" missile which Ukraine first claimed. It was then confirmed by the Pentagon. The Kinzhal missile is a hypersonic missile, essentially an air launched ballistic missile, one of the most advanced and powerful systems we've seen Russia use in its war in Ukraine. And crucially, we've seen it used for the first time during this war.Well, now we've learned that what Russia was targeting when it fired this Kinzhal missile, and it turns out according to two U.S. officials that Russia was targeting the Patriot missile itself to try to take out one of the most potent and long-range air defense capabilities that Ukraine has, and this just weeks after it arrived in country. When the U.S. first announced they were sending in Patriots back in December, it was the Kremlin's spokesperson Dmitry Peskov who said that Russia would target these, and now we have seen them carry out that promise. But it was a failed attempt. Ukraine was able to detect the incoming threat with the Patriot missiles, that long range radar, showing its potency and detecting the incoming Kinzhal missile. And multiple rockets were fired, or multiple missiles from the Patriot system, rather, were fired, according to the two officials, to intercept the incoming Kinzhal missile, to protect the Patriot system and to keep it online. The Ukrainians were able to learn the Patriot missile battery, a complex long-range air defense system, much faster than anticipated, only several months, three or four months, instead of a year, to get it into the country quickly and get it up and online. How is it that Russia was able to find the system? The Patriot uses a very powerful radar to detect threats at a long range. And just as the U.S. or Ukraine can detect Russian radar, Russia can detect western radars and try to target this. Once they have a general sense of where it is, because they can pick up on that radar emission, they can use satellite imagery or other signals and intelligence ways to try to zero in on than that and try to target it, which is what they tried to do with the powerful Kinzhal or Killjoy missile, but Ukraine able to effectively use the Patriot missile system to shoot down that Kinzhal before it was able to hit its target, to hit that Patriot battery and take it offline. That would be a devastating blow since this is one of more powerful and advanced and long-range air defense systems that Ukraine has. Victor and Amara?",

Investigators have been pouring over video of the account, 911 calls, eyewitness interviews. That's how we've gotten here today. And as we mentioned, Penny facing second degree manslaughter charges. In court, prosecutors, they read the details they had in the case. They said that Jordan Neely had gotten on the subway, was making threats, was scaring passengers, and that's when Penny came up from behind him and put him in that chokehold.Now, Mr. Penny did not enter a plea, that comes later on in the process. For right now, he was just there to face the charges and to give the details of his release, $100,000 bond. He does have to give up his passport, and if he wants to leave New York state at any point, he does have to get permission from the courts.",

And really, these negotiations just began in earnest this past week. Normally a deal like this takes months to come together. And the reality is they don't have months. They have less than 20 days until June 1st. And early June is the deadline that the Treasury Department has set for when the government could default on its debt. Now the Congressional Budget Office released a report on Friday backing up the Treasury Department's timeline here in saying a default is likely within the first two weeks of June, and this has a lot of leaders on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue really worried about what's going to happen here. But I am told from people who have been involved in these negotiations that they have made some modest progress. They began to pinpoint some policy areas that they think they could find an agreement on. Those include rescinding unspent COVID relief funds, permitting reform, and spending cuts, which is something that the White House really hasn't wanted to budge on, but increasingly people within the West Wing think that they are going to have to cave on that. We also heard from President Biden just this morning, he issued a tweet warning of the economic calamity of not passing a deal. He wrote, \"Default would erase millions of jobs, trigger a recession, hit retirement accounts, and increase borrowing costs.\" He also added that this is not an option. Now, we're going to see these negotiations continue over the weekend and into next week, but really, they need to have a deal in hand in the next few days. Remember, Congress moves very slowly. They still need to draft a bill once a deal is reached, then they need to sell it do both chambers of Congress, and then try to get enough support to pass it. And that is a huge obstacle that they face. But there is still hope that they can get a deal done on time to avoid the first- ever government default.",
