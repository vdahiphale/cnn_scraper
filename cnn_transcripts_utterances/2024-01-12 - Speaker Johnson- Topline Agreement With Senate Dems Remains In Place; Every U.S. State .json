That is the far-right block that has been a persistent thorn in the side of leadership team after leadership team, now being one with Speaker Johnson because they intended to try to scuttle this deal that -- by -- Johnson cut with Chuck Schumer.They believed it spent too much money. They also are demanded for restrictions -- severe restrictions on the southern border with Mexico. Things that simply the Democrats would not accept. Johnson trying to cut a bipartisan deal, try to tout some what he believes are some conservative victories he had -- or was open to discussing the concerns of the far-right members. But just moments go, as you indicated, saying that he would not side with those concerns and would stick to the agreement he cut with Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer. So, when I asked Bob Good about this -- Bob Good, one of the eight members who voted out Kevin McCarthy as speaker last year, he made clear he was opposed to what Johnson was doing, but also indicated he was not going to try to push Johnson out of the speakership.

This comes as the number of migrant encounters in Eagle Pass, for example, has dropped to about 500 per day, a far cry from the thousands seen in mid-December. But Texas is taking a very hardline stance. Joining us now from CNN's Rosa Flores. She is live for us in Texas. Rosa, what is the latest update?

But having said that, this is just a continuation of the political theater that Governor Abbott has done for a long time. One time, he had inspections of trucks coming across the border that lasted for a few weeks, then he was you know, building a wall, and he put razor wire out in the middle of the river that killed children and women and he's put a capitalist -- State National Guard troops - aligned with this (ph).

And what we're seeing now is no different than what we saw during the Trump administration. We're not going to put it the same way as he did. We're not going to rip children out of women's -- mother's arms, and we're not going to separate families and we're not going to cage children. But we do need to enforce laws on our southern border.

So, the snow that's falling here isn't accumulating that much on the streets in Chicago. It's turning to water very quickly. It's also pushing down that total snow accumulation. We're thinking between four and eight inches from the start of the storm which was around 3:00 a.m. this morning through when these advisory lights up which is around 1:00 Eastern tomorrow. But let me just give you a sense of what it looks like out here. You look to the skyline here, that's probably the most visible place we're seeing the storm, Sara. That box, that's the Willis Tower. People outside Chicago might know that as the Sears Tower. Normally, that is one of the most striking buildings in the Chicago skyline because you'd have those two iconic spires at the top. But you can't see any of that. It's not nearly as striking as it normally is. Across Illinois, this is a bigger problem. Up to a foot in some places. Illinois Department of Transportation sending out at least 1800 vehicles and pieces of equipment. Back here in Chicago, challenge after challenge after challenge because there are migrants still pouring into the city. Another bus is expected today. Let me take you on a walk here and I'll show you what the city is trying to do to try to help these migrants. They have warming buses here at the landing zone where 141 migrants are staying, Sara.",
