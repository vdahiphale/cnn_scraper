And, again, someone not living in a state for most of their life, you'd think rationally that would hurt. And the deal that Oz made with Donald Trump to get this. But the other national thing to look at is, actually Republicans narrowly won the suburbs. So, Democrats won independents narrowly. Republicans narrowly won the suburbs nationally. That may be more evident in places like New York than in Pennsylvania apparently. But that's a fascinating undercurrent to this election.",

There you saw in Michigan with Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer winning her re-election bid against Trump-endorsed Republican Tudor Dixon. Democrats have flipped two gubernatorial seats so far. One in Massachusetts, with an historic win by Maura Healey. She will become the nation's first out lesbian governor. And the other in Maryland, where Wes Moore defeated far-right Republican Dan Cox to become the first African American elected governor there. Moore will join CNN this morning a little bit later on. So, overall, though, the GOP still holds the top job in the majority of states with a history making victory of their own in Arkansas. That's where Sarah Huckabee Sanders is projected to become the first woman elected governor, following in her father's footsteps. He was the governor of that state once as well. Republicans also winning a few other big races. Florida's Ron DeSantis, Georgia's Brian Kemp, Greg Abbott in Texas, all defeating Democratic challengers. Headed over to the man of the hour, Mr. John Berman, to take us through where we are right now. Where are we standing, John?",

It's a much smaller lead for the Republican, Adam Laxalt.So, Sheriff Joe Lombardo is outperforming Adam Laxalt there by about 18,000 votes. Obviously, we're still going to have to wait for Clark County, where all the mail ballot that has been received yesterday and then going forward will have to still be counted. In Arizona, it's kind of a similar story. You have Kari Lake, the Republican there, trailing Katie Hobbs. The reason I say it's a similar story, she's behind with about 607 percent in.",

You were his deputy press secretary until you resigned on January 6th after seeing him not come out and condemn immediately the violent protesters.

He cost Republicans winnable seats by boosting poor quality candidates. I mean you look at the political environment, you have record inflation, increased fears over crime, the worst border crisis in history, an unpopular president and Republican performance was still underwhelming. And that was in large part due to the candidates that Trump backed. That they weren't up to quality. And so I think that this is lessons learned for Republicans that, a, Trump is not a national winner, and, b, that candidate quality matters and we need to like look more into that.",

A lot of pundits said, that might be the wrong closing argument, right? And we don't know who's going to take the House, but this certainly isn't a red wave. What does this tell you? TOM NICHOLS, STAFF WRITER, \"THE ATLANTIC\": Well, I think it dovetails with Sarah's point, that when you have somebody like Trump pushing bad candidates, the democracy argument actually starts to matter again. That I think it reminds people of what's at stake. You know, the - there were a lot of -- the president got a lot of -- President Biden got a lot of unsolicited advice about -- talk about the economy instead of talking about what's at stake and yet I would say the candidate who came out with the strongest message about that was somebody like Tim Ryan, and it just didn't really flying in Ohio. And I think that actually, between Donald Trump and the president making this kind of an argument, I think a lot of voters seemed to hear it.",

Can they work together effectively for the American people?MICHAEL LAROSA, FORMER BIDEN-HARRIS CAMPAIGN SPOKESMAN: You know, I think President Biden, whether you agree with the policies that he's pushed and passed, you cannot say that he hasn't been successful. I think in the first two years he's accomplished more - accomplished enough to last him two terms in office. He does not -- this shouldn't be about what President Biden does to govern.
