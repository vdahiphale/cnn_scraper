Trump says he was offering up a small preview of his second term agenda from the podium promising his coming crackdown on immigration, promising to \"stop woke,\" and also talking about sitting down very soon with Vladimir Putin.Trump also pushed back on the refrain that we heard from Democrats really pick up last week about a co-presidency that Trump now has with none other than Elon Musk.

And it was certainly reminiscent of many of the campaign speeches that he delivered over the past two years with a heavy focus on immigration and his plans for the U.S.-Mexico border.He did, however, tread some new ground, saying that he was open to allowing TikTok, the Chinese social media company, to continue to operate in the United States. He also considered taking back control of the Panama Canal and suggested that he would meet early in his term with Russian President Vladimir Putin about the Ukraine war. He also pushed back against Democrats' criticism that he has allowed billionaire Elon Musk to become the de facto leader of his party and the country. Take a listen to what he said. DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES:  They're on a new kick. Russia, Russia, Russia. Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine. All the different hoaxes. The new one is President Trump has ceded to -- the presidency to Elon Musk. No, no. That's not happening. No, he's not going to be president -- that I can tell you. And I'm safe. You know why?

And if this merger went through, they would jump to number three ahead of U.S. automakers Stellantis and General Motors. Also involved in this is Mitsubishi, which has an alliance with Nissan. But why are they doing this? Well, of course, they want to remain competitive. They said in their press release that they need to increase and boost sales. Also, Nissan is on very shaky financial footing right now. A lot of people expect that they could file for bankruptcy soon. So a partnership merging with Honda would be very good for them. Also, Nissan does have better EV capabilities right now compared to Honda, so that would -- that merger would create a better sort of business model for the two companies to, as you said Kate, compete in the electric vehicle market.

The FAA and Orlando city officials are now conducting an investigation to find out exactly what happened here. In a new civil rights complaint, actress Blake Lively is accusing her \"It Ends With Us\" co-star and director of sexual harassment and retaliation. Lively claims that Justin Baldoni and his team launched a smear campaign to destroy her reputation after she accused him of misconduct on set. Now, the complaint alleges that Baldoni and another man repeatedly violated physical boundaries and made sexual and other inappropriate comments to her. In a statement to CNN, Lively says this. \"I hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted.\" Baldoni's attorney denies the allegations, calling them completely false and outrageous. And officials are now investigating what happened at a popular Colorado ski resort that left more than 170 people stranded for hours. You see the end result there. This is how they got there. The gondola lift at Winter Park automatically stopped when it detected a crack in a structural piece of the lift just after noon on Saturday. That's according to a spokesperson with the Winter Park Resort. It eventually forced the resort to evacuate all the skiers and snowboarders who were stuck, lowering them down by ropes -- a rescue that took about five hours to get everyone down safely.

The FDA has approved the weight loss drug Zepbound for obstructive sleep apnea. It's the first prescription medicine to be approved to treat moderate to severe forms of a sleep condition closely associated with obesity. CNN's Meg Tirrell has all of the details. Is this beyond obesity because, of course, Zepbound helps people lose weight? That this drug works in conjunction with that?",

      "sentences": "No, you're exactly right, Sara. So this has been approved for people with obstructive sleep apnea and obesity. Those two conditions are very closely related and so often you already see that weight loss is recommended to reduce the severity of obstructive sleep apnea.And so what we're seeing here is one of these very popular GLP-1 medicines. This one is the drug tirzepatide. The brand name for weight loss is Zepbound. It's made by Eli Lilly. They did these trials, and they showed that this drug through helping people lose weight most likely really helps them with their obstructive sleep apnea as well. And this is a common condition. It can affect an estimate 30 million people in the U.S. and perhaps even more. A lot of folks don't even realize they have it. It's characterized by these sleep disruptions that you get because the airway starts to close, and you can feel really sleepy when you're awake. You can snore. But it's a lot stronger than that and can have really severe health impacts on folks. And so what they found is that in this clinical trial they ran two trials -- one where people were already and CPAP machines. These continuous airway pressure machines that keep your airway open while you're sleeping. And even on top of that therapy they found that people on average started with 50 of these breathing disruptions per hour overnight. And after a year of treatment of people taking the drug, even on top of CPAP, had 29 fewer per hour. So more -- a reduction of more than half of those events. And a lot of people saw even greater results than that. They also saw this on top of the weight loss we see with these medicines about 18 to 20 percent of their body weight lost over a year. That equates to about 45 to 50 pounds. And so while these drugs are already approved for people with obesity what I'm understanding about this is that it could potentially improve insurance coverage for some folks because that can still be really difficult, particularly on Medicare -- Sara.",
