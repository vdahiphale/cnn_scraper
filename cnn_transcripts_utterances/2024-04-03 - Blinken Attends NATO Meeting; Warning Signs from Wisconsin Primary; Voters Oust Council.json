They're pretty negative on Biden. Also, from my experience, talking to Haley voters in New Hampshire and South Carolina. So there may be a limit on how many of them he can attract.

So - so Biden is making choices. I mean there are other issues. Defending abortion rights is going to be a huge, I think, asset for him in Michigan after voters, you know, approve the constitutional amendment to keep it legal there. The possibility that Trump could go over their heads, as well as in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and supersede their efforts with a national ban, that is going to be an important asset for Biden.

Not just for domestic political reasons, as you just reported a few minutes ago, but also because of the impact on the region. Basically, Biden understands Israel is fighting an existential battle, not just but particularly in Gaza, against Iran and Iran-back surrogates throughout the region. And this is a fight that the United States has joined Israel in for good reason. The problem is, the way Israel is carrying it out. As we just heard from the head of the World Central Kitchen, Israel's rules of engagement, as we call them, for using force in this battle are far too loose. They must be tightened. President Biden needs to insist on this. And there are specific steps, such as opening new crossings from north Gaza into Israel to let more food in. And Israel returning to cooperation with the main U.S. organization, UNRWA, that provides food to some 1.1 million people in Gaza under good conditions every day.
