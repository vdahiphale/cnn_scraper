That number only expected to climb.Let's go straight to the CNN Weather Center with Meteorologist Allison Chinchar, who's been tracking what appears to be an upcoming storm. Allison, where are we going to see the worst weather? ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Right. So at least initially today, the main focus is going to be across the central portion of the U.S. But this system right here is going to spread its way across pretty much the entire eastern half of the country today and tomorrow. So a lot more cities are likely going to be impacted in the next 24 to 48 hours. For today, the cities where we're looking at some of the biggest impacts are going to be Dallas, Houston, Memphis, Atlanta and Kansas City. We also have that secondary system in the West. So places like Denver and Salt Lake, even Seattle may also have some delays in the airways. Here's the thing you want to take a note of, also the highways. It's not just the runways, but the highways that may also have some issues, especially along the Gulf Coast, Houston stretching over towards New Orleans up to Dallas, even into Oklahoma City. You're looking at rain and it's going to be very heavy at times. So flooding with that water that will just be standing at times could be an issue. Here's the areas where we anticipate the greatest flood threat. Notice it stretches from Houston all the way over towards the Pensacola region and then up through Little Rock, Arkansas. All of these areas have the potential for those downpours at times through some of these waves coming through. And yes, even the potential for some severe storms along the Gulf Coast, including the potential for some tornadoes. Here's a look at the system for today. This is where the main focus is going to be for all of the delays, whether it is by air or by roadway. But once we go into tonight and early tomorrow, then we start seeing a lot more Midwestern cities and portions of the southeast, now starting to tick up and see some of those problems as well. So Cincinnati, Chicago, St. Louis, Atlanta, Charlotte, also looking at potential delays. By the time we get to Sunday afternoon and heading into Monday, now we're talking the Northeast being some of the problem cities including New York, Boston, Philadelphia, stretching down to Washington, D.C. and Baltimore. So that's where you'll notice a lot of those airports also starting to tick up in the color of the yellow and orange is indicating the delays there as well. But we also have a new system that will be arriving to the Pacific Northwest. So that means additional delays even for Seattle, Portland stretching over into some of the other cities as well could also in turn be a concern too. Overall, most of the areas in the eastern half of the country likely looking, Boris and Sara, at about an inch of rain but we will have some places that pick up 2, 3, even 4 inches in a short period of time.",

Five people murdered at a shooting at a nightclub in Colorado and then another six lives needlessly lost at a Virginia Walmart. These statistics are sobering. The nonprofit Gun Violence Archive says the United States is now on pace to record 675 mass shootings by the end of the year. The definition of mass shooting being a shooting in which four or more people are killed or injured. That would make it the second most deadly years since they started tracking gun deaths. Last year still holds the record 690. A pediatrician scene here pictured with her family right before the Highland Park shooting at a July 4 parade right outside Chicago, says that policymakers need to reframe this as a public health crisis. That Pediatrician Dr. Emily Lieberman joins us now live. Emily, we're grateful to have you with us. I'm curious to get your solutions to the cycle of violence. But first, I want to remind our viewers what happened to you and your family this summer during that parade, and why it made you decide to take action. DR. EMILY LIEBERMAN, PEDIATRICIAN AND MASS SHOOTING SURVIVOR: Yes. First of all, thank you so much for having me today. I am a pediatrician, a natural child advocate. I'm a mother of two beautiful daughters. This summer, I attended a holiday parade on the most patriotic day of our year without a fear in my mind. And that parade ended up being a mass shooting. There were seven people from my community who were killed, there were almost 50 injured, and there are thousands that were traumatized, including my own family. And in the aftermath of that horrible massacre, as a pediatrician and child advocate, I promised that I would help prevent future mass shootings and save lives of children and citizens of our country.",

So it's not just the casualties that we experience on that day of seven people dying. It's a ripple effect. It's the children whose lives are forever changed by this trauma.

So he is thoughtful enough to take precautionary measures. And if that's the case, that it's entirely possible that the killer wear a hat, wear gloves to minimize any trace of DNA. The second thing is that the house, we have to admit, has a long history of housing, a lot of students, it is a student rental house. So for years, up to six people have rented there per semester, plus all their friends, the neighbors say it was a party house. Lots of visitors, lots of students going in and out of there. For years, a lot of people had the code to the keypad. So you could have potentially dozens of DNA samples, a hundreds even. Contractors, landlords visitors, to track them and match them, assuming you can get these people to give a DNA sample consent to it, then rule them out. All you can do is hope that you end up with one DNA sample that doesn't match anybody you know has been in the place and hopefully see if it comes in with a match to code this.

But the more time that goes on, the more I'm convinced that this could be the random act of a stranger completely unrelated to the students.",

But it is important to remember that for some people, COVID is still a serious risk.Now, COVID rates aren't nearly what they were at one point, but let's take a look at where they are right now. Still, there are more than 300 COVID deaths every day, and about 3,400 people are hospitalized with COVID every day. Now, as we know, these COVID variants keep changing. The ones that are starting to dominate right now, there's bad news and there's good news. The bad news is they're pretty smart, they're pretty wily, they seem to be outsmarting vaccination and infections more so than previous variants. The good news is, is they do seem to be causing pretty mild illness. So for most people, an illness with one of these variants is not necessarily such a big deal. But for some people, for the elderly, for people who are immune, compromised, it can be a very big deal. So as you're gathering this weekend, think about those people, think about whether there are certain people in your family and friend group who need to be more careful. And maybe around those people, you need to wear a mask. Maybe they need to be wearing a mask. So as you celebrate the holidays, think about those who are most vulnerable. Boris, Sara?",

I mean, you think about the fact that more than 11 million people state side watched them on Monday, and then yesterday's audience is surely going to be higher than that when those figures are released.But USR Christian Pulisic says that he really hopes that the fans back home were proud of this most recent performance against England. He also knows that the team has a lot of work to do if they want to move on to the round of 16. They played really well. I mean, it was a raucous crowd for the most high-profile matchup of this group stage. England were the favorite, no question about it, of Group B. They had more possessions, but the U.S. really looked like the better side for most of this match. They couldn't finish. Weston McKennie, great (ph) first chance there for the U.S. in the 26-minute, he's got it, a little bit high. And then a few minutes later, Pulisic missing just what was a tremendous opportunity. Beat the keeper, hit the crossbar. So unfortunate. Everybody thought that was going to be the moment. And then England with the final shot here. This had fans on the edge of their seats, but Harry Kane's headers sword wide in stoppage time. So the match ending in a scoreless draw, setting up what will be a win or go home match against Iran on Tuesday. Elsewhere for you, huge day in college football. Number two, Ohio State hosting third rank Michigan. And the stakes have maybe never been higher. There is so much hype around this game, guys. This is just the fourth time in nearly 120 meetings that both the Buckeyes and the Wolverines are squaring off with perfect records. Buckeyes looking for a little bit of revenge here. They had an eight- game win streak in the rivalry come to an end last year. But on top of that, both sides are so hungry because this is basically a playing game for the playoffs.
