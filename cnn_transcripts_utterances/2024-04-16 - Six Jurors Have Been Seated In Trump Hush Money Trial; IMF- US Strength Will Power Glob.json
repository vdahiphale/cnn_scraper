In the courthouse, right behind me, on the 15th floor, potential jurors are facing questions from both the prosecution and the defense, even their social media posts through the years are coming under scrutiny. The judge struck one potential juror from the pool since he called on Facebook for Trump to be locked up. Trump's team wanted another removed for posting a pro-Biden celebration after the 2020 election, the judge declined to strike the potential jurors saying the post did not implicate her ability to be fair. Trump hit on some familiar points when he spoke before today's proceedings. He again attacked Judge Juan Merchan and the case itself. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But one of the jurors who was stricken from this case over social media posts that happened because they wrote that they want to see Donald Trump in jail. The judge said that that was something that was a bridge too far. They had to strike that juror from the case, and then there was a combination on the third juror who was stricken for cause, a combination both of the post and the content in social media posts, as well as the jurors' demeanor when they were answering questions from attorneys. So, there are a little bit of a variety there, but Judge Merchan making clear that social media content and what you're posting on social media does not necessarily require you to be struck -- it does not necessarily reflect a bias. It is about their ability to render an impartial and fair verdict in this case and whether or not he believes them when they tell him that they can't.",

And there you saw Donald Trump really start to perk up, to smirk at some of the jurors in the box and he was even admonished by the judge for appearing to murmur something at one woman as she left the well, and the judge was very clear that he wouldn't tolerate any more of that from Donald Trump.

He said that is entirely irrelevant. What matters here is whether or not those potential jurors can pledge to be fair and impartial in deciding this case, and there were a number of challenges related to the social media post that Trump's team had unearthed over the lunch break that were dismissed quite rapidly by Judge Merchan because he said they did not seem to indicate that these potential jurors could not decide this case fairly.

The IMF also saw what are some signs the inflation fight has stalled, geopolitical risks are threatening to push energy prices higher. As you can see, Brent is once again way up there from where it was in March. The IMF's chief economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas joins me now. Pierre- Olivier good to see you, sir. Let's cut straight to what the fund is seeking in terms of policy response from the United States. Are you saying all things considered that an early cut in rates should not happen? PIERRE-OLIVIER GOURINCHAS, CHIEF ECONOMIST, IMF: Well, thank you for having me, Richard? And yes, the US economy has been doing better. It has been doing better in terms of economic activity, so we have revised upwards our projections for 2024 and also for 2025, but it also comes with a revision upwards in inflation. And when look a little bit more closely, what we are seeing in the US economy is strong growth, strong supply, strong productivity increase in labor supply, but also strong demand. US households are actually out there, they are consuming.

Today has been a very violent day on the border between Lebanon and Israel. Each side have conducted by my count more than ten strikes on the other, the Israelis conducted, for instance, two drone strikes on two separate cars. So far we understand that three fighters with Hezbollah were killed, one with the Amal Movement which is another Shia political party/militia that operates in Lebanon. The Israelis are claiming that one of them was a senior field commander, one of the Hezbollah people who was killed, but certainly, this would indicate the tensions are rising on the border. Now, we've seen them fluctuate in the past, but certainly, eyes have been watching much more closely what is going on in the border perhaps to see an indication if tensions will rise after the Iranian strikes. But we understand that there is real pressure on the Israelis to tone down the possibility of some sort of strike on the Iranians. The Egyptian foreign minister spoke with his Israeli counterpart. Rishi Sunak, the British Prime Minister, spoke with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying its time for cooler heads to prevail. The real worry is that if this gets to be a situation where each one is responding to the previous strike, this region could really slip down into the abyss of a regional war, so the pressure is on Israel to moderate its response or many would prefer just not respond at all, take satisfaction with how the strike, the Iranian strike really didn't end in any palpable results, any damage on Israel and perhaps move along and the hope is in this part of the region that the focus will return on the situation in Gaza, which is as dire as ever, and only getting worse -- Richard.",

Bragg's resume lists a series of prestigious offices. He served as assistant attorney in the Southern District of New York, a top lawyer in the New York attorney general's office, a professor of the New York Law School Racial Justice Project. That's where he represented the family of Eric Garner. The family sued the city after a plain clothed officer put him in an unauthorized chokehold after he was caught selling loose cigarettes. Garner's death in 2014 sparked outrage and protests nationwide. Bragg credits his interest in police reform to his years growing up here in Harlem, where he says once again he was unfairly stopped by police as a child.

Instead, let's talk about the IMF and their latest economic report. Well, the cat is out the bag. It's now quite clear that the IMF that says the U.S. is potentially overheating and therefore cuts in interest rates immediately would do no good in their quest to bring down inflation. And so whether it's in September, October, November, or later in the year the IMF still expects a cutting rates, but not just yet. And Jay Powell confirmed it pretty much when he said that there needs to be greater confidence and that clearly inflation was not coming down as fast, which sets the scene for the annual meet or the spring meetings, I should say, that are taking place in Washington where we will be on Thursday and Friday of this week. It is a very tricky moment. Everybody wants a rate cut. If only to give some relief after such high rates after many years. But now is perhaps just not the time. It depends on how you explain that to people, whether or not the markets can take it in its stride. And that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight. I'm Richard Quest in New York. Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, there you have it, I hope it is profitable. \"THE LEAD\" coming up next.",
