He's paying a lot of money for those views.Of course, he's just hired someone who's good at making money, Linda Yaccarino , and she's going to spend a lot of time pushing back his comments and, you know, slowly diminishing her reputation, unfortunately. She has a terrific reputation in the ad industry. And so if you're trying to attract ads, you know, saying someone who's wearing obvious Nazi tattoos is not -- doesn't have white supremacist views is unusual, I would say, and unusual for a CEO and leader. But he seems to want to do it and he's willing to pay the price for it. And it's, of course, his money. That we tolerate it. I don't know what we could do, Kaitlan.
