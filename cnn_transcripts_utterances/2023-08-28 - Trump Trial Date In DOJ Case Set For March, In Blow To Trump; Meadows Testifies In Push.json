      "sentences": "OUTFRONT next, Trump fumes. The former president vowing to appeal after a federal judge sets a March date for his election interference trial. And now all eyes on Mark Meadows who testified today, hoping to move his Georgia case to federal court. Will Trump follow suit?And just in, police releasing new surveillance video showing the Jacksonville killer moments before he opened fire, targeting Black shoppers. This as we're learning more about why he was forced to abandon what may have been an original plan. And prepare for evacuate. Warnings now up for Florida's gulf coast as tropical storm Idalia rapidly intensifies. It is expected to be a major hurricane by the time it makes landfall. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. I'm Erica Hill, in for Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, Trump on trial. A federal judge announcing his 2020 election interference case will begin in March of next year. Now, that is two years sooner than Trump's team had requested. They wanted it pushed out to April of 2026. Judge Tanya Chutkan, though, saying it will actually begin in six months on March 4th, to be exact. That's one day before Super Tuesday when 15 states hold their contests, it's three weeks before Trump's hush money trial begins in New York. And while we're keeping track here, it also comes just two months before the start of his classified documents trial. So, as you can see here, these dates are really colliding, not just with one another but with the Republican primary calendar. On social media, Trump says he's going to appeal this March 4th date for the criminal trial. Just a reminder, that is where he's accused of staging a conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election. But those aren't the only developments tonight. We do also want to take a close look at what's happening in Fulton County, Georgia, today. Trump's former chief of staff Mark Meadows on the stand for some 3 1/2 hours, hoping to convince a judge to move his case to federal court. Meadows testified he was simply doing his job. He was serving the president of the United States when he set up meetings and called Georgia officials to ask about election fraud. That argument, though, undercut by Georgia's Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger who said the in infamous 2020 call with Trump and Meadows was a, quote, campaign call. This was the first major hearing since the indictment of Donald Trump, Meadows and 17 others in Georgia, and what ultimately happens could impact all 19 defendants. Time is of the essence here. Everyone who you're about to see on your screen, all 19 there, set to be arraigned on charges that they conspired to overturn Georgia's 2020 election results. That arraignment set for next Wednesday. As you can see, we have a lot to get to on this Monday night. Sara Murray has been watching the Meadows' hearing. Evan Perez has been following everything happening with the DOJ. Sara, let's start with you. The Meadows hearing just wrapping up. How did it go for Mark Meadows today? He spent a long time on the stand.",

      "sentences": "He did. And it's pretty remarkable that he took this stand at all, considering he is a criminal defendant in this case. And, of course, that comes with some risk. But obviously, Meadows and his team wanted to use him to make the case that everything that he was doing in Georgia in the aftermath of the 2020 election had to do with his role as chief of staff.So, when he was on calls with Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani, then Trump's personal attorney, he said that was part of his role as a, you know, a gate keeper, a scheduler, part of making sure that from a federal prospective,  that elections were being carried out. He said something similarly when asked about setting up the call between Donald Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, that that was part of his job as White House chief of staff, even though Raffensperger testified that the federal government doesn't play a role in certifying the election results at this state level. And to give you a sense of just how broadly that Meadows' team is viewing his responsibilities, here's part of what played out. The judge asked Meadows' attorney at one point, could Meadows be acting under federal authority if Trump wasn't acting under federal authority. And Meadows' attorney says the answer is definitely yes. So, again, Meadows was on the stand for about 3 1/2 hours in a hearing that lasted all day long. The judge did not rule from the bench, but he said he will do so quickly. So we're expecting a ruling on paper, and he acknowledged that arraignments in this case are now scheduled in the state court on September 6th.",

      "sentences": "Well, we learned that there was a lot of discovery that has already been turned over from the prosecution to the defense, and that's one of the reasons why John Lauro, the former president's lawyer, stood up in court and gave a really strenuous and impassioned plea for the judge to just give them more time. Of course, they're asking for two years to prepare for this trial.The judge was not buying any of that. She said, one of the things that he was raising obviously was the fact that the former president is running for office, he's got three other indictments. And let me just read you a part of what she said. She said: Setting a trial date does not depend and should not defend on the defendant's personal or professional obligations. She compared it to, you know, a sports star who was going to be on trial. And she said we don't get to, you know, deal with the fact that they have to go play as part of the reasons why you set the trial date. That doesn't work that way. Now, the former president will now have to sit for trial beginning on March 4th, which, as you pointed out, is day before Super Tuesday. That means he's going to be sitting in court, Erica, during the time that you normally have candidates out on the campaign trail, right, meeting people at cook house and kissing babies. That's the kind of thing that candidates regularly do. This is not, of course, what this candidate is going to be doing. He's going to be stuck in court certainly at least for the four to six weeks that the prosecution says it'll take to put on this trial. Of course, we expect that the former president is going to try to appeal a whole bunch of things, but this judge has made it clear, Erica, that she does not intend for this trial to wait certainly for the 2024 election. She said that the public has a right to have this resolved before then.",

He certainly articulated that, in his view, he had a wide range of activities that fell under his obligations as chief of staff -- you know, making phone calls, getting contact information, gate-keeping, keeping the president on schedule.But when the D.A.'s office pushed back, there were a number of very important points raised that Meadows really didn't have a good answer for. So, for example, why did he offer campaign cash in order to help Fulton County get a signature audit moving along. Why did he have coordinated efforts with particular campaign officials for the electors scheme or for setting up this phone call. And finally, I think the big question that was left open-ended was why didn't he rope in members of the Department of Justice or the Department of Homeland Security on the meetings and the kind of conversations he was having with people about events in Georgia if there was a real federal interest involved that he was pursuing and furthering as an officer, an agent, an employee of the federal government. So, I think he had a really tough time today. I think Brad Raffensperger made it even tougher when he came into court and basically said that when Brad Raffensperger had the phone call that Mark Meadows had set up between him and Donald Trump, that there was no lawful way to change the outcome of the election. So I think it was a pretty tough day. That said, it's a low threshold for Mark Meadows to show in order to have this removed to federal court. So I don't think we have any great insight as to what will happen. But I don't think it was a particularly good day for him.",

But, of course, he has a federal case potentially to participate in as well. So I think it's really quite -- you know, it's kind of chaotic at -- at this point in time, but I think if Mark Meadows is in a position to make a deal and the D.A. wants to do that, that could also spell a lot of trouble for Donald Trump. So, a lot to be seen. But I also think, again, I think that Mark Meadows -- this is a big threshold question too because there are other people who want to get into federal court.

And, in fact, she is accommodating him to some degree because the DOJ said that they wanted it early January. There was an amicus brief submitted by very prominent conservative lawyers including Judge Michael Luttig, Alberta Gonzales, Stuart Gerson, who's acting attorney general, and Republican administration. And they all said the Justice Department's January 4th date was practicable, that she could go with that, and she didn't. So, the idea that this denies him effective counsel.

A racist hate, anti-Semitic hate, anti-Muslim hate, anti-LGBTQ hate.What is this that is so in the core of this country that so-called other people are going to be hated to such an extent that people want to kill them and take their lives? This is a reckoning moment for America once again, whether it's Tree of Life synagogue or El Paso or Mother Emanuel or Buffalo, now Jacksonville, where every responsible leader, a faith leader, a corporate leader, a political leader, has to speak out forcefully against hate. We have young children today who wonder because they're Black if they're safe at their college, if they're safe at school. People are afraid to go to grocery stores or go to the Laundromat or go to a diner for fear that some radicalized hater for no reason whatsoever will use an assault weapon and take their lives. This is a moment -- I was with the president just a few hours ago. He sounded the alarm that America is at an inflection point. I agree with the president's framing, his tone was absolutely right.

But the fact is his plane plunged to the ground two months after to the day has fuelled suspicions. Many doubt the official investigation would ever reveal state involvement.Already, there are concerns of how quickly and carelessly evidence has been dragged from the crash scene. When CNN visited Monday morning, it had already been flattened and cleared, just a small memorial to mark the spot. But the memory of the Wagner leader may not be so easily erased. All of us are angry at what happened, says this former military officer, now running for political office in the Russian far east. We all considered Prigozhin our primary commander in the special military operation, he told crowds of mourners. The Kremlin may not like it, but even in death, Russia's mercenary leader continues to strike a chord. (END VIDEOTAPE) CHANCE (on camera): Well, Erica, the next big significant event is likely to be Prigozhin's funeral, the date of which has not been announced. The concern for the Kremlin is that it could see yet more public support for the killed mercenary leader and, of course, to his criticism of the Kremlin's conduct of the Ukraine war.

ABBAS GALLYAMOV, FORMER PUTIN SPEECHWRITER; RUSSIAN POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, you know, the fact that Putin preferred Prigozhin to be dead instead of being active says to me that Putin cares much more about defense now than in the past. He's more on the defensive than on the offensive. You know, Prigozhin was really necessary for him from the point of view expansion, both in Ukraine, in Africa, in Belarus now. He was the kind of person on whom you could rely on from the point of view going forward. But he was too dangerous from the point of view of domestic security. He was too wild. He couldn't be controlled well. So, he was like, you know, destabilizing (INAUDIBLE) in the Russian elites a lot.
