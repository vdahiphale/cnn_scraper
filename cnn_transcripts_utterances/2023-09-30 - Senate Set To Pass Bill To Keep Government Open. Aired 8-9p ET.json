That Senate plan is moving through the legislative process. It did not receive a final vote yet. But Kevin McCarthy, the speaker of the House, said it was dead on arrival in large part because it included funding for Ukraine. That's why the speaker decided to push that aside, move forward with the bill that did not include aid for Ukraine, but kept the government open, would keep the government open for 45 days, includes some aid for national disaster relief, did not go forward with spending cuts as he had been pushing, the border security measures as he had been pushing, because he needs Democratic support, which is how what happened today in a really -- in a really lightning speed in the House, as the speaker retreated from his position.

Errol, your sense of what took place today. And we were just talking about this with Manu Raju a few moments ago. The House speaker had his back up against the wall, it seems. He was not going to get anywhere with his Republican conference alone. There was just too much infighting going on inside the conference. And so he had to work with Democrats to get this done here. And it was really just driving the government to the brink of a shutdown. We're seeing this take place right now in the Senate, as Manu was just explaining a few moments ago.

Because they did take things to the brink and they didn't get what they wanted.",

And the question is what they're actually going to do in the weeks ahead. The question that I have is, will this change how McCarthy deals with these hardliners in the weeks and months ahead. This is really the most direct he has taken them on in his time as speaker. He has worked with them, try to keep them in line, knowing that one member could call for a vote seeking his ouster at any moment.Time and time again, he has sided with them, whether it was a vote on an impeachment inquiry, doing it rather quickly even though he didn't have the support votes to actually launch an impeachment inquiry. He announced it, what happened, because he is getting pressure from those members on the far-right. Or his decision to back off spending levels that he agreed to as part of the deal to raise the national debt limit. He backed off on those spending levels and sought deeper cuts because of those same members. Those members who held the floor hostage in the House early in the summer, ultimately force McCarthy to cut a deal to actually seek deeper spending cuts, which is the big reason why Congress is in this fight over funding the federal government because McCarthy had to listen to those hardliners. But today, he took a different approach, took them on directly, and said, I am going to pass this bill with bipartisan support, with Democratic support, something that they were warning him against, and now he'll have to see what the political consequences are of any of that action. So the question I have, will this change his approach in 45 days when they have to fund the government, or any other big issue that they have to deal with for the next you are so? Or, if not, maybe it won't. Maybe he'll go back to catering to that part of his conference. And we'll see if he's able to make amends with them.",

You know, if you think back to those 15 rounds of votes that it took for him to be speaker, this is a group that does not mind looking bad on national television, doesn't mind holding up the works, doesn't mind bringing Congress to a halt.I think today suggests that they may have overplayed their hand, but that remains to be seen. They've still got a couple of really strong cards to play. And those, frankly, are cards that the speaker gave them, by allowing any one of them -- I mean, with no numerical minimum at all -- any one of them can decide to bring a motion to vacate.

This is going to be a huge fight in the fall, getting this aid to Ukraine, which is of course not included in this bill to keep the government open for 45 days because of the decision by Speaker McCarthy not to include it in there, given the divisions within his own conference about moving ahead with funding for Ukraine. But in the statement that just came out from the top Democratic leaders, Hakeem Jeffries, and his leadership team, they indicate that they do believe that McCarthy will put this on the floor.It says, \"When the House return, we expect Speaker McCarthy to advance a bill to the House floor for an up or down vote that supports Ukraine, is consistent with his commitment to making sure that Vladimir Putin, Russia and authoritarianism are defeated.\" It says we must stand with Ukraine and ensure Ukraine's victory. Now just to unpack this a little bit, McCarthy has not fully committed to having a vote on this on the House floor. He has indicated that it should move separately from this government funding legislation, but hasn't said explicitly that he would put this bill -- the White House has requested -- $24 billion in aid to Ukraine. He has not indicated that that would come up for a vote. These leaders think that some version of that will come up for a vote. It will be interesting to watch and play out -- this could be tied into the fight to potentially oust Kevin McCarthy from the speakership because of his decision to move forward to keep the government open and rely on Democratic votes to extend government funding for 45 days. That is something that has hogged on, as I've said, could be enough to push him out of the speakership. But if Kevin McCarthy needs Democratic support in any way to maintain his speakership, those Democrats are going to be seeking some concessions from the speaker. Expect Ukraine, Jim, to be a big part of their ask, as Kevin McCarthy if this scenario plays out. And it's one that is being actively discussed behind closed doors by Democrats and Republicans alike. They're trying to game out the situation. Ukraine could be a big piece of the puzzle here. Earlier today, Jim, I asked the speaker if he expects that he would need Democratic support to maintain the speakership if they try to push him out of the speakership. He did not respond to that directly. And he went on to say, bring it on. I'm ready to have this fight to become speaker. But he did not say if he would need Democratic votes. But if he does, Jim, Ukraine could be a central part of those negotiations in the coming days here.",

It's just getting back -- as you mentioned, I wrote \"Fortune\" piece, it was just out the other day, that was highlighting what we heard and saw everywhere in Kyiv and comparing it to what's the rebuilding of Warsaw as a great inspiration.The spirit is so strong but this is a terrible time to suggest any weakening in our resolve to undermine the enthusiasm of our allies and of course the Ukrainians.

This is not a thing to trifle with.We're looking at not even, you know, 5 percent of the U.S. Defense budget that we're talking about here. The Biden administration has asked for an additional $24 billion. The Senate only cleared a quarter of that, $6 billion. And the House is now sitting on that $6 billion. This is not much money. Of all the money we have spent on Ukraine today, again it's only 5 percent of the U.S. Defense budget or less than 1 percent of the U.S. government federal budget in general. Every European now -- the E.U. has spent just as much militarily and twice as much in humanitarian assistance. So we're not looking too good on this. It's so shameful. We spent three times this on the Marshall plan, which was money well spent. But I do salute Mitch McConnell on his resolve. There is a U.S. senator, a very conservative senator, Arthur Vandenberg, from the GOP in that 1947, who stood. He was an isolationist, and he stood behind Truman and General Marshall to make the Marshall plan come alive. And that's the kind of role that Mitch McConnell is playing, bringing his party along here. So I support his resolve. But, boy, this is a terrible signal to put out that there is any uncertainty right now. I mean, there are questions right now about the oil price cap, which have been very effective. And we don't want to take a look at anything which melts down the sanctions or anything that we have done. We have to redo the oil price gaps as an aside to elevate some enforcement there. But we have seen that Putin -- we've destroyed almost half of his military by estimates. His economy is collapsing. He's surviving only as you and I have talked before on the show, he's surviving only by cannibalizing his economy. Every sector has fallen by 60 percent to 95 percent. The only thing he hopes for is attrition and propaganda to weaken the resolve of the allies, and that's what this messaging does, is to put some self-doubt. Very destructive.",

What is your sense of what's happening behind the scenes over at the White House because I have to imagine, and I know they're probably going to say, no, no, no, we know there is another bill that's going to get past and Ukraine funding will be there, but I have to think there is just a touch bit of nervousness over there as to how this is playing out.",

And, you know, for Zelenskyy to go to New York, make these appeals to the U.N. General Assembly, go to Washington, make these appeals up on Capitol Hill, and at the White House.I mean, this is potentially a precarious moment in all of this because, as Manu Raju was saying earlier on in this program, there is no guarantee right now from the House speaker that this aid to Ukraine is going to get a chance on the House of Representatives, on the floor of the House of Representatives.",

There is a real sense of history whenever the U.N. comes to town, and it's just a reminder that, in the past, when we didn't take measures early on, and we weren't united with our allies, the results were catastrophic. And that trying to save a couple of dollars or a little bit of trouble on the front end can lead to huge disastrous problems on the back end.So, you know, in the late 1990s, when Osama bin Laden declares war on the United States, and it's pretty much ignored and not enough is done to sort of track him down, and then five years later, you have 9/11 and an involvement in Afghanistan that lasted 20 years and cost $2.3 trillion, hundreds of thousands of lives lost, 2400 American servicemen, thousands of contractors, on and on and on. You know, the number of wounded, catastrophic results, when a little bit of attention and a little bit of money on the front end could have prevented it.",

That was the message at the United Nations. That's what we're hearing from the White House. That's what's being debated in the Senate. And sooner or later, we are going to have to really focus on that. We, in the media, of course, have to remind our audiences what's at stake, that what happens in the next 45 days is going to be about a lot more than just whether or not Kevin McCarthy gets to keep his job.",

I feel like we keep on waiting for the fever to break, and then it doesn't break. Instead it, you know, it just keeps on going. And rather than dysfunction being an unfortunate side effect of parties having ideological differences or whatnot, it seems like it is the goal at this point.And that's what's really troubling, that when you have one major party in this country with a significant faction that has no interest in governing, and in fact maybe wanted there to be a shutdown of some kind or at least wanted there to be a little bit more turmoil than would necessarily need to be the case, I don't know how you get back to a functional system. Clearly there are some Republicans who would like to govern, who voted, in fact, to keep the government open.

What has been different in this Congress has been the decision by those far-right members to try to hold the House floor hostage, basically the way that legislative process works in the House is you have to approve a rule first. That sets the parameters for floor debate. That happens before you actually can move on to the legislation.What typically happens is the majority party votes in lockstep for the rule, the minority party votes against it, they have the votes as a majority party to move the legislation. What these hardliners have decided to do in this Congress is to vote to take down those rules. And that mix has really paralyzed action in McCarthy's House. That forced him to cut a deal with these hardliners to seek much deeper spending cuts, which is the reason why the House and the Senate are in much different places over spending levels, and the reason why we're on the brink of a government shutdown that we barely averted because of the demands that were made by those members on the right. McCarthy forced to acquiesce to those demands, even though he had cut a deal and funding levels with the White House and with Senate Democrats and Republicans, he had to back off of that because those members were using those hardball tactics to essentially hold the House floor hostage. So, Jim, the question is going to be if they will continue to do that as the legislative process moves forward, as we get into the next funding fight in 45 days.",
