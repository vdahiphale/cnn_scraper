What's that? One million people, half a million people, who knows what the number might be. But this is a scenario that is really worrying. And the worries go outside of Israel.

You now have Prime Minister Netanyahu asking the IDF to draw up a plan to evacuate well over a million people from Rafah, something the White House says would be a disaster. Is this even possible? What would this look like? BRIG GEN. STEVE ANDERSON, U.S. ARMY, RETIRED: Thank you for having me, Brianna. Yes, it would be possible but it would be very difficult. But I think it misses the point that Nic made, in which Netanyahu is trying to pass the buck to the military to solve this problem for him. Whereas this is a political situation. They need a political solution, the two-state solution. I mean, what's going on now in Gaza? Now four months into this, you essentially have got a petri dish for growing future terrorists going on in there. This is not a military solution at this point. We need to have a political situation solved. You need a two-state solution. I mean, an occupation force like this, down in Rafah and all the rest of Gaza, plays right into the Iranian hands. They can point at Israel, the United States as hating them and everything they stand for. It also -- Saudi Arabia has a problem with this. They will not sign a peace deal with Israel as long as this is going on. The other thing is it's a math problem. There's only 10 million Israelis. There are two million people in the Gaza Strip. There is no way they can occupy all the Gaza Strip effectively without having a major impact on their economy, their entire way of life. So they've got to do everything they can to come up with a political solution, Brianna.",

There are attacks happening up there almost every day.But the last thing they need to do is open up another front with Hezbollah. They do not need to take on Hezbollah in any way, shape, or form. They need to solve the problem on the Gaza Strip, which is huge. They need to come up with a political situation -- solution to this, a two- state solution. The other thing I would say, Brianna, is they have yet to -- the Israelis have yet to account for what happened on the 7th of November -- of October, four months ago. It is still incredible to me that there has been no accountability from this, the most significant letdown in national defense by a country maybe in the history. It's almost inconceivable that they could allow the advance like the 7th of October happened. Everybody sympathizes with Israel, but they had about a three- or four-month window of opportunity there to solve this problem. After that -- I mean, right now, Israel is turning into a political liability for President Biden and the rest of the world is getting ticked off. They've got to come up with a political solution now. They need to rescue the hostages and they need to develop a two-state solution that gives the Palestinians self-rule.",

      "sentences": "Because they are connected by the same person in the middle, former President Trump.Look, two things can be true. This is a high court that's under enormous scrutiny. Questions about ethics and partisanship. The chief justice is under enormous pressure to find, for example, in the ballot case, find some sort of opinion that can draw bipartisan consensus, likely be very narrow. If you listen to the arguments yesterday, it's clearly possible he can do that. But at the same time, you have two cases that are not equal in terms of their legal merit for the former president. Ballot eligibility, also a strong argument for him, a very ambiguous Constitutional provision. Different outcomes across states, across the country. And this idea that you would allow states to Strip voters of their choice of candidate it is one that is powerful, not only in the high court, because it's for case law to defend that, but also the court of public opinion. This idea of absolute presidential immunity, I know from talking to sources in and around the Trump legal team, even they know that it is not a winning issue on the merits for them. And in many ways, they are litigating that issue, not only to try to exercise their clients' rights to the fullest extent, but also to try to get the Jack Smith case delayed until after the November election. So what people want to say, oh, maybe the Supreme Court will split the baby here. I think it is just the fact is the law allows them to do that. Trump has a strong case on ballot eligibility, far less on immunity. I think people around the former president think it's unlikely the Supreme Court will want to take up the ballot eligibility question. So the question is, how long does it take them to get an answer on what they are going to do? That, the timing, really matters more than anything. The longer it takes, then the less likely Jack Smith can bring his case.",

President Biden certainly agreed and is vehemently so that he hadn't broken any laws. And I think there is a legitimate discussion to be had. Of course, I was the Obama White House ethics czar. I was talking to the Bush-era ethics czar. We were surprised that the special counsel veered, in our view, gratuitously into comments about the presidents age and memory that are the most hot-button political issues right now. There is a long-standing DOJ principle that prosecutors should avoid that kind of thing when they don't charge. Former Attorney General Eric Holder spoke about it. As this sinks in, we understand better some of why Biden was concerned. I'm not justifying what he did with the documents.",

That's the conclusion that was made based on the evidence. And there's something else I want to add about this, because we have gone back and forth. On page one of the report, it says, \"The president willfully retain classified-mark documents related to Afghanistan.\" But on page 215 of the report, it says, quote, \"There is, in fact, a shortage of evidence on these points.\" On page five of the report -- everybody read that, first few pages. It says, quote, \"Mr. Biden's memory was significantly limited.\" But here's something that everyone should make sure that they see. Elsewhere in the report, he says, quote, \"We expect the evidence of Mr. Biden's state of mind to be compelling,\" pointing to him providing, quote, \"clear and forceful testimony.\" That is his comments on his state of mind later in the report.
