And we begin this hour with breaking news. A woman who is expected to be one of the most significant witnesses in Donald Trump's hush money trial now on the stand. Hope Hicks is speaking at this moment. She of course was once considered to be one of Donald Trump's closest aides and confidants. She served as press secretary for the 2016 campaign. Her testimony is expected to center on how the campaign was scrambling to deal with the scandal surrounding Trump's alleged treatment of women and what the responses were in those moments. It's important to remember there are really few people who can speak to Donald Trump's mindset and what he was doing outside of the public eye in quite the way that Hope Hicks can. And just a reminder that we will be showing you on the left side of your screen the panels that will be giving you key updates that we're getting from our team of reporters from CNN inside the courtroom. Let's first begin with Jessica Schneider, our Justice Correspondent, taking a look at this testimony that we're hearing just from Hope Hicks right now. She's testifying to -- she testified initially to her role, but she's also talking a lot about Donald Trump and Donald Trump's role specifically in communications and the statements that would be released.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, the fact that Donald Trump was very involved, especially in those beginning days of thecampaign. As Hope Hicks put it, he was really the master communicator and she was new in this role of press secretary starting in January, 2015. And so, she was really just sort of learning from Donald Trump. Interestingly, we just got to some -- some crucial testimony potentially when it comes to Hope Hicks' knowledge of this hush money scheme, or maybe her lack of knowledge as she might be trying to portray it. But she did say that, yes, she was aware of who David Pecker is, of course, the former publisher of the \"National Enquirer\", the man who really, prosecutors allege, orchestrated this hush money scheme and this conspiracy. She said that she was often listening in on the phone calls between David Pecker and Donald Trump. There was one where Donald Trump congratulated David Pecker on a good story about a then Republican rival, Ben Carson. But then Hope Hicks was asked by prosecutors, were you ever in on any physical meetings with David Pecker and Donald Trump? Hope Hicks saying to that one, she doesn't recall. And that's interesting because remember David Pecker had testified that Hope Hicks had stopped into a meeting at Trump Tower in August, 2015, when David Pecker, Michael Cohen and Donald Trump sort of hatched this plan, this conspiracy to cover up any negative stories in particular about women who alleged affairs that might come up during the campaign. So, those are the two mentions we've really heard Hope Hicks respond to questions about this hush money scheme. Prosecutors are sort of all over the place with their questioning. Again, we're just at the beginning of this testimony that will probably last all afternoon, Erica, because court today only goes until 3:45. We've still got the lunch break, but they will likely be just building on how closely -- like you said, how closely she worked with Donald Trump. She was in on so many meetings, so many phone calls. They're going to try to elicit more testimony about when things really got crazy in October 2016 leading up to the election. What she knew. We still have -- we still have to get to that, but it will come. Erica.",

So, the more the prosecution can show that Donald Trump ran his business with an iron fist, that he was involved in every decision, that is highly unlikely and not probable that a decision such as killing a story or promoting a story in the \"National Enquirer\" would have been done without Donald Trump's involvement. Hope Hicks, because she was so close to Donald Trump during the critical period that we're talking about in this case, she's going to be used by the prosecution to try to establish the involvement, the day-to-day involvement that Donald Trump had in his business and in business decisions.",

And one thing we shouldn't underestimate, Erica, is the fact that the prosecution pretty much already knows what Hope Hicks' testimony is going to be. They subpoenaed her to be there, so she's not there voluntarily. But because of the investigation that was done leading up to the trial, it's possible that they've even had conversations with her, that they've met with her, that they know what her testimony is. And we know they have text messages, they have emails, they have other documentary evidence that will give them a pretty good look into what to expect from her testimony. And as you said, Hope Hicks had a very warm and personal relationship with Donald Trump. He plucked her out of Ivanka Trump's clothing company and put her in a very prominent role, even without a lot of experience, in his campaign. But we have heard that that relationship changed after January 6th, because apparently she was very critical of his handling of the January 6th insurrection. So, here's someone who was very close to Donald Trump at one time, but who is capable of criticizing him when she believes he's done things that she doesn't support.",

So, interesting, too, that we're hearing her described as being uncomfortable right now. She's talking about how she's nervous. I can tell you right now what they're talking about in court. They're talking about \"The Washington Post\" reaching out to the campaign for comment on this \"Access Hollywood\" tape. And it's important to remember, the jury is not going to see that tape. The judge has said that would be too prejudicial, but they can see the transcript. There is other related evidence that's going to be brought in.

He was concerned about how female voters would respond to his candidacy in light of that \"Access Hollywood\" tape. So, the campaign was scrambling, trying to come up with a plan to deal with the \"Access Hollywood\" tape and the fallout of it. And so, when you look at David Pecker's testimony, the catch-and-kill scheme as it related to Stormy Daniels' story, it's all a part of this bigger narrative that this campaign is on pins and needles, very concerned, thinking that it can taint the campaign, that women turning against Donald Trump, that women being upset about that \"Access Hollywood\" tape could be the death knell of his campaign. So, getting Hope Hicks to testify about the nervousness, about the concerns during this period that \"The Washington Post\" is reaching out is very, very important testimony for the prosecution in terms of connecting the dots as to why Donald Trump would have wanted the story about Stormy Daniels to never see the light of day.",

And while it might not be Vietnam in terms of those statistics, Bianna, there's stillwidespread disapproval of President Biden's handling of the war between Israel and Hamas. In a CNN poll that was released just in the last week, some 71 percent of voters disproved of Biden's handling, while 81 percent of voters under the age of 35 disapproved of it. And while it is true that there are other issues like the economy and reproductive rights that rank in front of this, it could be something that voters remember going into November. The President yesterday delivering his remarks, he had a sober and a forceful tone, echoing much of what he said in written statements or through spokespeople in recent weeks. But aides say that he made the decision to deliver those remarks on Thursday morning after seeing some of the imagery come in from UCLA overnight and just seeing what was described to me as a repeated drumbeat of the need for law enforcement to get involved. The White House continues to monitor the situation on campuses nationwide and worldwide, with senior aides monitoring official channels through law enforcement and local governments, while I'm told younger staffers sort of tapped into the zeitgeist and they've been in touch with friends of theirs, peers of theirs who remain on campus either in undergraduate or postgraduate studies and are sharing some social media commentary and content with top aides who are making these decisions. [12:15:00] But Bianna, it comes as the White House is preparing for President Biden to visit two specific campuses later this month. That is Morehouse College in Atlanta and West Point University, where he'll be delivering commencement addresses. The White House has said they can't really predict what sort of environment they'll encounter on campus. But we're told that there's really one thing and one thing only that the White House believes could actually take down the temperature, and that is the potential for a deal that ushers in a ceasefire, frees dozens of hostages that remain in Hamas captivity, and that Secretary of State Antony Blinken has been working to secure this week. That is what they believe could be the solution here, and it's one where they remain hopeful. Bianna.",

Natasha, we're just learning the CIA Director Bill Burns has just arrived in Egypt for yet another round of negotiations to reach some sort of ceasefire, to release the hostages, and to have a substantial pause in the war at bare minimum.

But if there is a ceasefire deal that comes out of these negotiations, of course, that Bill Burns now is in Cairo discussing with his counterparts, then that could, of course, forestall Israel's plans to go into Rafah. Now, at this point, one of the major sticking points, of course, is a response by Hamas, whether they're actually going to respond favorably to the latest proposal that Israel has put forward that President -- or I should say that Secretary of State Antony Blinken called earlier this week extremely generous, saying that it is basically a very positive step forward on the Israeli side, but waiting, of course, for that Hamas response. But the ultimate goal here is for a ceasefire to be put in place, one that is ideally lasting, not only for, you know, a month or six weeks, but for much longer than that, with the hopes, of course, that the war will eventually end. And so, what the administration is watching for at this point is not only whether Israel actually comes up with an actual plan to protect the civilians in Gaza, over a million of them now sheltering in southern Gaza and Rafah there, where the Israelis are planning to carry out this kind of operation, but also the hopes that, of course, something comes out of these negotiations for a more lasting ceasefire. So, as of right now, again, Secretary Austin, he spoke to this just yesterday. He said that we are going to see a lot more civilian casualties coming out of this conflict if Israel does, in fact, move forward with that. So, right now, all eyes are on those negotiations.",

We start talking about and using the wordrecord territory or record breaking and that carries a lot of weight, especially across southeast Texas considering their history of flooding over the decades. Well, here's an example. This is Livingston, Texas and this is just a drop in the bucket, quite literally, of the flooding that is ongoing. Right now, we have upwards of 40 different river gauges across southeast Texas and into central Louisiana that are at or over some sort of minor flood stage. But you can see 12 of them are actually at major flood stage and a few river gauges along these rivers and Trinity River in particular, this is just northeast of Houston, are forecast to crest above record territory. Previous record was 43 feet, forecast at 44.4 feet by Saturday morning. So, not only does this eclipse Hurricane Harvey 2017 flood stages, but at this particular river, it will break an all-time record high. [12:25:00 So, that's significant. We have ongoing flash flood warnings where you see that shading of red impacting tens of thousands of people including the greater Houston metro area which is under a flood watch and this is the reason why upwards of 27 inches of rain or roughly 685 millimeters of rain since the past month. Just in the past week alone we have experienced nearly a foot of rain. And this is just into CNN, the Weather Prediction Center has increased the risk of excessive rainfall through the course of the day today. So, ending off the weekend with more chances of flooding as one could imagine, these rivers will take time to crest and then start to slowly reside. But with additional rain in this forecast, we don't see any real relief in sight. Because you take us through the weekend and you can see some of our computer models picking up on anywhere from an additional four to six inches of rain. Now, on top of that the severe weather threat has been dire. This is just one tornado that spawned yesterday. This is in Hawley, Texas. You saw Bianna talking about it a moment ago. But look at the moment it obliterates a building and a home spreading debris across the southern portion of this or the bottom portion of this large and violent twister. I mean just look at that incredible imagery. Unfortunately we have really seen just an uptick in the number of tornadoes across the central U.S. and once again an enhanced risk of tornadoes and severe weather resides across central and western portions of Texas.

As she took the stand, Hicks was visibly uncomfortable expressing how nervous she was. Prosecutors have Hicks on the stand there, of course, working now to demonstrate the relationship that they had and also just how involved Donald Trump was, how hands on he was with all aspects of the campaign.

Did she see Cohen and Mr. Trump talk? Was she in the room when they talked? Was she in the room when they talked about Stormy Daniels? So far, I haven't seen any notes that they've gone that far yet, but there must be some feeling that she has some of that knowledge. And she also may know about what happened at Mar-a-Lago. She may have seen Mr. Trump with Stormy Daniels. She may have seen Mr. Trump with Ms. McDougal at one time or another, been asked to make phone calls or connections for Mr. Trump at one time or another.

Part residence, part bureau. Everything is a challenge, from the search for signal to transmit the day's footage, to the search for food. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AL-ZANOUN (through translator):  There have been days when we've eaten donkey and horse food, corn and fodder, as well as barley just to stay alive. BASHIR (voice-over): For journalists in Gaza, the biggest challenges are the most basic ones. Sami Shahada is a photojournalist for Turkish-based broadcaster TRT. He was filming at a refugee camp in central Gaza. SAMI SHERHADEH, TRT JOURNALIST (through translator):  We went to cover the movement of displaced people. And as soon as we arrived at the place, we were targeted. BASHIR (voice-over):  Sami had to have his leg amputated above the knee and is now awaiting medical evacuation to Turkey. At least 97 members of the press have been killed in what the Committee to Protect Journalists has termed the deadliest period for media workers since its records began. But that figure, according to the CPJ, is likely to be much higher. And yet, despite the risks, Palestinian journalists in Gaza keep doing their jobs, working in groups for protection, covering stories even if it means getting there on a donkey and cart. AL-ZANOUN (through translator):  Every day we wake up, we thank God that we are still alive and that we are still able to continue documenting the events in the Gaza Strip. BASHIR (voice-over):  In the belief that one day, his work and the work of Palestinian journalists like him won't have been in vain. AL-ZANOUN (through translator):  Our hope is that this war will end, God willing, and that we will be able to save and protect our children after these targeted attacks and this continuing war, because they want to live like the rest of the world's children, in security and peace.

Prosecutors have said the scandal surrounding that tape was actually a major motivator for Donald Trump to buy the silence of women who could accuse him of being a sexual predator or unsavory behavior. Hicks testified she spoke to Trump daily throughout 2015 and 2016. At the time, of course, during the 2016 campaign, she was the campaign press secretary. It's important to note, Hope Hicks has said she's paying her own legal fees and also that she has not spoken to the former president for about two years now. CNN's Jessica Schneider, Justice Correspondent is following along with all of this. And Jessica, in terms of what's happening there in the courtroom, we're now really getting into some of the meat here, right, about Karen McDougal, about a request from \"The Wall Street Journal\" for them to comment on a story that Karen McDougal's silence had been bought so that a story about her and Donald Trump would not get out. What more is Hope Hicks saying?",
