The other half, of course is controlled by the Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.So for any joint address, there has to be a joint invitation of course. They could go and just have him speak to the House. That's possible. That would create an interesting situation. Would Senate Republicans go? So we will see if this actually ever happens.

Thank you so much for being here. I want to talk about your new campaign. Republican Voters Against Trump. You told Politico, quote, \"Unlike other never Trumpers you are all in on Biden.\" So what are you going to do with this movement? How are you going to organize?",

We Republican Voters Against Kari Lake and Republican Voters Against Herschel Walker. And our theory of the case is that the most persuasive tool for peeling off these sort of disaffected Republican voters, right-leaning independents, soft GOP voters, is to use real Republicans, real voters.And in 2024 everybody that's part of our campaign, Republican Voters Against Trump, has actually voted for Trump at least once. And they explained why they're not going to do it again and the reasons vary. I mean, for a lot of them this time around, it's about January 6th. It's about Trump's lies about the election. It's about how dangerous they think he's going to be in 2024. The fact that, you know, he's something of a lunatic who will be surrounded by other lunatics. And the fact that he's in it for himself, that he's not in it for people, that it's about grievance, it's about staying out of jail, it's about raising money. And so, you know, the messengers, as people who voted for Trump in the past, they are more credible to swing voters than let's say just about anybody else. Certainly than Democrats. And a big piece of it psychologically is these are not people who are Democrats. And so its uncomfortable for them to vote for Joe Biden. And so you're not building really a pro-Joe Biden coalition like the Democrats might. You're trying to become part of the broader anti- Trump coalition, and so that's what we're trying to do here.",

You said a new never Trump is born every minute, and on that note, this week, we saw about 108,000 Republicans in Arizona, Republicans, vote for Nikki Haley, who of course is not even in the race. There is a prominent school of thought, though, that Republicans who aren't fans of Trump are going to put on their GOP jerseys in November and pull the lever for Trump. So how -- you mentioned part of your strategy to have Republicans likeyourself, maybe even more different kinds of Republicans, those who served with him in the White House perhaps, is that going to be enough in such a tribal country right now?",

But we need to hear from Jim Mattis.We need to hear from so many of the cabinet officials that they have maybe said something off the record, or maybe they've a quote here and there. They need to sound the alarm and explain to the country what they saw, why Donald Trump cannot return to office, and because we might think it doesn't matter to voters, but to this critical slice of voters who will make the margin, the decision in 2024, they can make a difference.
