We'll have a conversation with the Spanish Soccer Player Andres Iniesta coming up. First though your other headlines this hour Florida's Gulf Coast bracing for a major storm as Hurricane Idalia is expected to hit the state at dangerous category three strength. Now the storm earlier lashed Cuba forcing thousands to evacuate. After a day of rumors were that Wagner Chief Yevgeny Prigozhin's funeral has taken place privately in St. Petersburg. The Kremlin said earlier there were no plans for Russian President Vladimir Putin to attend. A wildfire in Greece is now said to be the European Union's largest blaze in at least 23 years. The total burn area in Northeastern Greece is now larger than New York City. And we now have the results from the largest study ever to look at traumatic brain injury in young athletes. It shows more than 60 cases of CTE in athletes who are under the age of 30 at the time of their death. All those stories are coming up as we welcome you to our second hour of \"Connect the World'. The regional heads of Spain's Football Federation are calling it unacceptable behavior that is seriously damaged Spanish football's image. Well, they are demanding the immediate resignation of Luis Rubiales over that kiss on the World Cup podium that has spiraled into a national controversy about the treatment of female athletes. Rubiales himself refusing to step down as these debates simmers the Spanish women's national team is boycotting future matches and some on the men's side are joining in. Look, it's a bad look for the country, which is part of a joint bid for the 2030 Men's World Cup. So tonight we ask what is the future of Spanish football. Well, Atika Shubert joining me now from Madrid this hour. Let's start with you with the very latest developments as you understand them.",

So what's happening instead is a very long and painstaking process in which the government through its high commission for sport has filed a complaint with the tribunal. The tribunal asked for more information and that was supplied earlier today. So now we're waiting to see whether or not the tribunal decides that there is enough evidence there to proceed with some sort of serious offence. If it's deemed serious enough, then it is possible that Rubiales will be suspended. If it is not however, then we're at a stalemate. So there are a lot of hoops to still jump through. And this seems to be one of the delaying tactics that will keep Rubiales in his position. Even though for example a FIFA has suspended him so here remains ineffective as President of the Federation, but he still has the title. So that's where we are at the moment. In the meantime, there has been no word from Rubiales since Friday, when he had that defiant speech in which he refused to resign and the pressure on him just keeps building Becky.",

I mean, how might this snowball if the core of this issue is not addressed at this point or is that no risk? SANCHIS No, there is. I would say it's unacceptable. It's unfair. And I could say many, many words. It's just now UEFA is a women's football country, you know perfectly what it means to win a World Cup for us. It's one of the biggest successes in the story of not of women's sports, but of sport of Spanish sport. So we've been stolen this moment of celebrating together. And CNN should have called us just to realize what's behind the success, not to talk about the behavior of the President, because he's not representing. He should be representing the values of Spanish football. But indeed, he showed that he is not aligned with this. So of course, there has been a massive impact internationally.

This time lapse video shows the outer bounds of what was then a tropical storm lashing Havana in Cuba and the worst is yet to come. Idalia is getting stronger as it approaches the U.S. State of Florida. By the time it makes landfall on Florida's Gulf Coast on Wednesday it is expected to be a powerful category three hurricane. Thousands are being told to evacuate while they still can. Let's get a look at where the storm has been and where it's going next? Patrick Oppmann is in a very wet Havana.

But that water is sitting about two degrees Celsius above where it should be this time of year. It's beyond bathtub temperature. We're talking hot tub temperature, right? And this water is primed for a major hurricane to develop. And we have one that is forming and strengthening right now. Let's get to the details and bring up my graphics because some of the latest information just came to us from the National Hurricane Center, the 11 am Eastern Time update, that's 140 kilometer per hour storm. There it is Hurricane Idalia. It is moving into the Straits of Florida off the Coast of Cuba and into those warm ocean waters. And that of course is what we're concerned about. The strengthening is explicitly shown within the forecast. The radar there showing the outer rain bands lashing Key West, Havana and some of the rainfall totals there have exceeded hundred millimeters already. There's a look at the watches and the warnings mainly hurricane warnings for the Big Bend of Florida that's like a catcher's mitt for all the water that's going to push up into that region. And the official forecast track has this just shy of a category four, Atlantic hurricane equivalent, that's 205 kilometers per hour by Wednesday morning. Let's talk about the threats here. Not only do we have destructive winds that will topple trees take down power and power lines. But it is this shallow nature of the Gulf of Mexico that I'm concerned about. We continue to talk about the storm surge potential here, which by the way where I'm standing, could run anywhere from 1.5 to 2 meters of normally dry ground. But if I was to walk out into the shallow water, let's say 50 meters from here, I would get water only up to my knees, maybe my waist at most. That shows you just how shallow the bathtub here is literally behind, right? And that has implications on the shoreline. So what we've done is with the wonderful resources that CNN has, we've done a drone flying to give you that aerial perspective. And you can see four kilometers that way towards Clearwater Beach, just how long this beach actually stretches and how flat it actually is? So the problem being is that water gets pushed up from Hurricane Idalia, that continues to strengthen that water will have to move somewhere, right? And it's going to come up and over these barrier islands. It could bring again upwards of two meters of storm surge where I'm located but in that catcher's mitt, that Big Bend area, Cedar Key, you can see it on the map. That is the area that is some of the most vulnerable coastline in America to storm surge. We're talking for the potential of over three meters of storm surge, and that is going to possibly inundates some of those coastal locations not a location that you want to be at. And you know what; we've seen this play out time and time again. We warn people you can hide from the wind. You got a run from the storm surge, right? And that is just such poignant words I think one of the officials was telling our channel that earlier today. There's the earliest arrival time, just offshore. You could see some of the outer rain bands from Hurricane Idalia that are about to reach our shoreline here in Clearwater Beach, Florida. I give it another 45 minutes before we have tropical storm force winds and rain for our live shot, Becky.",

It wasn't until later though, that the U.S. intelligence community received information that allowed them to understand that these people were traveling to the United States with the help of a smuggling network that included a member with some pretty troubling ties to ISIS. Now, this obviously set off some big alarm bells across the U.S. government. The FBI immediately scrambled to try to locate, investigate and assess all of the different individuals who had traveled to the United States with the help of this network.

And part of that was requesting that the Turkish authorities arrest the ISIS linked smuggler as well as other members of this sort of human smuggling network. And because of that U.S. officials were pretty quickly able to determine that this person wasn't actually a member of ISIS. He was a more like an independent contractor who had some personal sympathies with the group. So because of that sort of understanding, the Biden Administration pretty quickly came to view this as more of a run of the mill human smuggling operation as opposed to a potential terrorist plot. And we do know from U.S. officials that at this point, the FBI and other intelligence agencies believe that there is that none of the people who have entered the United States are part of any kind of active ISIS plot, ISIS planning, anything like that. So for many officials, this is really kind of the system working the way it is meant to right. The intelligence community received additional information about a group of migrants inside the United States. They investigated; they determined that they likely did not pose a threat. But for other national security for other intelligence and law enforcement officials that we spoke to in the course of reporting this story, the episode is much more alarming. These people say that what the episode really shows is that the United States is deeply vulnerable to the possibility that terror groups could seek to try to sneak across the U.S. southern border by essentially hiding themselves in the surge of migrants seeking asylum in the United States, Becky.",

So it's very much this idea that, you know, you hear this in the German debate all the time, 2015 can't be repeated. This is sort of now something that's in the past, I think.",

But even as that's happened, you know, push backs of non-white non-Christian refugees in the Mediterranean and elsewhere have continued. So this is real double standard there, which I think has kind of revealed the way that you know, the, the position which Orban had in 2015, which is we're perfectly happy to have Christian and white migrants. But a not non- Christian or non-white immigrant has, in effect become EU policy at this point. I think more broadly, what the war in Ukraine has done has really galvanized this sense that Europe needs to be geopolitical. You know, this is the word you hear all the time, although it's not entirely clear what that means. And, and so, I think there has been a, it's increased the sense that Europe is sort of on the defensive, and that's, I think, a trend that has been developing since the euro crisis in 2010. And then, on top of that, the threats to Europe are, I think, increasingly perceived in sort of civilizational terms. And that's, I think, the direction in which the EU seems to be going.",

The researchers evaluated 152 donated brains and found evidence of the disease in more than 60 of them, including in athletes who never played professionally. CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta has been covering this issue for years and has even visited the very brain bank where this work is happening. I know that you've visited this lab, Sanjay, what do you make of the findings? How, how concerning is this? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, one thing I think to point out right away, Becky, is that all the people who donated their brains for this study, you know, this is only something that can be diagnosed at autopsy, everyone who donated their brains, they had significant cause for concern when they were still alive. So this is a pretty specific population of people. I don't want people to think that look, you know, 40 percent of people who play even amateur sports are going to develop this. That's not what this study is saying. But it is saying that CTE known as Chronic traumatic encephalopathy, this, Alzheimer's, like sort of syndrome can start to occur at a pretty young age. That's what the study really showed 17 to 29 years old. And they can have many of the symptoms that we see in patients much older. They could have confusion, memory loss, depression, and even suicidal behavior. In fact, most of the people Becky, who died and whose brains were subsequently donated, died by suicide. The rains were then examined, and they were found to have this CTE, so it can start young. And it's not just professional athletes. That's I think the takeaway here.",

      "sentences": "You said the youngest person who had been diagnosed was with CTE who was just 17, that does seem very young, Sanjay.DR. GUPTA: Yes. You know, and I'll tell you something, Becky, we were working on a documentary about this years ago, I was actually in the lab, when Nathan Stiles, that's the 17-year-olds name. When his brain arrived, his parents wanted his brain to be examined by this lab, to see if he had any evidence of CTE. And I happen to be that that's Nathan, you're looking at there on the screen. But I looked at his brain along with Ann McKee so sad story. But what they saw in his brain, when they really zoomed into some of the specific areas of the brain, were findings that you would normally see in someone who might be in their 70s or 80s, someone with Alzheimer's disease, for example. So it was the first indication that some of these changes can take place very early in life. Now, I will point out that Nathan did not have any symptoms of CTE at that point. So the signs in the brain may greatly predate when someone actually starts to develop any symptoms. And I think that that's it's an opportunity for these researchers to really focus on. If they can prevent those changes in the brain from turning into symptoms, that could be a big, big benefit.",

      "sentences": "Do we know why some people develop CT and others, others don't, Sanjay?DR. GUPTA: You know, decades of research now, Becky, I think that is the question because sometimes it can seem pretty random. I mean, people who did not have really a history of concussions, developed CTE, people who had many blows to the head did not develop the CTE. So it's probably some genetic predisposition that has not yet been identified environmental factors. One thing to keep in mind is people always say, look, how many concussions did you have likelihood of CTE? We know now that just blows to the head even if they didn't cause concussion, what are called sub concussive hits can be associated with CTE. And again, that's another opportunity. Let's lower the number of blows to the head and practices and drills and things like that, that might decrease the overall likelihood of CTE in the future.",
