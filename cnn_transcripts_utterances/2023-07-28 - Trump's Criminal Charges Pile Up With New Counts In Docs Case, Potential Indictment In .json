At the same time, law enforcement officials in Atlanta, as well as here in Washington D.C., they are ramping up security as grand juries in both cities may be on the brink of indicting the former president.Also tonight, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is attempting to clarify what he said in our one-on-one interview here in THE SITUATION ROOM yesterday. Critics alarm that he would not commit to abide by the Israeli Supreme Court if it were to knock down his controversial judicial overall. We're going to tell you what Netanyahu is now saying.

And really what the foreign president is described as doing essentially by prosecutors orchestrating a scheme with his employees from Mar-a-Lago to try to delete surveillance footage after prosecutors had sent a subpoena asking for him to turn over for the Trump Organization to turn over surveillance that showed, you know, the key room, the storage room where these boxes, including classified documents that the government says were being illegally stored there would show all of that, the movement of that, the obstruction that was going on.I'll read you just a part of what prosecutors describe. Again, they describe this one employee who is maintenance -- oversaw the maintenance at Mar-a-Lago, Carlos De Oliveira, they say that they say De Oliveira told Trump employee 4, who we know is identified as Yuscil Taveras, that the boss wanted to delete -- wanted the server deleted. This is the server that contain all the surveillance footage. Trump employee 4 responded that he would not know how to do that, that he did not believe that he would have the right to do that. Again, trying to push back it appears according to prosecutors. De Oliveira then insisted that Trump employee 4 -- to intern for employee 4 that the boss wanted the server deleted and asked, what are we going to do? Wolf, the prosecutor was also described an effort by members of the former presidents circle there -- down there in Mar-a-Lago discussing whether they could trust that De Oliveira would stay on board and whether he was loyal or not. And after they were -- they also share some text messages, some encrypted text messages where they're trying to reassure each other that he is in fact loyal. According to prosecutors, the former president then calls De Oliveira and offers to pay for his legal fees. Again, an effort to try to make sure that he stays on board.",

It's quite compelling, starting with the folks at Mar-a-Lago receiving a draft grand jury subpoena. So they're on notice that they're being investigated. It's after they are on notice that they're being investigated that they start taking these affirmative steps toward having the video footage of Mar-a-Lago deleted.What you have there is knowledge of an investigation, criminal intent in the form of knowing that they have to cover up some tracks in some way, possible inducement from the part of the president, that means trying to persuade people to commit the crime and a conspiracy to do it where they're all in agreement. So you have multiple crimes happening at once. Certainly, the evidence as laid out and presented the first time around was quite compelling and evocative.

So this is the drone that we saw very advanced. It's very fast. It's very nimble. It's about the size of a small boat. It carries hundreds of pounds of explosives. Now, Ukraine doesn't have much of a navy to speak up, doesn't have much of a fleet to speak up. But the people we spoke with who are developing this drone say that they are managing with technology like this to limit the movement of those Russian ships and keep them at bay. Keep them away from Ukraine. Wolf?",

He said this, if Netanyahu, like any elected official does not follow the court's ruling, he will carry out a regime coup d'etat that will change the nature of the regime in Israel, something that will negate his legitimacy to hold office. Barak, is Prime Minister Netanyahu now attempting some damage control, following what he said in the interview with me?",

People were quite shocked as much as we can still be shocked by things that Netanyahu says or does. And I think that, you know, people looked at this interview and said, what we're watching here is exactly what we feared for, you know, so many months since Netanyahu was sworn in, because the fact that the Prime Minister is asked whether he will abide by Supreme Court ruling, and his answer is not a straight yes, is just shocking.And you know, Netanyahu, when he commented about this, after he got criticized, he said that his comments were misrepresented by the Israeli opposition. But as I think, as everybody just saw a minute ago, it's very clear what happened in the interview.",

And you know, Netanyahu, one of the biggest lies that he said that he gave you in this interview, was this preposterous comparison between the -- a U.S. Constitution and the basic law in Israel. If you want to amend the Constitution in the U.S., as you and all of our people watching us now, no, you need to get two-thirds of the Senate and two-thirds of the house and then ratify it in three quarters of all the states, in the United States. OK.In Israel, this is not the case. And he just, you know, created an amendment in what he calls our constitution with a majority of only 64 out of 120 lawmakers. So I think that, you know, this comparison was really silly. And I think when people look ahead at what's in front of us, that I don't think that there's a lot of people here in this country that really believe Netanyahu when he says that he wants a consensus, and that he's willing to negotiate with the opposition. He said the same things few months ago, and we see where it got us. Another interesting point, Wolf, you know, Netanyahu is in a media blitz in the U.S. not in Israel. He gave several interviews in the American media in the last few days. And this is because he's very nervous about the image of what's -- what he's doing in Israel, how it's going to influence his image in America, and how it's going to influence, how the White House sees what's going on. So he's doing some damage control. And you and all of the people watching us need to know that for months and for years, Netanyahu hasn't given any interviews to Israeli media.",
