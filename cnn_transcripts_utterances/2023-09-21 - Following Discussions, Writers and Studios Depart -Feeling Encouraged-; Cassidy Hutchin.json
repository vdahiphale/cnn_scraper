Even if there is an agreement and people go back to work at the studios and go back to work in the writer's rooms, it's going to take some time for each show, for each production to really get up to full speed. A prop house owner I was talking to yesterday said that she was prepared to, you know, work as soon as the studios are ready to ask them for props, ask them for set decorations. But she also told me it's -- even after a deal is reached, he's expecting that the money won't start flowing until maybe three or four months later. So, that gives us a little bit of a sense of just how quickly those productions might turn around.",

Let me start here, when you see these allegations, they came out in a book and they haven't been made since. What is your initially thought? Obviously, Giuliani denying them, but your initial thoughts about hearing from her? You saw her in person testifying. TIM HEAPHY, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR, FORMER LEAD INVESTIGATOR, JANUARY 6TH COMMITTEE:  Yes, new information. I don't believe that she provided this to the Select Committee, and I'm not sure that it is relevant and that it will come in in a criminal trial in the allegations that are facing Rudy Giuliani in Georgia involve very different conduct. Conduct about challenging the election and an alleged bad act, like, you know, personal assault that she describes. I am not clear that that would be deemed relevant, certainly prejudicial. Generally, you know, prosecutors cannot introduce bad act -- general bad act evidence against a defendant absent (ph) a specific reason as to its relevance. I'm not sure here what that might be.",

A police report is not a condition precedent for its admissibility. It's rather a relevance question, right? In any criminal trial, the rules provide that evidence that bears upon the issues at stake in that trial are admissible, but other stuff that the defendant may or may not have done is not admissible.So, here, the prosecutor would need some theory as to how that alleged incident were bear on issues in the case, the intentional effort to prevent -- to disrupt the joint session and prevent the transfer of power. And this, sort of, alleged sexual misconduct, there would need to be a theory as to why that bears upon the broader issues that are stake in the Georgia case.",

And while he did assert some privilege claims in response to questions, essentially doubled down on the, sort of, claim that there was evidence that the election was stolen. He has repeated those allegations publicly. So, for him to, sort of, become a cooperating witness and to provide information that would inculcate (ph) others, maybe difficult given how consistent he's been on the other side.I don't know whether or not that is a calculus. I mean, prosecutors always want to talk to charge defendants and evaluate whether they might have information that would make the pending stronger.
