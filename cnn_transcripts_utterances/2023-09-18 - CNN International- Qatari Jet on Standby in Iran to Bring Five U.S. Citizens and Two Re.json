      "sentences": "FOSTERThe U.S. government had designated all five Americans as being wrongfully detained, a source briefed on details of the matter tells CNN, a Qatari jet is on standby in Iran to bring five U.S. citizens and two relatives to Doha. Do stay with us for the very latest on this, but I'm told I can now speak to Becky Anderson, who's in Doha. I gather the deal has effectively been done, so this is about to happen. BECKY ANDERSON, CNN MANAGING EDITOR, ABU DHABI &amp; ANCHOR (via phone): Max, it certainly seems like this is the beginning of the end of a year's long nightmare for five American citizens wrongly detained by Iran, who are expected to be headed here, to Qatar in the coming hours. According to that source briefed on the details, the Qatari jet, as you rightly said, is currently on the tarmac in Tehran. And this deal to release Siamak Namazi, Emad Shargi and Morad Tahbaz and two others who have not yet been identified, has been mediated by Qatar over the past 18 months. And this deal, Max, sees the unfreezing of $6 billion of Iranian funds. Until now, restricted in accounts in South Korea. Those funds, we are told by a source, have now been successfully transferred to bank accounts here in Qatar. So Qatar effectively then acting as a guarantor in this deal going forward. The deal also includes the release of five Iranians in prison in the United States for sanctions busting. The Americans will be greeted in Doha on the tarmac as we understand it by Brett McGurk, who is the White House, Middle East envoy. Special presidential envoy for hostage affairs Roger Carstens and the U.S. acting Special Envoy for Iran, Abram Paley. Now look, there's going to be relief from all of these hostages, of course. And indeed, their family members here members. Siamak Namazi's mother, as we understand it, is on the plane as well, as is the wife of Morad. But of course, this is going to be a huge relief for all of them, not least Siamak. He has been Iran's longest held American prisoner. His espionage charges there date back to 2015. He has made it very clear that he has felt left behind by successive U.S. administrations. And earlier this year went on a seven-day hunger strike in the notorious Evin prison to protest being abandoned, as he described it, by President Biden. Appealing to the president personally in an unprecedented life interview with CNN from Evin prison to get him freed. So we are in the next hour or so timings still a little bit fluid, Max, but we are expecting to see those prisoners here in Qatar. Being transferred in the first instance to Doha from Tehran, and then if all goes to plan, they will be onwards from here en route to the United States -- Max.",

Because you know, there is a lot of speculation online suggesting this is a hostage payment for the Americans being held in Iran, but it isn't actually America's money. It is Iran's money and they're prisoners.",

We heard just earlier in the show from John Kirby laying out the U.S. views on this. The money it is -- is it paying for the release? That certainly if you stand up and take an objective view, that is what is happening. Iran is moved by financial inducements. This is a regime that is weak, that it is unpopular. The country is going through huge economic hardship because of the sanctions and they seem to turn to many avenues and respond to those financial inducements.And we spoke earlier about their rapprochement with Saudi Arabia and their they've stopped, it appears, from backing the Houthis in Yemen, who were then attacking the United States with Iranian provided cruise missiles. So the financial inducements works with this Iranian leadership right now. I think you just have to read it, the situation and what's happening in that context.",

It's interesting that he was saying that to NBC because it's more about making the Iranians feel, isn't it, that they -- they've got a good deal. But actually huge restrictions on these funds. They can't -- it's the Qataris which who will control it effectively.",

And that will then be examined, analyzed and access to the funds if it's found to have merit.Now, both sides in any negotiation, in any deal, need to walk away from the table, feeling that they've got something. The Iranians are talking about five Iranian prisoners in U.S. jails who will be released and go back to Iran. So the Iranian leadership needs to be able to sell this as a success. So it is not with surprise that they would say this is this is our money and we're getting access to it. But I think for those, you know, for, for critics of this or others would say, look what you're doing maybe is giving Iran money for humanitarian goods, but that will free up that money that they're spending helping people --",

But what we can say is that just last week the U.K., France, Germany said that they would continue their sanctions on Iran. We heard over their failure to uphold the nuclear arms -- the nuclear deal. The nuclear watchdog, the IAEA has inspectors in Iran checking that they hold -- they're held to account on what they say they'll do, criticize the Iranian leadership for blocking 1/3 of their inspectors from access to the country. There's been no shortage of criticism of Iran and its actions. Indeed, additional sanctions for the United States last week on 25members of the IRGC, Iran's, you know, main power body to law enforcement institutions for the head of prisons. And criticism as well of the way that Iran is handling this year long year anniversary of Mahsa Amini's brutal murder.",

And the Qataris are definitely stepping up to that. So, yes, I think we can expect others in the region, particularlySaudi to want to have that role, perhaps with Iran in the future because of their own rapprochement and their closeness to the United States right now that that would be expected. Sorry. But I think a sort of a detailed pertinent to today that we that we've got -- Becky is speaking about here and just to add to what she's saying. This day may not be without a couple of small hurdles. I'm thinking here of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British Iranian national, who was released not so long ago from detention in Iran and freed to travel back to the U.K. And she was arrested there in April 2016. What happened to her at the airport during her carefully structured release? Well, she was held up there unexpectedly for quite a period of time. So it wouldn't be untoward to expect Iran to perhaps have some hiccups and delays on the tarmac and at the airport in in Tehran today.

American citizens, dual Iranian/American citizens.But we do know that there are other Europeans and other dual citizens of Iranian European background, who remain in Iran. So as far as sort of the relationship between Iran, Tehran and the West, including the Europeans, there is still much work to do. And let's be quite clear, you know, things have changed significantly since 2015, when the Obama administration negotiated that deal that the Trump administration then pulled out of in 2018. So while this, hopefully, according to those who are briefed in these negotiations, may provide, they say -- and this is their hopeful, this is what they're hopeful of -- a path potentially to some sort of negotiation down the route which is wider than just this prisoner swap. I think we have to be very clear about where relations and tensions stand between, not just the United States, but European capitals with Tehran at this point.",
