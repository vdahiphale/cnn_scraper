We recognize the historic inequities that persist, particularly impacting some of the lowest wage earners in our community, the voices you just heard from. So, that's why we led with an historic compensation package that we put on the table. We started out at 15 percent cash in hand as well as recurring compensation increase. We're now at a 23 percent recurring compensation increase, in addition to a 3 percent bonus. But look, this is the result of a crescendo of frustration that goes back many, many, many years. This new team has inherited these conditions. We are negotiating and I remain hopeful that we'll be able to have a legitimate conversation that may result in a precedent- setting contract.",

Number one, years of substandard compensation at levels that, quite frankly in a community like Los Angeles where the cost of living, the cost of housing are so high, have been -- have put our workforce, particularly the lowest wage earnings, bus drivers, cafeteria workers, custodial staff, in a position where they cannot live in the communities where they work.Also, allegations that go back a long time regarding some workplace conditions. That is why we continue to investigate every one of those allegations. That is why we have put on the table a very compelling compensation package, which includes not only that 23 percent salary increase, in addition to a 3 percent cash in hand bonus to recognize the effort of this very indispensable workforce group, but also extending dignity and respect, offering even for part-time employees full health care benefits for them and their dependents, their family members at no cost to the employees. This is a compelling package. What we're waiting now is for the union to come back to the table for us to maintain and continue these negotiations.",

She said it was a culture of denial, a culture of we know best, so to speak, and that was part of what was making it resistant to reform over the years.Now there's been some strong language by the leaders here the U.K. The London's Mayor Sadiq Khan has said that the evidence in this report is damning. And the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said that the culture of London's Met Police needs to change. However, this is not the first inquiry into London's Met Police. There have been many over decades with very similar critical conclusions. And so, the question is really whether this will be the turning point for the Met.",

But we really are seeing some pretty significant impacts across the California coast. We're seeing very heavy rain. Some of these rainfall rates, about an inch or two an hour. Also seeing very heavy snow, very high winds and power outages. You can even see some spin right there just offshore. And so, once it starts to pull inland or that low will, then we'll start to see this storm peak along the coast and then start to improve.But that flash flood probability is still there. We have a very high risk of that, moderate across Southern California from Los Angeles to San Diego. And that's where we could see the most significant flooding. So, as we go forward in time, the rain will continue to fall, the snow, and then pulling into the Rockies as well. You can see still raining across the California coast by Wednesday morning. And then it finally starts to wind down where the showers will start to subside a little bit as well as the snow. But the forecast rain and snow accumulation, we could see anywhere from 2 to 4 inches along the coast. Very high snow amounts as well. We could see several feet of snow. You can see, this also spills to the east into the Rockies and in portions of the Plains. So, zooming down on some of the harder hit areas where we could see some very high totals, guys, before this is all said and done.",
