Investigations around former President Trump's assassination attempt continue as more details emerge over security failures. And new polling shows Vice President Kamala Harris is growing favorability just a week after her campaign launch. Begin this hour with more details on the breaking news that we first told you about last hour. The ambulance service in northwest England says eight patients are now being treated for stab injuries. Some have been transferred to a children's hospital. This is happening in the town of Southport. Anna Stewart back with us with some new information. Anna?",

We know of course that there were eight patients taken by ambulance that included a couple of air ambulances, I believe. And this was a major stabbing in a seaside town in the northwest of England called Southport outside of Liverpool. It happened at 10 -- sorry, 11:50 a.m. this morning. That's when reports were first made to police of a stabbing incident. We know that one man has been arrested at this stage. A knife was seized and there is no wider risk to the public at this stage. We do have more information on who was arrested, we're likely going to get that more information if and when they are charged. We have had their response at this stage from the Prime Minister Keir Starmer peel on X has posted to say horrendous and deeply shocking news emerging from Southport. My thoughts are with those affected. I would like to thank the police and emergency services for their swift response. I am being kept updated as the situation develops.

Israel and Hamas are still at war more than nine months later, almost 10 months later. So, Israel from a practical perspective, probably wouldn't really choose to stretch itself even more. And so, as a result of that, as I say, if your glass is half full, this could concentrate minds more, perhaps encourage Israel to do a deal with Hamas that sees the -- as we've been talking over the last few weeks or six weeks ceasefire, release of a number of hostages, release of a certain number of Palestinian prisoners and various other -- various other elements. And then at the same time, that would therefore allow for calm there, that would probably cause calm on the border with Hezbollah, at least Hezbollah would stop firing because Hezbollah started firing on Israel, a day after the Hamas-led terrorist attacks, which is why that has been simmering for all this time, as well. But that would really just be a short-term fix because you're talking about more than 60,000 Israelis who have been displaced from their communities in the north, many villages kibbutzim and towns or ghost towns. Similar picture I should say on the southern border of Lebanon. And they do not want to go back to their homes, even if there is quiet in the knowledge that Hezbollah is just over the other side of the border. Now you'll recall that back in 2006, I think U.N. Security Council resolution 1701 called Freedom Demilitarization, south of the Litani River. Now, depending where you take, it's about 12 to 15 kilometers a swathe of southern Lebanon. And Hezbollah is clearly in breach of that. So, Israel has said in the past, and we've heard it from Yoav Gallant in the past. This was back in December. Yoav Gallant, the defense minister saying if the world doesn't get Hezbollah away from the border, Israel will do it. Now in the short term that might not be possible and in the short term quiet on the border may be the best that anyone can hope for. But longer term, Israel and Israelis especially those who live in North will be demanding that something be done and that Hezbollah be moved back to the Litani River in accordance with a U.N. resolution 1701 because otherwise, how are they going to live insecurity without fear of a harmless style attack from Hezbollah?",

A new warfront should likely mean more displaced people. A major concern for Lebanon, which is already home to well over 1-1/2 million refugees.

And I do hope and pray the current efforts that are being made by many countries to try to deescalate the tensions succeed. You know, I -- we have had a terrible year. A terrible couple of years. And the humanitarian community is stretched to an unbelievable point, further conflict further refugee crisis. I'm not sure we can cope with that any longer. So let's really all pray that an end is put to these conflicts.

CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta has more on what is this promising new development. DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: We're talking about a two-part blood test here to give you an idea of how much amyloid you'd likely have in your brain. It's an amyloid probability score. Now, I want to be clear, this is not an Alzheimer's test, per se, you can't take the blood test and say you either have Alzheimer's or you don't. But it can provide a lot of information for people, especially those who are worried could the memory loss they're experiencing actually be due to Alzheimer's? So specifically, we're again, we're talking about two specific blood tests here. One is called P-Tau 217. That's measuring for tau protein and something known as Beta Amyloid 42. That's another biomarker of Alzheimer's disease. The real question, I think, and part of the reason there's so much enthusiasm is how predictive is it really? And how predictive is it against what is typically out there? And what you find is that the accuracy and determining of memory loss is likely due to Alzheimer's disease with this blood test around 90 percent.

So this morning really just an hour and 45 minutes ago, this went into effect in Iowa and what it does isshorten the amount of time when somebody can get an abortion in the state. Down to about six weeks the law states that after cardiac activity has been detected via ultrasound, you can no longer get an abortion. And for most people, that's about six weeks into pregnancy. There are some narrow exceptions here including for cases of rape and incest if they've been reported to authorities. Also for cases where there are fetal -- fatal fetal abnormalities when the fetus is not expected to survive. Miscarriage care and preserving the life of the person who's pregnant, although abortion advocates note that those are fairly rare exceptions. We know that last year there were about 4200 clinician provided abortions in the state of Iowa. That's according to the Guttmacher Institute, which is a research group that advocates for abortion access. Most of those were for people living in Iowa, but some of them were from people traveling from out of state, including from nearby Nebraska, where there's a 12-week law. Now it's thought folks might be going in the other direction because Iowa's law has become much stricter. This is the fourth state in the U.S. to put into place about a six-week ban in addition to Florida, which was the most recent South Carolina and Georgia. And there are about 14 states that ban abortion almost completely. So, this landscape keeps changing pretty quickly, Becky.",

And so that really shortens the amount of time for decision making.Advocates say they are increasing resources to try to help people to travel out of state. And we know though that looking at other states like South Carolina, for example, which implemented a six-week law in August of 2023 dramatically impacts how many abortions happen within that state. In South Carolina abortions dropped by 71 percent just month to month after their law went into effect. So, we are expecting to see a lot more people travel across state lines from Iowa to access abortion. Illinois already has had a tremendous influx of patients between 2020 and 2023. Tripled the number of patients traveling to that state to seek abortion. So, folks are a bit worried about constraints on the system for states like Illinois, also, Minnesota. We know Planned Parenthood has increased its resources both in Nebraska and Minnesota. So a lot of people will be traveling. But there's also concern that people -- some people won't be able to travel and will have to carry pregnancies to term that they didn't plan.",
