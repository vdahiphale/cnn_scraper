Joe Biden hasn't had that opportunity to appoint as many federal judges.And having that 51, in the Senate, if Raphael Warnock wins, will give Joe Biden an opportunity to have a much easier time to appoint those types of judges that will balance out the Donald Trump judges. We know that some of the appointees for Donald Trump have acted in a way consistent with conservative principles and ideologies and have been less willing to bow to what many pundits believe to be the law. They have been favorable to Donald Trump. We saw that with respect to the federal judge in the Mar-a-Lago case. So this 51st seat in the Senate would be a huge benefit to the Democrats.",

So I think in this last two years, particularly since Democrats don't have control of the House, we're going to see a more emboldened Joe Biden. We're going to see a Joe Biden that understands what the assignment is. And that assignment is going to try to even out the federal bench and he has an opportunity if Warnock wins the election in Georgia to do so and I think be far more aggressive with the respect to the appointment of liberal and liberal-leaning judges.",

So there is a lot at stake in respect to the federal bench. And Democrats have not been always so focused on judicial appointments in a way that we have seen Republicans do over the last couple of decades.

But what Ukrainians think the strategy here is, is that by overwhelming Ukraine's air defense systems and launching a mixture of these older, dummy missiles and then newer missiles that have warheads, there is a greater likelihood of inflicting huge damage on the energy -- the power grid here in Ukraine. In fact the foreign minister said last night they're bracing themselves for a massive Russian attack in the coming days, on the power grid with the intent of trying to knock out power across the country. Here in Kyiv right now, they are at about 70 percent capacity. And the Russian goal is to weaponize winter with these colder temperatures, knock out power to as many people as possible in as many places as possible. So by launching these dummy missiles, it makes it more difficult for the Ukrainians to shoot everything down. Think about their success rate. They launched more than 70 missiles, the Ukrainians shot down more than 50 of them. That still leaves though about 20 hitting their targets. It's just impossible to do all of them down, even with a very accurate and increasingly powerful missile defense systems. But Kim, certainly the fear here is that Russia will continue to try and overwhelm the missile defenses as they target the power grid, just as they've just rebuilt the systems and got them back online. It could be a very difficult period ahead here in Ukraine, which is why they're asking for Patriot missile defense systems from the United States and other missile defense systems as soon as possible, to be able to shoot down more of these things.",

Especially if someone is living at a higher level floor in an older building, where you need the elevator to go up and down, otherwise it is a trudge through darkly, you know very dark stairwells. And obviously with temperatures plummeting it can be very, very arduous for people that are trying to deal with those conditions. But I will say that I am observing just in my first hours here on the ground here, just incredible resilience, when you have these small businesses that are all equipped in many cases with generators. When the lights are, off they fire off the generators and continue to operate. They are still serving, you know, a smaller menu or they're still serving coffee but they're moving forward.
