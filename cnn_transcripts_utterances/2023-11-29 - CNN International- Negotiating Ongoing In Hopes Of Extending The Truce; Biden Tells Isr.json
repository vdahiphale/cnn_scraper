      "sentences": "Hello I'm Max Foster in London and this is CNN Newsroom. Just ahead, the latest developments from the Middle East as negotiators are looking to extend a truce in Gaza between Israel and Hamas. This as more hostages are expected to be released in the coming hours.Then NATO allies say they won't back down on their support for Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression, even as global attention is focused on the Israel-Hamas war. And search operations underway in Japan after a U.S. military aircraft crashed into the sea. What we know next. Well, we are watching two important events unfolding in the Israel- Hamas war today. First is the sixth hostage for prisoner exchange expected to happen in a few hours. Hamas allowed an outside journalist to watch today's hostage release, which included an elderly woman in a wheelchair. So far, things appear to be on course today, with Israel getting a list of hostages that are set to be handed over to the Red Cross. That list does not include a 10-month-old baby, who Israel had hoped to get back in today's exchange. And we're also watching Qatar, where the U.S., Egypt, and Israel are in discussions about extending the six day old truce. If a deal can't be reached, fighting could resume tomorrow morning. Let's go straight to our CNN's Scott McLean. I mean, it's difficult to know what's going on in these negotiations, but what do you think they're considering and what might be the sticking points?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Max. And look, it seems like the parties involved are showing positive signs that this may be extended. And it seems like everyone has a vested interest. You have the U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, saying that he is focused on getting an extension of this truce.Hamas has made clear that it would like to turn this truce into a permanent ceasefire. You also have last night, a member of the Israeli Knesset, a former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, saying that Israel could be open to extending this for a few more days, perhaps even a week in order to get hostages back. He says that the government has signed off on this already until Monday, potentially as long as Monday. After that, the Cabinet would have to meet again to approve a new deal. So it seems like a short extension might be easy, a longer extension, perhaps more complicated. A source familiar says that if today goes well, the expectation is that Hamas will agree to extend this for at least another day. The difficulty, though, is that there are only perhaps two more days left of women and children to actually turn over in Gaza. It is not entirely clear how many civilian women are still held captive, which makes it complicated to calculate the exact numbers. But after the women and children have been handed over, now we're getting into civilian men and soldiers, some of whom we know are female and Hamas will demand a higher price for them. Hamas has said that it's open to a partial deal involving only civilians. It's also open to what it calls a comprehensive deal involving those soldiers as well. But it's demanded that Israel empty its prisons of Palestinian prisoners in order to make that happen. Danny Danon, for his part, has also said that, look, Israel would not agree to a deal to end this war in exchange for all of the hostages back because it thinks that that just allows Hamas to live for one more day. You showed that video, I think, of Hamas handing over the hostages yesterday in the dark, people cheering, people recording on their phone. There are Hamas fighters in that video. There are also fighters from Palestinian Islamic Jihad. And part of what's also complicating all of this, Max, is the fact that a diplomatic source says that per 40, perhaps 50 of these hostages are actually held by groups other than Hamas. So all of this adds a layer of complexity. In fact, Danny Danon called the transfer of hostages within Gaza. He described it quite starkly. He said that it was trading. He also described it as selling and said that this is something that Israel simply has not seen before. Max?",

      "sentences": "Yes, there certainly are. There's members of the Democratic Party, including a few senators who have pushed for a longer term ceasefire in this war between Israel and Hamas. But the focus for key -- for administration officials today is on whether they should extend the current truce, which is now in its sixth day.Now, as you hear from Secretary of State Antony Blinken there, the thinking is that extending the truce would essentially try to get more hostages out and also surge more humanitarian into -- humanitarian aid into Gaza. The CIA Director, Bill Burns, was in the region yesterday. And in Doha, he met with Qatari, Israeli and Egyptian officials where there was a consensus that they could potentially work towards another extension in this truce. The thinking is that if everything goes according to plan today with this hostage release, Hamas could potentially provide another list of hostages that would then be released and could extend the pause for about 24 hours. They -- a source familiar with the discussion says that they believe that there are enough women and children to extend this pause by another two days. But it also highlights just how involved the Biden administration has been in these negotiations. In addition to working towards what is happening with the hostages out, trying to get them out at this moment, they're also setting their sights on what happens after this truce ends. Senior administration officials say that they have encouraged the Israelis that when they resume their fighting to be more surgical, more tactical in their approach to targeting Hamas. The goal there is trying to minimize civilian casualties. One thing officials have also pushed for is trying to avoid these widespread operations in the southern part of Gaza where many people have fled to. The White House believes that they -- Israelis, are listening and that this is something that they continue to press upon them. Of course, another focus for them for the White House today is waiting to hear whether those two American women will be released as part of this hostage group expected to be released a bit later today. The White House has said they are hopeful that the two American women will be part of it, but they have been so far unable to pinpoint exactly when they believe those women will get out and if that could happen today.",

We're now in the 22nd month of this war.They haven't seen a major breakthrough, like with the capture of Kherson. That was a year ago, so 12 months without a major breakthrough. So Stoltenberg, he, you know, went through some evidence. He said, look, maybe we haven't seen a major breakthrough, but they have taken back. He said 50 percent of the territory that Russia originally seized. They have made great progress in the Black Sea, opening up a shipping lane, which has helped with world food security.

We heard from Japan's Coast Guard, quoting the U.S. military, saying that it was an attempted crash landing on the water, saying that the pilot appeared to be in control until the aircraft hit the water. And so, certainly, they say the pilot tried his best until the end. Now, at this point, we are hearing from Okinawa's governor. This is the area of the island where the majority of U.S. troops are stationed in Japan, asking for all Ospreys to be grounded until an investigation has been carried out. Now, this is not being backed up by Japan's government. Tokyo officials saying that at this point, the priority does need to be on saving lives and trying to continue this search and rescue mission. But we have seen in the past -- just the past 18 months, a number of accidents and incidents when it comes to these military aircraft. We saw just a few months ago in Australia, three U.S. Marines were killed when there was an accident during military training there. And just last year, five U.S. Marines were killed in training in California. Just before that, there were also four U.S. service members that lost their lives in a NATO accident in Norway. So this has been a concern for some time, and there is some discussion as to whether or not these aircraft should be grounded while this search and rescue mission is ongoing. But at this point, officials in Tokyo say their priority has to be to try and find the other five that were on board. Six were on board, one killed. We're hearing from Japan's Coast Guard that the information came just before 3:00 p.m. local time. They did immediately send out a patrol ship but also an aircraft which is when they did identify the wreckage in the water. Max?",

They surrounded the refugee camp there. They declared it a closed military area, and of course, the IDF is just saying that this is part of counterterrorism activities. Now, in addition to the two people who died that you mentioned cited by Doctors Without Borders, saying that they died because Israeli vehicles would not allow ambulances to reach the hospital. That's very similar to a case we heard about. We were in Jenin yesterday before the incursion. We spoke to a woman whose son bled to death on their front door because Israeli forces would not allow medics to take him to the hospital. Now, in addition to the two killed last night as a result of dying outside the hospital, two boys, one aged 14, one aged nine were shot dead by Israeli forces in Jenin. Now when we were in Jenin yesterday, the residents told us that since August, there have been more than 30 Israeli military incursions inside that camp itself.
