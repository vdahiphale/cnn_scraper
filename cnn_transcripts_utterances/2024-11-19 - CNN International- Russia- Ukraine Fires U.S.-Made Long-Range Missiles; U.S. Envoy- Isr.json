It's 09:00 a.m. in New York City, it's 06:00 p.m. here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Becky Anderson, you are watching \"Connect the World\". Also coming up in the next two hours, a cease fire in Lebanon is within our grasp, that from the U.S. Envoy Amos Hochstein, who is now in Beirut for talks. And 1000 days of war in Ukraine. The Grim milestone comes as Ukraine fires newly approved and delivered U.S. made longer range missiles into Russia. And then stock market in New York will open about 30 minutes from now, and if the futures markets are any indication that open looks to be weaker back there at 09:30 New York time. We start with Ukraine marking a dark milestone. Today, 1000 days since Russia launched its full-scale invasion. Bringing years of chaos and war, the Ukrainian President telling the European Parliament, 1000 days on, he needs them to push harder than ever for peace, as he expects the North Korean troops in Russia's ranks to multiply tenfold.

And the question for the Ukrainians, number one is, OK, if people are going to be brought around the table sort of by hook or by crook to talk peace, do they want to be in a position of strength? The other thing that's work here, I think, is the Biden Administration, after many, many months of this kind of careful policy of managed escalation, of being careful not to give Ukrainians anything that in the Russian viewpoint would be seen as too provocative crossing that red line. Well, you know that door is now open, and the Americans have given the green light for the use of a system to strike inside of Russian territory. Now, striking inside of Russian territory is something the Ukrainians have already shown that they are capable of doing with their own homegrown capabilities, with, for instance, long distance drones. So, you know, this is a pretty complex picture that it's emerging, but a lot of the discussion about the use of the ATACM system has focused on, as we understand it that they would be designated for use in the Kursk region or along sort of the border with Ukraine, where Ukraine has had an incursion in the past couple of months. Very unexpectedly, that has sort of shifted a little bit of the narrative about Ukraine being entirely on the back foot, which it very much has been in the east of the country, Becky.",

They -- on election night, they were unsure about whether they were going to be able to move forward with a deal broker between Israel and Hezbollah, because of all of the political pressures right of an incoming administration. But we are told that the Israelis signal to Biden officials, including Amos Hochstein there, that they wanted to continue trying to get the cease fire deal with Hezbollah. And so, given that kind of green light from the Israelis, Amos Hochstein was dispatched to Lebanon to try to secure the final, you know, really sticking points of this deal, which, for right now, we are told, is that enforcement mechanism. How do you enforce Hezbollah being pushed back further north into Lebanon from that very key southern border area there? And so that is really kind of where they're at right now. We are told that Donald Trump is not prepared at this point, or is not going to or is not indicating to Biden Administration officials that he is going to throw a wrench into this. In fact, we're told that Trump has indicated to Biden Administration officials that he is willing to allow this to go forward, even if the Israelis behind the scenes are kind of giving mixed signals to Donald Trump's team that perhaps they want to give a cease fire deal to them as a kind of political gift once he enters office. We're told that as of right now, the administration is full steam ahead on trying to broker this deal, and they do believe that one is possible in the very near future.",

As you mentioned before, 17 of those from one family. And I was just looking at video from the latest strike, where we know at least one person was killed. A young girl literally being rushed to hospital on the back of a hand card as somebody is trying to stem the flow of blood from her neck. This is a young girl must have been, perhaps two years old, lying on that rough -- So, it absolutely goes on in Gaza. And any respite that that can be had in Gaza, obviously, will be welcomed by people there. The reality, though, of that war that's going on in Lebanon also biting for the Israelis. They announced today, the IDF announcing that one of their soldiers was killed in southern Lebanon, three other soldiers severely injured, and that came, that announcement has come sort of 12 hours or so following what were a couple of significant it appeared impacts in Israel from by weapons fired by Hezbollah into Israel. There was an intercept over one of the suburbs of Tel Aviv last night that spewed a big fire on the outside of a shopping mall. One person there was badly injured, a couple of others moderately injured. And further north, Hezbollah missile landed in a town there, killing a woman and quite a few other people there, injured dozens of people there, injured and taken to hospital for treatment. So, the war in Lebanon still continues to pace, the IDF claims that it yesterday killed a significant Hezbollah commander in charge of medium range missiles. He said that it fired 300 missiles into Lebanon. But as we both know, and to Israel rather, but as we both know, these Hezbollah commanders are readily replaced by other Hezbollah fighters on the ground. But I think the sort of, if we try to sort of gage where the tempo of talks is around this potential Hezbollah Israel cease fire, you can maybe get a sense of it by the number of strikes and the center of Beirut. Only six strikes by Israeli forces on the center of Beirut since 2006. Three of those have come since the weekend, and one of those particular strikes killed a senior Hezbollah official, not military but political, but nevertheless a senior official. So that tempo of pressure taking the fight into the heart of Beirut. I think you have to look at that in the context of the talks being significant and perhaps indicating that the sides are getting closer, but it's very hard to judge. But absolutely, as you say, the benefit will fall on the people of Gaza if there's a cease fire with Hezbollah as well.",

The judge paused everything last week to give them a week to look at the law and figure out what their options are. From there on, everything else is really up in the air of what's going to happen and how things will proceed. The district attorney's office could say that they don't think there's a legal way forward. Trump's team has said they've already teed up some legal issues here. Trump is in the transition. Should a state judge have anything to influence a future president? Kind of the separation of powers issue in the U.S. also looking at other issues related to immunity, and whether you know that is something that they should continue to litigate while Trump is heading into office as well. So, it will be up to the DAs to say what they think the best course is. They could say they want to proceed. They could say that they don't think there is a way to proceed. Or they could say to the judge, put this on hold for four years until Trump is out of office. But everyone that I've spoken to suggests that there's a range of potential options here. And really it will be in the letter of the words and what they say they want to do. And then ultimately it will be up for the judge to figure out what the next course is. Trump's team has made it clear that they want to stop the sentencing, as you said, scheduled for next week, from happening. They also don't want the judge to issue his ruling on immunity and whether to dismiss the case on those grounds that was due last week too. So, the ball will be back in the judge's court once the DA says what they think the best course of action is. But we do expect this to assuming the DA wants to proceed, to continue to be litigated, but it really is, as you said, unprecedented. We've never been in this position before as a country for these legal questions here and the decisions that are made could then perhaps influence proceedings in the future, if we are ever do find ourselves back in the situation again, Becky.",

With Matt Egan coming up even before the election, the U.S. stock market had been in a Trump bump. How might this bumper market, despite the fact that it's slightly lower today serve as a guardrail to deter him from implementing some of his more radical policies that could be inflationary. Well, this is what I want to discuss with Matt Egan, who joins me to discuss how he might do that. And I guess the big question, these were big promises. They were controversial promises on taxes and tariffs at a time when, of course, the Trump campaign was saying, the U.S. economy is in a mess. It isn't in a mess. It's very robust. The cost of living is painful for many people, and will continue to be so for some time.

And it's been said that Trump doesn't have as many guardrails this time around in the White House, some of those never Trump Republicans are no longer around, and the Supreme Court has granted the president vast new immunities. And yet, some of the analysts that have been talking to they say that there is a guardrail here, right? And it's the stock market, because during his first term in the White House, Trump, he looked at the stock market as kind of a real time barometer of his success. And he would not love to see a market drop that was triggered by some of his own policies. I talked to Isaac Boltansky over at BTIG, and he told me, I don't see Congress or the courts limiting the president's authority. Ultimately, the only entity that has real power over the president's thinking about his agenda is the stock market. So, it's not hard to envision a scenario, Becky, where, say, a Trump policy proposal has been floated around really big tariffs on China or Mexico or another country. And the market goes down, and that could force Trump to sort of moderate some of his stances on tariffs.",

And so, it is really important that Trump picks someone who investors are comfortable with. I mean, this is sort of the quarterback of his economic policy, and this person is going to be looked upon to sell lawmakers, the public, investors, CEOs, on Trump's agenda. And the treasury secretary is also someone who's got to plan out the borrowing that needs to get done to make the president's agenda a reality. And that's especially critical now, because we know the national debt is really high. We know there's a lot of concerns about high deficits and how they could go even higher if Trump gets his 2017 tax cuts fully extended. So, all of those are going to fall to the treasury secretary, also during times of market stress. That's something that the treasury secretary has looked upon to try to reassure investors. Now if we could just touch on what's happening in the market this morning, we see the DOW down about 300 points, not a massive retreat, but a noteworthy one.

It's been a bit, Becky, since we've heard investors really voice concern about that matter, but we've seen stocks take a hit.

Trump was flanked by Elon Musk, Kid Rock, House Speaker Mike Johnson and some of his new cabinet picks, including RFK Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard. As he made his way into the arena, Trump embraced UFC commentator in the world's most famous podcaster, Joe Rogan, who'd endorsed him after Trump appeared on his podcast. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The Director of FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, will speak to lawmakers after a controversy in its ranks in the aftermath of hurricane Milton in Florida, recently. A federal employee responsible for providing relief was accused of skipping homes belonging to Donald Trump supporters. The employee Marn'i Washington has since been fired, and she spoke to CNN claiming that she was following FEMA policy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARN'I WASHINGTON, FIRED FROM FEMA AFTER HURRICANE MILTON CONTROVERSY: Before I was even deployed to Florida, there are accounts of Trump supporters being very passionate about their political stance, and unfortunately, that led to them saying they would either do bodily harm to FEMA workers or they would do threatening, take threatening actions towards FEMA workers, and that was the trend. There are plenty of reports that discuss hostile encounters, is how FEMA describes it, and our method is avoidance. I don't understand why we're hiding there from the American people.

FEMA fired her after this all came to light, saying they put out a statement saying this was a violation of their values and their principles. It would not be tolerated. But having talked to Marn'i Washington, that FEMA supervisor myself, she says she's really being scapegoated right now that she was taking orders from superiors, and at that particular time, they said they should avoid homes that were advertising Trump with things like signs and flags. And so, lawmakers are going to be demanding to know if that is true. And we have already seen Republican lawmakers who are out there publicly saying that this shows a deeper culture problem at FEMA. And I'm really curious to see how Criswell defends herself and the agency. But as you mentioned, Becky, there is a really important context here, and that is the threats that FEMA workers have been receiving. If you remember, after hurricane Helene hit in September, Donald Trump was out on the campaign trail really quickly, and he was spreading a lot of these at the time, really baseless rumors about FEMA. A lot of different rumors, but one of them was that the agency was not helping Republican victims. And after that, what we started to see were incidents where FEMA workers were being harassed in and threatened in these hardest hit areas. And FEMA officials started to quietly raise red flags, saying that their teams were feeling unsafe. And it was just after that that Marn'i Washington says she received guidance from her superiors and then sent it to her team, a very small team, just about 11 people in one particular part of Florida, but she sent that note saying, today, you should be avoiding homes that advertise Trump. She says it was not political. It was not about Trump. It was about the harassment that they were dealing with and facing from these supporters. She told me, Becky, that she would do it again, but now what we're seeing is the state of Florida suing her, and the FEMA Administrator claiming that this is a conspiracy top to bottom in this agency. That's what we're hearing a lot of Republicans say. So that's what the FEMA administrator is really going to have to address today. Was this a top-down conspiracy? Where did this all come from?",
