And voters themselves are enthusiastic when they show up, telling me that they are passionate about the people that they are choosing to vote for. And they especially enjoy the idea that North Carolina may have a deciding factor in the national vote come November when it comes to the president. But they're also looking again at those down ballot races. Now, in terms of the issues, I can say, especially this afternoon, I've had many voters talk to me about abortion and immigration, adding in education and the economy here as well. I spoke with a Biden voter and a Trump voter about why they made the decision they did with their ballot today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Where the intelligence community and the FBI have to go out and look at what attempts were there made to interfere or influence U.S. politics around an election.When you think about the election cycles in a midterm election vice presidential year, you're always going to have more activity in a presidential year because the stakes are much larger. There is more attention to these races than those midterm congressional races. My sense, though, is that the playbook that has been established since 2016 has been copied. Just like in 2020, we saw the Iranians try to imitate the Proud Boys and intimidate voters. That is now, I think, going to be pretty much the standard operating procedure for most state security services that want to interfere in U.S. elections. But I think that the good news is today is just -- it's kind of like what I said in 2020, where it's just another Tuesday on the Internet. And there hasn't been a whole lot of activity that I think would be concerning in terms of threats against the election.",

We've heard some people wanted to vote in person because they wanted to make sure that they felt like their vote was being counted. But a lot of people have voted by mail already or dropping off their ballot.We've seen people coming in, dropping off their ballot as well. That's been going on for a few weeks here as well. So it is different. You don't see as many. But they did set up these tents out here so that people could vote out here if there was an overflow as the day goes on. But you're right, that Senate race is really what a lot of people are focusing on here. We have seen Adam Schiff has raised the most money. His war chest, as far as the amount of money he has, is larger than everyone else. And what he's been doing is really targeting Republican Steve Garvey, who has not spent any money on ads. Meanwhile, in this election, there has been more than $71 million spent on advertising for just this. And since February, that number is larger than even how much has been spent on ads in the presidential election. So it's very consequential here. But we are seeing Schiff targeting Garvey because he's thinking it would be better odds for him to be going up against a Republican in November instead of another one of the Democrats, since they would have to battle for basically the same voting block. So what he's been doing is raising his profile and it seems to be working. We have seen the numbers rising for Garvey in this election. The idea is California, the Democrats here, outnumber Republicans two to one. So he's thinking if he's up against a Republican, it'll make it more likely that he will win in November here. But obviously very consequential as they're going after this one seat, this one Senate seat, very important Senate seat here in California -- Brianna.",
