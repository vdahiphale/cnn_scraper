It's kind of a delicate balance.But you know, that's something that I'm hearing from Republicans here in South Carolina. It's also kind of confusing because when she's doing these things, like saying the cause of the Civil War wasn't necessarily slavery and then walking it back, the Texas border issue can Texas secede, that's another one we've seen coming up lately, it kind of into -- it gives an in message of not really knowing where she stands.

And there's new reporting this morning that President Biden is already approving further action.Let's get over to the Pentagon. CNN's Natasha Bertrand is standing by for us. Let's start there.

And so, they have not given us a good sense of where that action is going to be next, or even if it's going to be some kind of kinetic action or non-kinetic action.For example, cyberattack, which we had been told was a possibility as a response to the attack that killed three U.S. service members in Jordan last month. But one thing that we have been told is that it is extremely unlikely that the administration is going to attack inside Iran itself. The administration has said repeatedly that they do not want to go to war with Iran. They're trying to de-escalate tensions in the region rather than escalate them. However, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan did say just yesterday that that response that we saw on Friday night with strikes in Iraq and Syria, that is only the first step of the response to common.
