I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.A building block witness digital forensic expert, Douglas Daus, is on the stand right now currently being cross-examined by the former president's lawyers, Trump's lawyers just eliciting an important fact from the witness. He says that Michael Cohen had signal, that is the encrypted messaging app on his phone, saying that the jury needs to know that it is difficult to recover messages sent using signal. The defense trying to make an implication here that there may be missing pieces of the story that are potentially helpful for the former president of the United States. And, Elie, what do you make of this strategy and how critical is that piece of audio that we heard yesterday, Michael Cohen talking to Trump about the payment. Trump saying, oh, can we pay with cash, and Cohen saying, no, no, no, no, no? I mean, I remember when that came out. It was in 2018. It was just a bombshell piece of audio.",

Tapes, no pun intended, trump all. I mean, it matters what a witness says in the box, but, boy, tapes are always going to reign supreme. And that recording really kind of cuts both ways, as I said before. On the one hand -- and, by the way, they're talking about the McDougal payments, not the Stormy Daniels payments, but it's right around that time. On the one hand, prosecutors will like this tape because it absolutely shows Donald Trump knew that they were paying off Karen McDougal and was fine with it, wanted it to happen, 150, ends up, AMI pays her off, but Trump and Cohen make the later payment to Stormy Daniels. But the defense is going to argue, first of all, why the heck is Michael Cohen a lawyer secretly recording his own client? Ask any defense lawyer -- I guess we don't really have a -- but ask any defense lawyer, have you ever secretly recorded your client? They will look at you like you're crazy.

So, then they're asking about, as an expert, well isn't it odd that that file was still on there and that there was a piece of it missing? Now, doubts at one point just a moment ago, he said that if there would have been metadata that would have shown if this recording had been edited or modified. Now, defense attorneys did not like that, but there's an update. I am told the defense attorneys asking Daus about another sync of the phone in October 2020.
