Republicans huddling behind closed doors as we speak. That's when we're going to get the best and first insights into whether or not lawmakers who had concerns with this bill are starting to get behind it.Some of the changes that were made last night were made to try to get support from conservatives. Some of the changes made last night were meant to get support from some midwestern Republicans. The first change that they made is speeding up when work requirements would go into effect for some social safety net programs. The other big change they made is they are not going to repeal some of the biofuel tax credits that were included in this legislation. That was a deep concern for some Iowa Republicans who were arguing that they may not back this proposal if those were included. These changes came, Sara, after leadership for days has been arguing that the negotiations on this bill were closed, that they were not going to open them back up, that this was it, take it or leave it. That changed in the 11th hour last night as they realized that they just weren't going to have the support that they needed.

So, what happens if the United States does default on its debt? First, it no longer would have enough money to pay all of its bills in full and on time, which means the government would likely have to delay payments or default on some of its commitments. To us regular folks, that could mean things like delays in paying Social Security payments, veterans benefits and federal employees' salaries. A default would also have a major impact on the U.S. economy and the global financial markets. It would also raise the cost to borrow, making it more difficult for businesses and even average Americans to borrow money. Even just the threat of a default that happened back in 2011 caused the only credit rating downgrade in our nation's history. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said that she believes the so- called extraordinary measures her department has taken should allow the government to pay its obligations until early June. According to three different analyses, early June is a key timeframe because tax receipts are less than expected so far this season. John.",

Jean Carroll's account of what happened or Donald Trump's denial of what happened. And to that end, if you have a person who's there and present, the jury will see that, first of all, as a sign of respect, I think juries feel like it's disrespectful for somebody not to show. E. Jean Carroll will take the stand. She will testify live. She will be subject to live cross-examination. In contrast, the jury's probably only going to see clips of Donald Trump's depositions.

Jean Carroll's lawyers are going to say, she told them 25, 30 years ago when this happened. Was she just making it up then. It's going to go against this charge that she just recently made this up. And also the judge -- and I think sort of controversially, legally, is allowing in evidence of witnesses, who I think may testify today, who claim that Donald Trump assaulted them, sexually assaulted them, on other occasions years apart from the Carroll allegation, which the plaintiff will argue goes to sort of his M.O.

And they're going to say, that means Donald Trump can't defend himself because if she pinpointed a day, who knows, maybe Trump was out of town that a day, maybe he has an alibi witness. They're going to claim E. Jean Carroll has bad motivations here. They're going to argue that she's been supported and spurred on by political opponents of Donald Trump.

That includes the deployment of a U.S. nuclear ballistic submarine. Officials say this will be a temporary move, but it is significant is that it hasn't happened since the 1980s. Additionally, this agreement will also set up a nuclear consultative group so that the two countries can discuss and plan for nuclear contingencies.

Cholera and measles are endemic in Sudan. And in the case of cholera, it gets a grip on a population that is vulnerable, exhausted, short of food and, above all, clean water.
