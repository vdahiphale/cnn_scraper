      "sentences": "It's a great point. Let's bring in to talk about that and a lot more, Clarissa Ward joins us live again this morning in Kyiv, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor, and retired Major General James \"Spider\" Marks. And General, let me just begin with you where Kaitlan left off, and that is on new START, the agreement, right, between the United States, Russia, et cetera, that was supposed to expire in 2026, the fact that Russia is saying now it will not go along anymore with any inspections on a full withdrawal, but the significance of that and the fact that Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, said it is deeply unfortunate and irresponsible, but also, I should note, Spider, said the U.S. will talk to Russia about this at any point regardless of what's happening on the world stage with Russia and Ukraine. That is how critical the U.S. believes this is.MAJ. GEN. JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Absolutely critical. Look, the only way that the nuclear threat is going to cool down in any way is if you look at past history where the United States and formerly the Soviet Union agreed to have their SALT talks, to have the START talks, and then to continue with the new START talks that we see right now. That competition has been in place for over four to five decades, and it must be addressed. Look, one nuclear weapon alone is sufficient to give us all concern, right? What we're talking about is Russia has in excess of 5,000 nuclear weapons. The United States on this graphic right here has about 5,000 as well. China, we need to keep in mind, is increasing their nuclear stockpile. So the discussion about nukes has to take place very broadly. It needs to be we serious, and it needs to be isolated and not tied to any other conflicts or challenges that exist, i.e., the problem in Ukraine is that Russia had this war of conquest and they are not giving any indication that they are going to leave. That needs to be addressed, but separately from the discussion in terms of strategic nuclear drawdown. That must take place. SARA SIDNER, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Major General, I can't help but ask this, because it's been annoying me. There is talk of giving F-16s to the Ukrainians from the United States. How long does it take to train for those? Like, can you give us some sense of how long it would take if those actually ended up in the country for their air force, their version of the air force, to train and to be competent on them?",

It's fighting that aircraft effectively. This a year-long, minimal year-long type of training environment. But what you want -- look, the Ukrainian air force has some competency is in a cockpit like that. So you could get them up to the ability to fly the ting, but then you have to put them through some training so that they can fight it. So that's a distinction with a difference.",

How do you think his remarks are impacted by the reality that the secretary of state is very concerned about China possibly supplying lethal aid to Russia, and now Russia this morning saying it won't comply with new START inspections?BILL TAYLOR, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE:  So, Poppy, it just demonstrates the problems that we have with the Russians. The Russians have not been cooperative about anything. Indeed, they have been clearly responsible for this invasion. There is no reason -- there was no reason for the Russians to invade. It was totally unprovoked. And so they have now indicated that they are not going to cooperate on new START. As Spider Marks says, this is a problem that can be addressed. We tried to address it, the Americans tried to address it with the Russians, and they pulled out of the conversation. They would not engage in this kind of conversation. So it's clearly the Russians' issue. Back on the issue about the F- 16s, just one thing on that, that's a long-term, as Spider Marks just indicated, that's going to take a year. There are two issues here. One is how to enable the Ukrainians to win on the battlefield right now in the next couple of months, and that won't be with F-16s. That will be with the kinds of weapons that are already there and that will include some of the European tanks, the Leopards. That's the immediate fight which they can win. The longer-term fight is where the F-16s and other weapons come in. That's where Ukraine needs to be able to deter and defend against another Russian attack. So there are two different timeframes here. F-16s are in the longer-term timeframe.",

Everything from long-range artillery to anti-aircraft systems to HIMARS and tanks, and who knows, perhaps they will eventually get the planes. as Ambassador Taylor said may not need them right now, but.But the most important thing is that the Ukrainians need the ammunition to go with the weapons systems that they have right now. This is the most important and crucial thing that is sort of not flying under the radar because the Europeans and NATO are trying to address this. But the production capacity in NATO is not as fast as they would like right now. They need shells and ammunitions for all the systems that they have, and that's for the current battle underway. Having said that, we do not and nor have these experts yet seen a sort of special evidence of any kind of new and different so-called Russian spring offensive. It just hasn't materialized yet.",

That's what happened at the end of the Afghan occupation in 1989. It was the parents who came out and said enough already. Our children are, are dying for nothing. So I think that's really important. COLLINS:  Yes, trying to keep popular opinion. You talked about giving soldiers vacation days, talking about those two weeks once a year. He has used these speeches to, a, announce the special military operation, as he called it, to announce the conscription.

What I found interesting was that he addressed sort of obliquely the problems with the Russian military, saying that in the next five years -- how about right now -- we have got to figure out how to get our military better than it is, essentially, he was saying. We have to modernize. We have to do all these things that he was saying, Clearly knowing, especially through the Russian military bloggers on the ground, knowing that there has been a huge amount of criticism of the ministry of defense and the Russian military operation. A huge amount of criticism not about the war, but about the way it's being prosecute by the Russians. So he had to do that.And then, of course, he did fling a few salvos at the utter corruption that we've seen, talking about people in their yachts and fleeing and having a good time with all their, quote-unquote, ill-gotten gains abroad.",

And Russia has been caught off from the international -- a lot of the international financial system, and they are also having problems getting spare parts, getting all the high-tech that they need.That's why the west is legitimately worried about any move by China, whose foreign minister is going there today, is probably there, to send any kind of lethal weaponry. I am told that as yet they have seen no evidence that that has started. But the west is really, the E.U. and the United States, really trying to convince China that it would not be in anybody's best interests. And I think President Biden's trip to Kyiv was a monument of courage and timeliness, and not just a symbol, but an absolute declaration that we, as leaders of the free world, are here to support you in your fight.

And you know, some of that might sound awkward to people internationally. But there are a lot of folks here in Russia actually believe that and I think it's important for our viewers to understand that we've actually spoken to top Russian pollsters here.And he said 80 percent of the people in Russia support Vladimir Putin and a large part of the people also, at least, are not negative to the special military operation, that obviously meaning the war in Ukraine. So, certainly, you know, some of the things that we hear from Vladimir Putin, a lot of folks are buying them here in Russia.
