We spoke with the sheriff here are short while ago, who confirmed that the latest death toll is now seven people, including four children. Two of those victims, two and five years old and this is what so many people here endured last night.This is a neighborhood that essentially took a direct hit. There is a family of five was inside this home as the tornado approached this area and I just spoke with one of the people in the family who, they were inside and is, everything the pressure started dropping in and they could feel the intensity of the storm and the warnings getting louder. They ran this way, Fredricka and inside this storage building just behind their property, there is a cinderblock storm shelter that they had built and that is where they rode out the storm, but they could just feel the intensity of the pressure dropping, the storm ripping through here. And the gentleman we spoke with said, you know, if they had been inside this home when the storm actually made a direct hit, they do not feel like they would have survived. You can see the damage inflicted through here, all the windows blown out, the inside of the homes, just an absolute mess. Terrifying moments here that so many people in this neighborhood have endured. And this is a storm, Fredricka that was on the ground for quite some time and the width of the damage is also rather intense as well. But this storm damage also caused a gas station area, a service station walls' to collapse. People were trapped in there, had to be rescued. There was a marina at a nearby lake that was devastated as well. So the intensity of the storm which happened in the darkness of night, it was almost eleven o'clock at night when the tornado ripped through here, just added absolutely terrifying moments because it is impossible to see where exactly the storm is coming from and to kind of get your bearings in those terrifying moments, but this is what people here near the Valley View area of Texas are left to clean up this afternoon -- Fredricka.",

This was near Wichita Falls, Northern Texas. I mean, classic textbook tornadoes that came out of these super cells.This is where Ed just was. They are north of Dallas where those tornadoes really kind of ripped through another long stretch from Oklahoma into Northern Arkansas where we know there is also a lot of damage, a lot of surveys going on today to figure out exactly how strong these tornadoes were. At least 25 reported tornadoes right now. Here is the latest watch, you can see it includes parts of Kentucky and Tennessee, including Nashville and Louisville. This goes until three o'clock Central Time and then all of that yellow, those are the severe under storm watches that go through the afternoon and evening that will bring that risk of damaging winds and even some isolated tornadoes. When you see this line, kind of organized and bending like that, that is when you get a push of damaging winds. We are talking winds up to 70 miles per hour. All of these yellow boxes are warnings for that severe thunderstorm warnings. Maybe even have additional tornado warnings because you can still get the brief spin up in a line like this that we have to watch out for as we go through the day today. So here is the risk. You see that orange enhanced risk from Louisville to Nashville over towards Little Rock. It is a level three out of five again, for the risk of damaging winds, hail to the size of ping pong balls and a couple of tornadoes. Then it shifts to the East Coast tomorrow. Look at all the massive cities in this risk in the yellow from DC to Richmond, Charlotte, even down to Atlanta as the storm continues to progress eastward. It could also come with some heavy rain, flash flood watches in effect for Missouri into Tennessee. So, here is a look at how this plays out. You could see the line of storms continues to push south through Kentucky and Tennessee as we go through the day today, that is the damaging wind threat. It plows into the deep south, Atlanta wakes up to some storms in the morning and then the storms reignite with daytime heat and humidity again up and down the East Coast. It could have come with some heavy rain for parts of Tennessee. I mean, two to four inches of rain. That is bringing us that flood threat that is a moderate. So we will have to keep an eye out for that and it is coming in what has been a crazy, busy last couple of months, more than 900 reported tornadoes average would have been 700.",

Nearly 700 people are feared dead according to a United Nations official.More than a thousand people have already been displaced from their homes. The area continues to pose an extreme risk as large rocks and soil continued to fall from a nearby hill. Residents are still working to remove the bodies trapped under the debris and rubble. And Hamas is claiming responsibility for an early morning rocket attack on Tel Aviv in Central Israel. These are the first rockets fired from Gaza at Tel Aviv since January. Israel Defense Forces say eight rockets were fired from Rafah in Southern Gaza, and that a number of projectiles were intercepted. Rafah has been the focus of Israeli military operations in recent weeks, and Israel has threatened an all-out assault if hostages being held in Gaza are not returned. Also a short time ago, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the latest demand from Hamas to end the war in Gaza in exchange for the release of hostages. Talks involving the two sides are expected to resume this week. I want to bring in now Colonel Cedric Leighton. He is a CNN military analysts and retired US Air Force colonel. Great to see you. So it appears those rockets didn't do any damage, and most of them were intercepted. But the IDF says they were launched from Rafah. So what is the significance of that? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, good afternoon, Fred. It is great to be with you. There are several big factors here, but the very fact that Hamas were able -- this group was able to launch these rockets from Rafah indicates clearly that Rafah is still an area that is going to be used by them for this kind of activity. I think they basically pooled their resources there. It is one of the few areas that the Israelis haven't completely occupied within Gaza, and that of course, lends a degree of significance to the plans that the Israelis have to take over as much of Rafah as they possibly can, basically to clean it up. And it will probably give you impetus to the Israeli efforts to do.",

There were several people in the latest wars in the Middle East, especially in Iraq and even in Afghanistan, who either gave their lives or were wounded. And it really shows that the segment of the US population, about one percent or so that serves making ordinant sacrifices in order to preserve the freedoms that we have. So Memorial Day has several meanings for me, but most important, it is one when I remember some of my friends and colleagues who gave their lives in the service of our country. I come from a long line of military people that go back all the way to the revolution, and it is certainly a fitting tribute for all of those who served, but particularly for those who served and gave the ultimate sacrifice.",

He bogeyed three consecutive holes, then he withdrew, and by the next day, we learned that he had taken his own life. This is some of the statement that his mom and dad released saying: \"We've spent the last 24 hours trying to come to terms with the fact that our son is gone. It is surreal that we not only have to admit it to ourselves, but we also have to acknowledge it to the world. It's a nightmare. Life wasn't always easy for Grayson and although he took his own life, we know he rests peacefully now.\" They concluded the statement by saying, \"Be kind to one another.\" If that becomes his legacy, then we could ask for nothing else. He was a player who was well-known to have struggled with anxiety, depression, alcohol abuse, but it did seem as though he turned things around this year. He was successful. He won on the PGA Tour back in January in Hawaii. He just played the Masters Tournament for the first time and make the cut and now he is gone. A lot of people are really struggling to wrap their heads around it.",

This is the final round happening in Dallas right now.Some of the players are wearing commemorative ribbons with black and red colors.
