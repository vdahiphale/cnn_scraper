There are 1.4 million backlog right now of last year's tax returns that still need to be done. If you tried to call the IRS last tax season, you didn't get through. They've hired about 5,000 new customer service agents. They need to hire IT people. They need to modernize the IRS.There will be 52,000 IRS agents - employees, actually, retiring over the next five years. They need to replace those. Some of this 87,000 will go to that. We're talking about people who answer phones. It also takes four to five years, did you know, to train an IRS agent to do - be able to do high level tax rushes. And so far the superrich are skating by. The IRS can't audit all the super-rich people who are under reporting their income to the tunes of hundreds of billions of dollars a year.

Now, distilled water is the most pure. It's going to have no inorganic or organic minerals or active organisms. Sterile water, you still have some minerals but you're getting rid of any organisms. So, either of those are good options.You can also boil water for about a minute or a couple of minutes and then let it cool and that water would be (INAUDIBLE) and these are the devices (INAUDIBLE) we're talking about or the things we're talking about. Things like humidifiers. So many parents use these. So many people use these, CPAP machines for sleep apnea, neti pots. Now, I've never used this, but a lot of people do and swear by them. And then contacts, which all of us wear. You don't want to rinse your contacts with, again, tap water. So, obviously, either the solution you can buy or one of these other options that we mentioned. So, food for thought this morning.",
