She fought tooth and nail not to even be here today. She fought that subpoena. A court disagreed with her and made her testify. I think she's trying to get in and out with doing as little damage as possible to her brothers and her father, while maintaining sort of this air of really ignorance with respect to what was going on with the financials. I would note her tack here is not and antagonistic to her brothers, which Don Jr. and Eric sort of went the, well, I just listened to the accountants route.

However, as Kara noted today, she -- her purpose is one of a witness to try to sort of give insight as to the state of mind of her brothers, her father. Also, with respect to damages, Kara noted the interest rates on those loans in terms of shopping them around. Part of this -- part of the trial is to determine damages. And part of the theory of damages is that, even though the banks got repaid, they could have charged actually higher interest rates had they known that the net worth was in fact lower towards a more realistic valuation of the actual assets.

Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  One, Gaza cannot be can continue to be run by Hamas. It's also clear that Israel cannot occupy Gaza. Now, the reality is that there may be a need for some transition period at the end of the conflict, but it is imperative that the Palestinian people be central to governance in Gaza and in the West Bank as well and that, again, we don't see a reoccupation.

We can't go back in time to before October 7. That's not tenable. Hamas is a brutal terrorist organization and cannot be allowed to continue. It has to be dismantled by Israel. But we also know that there's no going back to before 2005, the last time Israeli troops occupied Gaza in a significant way. That is not tenable. That did not work. It did not work for decades.
