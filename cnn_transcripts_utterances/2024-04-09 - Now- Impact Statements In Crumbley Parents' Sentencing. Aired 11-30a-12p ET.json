      "sentences": "Now, we still want that responsibility, even though it's not very clear what it all entails. But how can we accept that responsibility, and not act responsibly towards that time? It doesn't add up.A child, even if he is in the losing child, deserves the same amount of love, compassion, and compare that any other child gets. A child deserves someone who is confident enough to lead by example. Because let's face it, it wasn't that child's choice to come into this world. You made them. And it's your responsibility to teach them how to live. It's your responsibility to give this -- to set a good example. This is plain and simple, just like that is in German. And the sooner we can figure out -- figure that out, the better we all will be. Being a parent is hard work. But if it's done correctly, it can be the most rewarding work you've ever do. There is no one that can tell you how to do it because each child is so precious and unique. I mean, there's no other one like them in the entire world. And that says a lot. So, cherish your ones always and never give them up. Never give up on that child. The results of doing so can be catastrophic and can affect the lives of so many other people. Well, I asked you all to go home today and hug your kids and make sure they know you are there for them. And make sure that they are all right. It's so crucial for the whole of our society. Thank you. CHERYL MATTHEWS. JUDGE: Thank you, Mr. Shilling. Reina, right? REINA ST. JULIANA, SISTER OF SHOOTING VICTIM HANA ST. JULIANA: Yes.",

      "sentences": "Reina St. Juliana.ST. JULIANA: Our 10-year-old little brother had to learn how to write a eulogy for a sister before he even learned how to write essays. November 30, 2021, all our parents did was send us off to school. Yet the next time they see Hana is to recognize her lifeless body in the medical examiner's office. I met up with Hana and a friend during school that day. When we split ways to go back to class, I just look back and smile. I didn't say goodbye. I never got to say goodbye. I never got to remind her that I love her, that she's my everything. The person I want to walk through life with side by side. I thought her feature was given. Of course, she played her first high school basketball game that night. Get ready for all the other school dances, have her JV and varsity season for all the sports she played, get her driver's license, player of Lacrosse season, have her first date, prom, graduation. She never got a chance for any of that. She didn't even get her 15, 16, 17 or 18th birthday. These are only some of the high school experiences she never got to have. But it is absolutely nothing compared to the rest of everything she had going for her future. That list is eternal. Hana's life only started to begin. 12:51 p.m., November 30, 2021, that was a moment I became aware of the fragility of our mortality. Hana who was healthy -- Hana who was only 14 shot four times. 12.5 percent of the bullets shot that day were at her. She took her last breath and her own full of blood in a school she hadn't even been in for three months. Alone for seven months -- seven minutes while police passed by her, bleeding out as a security guard failed to put a tourniquet on her, dying as EMS took more than 10 minutes after the shooter had been detained to even give aid to her. Our Japanese grandma would often worry about anything bad happening to us because she knew how dangerous it was here compared to Japan. She told me one FaceTime that Hana responded to laugh saying don't worry, I'm a fast runner. I'll outrun them. It wasn't possible for Hana to outrun the bullets bought by you, Jennifer Crumbley, which were fired by the nine-millimeter SIG Sauer that you, James, gifted to your son. Both used to murder Hana, Justin, Tate, and Madisyn. The fact is, no matter what you try to make yourself believe, Jennifer, you did fail as a parent, both of you. To love and to be loved, that is the human experience. It was up to you guys to show your son that. Instead of getting quality time and compassion, you give your son a gun. A gun you know causes extraordinary damage. There's a reason your kid didn't use the other two firearms or the .22 ammunition you own. I believe your actions cannot even be confined into the word failure. Your mistakes created our everlasting nightmare. So yes, you are still a danger to society because even after serving two years, you have yet to admit to your wrongdoings. And we know that when we've not learned from our mistakes, we repeat history. [11:35:08] You call yourself a victim. The difference between you and Hana, Justin, Tate, and Madisyn, you and my family, you and all the students there that day, is that we didn't have a hand in causing this. You caused the most cruel thing I could ever imagine. You guys made loving Hana so painful. That is not a narrative. That is reality. For that, unless you have a time machine or the ability to stop time, there is no existing punishment or rehabilitation that will ever be enough because there is no way that the one life I have, I now have to live without Hana, my little sister, my best friend, my other half. To me, that makes a maximum sentence being 15 years too short. Hana didn't even have 15 years to live. Jennifer, you say that even after knowing everything you know now, you wouldn't do anything different. I cannot fathom that. I would do anything to hear her footsteps coming up the stairs. You don't have to roll your eyes. It's on video that she said that. It's not having an empty seat at the dining table to have her come into my room and ask which clothes to order, to see her napping on the couch, to laugh and share a look when we accidentally say the same thing at the same time. There's not a day that goes by that I wish I hadn't run out of that building. If I knew what I know now, I would do everything differently in a heartbeat. I hope time makes you think differently. One day, I hope you would have chosen to care for your son, teach him how to love and to be loved that you would not choose to buy the bullets that entered children's bodies. But you would not choose to omit relevant important information to the Counselor Shawn Hopkins and Dean of Students Nicholas Ejak that could help their unconfident brains and one shared brain cells to decide to act and search the backpack. That you wouldn't still choose to hide from accountability when you're the reason we had to hide for our lives. That you would choose to save Hana, Justin, Tate, and Madisyn. Like my mother said, both of you should implore that even on your worst days, it's the tomorrow Hana doesn't get but the tomorrow she wanted to live so badly that tomorrow that she should have. I can never do Hana justice when talking about her. She's all I want to talk about and yes, I will need a lifetime and still wouldn't have the right words to capture incandescence, humor, thoughtfulness, kindness, or loyalty. She's always there for you. Helping without a second thought. She's always sharing whether it's her smile, her food, her clothes, her crafts, her joy. She's funny. It's a given she brings people together. Whether it's her contagious laughter or sarcastic wit, you will be laughing right along with her. She's noticing the small things, new shoes, new haircut, cute jewelry. But even more importantly, she makes you feel seen. She's extremely spirited. Her energy is unmatched on or off the court. She dresses up every holiday, every spirit day, the first one to put up Christmas lights, or our lights for that matter. Not even realizing she was a light for so many others. She's the one who would not only playfully roll her eyes and smile when I would say I'm taller than her as I look up to her. Not only did I look up to her physically because yes, she was taller, but as a whole, as a human being. She isn't perfect, but she's Hana. And to me, that's as close as you can get. I can't convey what losing has done to me. I've missed her with every breath I take. I think going forward without her is something I'll never be able to fully navigate. I believe the word sad is inappropriate to use because it does nothing to capture the hurt or the way my soul shattered. I didn't know. I've never felt every atom of my body igniting from anger until Hana's murder. I didn't know what it was like to want to stop waking up in the morning until she wasn't here. I've never known pain that is forever until seeing Hana in a casket. I didn't know it was possible to feel so isolated even when you're surrounded by people. I don't know how it feels not knowing yourself at all. I have no idea who I am without Hana. She's my happy. She's my home. I look for Hana and everyone I meet every place I go, and it's exhausting when I'm met with disappointment every time. But it's the world. It's all the people she would have met. I agree with them too. To have that chance of Hana being in your life taken away from you is a tragedy in and of itself. She's more -- she's more of a person than us to combine times a trillion could ever even hope to be. But when the day comes that you reenter society in 13 years, I hope you live more like Hana. I hope you live every moment to the fullest like Hana. I hope you live every day like Hana, and I hope you love unconditionally like Hana. That's it.",

Jean Casarez is with us who's been covering this from the very beginning.I got to tell you how emotional and sad and heartbreaking it is to hear these family members speak about their loved ones the way they have, asking that these parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley be given the maximum sentence, which is what up to 15 years in prison.",

      "sentences": "That is correct. And the judge has to take into consideration these words from these victim impact statements. They are pivotal moments in this court, and the judge will look at it for consideration.The way Madisyn Baldwin, the very first victim impact statement her mother gave it was a timeline. And it was a timeline of that morning and went --what she was doing and what Jennifer and James Crumbley were doing at the same time. And I think it set the stage for the emotion, the presence, and those that follow. Craig Shillings, the father, really gave a moment for parents of uplifting to cherish your child, to nurture your child. And they all are speaking directly to James and Jennifer Crumbley, if you notice in these victim impact statements talking about how it was so obvious, they didn't even want their child. And so, of course, the defense will counter that but that is the feeling I think of most in that courtroom today.",

So, it's really -- it's really an awful situation.

She's -- (INAUDIBLE) there's an abundance of sadness -- there's enough sadness to go around for all of the victims, for Mrs. Crumbley, for everyone involved in this case.It's not surprising that the victims have come in and obviously want the maximum sentence. There has been a narrative throughout this case that they believe is true. And this court knows that there is other information that was not a part of this case.
