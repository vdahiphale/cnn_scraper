      "sentences": "OUTFRONT nextBreaking news on this Friday, Trump's hush money criminal trial has a new date. This as the lead prosecutor in the Fulton County election case has just resigned. Will Trump face a criminal trial before the election? Plus, could a button on the back of a Boeing 787 cockpit chair lead to a jet plunging in mid-air, causing bodies to go flying into the roof? Well, OUTFRONT has obtained the pilot's manual with revealing details about that very chair. And we will speak to a pilot who's flown that plane hundreds of times. And she's a South Dakota governor on Trump's list of possible running mates. So why is she selling up shoe inserts and dental work? Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news, the Trump trials in complete chaos at this hour. A New York judge just ruling that the start of Donald Trumps criminal hush money trial is now delayed. As the lead attorney on Trumps Georgia election interference case has resigned tonight. So on the hush money case, let's start there. The trial had been set to start this month, ten days from now in March 25. And now the judge says, well, it likely won't start before even mid- April, and that comes after a dispute between Trumps defense team and prosecutors over documents in the case. The delay playing directly into Trump's self-declared strategy in all his legal cases. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We want delays, obviously, I'm running for election (END VIDEO CLIP) BURNETT:  Obviously, he's running for election, so he wants delays. He doesn't want verdicts here. He doesn't want people to see this and he's concerned what voters will see and hear in his legal cases during the closed days of the election. And a huge reason for concern is the Georgia case. Now, judges just ruled that District Attorney Fani Willis can stay on the case or lead prosecutor has to go, but Fani Willis stays in place. And that case will be televised live nationally, which means that voters will see everything that happens before Election Day, evidence witnesses, maybe even Trump himself that will be broadcast daily while Americans are deciding who to vote for, as early voting is open. And if Fani Willis gets her way, that trial will still start on August 5th, that's exactly three months before Election Day. But Willis has said she believes the trial could conclude in the very early part of 2025, which would be right around the time Trump is sworn in if he's elected. So the real question becomes, how quickly can the Georgia case move forward without the top prosecutor, Nathan Wade, because he is forced to resign. So, Fani Willis up on top, she stays in plays, but he has to leave and Trump and his co-defendants that accused Willis, of course, of profiting from her now ex- boyfriend, Nathan Wade. And immediately after this decision, that Fani Willis got to stay on the case. Trump's campaign quickly fundraising off the judge's decision today, sending the message to supporters, quote, Fani Willis, can continue the which and against me, rigged system against us. And then, of course, links to donate money. Paula Reid is OUTFRONT in Washington. And, Paula, what more are you learning about these delays in Trump's legal calendar which have such huge significance in these months before Election Day?",

So, Ryan, you heard what Gerald just said. You know, this is his view of his friends. Fani Willis knows what's going on, to try this herself, with her RICO experience, that there would be no reason to indicate that this would cause a delay, her remaining and Nathan Wade being removed. How do you see it? And what happens here that August 5th date is still technically her latest request for the trial?",

In the past, it has taken a long time in Georgia to seat a jury in a RICO case, but those that other case was different in this case, you might actually have the problem of people actually wanting to serve on the jury because its such an historic case that might go a little bit more quickly, but even by her own standards or what she has said or expectations, the trial will go until after the election.
