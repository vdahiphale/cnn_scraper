Well, two sources say he has selected Kristi Noem to head up the Department of Homeland Security. The South Dakota governor, a long-time loyalist, would be in charge of a sprawling agency that controls customs and border protection, immigration enforcement and emergency management, as well as the Secret Service.Noam had been on Trump's shortlist for vice president, but there was backlash to her recent book. In it, she admitted killing her 14-month- old dog for not showing signs of being an ideal hunting dog. A few hours ago, came word Trump is likely to choose Marco Rubio for Secretary of State, but it's not clear if the Florida Senator had been formally offered the position. Well, these are some of the other expected staff selections, which include EPA Administrator and U.N. Ambassador. Many other cabinet positions, like Attorney General and the Secretaries of Energy, Interior, Labor and Treasury, have yet to be announced. CNN's Alayna Treen has a closer look at those who have been named so far and the common theme that unites them.",

      "sentences": "Well, President elect Donald Trump on Monday, we're told, offered the role of National Security Advisor to Florida Republican Mike Waltz. Waltz is a former Green Beret. He had served in Afghanistan, the Middle East, and Africa. And his military experience could help him, as he navigates some of the wars abroad, including in the Middle East and in Ukraine.Now, Waltz's pick really is keeping in what Donald Trump is valuing most for some of these top positions. And that is loyalty. We saw him name, Susie Wiles as his chief of staff. CNN reported that Stephen Miller is going to be named deputy chief of staff for policy. There's been a number of other people, Tom Homan, to serve as his border czar. Elise Stefanik as his U.N. ambassador. All of these people have one thing in common and that is that they are loyal to him, particularly so they are loyalty stretching back to the time that he had departed the White House in 2021 when many people had tried to distance themselves from Donald Trump following the January 6th attack. All of these people stood by him, and I'm told that is his version of rewarding them. Now, I also want to note that Waltz, like some of these other picks, has been seen at Mar-a-Lago in recent days. He's also been a strong defender of the former president on television, particularly when it relates to some of these military matters. Now, another, influential voice that, we are continuing to see him move sway with is Elon Musk. He has been at Mar-a-Lago virtually every single day since Donald Trump won the election. And I'm also told that he's been not only calling up, Trump allies and lawmakers, but they are calling him as they seek to exert as much influence as they can in this process. Really hoping that Musk will help them paint a bigger -- a better picture of them to the president elect. Alayna Treen, CNN, West Palm Beach, Florida.",

He's going to bring in people who are loyal to him, people who are extremists, people who will do all the jobs that people refuse to do in the first term.

Well, one haunting example, a woman and her three children were killed in the city of Kryvyi Rih.And the outcome of the U.S. election could embolden Moscow to pursue its special military operation with even more force.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): Russian state T.V. feasting on Donald Trump's election victory. The main talk program showcasing a social media post by Donald Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr. mocking Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, saying his so-called allowance from the U.S. will soon run out. The message from Russian media, Ukraine is concerned U.S. aid could dry up and Russia will win the war. On Moscow Street, optimism about the incoming administration in Washington. PLEITGEN (on camera): Since the war in Ukraine, relations between Moscow and Washington have continued to plummet to new lows. But now, many people here hope and believe that a new Trump presidency could bring those relations back on track. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (text): I don't think he can directly stop the war, but I feel he can set ultimatums to both sides, which will definitely bring this conflict closer to an end. PLEITGEN (text): Trump also said he wants to end the war in Ukraine? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (text): We all want that. We really want the war to end now. The situation is impossible. I hope we get to a mutual understanding. PLEITGEN (voice-over): But what could a so-called mutual understanding look like? This video from Ukraine's military purporting to show Kyiv's forces hitting Russian troops in the Kursk region of Russia, where the Ukrainians say they are now facing off against nearly 50,000 Russian and also North Korean troops. The Ukrainians acknowledge they probably wouldn't be able to sustain their operations without U.S. military aid. Aid Donald Trump has in the past insinuated he might cut altogether in an effort he claims to end the war. DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT-ELECT: They're dying, Russians and Ukrainians. I want them to stop dying. And I'll have that done -- I'll have that done in 24 hours. Take over, Elon. Just -- PLEITGEN (voice-over): A Ukrainian source now saying Trump was joined by billionaire Elon Musk on a recent phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Musk, who while helping Ukraine by providing Starlink satellite internet, has in the past also criticized military aid for Ukraine, ridiculing Zelenskyy in posts on his platform X. The Kremlin is vehemently denying Washington Post reporting claiming a Trump-Putin phone call has already happened. Still, Vladimir Putin openly praising the President-elect's stance on Ukraine and on Russia. A slot was said concerning the desire to restore relations with Russia to help end the Ukrainian crisis, in my opinion, seems to me to be at least worthy of attention, Putin said. The incoming Trump administration certainly has the attention of many in Russia, hoping for improved relations with the U.S. and even possible sanctions relief. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Moscow.

      "sentences": "Right. So, Donald Trump definitely implied that he is -- that he plans to do so. Whether he will do so, it's unclear because Trump's rhetoric does not always align with his actions. See, if you go back to Trump's first presidency, he actually approved military aid for Ukraine, while President Obama vetoed this decision. And Trump did it not because he is a great friend of Ukraine, absolutely not.He did it because he believed that this military aid benefits U.S. domestic producers, and the current military aid that goes for Ukraine mostly goes to production within the U.S. So, shouting of this aid will also have domestic implications for U.S. production, which I think the president-elect has not fully thought through. And the aid still is quite popular among Americans, even among the Republicans. If you look at the last aid package, it was approved by overwhelming majority, both in the Senate and in the House. So, I think if Trump decides just to cut off date immediately, there will -- he will be facing pushback from within the U.S. and also let's be clear about what's happening with the current aid. The nominal value of the aid that U.S. promised to Ukraine is extensive, but in fact, Ukrainians complaining that they received only about 10 percent of what has been promised and what did come also comes with string attached like refusal to allow Ukrainians to strike deep into Russian territory. So, there is also a great frustration in Ukraine about the aid that they currently receive. So, I think that -- I think that the views -- the fear that Trump shuts down aid and then Ukrainian. Military will immediately collapse, over it. So of course, it will be much harder for them, but U.S. is not alone.",

Any attempt to contain China or to impose new sanctions on Iran will directly harm Putin. And Russia, no questions about that. And on the other hand, accommodating Putin in Ukraine will likely embolden China and Iran, for instance, in relations to Taiwan -- to Taiwan and the potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan.So, so again, I don't think that Trump and people around him fully taught true that how interconnected their foreign policy ideals are. And I think that again, I don't think that this will increase Trump's willingness to help Ukraine But it might decrease his willingness to strong arm Ukraine into submitting to Putin.",

Visitors will also have to buy personalized tickets with their names on them, an effort to stop travel groups from buying up tickets to sell at higher prices.The changes are part of an effort to make important tour destinations like Pompeii sustainable by focusing on the quality of the experience for the visitor rather than on the quantity of tickets sold. Pompeii was destroyed when Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 A.D. and is an ongoing archeological dig with just two-thirds of the site excavated. Barbie Latza Nadeau, CNN, Rome.",
