The U.S. House of Representatives appears to be on the verge of approving a bill to avert a federal government shutdown. The paradigm plan now winning support from both Democrats and Republicans after Donald Trump set off a scramble here in Washington when he tanked a previously negotiated bipartisan deal.

      "sentences": "Yes. This is on the verge of passing, Wolf, averting a scare at the last-minute government shutdown just on the horizon in a matter of hours. But now the House is poised to pass this bill well over the threshold. A two thirds majority needed to pass this bill that would keep the government open up until mid-March.Right now, it's at 366 to 34 vote. That's well over the 290 votes that would be needed, assuming all members are here and present, so that in right now, it looks like more -- it looks like it's broken down a lot of Republicans in favor of it. Well, 170 Republicans voting in the affirmative, just 34 voting against it. And the Democrats -- more Democrats have supported this, in fact, 196 Democrats. There's not a single Republican Democratic no vote. Now, this came all after a scare over the last several days. And then the aftermath of Donald Trump intervening late and scuttling a separate bipartisan deal that had been reached. It appeared to be on a glide path to becoming law. Trump demanding major changes, including to include an increase of the national debt limit, something he wanted off the table so he won't have to deal with it in the next Congress. That is a perennially difficult issue for Congress to deal with. He didn't want to have to handle it. He said, deal with it now. But Congress had a very difficult time in responding to that demand. In fact, one of the proposal backed by him yesterday failed. That went down with the opposition of 38 Republicans and Democrats because of that demand of Donald Trump's to include the national debt limit. So, today, all day long, they've been negotiating behind closed doors trying to figure out how to placate Donald Trump's concerns and win over Democrats as well. And it looks like, Wolf, the gavel just came down and that this bill has, in fact, passed the House of Representatives. It will be go over now to the Senate, and that's where they'll act on this later tonight, Wolf. And so at the moment, this bill, which was includes an extension of government funding up until mid-March, also aid to farmers, about $10 billion for farmers hit hard by different difficult conditions around the country and $100 billion or so for communities ravaged by natural disasters, all part of this bill. But that issue of the national debt limit was taken apart out of this bill and sent to deal with in the next Congress, putting that on Donald Trump's plate and really defying Donald Trump's public demands over that issue over the last several days. But Trump simply did not have the votes. The final vote, Wolf, was 366 to 34, passing this bill out of the House of Representatives just moments ago. 34 Republicans voted against it and one Democrat voted present. The rest of the Democrats voted for it. So, an overwhelming vote in the House of Representatives just hours before the shutdown deadline and now on to the Senate, which will expect it to give overwhelming passage later tonight. Wolf?",

But one thing that people know since the government shutdown of the first Trump administration, they are not good politics, particularly right before Christmas. This was something that obviously both sides have viewed was not a good thing.But we learned a lot from the last 48 hours or so that will be instructive heading into the next year. One, Speaker Johnson, how weakened is he by all of this? We don't know quite yet. He's obviously hoping that, you know, some holiday charity perhaps steps in here and people forget some of this come January 3rd, but we'll see about that. But we also learned that Elon Musk is clearly much more influential than we even assumed. So, look, as the Senate passes this this evening, presumably, obviously they want to get out of town as well. We know that in the Trump era, it is going to be a challenge to govern. And the debt ceiling, we know why the president-elect wanted to get it out of the way now. But it is not -- this is going to be a huge cloud and a challenge that's going to be awaiting him next year.",

They were expecting it to pass and then he tweeted out that anyone who voted for it should be primaried.So, the idea that this would fall on Biden, particularly when we haven't really seen Biden in the spotlight at all on this, it seems pretty farfetched. But, of course, this is Donald Trump trying to posture, trying to say that it's not going to fall on him. The one thing I do want to point out here, I think it's interesting, is I want to go back to what Jeff was saying about Speaker Johnson, because I really think this is going to be one of the most interesting dynamics here, particularly when it comes to Johnson, Trump and Elon Musk. A few moments ago, Elon Musk seemingly was posting support of Johnson, saying the speaker did a good job with what he had. We know that usually what Elon has said in the past has come from Donald Trump. But then I got a text from a senior advisor essentially saying that this was Johnson's fault, not Donald Trump's fault, that Trump had mentioned that he wanted to deal with the debt ceiling early on and that this was something that Johnson knew before putting forward this negotiated bill. The reason why that's interesting is that, clearly, they're throwing Johnson under the bus. So, how this dynamic actually ends up playing out and where Trump's head is at, that'll be interesting to see as we go into the speaker's race.",

They're going to have to adjust themselves.But here's two really big takeaways for me, Wolf. One, this is Donald Trump's first loss. That cannot be overstated. His party bucked him, and the reality is they need Democratic votes. The second is, I feel for Jeffries. I used to work for Speaker Pelosi. And what you need when you're governing is a level of certainty, especially from the White House. So, the question is, who's in charge? Who's in control? Is it Elon Musk? Is it Donald Trump? I mean, you know, the question, the outstanding question there leaves, I think, Johnson in this perilous position going forward. And that's really going to really put on full display the fact that Republicans have a sort of a lack of an ability to govern. So, it's just going to be a tough new world for Elon Musk and Donald Trump that they're going to have to adjust to.

Congressman, thanks so much for joining us. I know you're one of the 34 Republicans who voted against this spending bill. Why did you vote against what the President-elect Trump wanted? REP. RICH MCCORMICK (R-GA): Well, in my opinion, there has to be a conservative conscience. And I believe that us 34 kind of were the original DOGE, if you will. We're the people who are conservative. We believe that the C.R.s that we keep on voting for are really, in this case, an omnibus, or a minibus, if you will. We've done nothing in two years. And when I came up here, I promised to address the debt crisis, and it is a crisis. As a matter of fact, right now, that trillion dollars of interest we're paying this year is taking up a considerable amount of the money we spent in Congress already. And then add to that. In about nine years, 45 percent of our entire budget will be spent on interest payments on our debt if we continue what we're doing right now. We simply can't do that anymore. Our children deserve better. I'm trying to save Social Security from bankruptcy. They'll have an automatic cut of 21 percent in about nine years.

And, of course, the fear is that that death toll could rise because some of the injuries are said to be extremely serious.Now, the police who have obviously arrived there in some force have taken into custody the driver, the suspected attacker. He hasn't been named, but he has been identified as a Saudi -- you know, somebody from Saudi Arabia. But it's -- apparently, he's been living in Germany since 2006, so, you know, nearly 20 years. So, he'd be considered German by most Germans, I expect. But nevertheless, you know, it helps to perhaps start to paint a picture of what's gone on here, because this isn't the first time. You know, we don't know exactly what the motivation is, obviously, yet, but there's not the first, you know, that there's been previous attacks in Germany on Christmas markets by organizations like the Islamic State back in 2016, more than a dozen people killed when a Christmas market was rammed by a truck back then, dozens more people injured as well.

Typically, when we speak about this kind of terrorist attack, we suspect younger, people in their 20s or even teenagers. He's a well-established man in Germany. He's a doctor who earns a living. He's highly qualified. And here comes the really interesting thing. Just in the last minutes, the German authorities released the name of the person. And if you read his Twitter profile, he has a Twitter profile, it is actually not what you think. It's someone who is a militant atheist, who considers himself to be an ex-Muslim, and who believes that Germany is Islamizing Europe.

Once you got inside those bollards, it was very packed.I got to say, the moment I heard these reports, I thought back to being packed in that crowd and wondered how I would find cover if a car came screaming at me there. But it's a place where people let their guards down, even though the German interior minister earlier this year, this fall, was saying, Christmas markets are a potential target, but she didn't, at that point, report any actual intelligence, anything to indicate that there was a specific plot. And what we've seen so far, if you add in what Peter's saying about this social media account that may or may not belong to assailant, it raises a question. Could this be related to ISIS, to Gaza, or to a person who is an extremist who just saw a method that he copycatted from previous terrorist attacks to express himself?",

That provision was eliminated. And the bill that went through the House was much more favorable to some of the billionaires' business interests. I think that's what next year is going to be. The billionaires that surround Trump are going to weigh legislation based upon whether it makes them more money.
