Rupert will take the new role of Chairman Emeritus with the company stressing he intends to remain fully involved, but what that involvement will be remains unclear. Here's part of a memo written to his employees. \"For my entire professional life, I have engaged daily with news and ideas, and that will not change. But the time is right for me to take on different roles, knowing that we have truly talented teams.\" Murdoch built a vast newspaper and magazine empire across the globe, which includes the Wall Street Journal as well as Britain's The Times and the Australian newspaper. He founded Sky News in the U.K. The 1990s saw the emergence of the Fox television network in the United States as a major competitor, but he will always be infamous for Fox News with a noxious mix of right-wing propaganda, conspiracy theories, bigotry and outright lies. It became a ratings powerhouse, making billions of dollars. CNN's Anna Stewart reports on Rupert Murdoch's seven decades shaping the media landscape. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER (voice-over): A media legend and self-made billionaire. Rupert Murdoch's career began more than 60 years ago when his father died leaving him control of a local Australian newspaper company. From that, he built a media empire and reshaped the TV business, especially with the launch of the Fox Broadcast Network and later, the Fox News Channel. RUPERT MURDOCH, NEWS CORP. CHAIRMAN: How delighted I am that we've now reached this moment when we can firmly announce the starting of a Fox News Channel and a much greater effort and the buildup of Fox News in every area. STEWART (voice-over): In the U.K., his son tabloid urged support for Brexit. Years earlier, British politicians admitted to openly courting his support. DAVID CAMERON, THEN-BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: And I think on all sides of the House, there's a bit of a need for a hand on heart. We all did too much cozying up to Rupert Murdoch. STEWART (voice-over): In the United States, properties like Fox News, the Wall Street Journal, and the New York Post made him a conservative kingmaker. Initially opposed to Donald Trump's campaign, Murdoch's relationship with a former president warmed up and eventually grew quite close. MURDOCH: The Commander in Chief and the President of the United States, my friend Donald J. Trump. STEWART (voice-over): The two men reportedly talked on the phone frequently, giving Murdoch a direct line to the Oval Office. But Murdoch's rise to the top wasn't without stumbles. In 2011, a phone hacking scandal led him to close the British tabloid News of the World. The powerful businessman was called before parliament.",

So far, some of the side comments, so far rather, some of the side comments are slightly anti, and they shouldn't be. The narrative should be this is a huge celebration\". You know, so he's already kind of hands on here. That seems to be even more to the right than Rupert. But here's the question, is he able to take the network in that direction, given the political views of the other three airs here? Because, you know, the Financial Times has reported the Murdoch family scions and how they could battle for control of the Murdoch Empire. It's all about the trust fund, which is quite complicated.

Now, once he leaves, you know, we could see a break up or breaking apart of this family through the trans that would make the Breakup of Yugoslavia after the death of Tito look like a party. So but that's -- we don't know when it's going to happen. It's probably at least a few years away, maybe 10 years away for all we know.

And what we hear from the Palestinian Authority president is essentially you cannot have this piece that you seek in the Middle East without a full recognition of a Palestinian state. It's interesting to hear from the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in that interview, not even mention the word necessarily a state for Palestinians, but instead talking about ways that they could ease the lives of Palestinians in this normalization deal. We do know that the Palestinians have set out certain things that they would like to receive as a result of this normalization deal. This is according to media reports as well as statements we've heard from Palestinian officials. This is things like U.S. backing for recognition of Palestinian statehood at the United Nations, which is something that Mahmoud Abbas mentioned in his speech. The U.S. reopening its consulate in Jerusalem that was closed by former President Donald Trump and as well as Israeli transfer of certain parts of the West Bank territory into Palestinian control. Now, it is going to be hard for much of these things to get through. This current Israeli government, the most right-wing extremist in Israeli history, something that Mahmoud Abbas addressed, calling it a right-wing racist government. Otherwise, for the rest of his speech, much of it is things that we have heard before from the Palestinian leader, things like demanding an end to the occupation, asking for full recognition of the state of Palestine, talking about what he called a double standard saying why is Israel recognized but the state of Palestine is not recognized. He also is calling for Israel, he said, to be held responsible for its actions, saying that there have been so many U.N. resolutions in that very body that he says have not been upheld. But definitely, the biggest takeaway from his speech was that first line, his sort of direct response to all the discussion about the normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia.

A spokesperson from the U.S. National Nuclear Security Administration confirmed to CNN that it is, quote, \"Recapitalizing infrastructure and scientific capabilities at the U1a complex\". Adding, \"The United States has not conducted a nuclear explosive test since 1992, and has no plans to do so\".

Along with a growing pile of excavated debris. Washington accuses China of dramatically expanding its nuclear arsenal. MICHAEL CHASE, U.S. DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR CHINA: We project out to 2035 when we expect that they'll want to have about 1,500 nuclear weapons.

The most recent being China in 1996 with an underground test. The U.S. has been conducting for years tests that it calls subcritical tests, and they're meant to ensure the reliability of its existing nuclear weapons, some of which have been around for 30 years or more longer than many people might keep a car. So you do need to modernize these types of weapons.It is possible that some of these governments are modernizing their testing facilities in the event that another government might carry out a test first. But that starts to get you into this nuclear brinksmanship and possible paranoia, the likes of which we haven't really seen between the world's largest military powers really since the days of the cold war.

Indigenous activists say it was an attempt to legalize the theft of millions of hectares of land. The group representing farmers say it will now push Congress to pass a bill to limit new claims by native communities. In India, a landmark bill is now on the books which will ensure more women are in government. The measure sets aside a third of the seats in India's lower house and state assemblies for women. 215 lawmakers in the country's upper house voted in favor of the bill on Thursday. Women make up nearly half of India's 950 million registered voters, but only 15 percent of lawmakers in parliament and 10 percent in state assemblies. India's Prime Minister called the bill, quote, \"an historic moment in the country's democratic journey\".
