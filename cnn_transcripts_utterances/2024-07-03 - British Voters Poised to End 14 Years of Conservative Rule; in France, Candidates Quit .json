Beryl is moving rapidly across the Caribbean and is now a Category 4 storm, packing 230 kilometer per hour winds. This week, Beryl became the earliest ever Cat 5 hurricane in the Atlantic basin, fueled by record high ocean temperatures. Forecasters say the center of the storm will make landfall in southern Jamaica Wednesday and will then head to the Cayman Islands. Jamaica's government is warning people to take the threat seriously to find shelter and to stock up on essentials, like food, water, and batteries. Officials have imposed a nationwide curfew from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. local time. And Jamaica's prime minister has declared the entire country a disaster area for the next week because of Beryl's likely strength and impact. Residents of the Windward Islands, which face barrels wrath earlier this week are assessing the damage, CNN's Patrick Oppmann shows us. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Hurricane Beryl leaves a trail of destruction in the Caribbean. The earliest Category 5 hurricane on record to ever form in the Atlantic, Beryl roared through the Windward Islands on Monday. In Barbados, the storm wrecked fishing boats and livelihoods.",

The first thing we need to do is we need to adapt to the climate change that we can't avoid.So, for example, a lot of places that used to not need air conditioning are going to need air conditioning. Yes, we're going to need to build sea walls for places that used to not flood, but now they are going to flood. And so, people call that adaptation. And so, we need to be doing that. At the same time, we want to stop the climate from warming. You know, it's been warming for 100 years, as we keep warming as long as we're dumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. And so, we need to stop doing that. We have the technology to stop doing that. We can switch to climate safe, renewable energy. It's our cheapest energy at this point. And you might be saying, well, why aren't we already doing it? It's because of the enormous political power of fossil fuels. There, the fossil fuel industry is probably the most powerful industry in the history of humanity. They make trillions of dollars in revenue every year. And they don't want to turn off the tap. They want to keep pumping oil and natural gas and digging up coal. And so, they are fighting the energy transition every step of the way. And that's really the battle. This -- you know, climate change is not a scientific or a technical problem, it's a political problem.",

So, you know, you're not going to go out tomorrow and replace your car. But when you get a new car, it should be an electric vehicle, it's cheaper to run. It's, you know, electric cars are better. And as we build more of them, they are going to be cheaper than internal combustion cars.And in fact, a lot of the technology that we have is actually cheaper. And as I said, solar and wind energy are now our cheapest energy sources. But again, it's the political power of fossil fuels. They have captured a lot of our elected officials. They give them enormous campaign contributions, the extent that these elected officials are legislating on behalf of fossil fuels and not on behalf of their citizens.",

We have clean air, we have better energy security, better national security, it's not costing us any extra money. And that's one world. \\ We still need to pay to adapt to the climate change we can't avoid in that world. But that's not a bad world to be in. The other world, the world where we don't adapt to climate change, where we don't deal with this problem is a world that gets continuously hotter, sea levels rise, precipitation patterns change, the oceans acidify, and it's going to be extremely difficult to adapt to that world.And, in fact, adaptation in that world is going to require enormous transfer of money from rich people to poor people. I mean, who is going to pay to air conditioned all of this? And I guarantee the people that are saying, let's adapt to climate change, are not going to spend their money helping poor people adapt. And so, it's a world where we're going to normalize suffering. You can already see this happening. If you go to places like Phoenix, if you go to places, you know, third world countries that are really suffering from extreme heat, you know, there is no sense that, you know, we need to help these people. It's just, you know, you're normalizing the sufferings. Like, well, you know, if those people are suffering from heatstroke, they had to go get a job, and they had to go, you know, have air conditioning, installed their houses, without recognizing that it's extremely expensive to install air conditioning in your house. So, it's really a very cruel -- I think the world where we don't adapt to climate change is a world of cruelty. A world where we normalize suffering, and where there, you know, it's there going to be a reasonably small number of people who are able to prosper in that world and everyone else is going to be hanging on to the lifeboat and hoping to get pulled in.",

But the leaders in the Republican -- in the Democratic Party are standing behind President Biden, and several members of Congress are explaining, like I said, the impracticality of just replacing him. People need to understand a few things. The nomination process is very complicated for Democrats -- a little bit different than for Republicans. But for Democrats, they have certain deadlines that have already passed, you cannot just transfer the $100 million of campaign finance money that has been raised on behalf of the Biden-Harris campaign. You can't just transfer that to another candidate.Whoever they were to allegedly replace, in theory, would have to race -- start raising money from scratch. That's number one. Number two, is president, would the -- would the replacement be Kamala Harris, the vice president? She would be the natural person to go to the next. That would be the only way that they could keep that campaign finance money. There is a lot of conversation about whether she would actually be that person, whether she could beat Donald Trump. Then, there is also the idea that you have to get on the ballot. Ballot access. Each state has is -- its controls its own elections. Whoever the new replacement would be, if it's not Kamala Harris, and whomever, they would have to get qualified for the ballot. The time just doesn't allow for that. So, there, again, there are logistical issues that do not allow for the president of the United States to just be -- to just be replaced that way. He would have to make that decision. And he would have to do it within the next few days. And what we've seen so far from President Biden, he is not keen on dropping out. And how does he drop out from the nomination and then not resign the presidency? I don't think that people are fully thinking this through. And he has demonstrated so far that he is fully capable. He had a bad night. A couple of bad nights here and there. But he has not -- people need to understand they are not just voting for a man, they are voting for an administration. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
