If he wins in November, Joe Biden would become the oldest person elected president at the age of 81. He's already the oldest person to hold the office in U.S. history. President Biden tried to put skepticism over his fitness for a second term to rest. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Last night, I think, he did a ton to bring them back home. And now, he's got to start building on top of that if he's going to be in a competitive position for reelection.

But he posted the bond today of $91.6 million, and he said he's going to appeal that $83.3 million judgment that the jury awarded E. Jean Carroll in the defamation case.Now, he posts a bond that is larger than the award because that is the common practice in the District Court. It's to cover some of the interests that he would have to you know pay on this bond. So, what this means is that Donald Trump got someone to help him write this bond, this large insurance company called Chubb. They're underwriting the bond. And this will cover the appeal of this case and these damages only. It's not for future appeals. And Trump as we know, we've seen the bond, you can -- you can see the signature on it. He signed it on Tuesday. So, he was able to get this bond locked up and signed even as he was asking the judge to give him more time to come up with the money and to post the bond. So, he's had it in hand. Of course, this comes Trump has about two weeks to come up with $454 million to satisfy the judgment in the New York Attorney General's civil fraud case. That is a much bigger amount of money that he'll need to front. And he is asking the appeals court in that case to give him time to not force him to post the bond until he appeals the verdict in that case where the judge found him liable. The appeals court is expected to make a decision on that later this month. That is just when that deadline is for him. So, these two things will be coming down to the wire yet again, Wolf.",

Families of the 239 people onboard have urged officials to relaunch the search. And this week, the Malaysian government says it might do so.I want to bring in someone who has covered this story for a long time, CNN Business Editor-At-Large Richard Quest. Richard, you also wrote a very important book about the search for this plane. And now 10 years later, do you think we're any closer at all to solving this huge mystery? RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR-AT-LARGE: Oh, the answer's no. We're not. Because until we find the plane, we just won't be able to find out what happened. All the same theories. The raw unvarnished truth is we know very little more now about how that plane crashed, why it crashed, or indeed where it crashed. And that's why the ocean infinity search is going to be so important because they're going to go down. They say they have new technologies. And, Wolf, this is what they are hoping that they're going to find when they get down that. The version of this. The black box. I don't know why they -- I'm not sure to know, Wolf, how that read. This will have stopped transmitting 10 years ago. But it is designed to withstand tremendous forces being underwater. Now, if they are able to find the wreckage, that's a big if, and locate the box, a very big if, then we stand a chance. But even if they just find the wreck -- I say just, they will still be able to tell a lot more. The more wreckage they can find, the better.
