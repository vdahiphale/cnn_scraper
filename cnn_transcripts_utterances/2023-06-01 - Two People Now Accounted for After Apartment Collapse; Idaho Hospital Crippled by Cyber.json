Police have reduced the number of those missing to three, saying that two of those unaccounted for have been located.Meantime, a city inspector has resigned over an administrative error involving a permit for the building. We also learned that the inspector visited the main street structure just three days before the partial collapse. And the mayor has yet to figure out the timeline of when the building will be demolished, which he says will not involve the use of explosives. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR MIKE MATSON (D-DAVENPORT, IA): We are working on a timeline. We are reaching out to experts that have particular expertise in taking it down with a very dignified and respectful way. This needs to be done in a way that it respects that this is a resting place.

Meanwhile, during that news conference, when we just heard from mayor and other city leaders a short time ago, we learned that the families who have been displaced will receive up to $6,000 in assistance. The businesses in this surrounding neighborhood could receive up to $25,000. $6,000 some out here say is a small price to pay. Think about it. These families have lost everything.

They probably are assuming this is a ransomware attack, they may want to give the hospital time to perhaps negotiate a ransom. And if they don't, they may dump the data.But, you know, dialing back a second, this is still very much a fluid situation. They've shut down computer systems. They're trying to minimize the impact on patient care. They insist that they are able to care for patients and it hasn't been a big impact. However, we know for more than 24 hours they had to divert ambulances, send them to nearby hospitals. So, it's definitely causing some pains. And sadly, this is not a new phenomenon in the United States or elsewhere in terms of during the pandemic these ransomware attacks -- if this is indeed ransomware -- forcing hospitals to change up what they're doing and there are measurable impacts on patient care.",

But if you don't have the resources to get your systems back online quickly, it may be the best course of action frankly, despite the fact that the FBI counsels victims not to pay because it encourages more attacks.But if you are talking about critical patient safety choices, then you might be best to pay off. In this case we don't know. They are still responding to it. We are waiting for an update from the hospital, but it's definitely something that the Biden administration has tried to cut down on in terms of cracking down.

In a new essay for \"Vogue\" magazine, Tallulah writes that she was in denial about his illness for years because of her own issues.But now she says, quote, I can savor that time, hold my dad's hand and feel that it's wonderful. I know that trials of looming, that this is the beginning of grief, but the whole thing about loving yourself before you can love somebody else, it's real. CNN's Chloe Melas is joining us with more on this story. Chloe, tell us a little bit about Tallulah's own struggles that did make it hard for her to accept her dad's diagnosis. CHLOE MELAS, CNN ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER: Yes, this incredibly poignant essay which she penned, like you said, for \"Vogue.\" She's one of three of Bruce Willis's daughters that he had with Demi Moore. And in this she says that she was struggling with anorexia and that she was so consumed with her public image and consumed with her weight and her eating disorder and her treatment that she didn't realize truly what her father was going to. And at times the family would chalk it up to hearing loss. From being in movies like \"Diehard\" and that they really did not truly know that it was as serious as FTD. I want to read you a little bit more of what she said. She said I kept flipping between the present and the past when I talk about Bruce. He is, he was, he is, he was. That's because I have hopes for my father that I'm so reluctant to let go of. And as we have said before, FTD, according to the Mayo Clinic, it is a disease that affects the parts of the brain that allow you to communicate. And that he has been showing these signs for years, but he finally got this diagnosis, Brianna. And the family, including his ex-wife, Demi Moore, they have put on a united front in sharing with the world, with his fans on social media what he is going through.",

And under the complaint, which we're reading right now, Victoria Valentino is alleging sexual assault and sexual battery at the hands of Bill Cosby. And Victoria Valentino, I want to tell you, she flew from California to New Jersey, and she was at the trial every single day in that jurisdiction, Pennsylvania, before Bill Cosby was convicted of aggravated sexual assault --which that verdict was overturned.But in her current complaint -- and this is civil -- she's alleging that in 1969 -- so we're talking 53 years ago -- that she was auditioning for a role. She was in the trailer of Bill Cosby. He was there. That she took out a picture of her 6-year-old son who had just drowned. She was very distraught. She was showing him the picture. Later in 1969 she's at a restaurant, Cafe Figueroa in Los Angeles. Bill Cosby is there. She is still emotional about her son. He says to she and her girlfriend who were there, you need to go to a spa for some treatment. Do that, my chauffeur will pick you up, we'll go to dinner afterwards. They did that. At the dinner she says that he put a pill by her dinner plate along with her friend. He took a pill himself. She believes he feigned it. That it was not really him taking the pill. Then she took it. She felt woozy. He said, let's go to my office, I want to show you some of my trophies. She said that she woke up and she saw Cosby trying to assault her friend. She tried to intercede. He came and he sexually assaulted her. Those are her allegations at this point. This is a California court. We do have a response from Bill Cosby that we've just gotten. Victoria Valentino has skirted from town to town promoting her alleged allegations against Mr. Cosby to anyone who would give her platform without any proof of facts. However, it is more deeply disturbing and disappointing that our lawmakers will push forward these look-back windows. What graveyard can Mr. Cosby visit in order to dig up potential witnesses to testify on his behalf? But one thing we must note, from that criminal trial, there was a deposition in 2005 where Mr. Cosby said under oath that he would give quaaludes, drugs to women he wanted to have sex with.",
