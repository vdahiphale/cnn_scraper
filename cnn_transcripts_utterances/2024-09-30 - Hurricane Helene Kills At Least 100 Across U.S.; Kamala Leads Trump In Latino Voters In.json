The latest check this morning -- the latest check in some of the other numbers this morning, nearly 2 million customers do not have power. Utility crews are working on it. But if you just take a look at the damage sustained, just look at that in one part of North Carolina, the roadways impassable, debris left behind. It's clear that they have huge challenges ahead of them to restore power, In North Carolina, the last numbers what we had in North Carolina where at least 36 people were killed, and there have been more than 1,000 reports of people missing. We had the governor of North Carolina on with us just last hour. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. ROY COOPER (D) NORTH CAROLINA: This is going to be a tremendous effort in the short run, but looking at it in the long run, with the hundreds of roads that are destroyed, communities that were wiped off the map. We have to make sure that we get in there. Are smart about rebuilding, doing it in a more resilient way, but right now, we're concentrating on saving lives and getting supplies to people who desperately, desperately need them.

And that goes for not only this gas station, but dozens and dozens in this part of the country. And one of the things that I was noticing, Kate, is that, for example, this screen here at the gas pump, it has sand inside the screen, which tells you that at one point the water level was at least this high. Now we have been talking to people here who tell us that they have no water, they have no power, mobile services nonexistent. Same goes for internet, and they're getting desperate because they're unable to talk to the loved ones to let them know that they're OK. We also heard from people just north of here in Madison County in the mountain areas, and they describe to us what it was like to go through this very powerful storm. Let's take a listen.

And their F-35 took part in strikes against a power station, against the fuel depot there.And the message I was told, this is to the Houthis, who had only the day before, fired another ballistic missile into the heart of Israel. Indeed, they said they were firing it at the airport, the main international airport here, while the Prime Minister was on the tarmac coming back for New York. This was a very strong message for the Houthis cease and desist and a message for the Iranians too, and that message echoes what the Prime Minister has been saying he said it at the UNGA, Israel has a long reach, and it can reach out and get its enemies, a message to Iran to stay out of the fight that's going on in Lebanon right now.",

So the next the expansion of the conflict is Israel attacks in Iran, or Iran attacks in Israel. I think that if Iran gives Israel a reason to do that, the first target is all the nuclear capability that the Iranians have. That's what this, I think, is really about. Israel looking over the horizon, saying, we have to take out that nuclear capability that the Iranians have. The Iranians have for the last 30 years, assembled these proxy forces around Israel to be kind of a ring of fire, to keep kind of Israel on their toes and keep them always on the defensive.
