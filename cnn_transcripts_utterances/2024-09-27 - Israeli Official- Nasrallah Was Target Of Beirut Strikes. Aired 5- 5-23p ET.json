Still awaiting more information on Nasrallah's whereabouts and whether he's still alive, promising to keep us informed. Interesting, obviously and obvious, perhaps in constant contact with the United States. This reference that you talked about earlier, that -- that Israel is ready for attack and defense, but that attack at the moment, is what it's all about, reserves being mobilized, and is going to keep us informed all night.",

Andthe IDF released video of them going through training exercises quite, quite some number of hours ago and getting their equipment handed out so they've been very visible on that front. I -- I was taken by a couple of things that I think I understood from the translation we had of the IDF spokesman there talk about Beirut airport and only making sure that can only be used for civilian use, not to bring in weapons from Iran that clearly seemed to be a warning about the airport, that Israel is clearly watching developments there, and what sort of planes fly in and what sort of planes fly out. And I think again, we heard from him the warning there to the civilians that you may be sleeping close to Hezbollah leaders, and that they will continue with this information. Look part of what the IDF is trying to do, probably at this stage, not particularly successfully, is -- is inform the Lebanese people that -- that Israel is not targeting them, the Lebanese people. Israel is targeting Hezbollah, trying to make that distinction. The success rate on that messaging is probably not very high, but that is part of what they're trying to do here it seems.",

And he sounded, now this was before the -- the attack, but he sounded restrained. And he made the point that, look, Hezbollah does not have the kind of weaponry to counter Israel's strikes. It is a, you know, Israel is much more powerful. I was surprised that the president of Iran would admit that. And in by implication, he -- he was even sort of saying it about Iran itself. The Iranian strategy, I think, is different. And in its own way, it's effective, which is to keep the pressure on Israel from Hamas, from Hezbollah, from the Houthis increasingly, a little bit from Iraqi militias. By -- and what -- and what that does is, it diverts shipping from the Persian Gulf. It makes it so that very few airlines are flying into Jerusalem anymore. You know, it used to be something like 62. And I saw a report that, you know, that said, you're down to one, El Al. So, in other words, you make it difficult for Israel to have business as usual. The businesses can't work. The travel and tourism industry doesn't work. Israel's reservists normally take two months, are -- are now out, you know, for a year in the army. So it's a kind of slow grinding, you know, keep the temperature high. But they don't have the capacity either to really strike back. And that's why you correctly point out they've said it many times, Richard, but they have actually rarely delivered, because they know that the Israelis would be able to punch, counterpunch much harder.",

And otherintelligence says that the Israelis have high confidence that Nasrallah was in the buildings that were then destroyed by the Israeli forces attacking the Lebanese capital. According to the IDF, it was a precision strike on Hezbollah's headquarters. Now, the whereabouts and how -- what -- what happened to Nasrallah, we simply don't know. The spokesman for Israel's IDF has said, told us a moment or two ago, that they're awaiting further information and they hope to have more precise details in a while. U.S. and Israeli officials say Washington was largely kept in the dark until the operation was underway. The Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has been speaking. He hit on familiar talking points and frankly didn't say much else. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LLOYD AUSTIN, U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY: What I will say is that you've heard me say a number of times that an all-out war should be avoided. Diplomacy continues to be the best way forward and it's the fastest way to let displaced Israeli and Lebanese citizens return to their homes on both sides of the border. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Clearly some frustration and I think you can hear it there a bit from Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. Hecertainly doesn't reveal much. That's very much his nature. But again, a level of frustration that the U.S. was told moments before that -- that Israel was carrying out a -- a strike or a major operation in Lebanon while the planes were effectively already in the air. So no -- no real point in trying to consult there or talk through things. Israel's strike was already well underway. And it's worth pointing out this is the second time in -- in days this has happened. It was exactly 10 days ago that Austin was on the phone with his Israeli counterpart and got a heads up that an Israeli operation would take place in Lebanon. Well, it's not a very useful piece of information because of the range of Israeli operations we've seen in Lebanon. And then U.S. officials only learned that it was exploding pagers when they saw those reports emerging from Lebanon. So this is now at least twice over the course of -- of a week and a half and you can sense the frustration on the U.S. side. On top of that, the U.S. has been pushing for a ceasefire, thought they had the Israelis on board and then Benjamin Netanyahu lands and -- and makes it clear that he has no interest in a ceasefire. It's worth trying to learn more about how related are those two, Richard. Did Netanyahu find out he had a chance to go after Hassan Nasrallah and therefore decided to abandon the U.S. plan or -- or was it something different there? Still, U.S. pushing diplomacy when it seems so unlikely right now.",

Sir, the situation and the ability to get out of this without it getting much worse is just about impossible now. GARY GRAPPO, FMR. DEPUTY CHIEF MISSION, U.S. EMBASSY IN SAUDI ARABIA: Well, thank you for having me, first of all. Indeed, the situation does look grim. Clearly, what Is -- Israel has done today is a marked increase in the escalation of the conflict that has been going on for years, if not decades, between Hezbollah and the state of Israel. I think what is clear here is that Israel has every intention of decapitating this organization, which it views after Iran as its most significant enemy. And over the course of the last 10 days, we have seen Israel systematically eliminate something like seven of the nine top leaders within Hezbollah. So it's not unusual they would go after Mr. Nasrallah himself.",
