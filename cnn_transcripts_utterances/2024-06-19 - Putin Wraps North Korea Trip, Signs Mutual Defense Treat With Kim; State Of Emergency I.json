We're breaking down their new mutual defense treaty and how this partnership of U.S. adversaries threatens the west.Also this hour, a state of emergency as wildfires rage in New Mexico and turn deadly. CNN is on the scene where flames have been consuming homes and forcing thousands of people to flee. And Donald Trump's ability to make or break Republican candidates is being tested in a congressional primary in Virginia that's still too close to call. Trump's anger and bid for revenge leaving a key House Republican incumbent in peril tonight. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. Tonight, Vladimir Putin is in Vietnam after leaving North Korea with a new partnership deal and a fresh commitment from Kim Jong-un to support Russia and its battle in Ukraine. CNN's Matthew Chance has more from Moscow. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice over): This was carefully choreographed pomp and ceremony, a lavish welcome in North Korea for the Russian president. In Pyongyang's central square, tens of thousands cheered, waving flags and balloons, as their own ruthless autocrat, Kim Jong-un, stood shoulder to shoulder with the Kremlin's strongman. It's been 24 years since Putin's last visit here. Now, international sanctions and war have driven him back. Later, the two leaders signing a strategic alliance treaty, unwavering, they called it, heralding a new and dangerous phase in cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang. I've no doubt this powerful treaty will be very constructive, declared Kim Jong-un, strictly peace-loving and defensive, he said. Putin clarified the partnership includes mutual assistance in the event of aggression. That's similar to NATO's Clause 5, raising concerns Ukrainian attacks on Russia could invoke the clause. Already U.S. officials say Russia is using North Korean ammunition to sustain its barrage on the Ukrainian frontlines. Moscow and Pyongyang deny arms transfers, which would be in violation of U.N. sanctions. The Kremlin needs all the help it can get to win its conflict in Ukraine. What North Korea may get in return is also concerning. Its space, ballistic missile and nuclear programs used to threaten the U.S. and its allies would benefit from Russian technology. Kremlin says Pyongyang hasn't even asked for help in the most sensitive areas. Putin and Kim, stone-faced at times, sat as the captive audience clapped along to patriotic Russian and Korean songs. Both leaders opposed to the U.S. and its allies are isolated and sanctioned by the west. In Pyongyang at least, neither looks like a pariah. (END VIDEOTAPE) CHANCE (on camera): Well, Wolf, tonight, Vladimir Putin is on the second leg of that Asian tour, visiting communist-run Vietnam, another old alliance the Kremlin wants to shore up. But don't expect to see any of that official enthusiasm that we saw in North Korea. Top of the agenda in Vietnam is business, not fighting the United States and its allies. Back to you.",

      "sentences": "Well, obviously, the tangible benefit for Putin is that he ensures that there will be a steady supply of weapons and ammunition made in North Korea, some of the ballistic missiles made with American parts, Wolf, even though both sides have denied that there are arms exports happening. There's clear evidence European independent think tanks that have actually picked up pieces of North Korean missile debris that's been used to kill civilians and soldiers and injure scores of people in Ukraine. So, Putin wants to make sure that there's going to be that weapon and ammunition supply that he needs to keep the fighting going. And so right now, it's crucial to continue to grow that relationship with Kim Jong-un.But also the welcome that he received, something the supersized socialist celebration that he's not going to find almost anywhere else in the world, much of the West, certainly regarding him as a global pariah, you know, one thing that strikes me, Wolf, is that those North Korean people waving those flags, yes, of course, they're compelled to be out there by their neighborhood leaders and whatnot to line the streets by the hundreds of thousands, but also North Korea is arguably more restricted now than it has possibly ever been, or at least since the Cold War. People there have no idea of the realities of Putin's brutal war in Ukraine, because their state media only tells them this glossy version. And so they genuinely might look at somebody like Vladimir Putin as a strong hero, unaware of the true reality of what most of the world thinks of him. Now, he's landed here in Hanoi, and as Matthew mentioned, it's all business here. Certainly, the Vietnamese are not thrilled by the fact that just after that spectacle in North Korea, he's now landed here, but they're honoring a decades-long friendship with Russia by welcoming the Russian president where he is hoping to get some business deals made, potentially in energy cooperation, maybe some military deals because, Wolf, Russia, ironically, is actually the number one weapons supplier for Vietnam, and they have been for a very long time.",

And I think that it shows you exactly where he's at. It also shows you how these connections between Russia, North Korea and China, which is, of course, North Korea's main partner, are beginning to solidify as they identify as kind of victims of sanctions, as enemies of the liberal Democratic ideas coming from the west, it's a pretty dangerous moment.",

And so they have warehouses full of it and they're willing to give it to Putin. I mean, it doesn't win the war for him. It's not sophisticated ammunition. Apparently, quite a lot of it doesn't work, but it has kept him going. I think he might well have run out many months ago if it wasn't for this.So, these alliances that he's made with North Korea, with Iran, his economic relationships with China, with India, he's clearly trying to build one with Vietnam.

That's a big shift. Remember that 20 years ago, when George Bush was beginning the Six Party Talks with North Korea, a diplomatic effort to get them to give up what was still a nascent nuclear program, the Russians and the Chinese were on the American-Japanese side of those negotiations.In Iran, in 2015, the Chinese and the Russians were on the American and European side of the negotiations with Iran to force it to stop its nuclear fuel production, and that succeeded. If either of those negotiations were starting up again today, and they won't be, it's a fair thing to say that the Russians for sure and the Chinese probably would be on the other side of the table, that at this point Russia needs the weaponry you just heard Anne discussed so desperately that they would have basically given up trying to convince the North Koreans to give up their weapons.",

So, no, Donald Trump, not every black is low level and know that not every Latino immigrant is in a low level job.",

I think Trump will keep it in check for the most part, I think Biden will bring some pretty good energy similar to what you saw in his State of the State speech, something like that. But -- so that's going to be the kind of the nuance, can Jake and Dana are really kind of pride to make their answers on some of these really serious issues a little more interesting, a little more substantive? And given that there's no audience, I think they're going to have a chance to do it. So I think its going to be a great debate. I think everyone's going to be watching grabbed the popcorn, buckle in.

State of the Union Address, you meant.CNN has learned that Trump has been huddling with it advisors on how to handle likely debate questions, including on the January 6 insurrection. Governor, is that an admission that Trumps sees this potentially as a major vulnerability? SUNUNU: Well, I think it's always been a vulnerability of his and I would hope that his team would understand that. You know, the one thing I'll say about his campaign this time around, it's much more professionally run. It really is, than his pretty -- than '16 or 2020. So I'm not surprised to hear that they're kind of putting them through the paces, making sure that he has the right answers. I imagine Biden team is doing the same thing on the substantive issues of how to explain the back-and-forth messaging on the border. How do you explain trying to tell people, inflation isn't -- is temporary and not a bad thing. You have the highest credit card debt ever. So both sides are going to have to really bone up because this is where they have to just look at America and answer the question. And, you know, it'll be interesting. I keep going back to the fact that there's no audience, right? I think the Biden team asked there for there to be no audience, but I actually think it helps Trump, believe it or not more than Biden. You know, Trump tends to play into the audience, like if he gets a response from the audience, he gets a little more outlandish and a little more abrasive. So the fact that there's no audience I think helps keep Trump in check a little bit. But it also will help it not be as jarring and maybe confusing to Biden. and help him focus. So either way, I think both teams are taking this very seriously. They're not just walking through it or anything like that. And I think at the end of the day, that's good for America, right? That makes for a more, hopefully a more substantive debate, and folks can actually use this to see where they want to go in November with their vote.",
