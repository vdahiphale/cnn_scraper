We're following breaking news out of Russia right now, very dramatic developments raising serious questions about President Vladimir Putin's grip on power. Putin is accusing the Wagner Mercenary Group of what he's calling an armed rebellion. The head of the Wagner group, Yevgeny Prigozhin says his forces have taken control of military facilities in the region of Rostov-on-Don. The Russian Governor in the Kursk Region is calling on Prigozhin to abandon his plans but Prigozhin threatens to move on to Moscow. Yes, Moscow.

The Governor of a Lipetsk area that neighbors Voronezh where we do appear to have seen signs that Wagner military forces have least moved into or moved through.The Governor of Lipetsk is telling people to stay indoors, to stay calm. Now that may simply just be a bid to ensure their safety but this is yet another stop on the highway from Rostov-on-Don, the southern military hub that Wagner forces sort of calmly walked into it seems last night another stop on the Highway north towards Moscow. Absurd, frankly, to even feel I'm reporting this, the notion of an armed insurrection inside Russia that's currently got its sights set on the Capitol. We've heard from the Governor of Voronezh, that key town halfway on the road up towards the Capitol, that combat measures have been begun by the Russian military, and those videos suggesting damage to an old facility in that town. And indeed, Russian state media reporting that an MI8 attack helicopter made a hard landing in that area. It's possible that it's all related to the same clashes around that particular area. But the ultimate question for us in the hours and days ahead is what is left of the Russian military inside of Russia. So much of it is sent to the frontlines inside of Ukraine that is willing to stop this Wagner advance. Wagner do appear to have been relatively large in number and prepared as they made these moves yesterday. This whole dispute it seems going on for months but coming to a head yesterday when Prigozhin and its leader put out a lengthy statement questioning the rationale for the war and its conduct essentially telling Russians they've been lied to. That was it seems he says met by an air strike on a camp by -- of Wagner's inside of Ukraine. That seems to have led his forces to be marching towards Rostov. They've been pictured relaxed in that essentially equivalent of Tampa, Florida, where SIMCOM is based for the Pentagon, a key Russian military hub with Wagner fighters relaxingly sitting around there in according to videos that we've seen. That may change as the Russian military begins to pull its response together. But ultimately, this is now about Vladimir Putin's grip on the country. He's never faced anything like this. This has frankly seemed inconceivable over the past two decades. And now one of his former loyalists, bagman is marching towards his capital, Wolf.",

Give us some perspective Rostov-on-Don it's maybe not well known outside of Russia but militarily speaking it's a very significant location and -- and not all that far away from Moscow either.[08:05:16] WALSH: No, not that far from Moscow but more importantly very close to Ukraine, to the territories that Russia occupies since 2014, adjacent for most of them. It's been the hub for Russia's wars in Chechnya, for their invasion at times of Georgia in 2008. And for the repeated invasions of Ukraine. This is the key Russian military city in the south and you might argue nationwide. And now it is in the control, for the most part, it seems of the Wagner mercenary group, part of what the Kremlin calls, terrorist methods blackmail, and what is clearly a mutiny aimed at it seems at this point, unseating possibly not only the top brass of Russia, judging by the rhetoric we've heard from Yevgeny Prigozhin calling Vladimir Putin mistaken and it may end up being that if this progresses to Moscow, it actually challenges that Vladimir Putin is placed in the Kremlin as well. But that's yet to be seen. But we are now into a frankly, existential moment between Prigozhin and Putin, and quite who perseveres through this moment will define the future of the Ukraine war, certainly but also the fate of this nuclear power.",

Now, of course, we've also heard from administration officials who say that National Security officials at the Whitehouse, while they're watching closely are being careful and cautious as to when to weigh in as all of this is moving rapidly. We also know that as of early January, there had been indications in U.S. Intelligence that there was a power struggle between the mercenary group, the mercenary Wagner group, and the Russian government. And over the course of time, they have continued to collect intelligence on this matter, which indicates to us that the Whitehouse has seen this as a power struggle and one that could cause instability. And, of course, have ramifications on the war in Ukraine.Now, a key part of that statement I mentioned earlier is the talks with allies and partners, of course, over the course of the war in Ukraine. There have been regular conversations with allies and partners abroad and the Whitehouse and President Biden. And so we'll look out to see today what conversations are continuing to happen as we get that trickle of statements from NATO, from Poland, and from other countries that they too, are monitoring this and being briefed on this.

That hurt his standing on the world stage.Then the West rose up with sanctions that have hurt him economically although there are many countries that still have not joined on.

They don't want their city destroyed because I think they are concerned that the battle between Russian regular military troops and the Wagner group will destroy much around them. And it may well it sort of depends on how this unfolds.At the end of the day, Wagner has 25,000 Troops, we think. I'm not sure that big enough for him to do the job he has in mind. So he must be counting on ordinary Russian troops and units siding with him. And with some of the generals around Putin breaking with Putin, and you know, maybe he knows something we don't. But we haven't seen that yet. But it's certainly got to be making a lot of people nervous including the Chinese who, you know, really embrace Putin, were nervous about what he was doing, why he got bogged down, but, of course, have -- have thrown their lot in with him.

And certainly, someone who has risen among the ranks thanks to Vladimir Putin, who's been given a lot of power by Vladimir Putin. But who has also done a lot for Vladimir Putin along the way? And one of the things that we always have to mention, Wolf. is that Yevgeny Prigozhin came from very humble beginnings. He was in jail for a considerable period of time in the 80s and then started off in the 90s, selling hotdogs at a hotdog stand and then at some point became known as Putin's chef, Putin's cater. He was seen giving food to Vladimir Putin at various events. And thenmanaged to build an empire also, largely thanks to Vladimir Putin on top of that. And that's when, of course, he got involved in things like the Internet Research Agency with some of that propaganda work, he was doing. The U.S. saying that he played a big part meddling in the 2016 election, of course, was sanctioned, and indicted for that as well. And then you have the Wagner private military company, which is sort of one of the things that he also took on there. And this is something, Wolf that, you know, we in our work internationally have been confronted with over the past couple of years. If you look at, for instance, Syria around 2014, 2015, where we would go around Syria and you would already see people from the Wagner private military company, at that point, still doing things like base protection for the Russians who are down on the ground in Syria. That then of course, evolved into more and more of a combat role. But then also doing shady economic dealings for Vladimir Putin as well, in Syria, for instance, with the oil wells that the Russians and the Syrian regime took there. But then also in Africa, dealing with gems, also training African military forces. But it really wasn't Wolf until the war in Ukraine or the full-on war in Ukraine, where Wagner went from essentially being a paramilitary company to being a full-on military, to being essentially a full-on army. And Yevgeny Prigozhin himself says he believes that right now, this is the strongest army that Russia has and, you know, even sort of boasting that it's allegedly one of the strongest in the world. And -- and again, it was something that we've seen on the ground, all of us who for instance, were in the Battle of Bakhmut in Eastern Ukraine. You know, many people came under heavy shelling by those Wagner operatives who all of a sudden had tanks, who had large artillery stocks, were shooting a lot of artillery shells as well. And, of course, Wolf, also using prisoners who they recruited out of Russian jails to then essentially be used as cannon fodder on the front lines. So someone with a lot of brutal tactics. But also someone who now has a large army at his disposal, which apparently now has turned on Vladimir Putin. Wolf.",

But I'd put a caveat to that a little bit, Wolf, because the defensive positions that -- that Russia has been putting in place for the last six months are still there. So there are mines and trenches, and -- and wire and Russian forces who probably don't yet know exactly what's going on and they're confused, are still in their defensive positions.So we're as there might be celebration by some Ukraine -- I'm sure that Ukrainian commanders are taking this very slowly trying to find where the new holes are in the frontlines that have been caused by Wagner's redeployment back to Russia, if you will.

And I'm quoting him now without firing a shotCNN's chief international security correspondent Nick Paton Walsh is tracking these historic, very powerful developments for all of us. So where do things stand, Nick right now? NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT^ Yes, I mean, still, as you mentioned, that utterly extraordinary. The atmosphere in Rostov-on-Don, a key Russian military town probably the most important one nationwide, you might argue, captured according to the Wagner chief without firing a shot and some of the video we've seen from there does show a very relaxed situation, him in fact talking to two military commanders based there. One of whom, in fact, have been seen on the internet, on television the day before urging people not to go along with this insurrection, but he was later pictured with Prigozhin, the Wagner chief and another commander talking Prigozhin at one point and monitoring one of the commanders for using the informal YouVersion. You singular when talking to him about lack of respect Prigozhin said there. Extraordinary scenes in Rostov that continues though, on the highway up towards Moscow. The town of Voronezh, well, the governor there of that region has said that there's been combat measures by the Russian military. There's been a report in state media of an MI-8 attack helicopter taken down in that particular area and further up the road towards Moscow. Indeed, the Lipetsk region governor has told people to stay at home for now sort of essentially stay off the streets. So that a key highway south to the capitol, certainly bracing. It is unclear at this point, the volume of Wagner traffic moving up there and quite where it has gone. But pictures indeed have emerged on the outskirts of Moscow, of troops setting up positions on the sandbags, so startling scenes. You couldn't even possibly begin to imagine were imaginable last year before the war indeed began. And in fact a key advisor, a key part of the Putin cabinet, Sergey Naryshkin, the head of the Foreign Intelligence Service has just put out a statement condemning what he refers to as the armed attempted rebellion, there that cannot be justified by any prior achievements. Essentially pointing towards how the Wagner group has been behind a lot of the most intense fighting particularly around the symbolic but strategically not that helpful city of Bakhmut. And I think part of the coterie around Putin putting out a message saying Russia needs to unify. The ultimate question here, Wolf, is exactly what the military are going to do whether they really want to take on the Wagner group, often ex-soldiers themselves and quite whether or not this convoy however big it is, will be stopped for the outskirts of Moscow.

And that is problematic for a number of reasons, not least, because obviously, Russia is a nuclear state.And so they have been watching this closely to see whether Prigozhin was actually going to do anything about all of his threats and all of his complaints about the Russian military not providing his men with enough ammunition, with enough equipment, a complaint that he has had for several months, saying that essentially, the Russian Ministry of Defense had left the Russian troops and Wagner troops to die in Ukraine without actually providing them with the equipment and the support that they actually needed.
