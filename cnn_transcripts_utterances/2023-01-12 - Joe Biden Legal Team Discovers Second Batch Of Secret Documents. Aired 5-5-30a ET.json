As that was happening, there was actually a very quiet but very intensive review ongoing by the president's legal team to see if there were any.In fact, there are. A second set has been discovered, according to people briefed on the matter. Some of those government records, they are indeed classified. Now, the president and his team, again, never said that there weren't any other documents out there. They spoke only about that initial set of 10 classified documents. In fact, to some degree, they have been very careful not to say anything about what else may be out there. Let's take a listen to the White House press briefing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

There are sparse details about where they were found, what is inside of them, but it certainly exacerbates a situation that has been politically perilous for the president over the course of the last several days.Republicans on Capitol Hill, both Senate and House Republicans say they believe they should investigate the matter. They have called on the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel to look into the matter, obviously drawing clear parallels even though these situations are quite different to former President Donald Trump and his classified records, issues right now, his legal problems. How this actually ends going forward has very much remained an open question. The White House says they are fully cooperating, that isn't going to change according to White House officials. But certainly, finding a second set of classified records only complicates a problem that had only been growing in the hours before it was eventually revealed. Phil Mattingly, CNN, the White House.",

There's no allegation here that Biden personally handled the documents or claim them for himself or refused to give them back or obstructed attempts by the Feds to retrieve them. And to the contrary, Biden's attorneys notified the Archives, which is how the Archives found out about all this and gave everything back.Also, there's a difference in that volume of documents. The Trump documents are so much greater number than the Biden documents. And so, comparing the two situations to me is a false equivalency. If Trump had just returned the documents, there would be no criminal investigation and potential indictment of him. And in this case, Trump refused to cooperate. Biden is cooperating fully.

His Chief of Staff General Valery Gerasimov is now in- charge of the invasion, replacing Sergey Surovikin who's been leading forces for the past three months. CNN's Clare Sebastian joins me live from London looking at the chessboard here. What do you make of this? What does it say about how the invasion of Ukraine is progressing?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Christine, this is pretty interesting. On the one hand, you could argue that Sergey Surovikin who is known as sort of general Armageddon seen as a very strong hand needing this conflict that perhaps there was reason to demote him, he will now be Gerasimov's deputy, you know, the loss of Kherson, the only regional capital, the Russia has captured in November.The very brutal but not particularly decisive attacks on Russia's energy grid, the Kyiv attack on New Year's Day that killed 89 Russian troops, all of that perhaps adding up to reason enough in Moscow to bring about this shake up. But it doesn't add up necessarily to installing essentially, what is the head of the Joint Chiefs, the head of the Armed Forces as the head of your operation in Ukraine. The question of why Gerasimov is raising a lot of eyebrows. Some are speculating experts, Russian military bloggers, that it might have something to do with the rise of Vagner, the mercenary group headed by Yevgeny Prigozhin which is really making a lot of waves in the battle for Soledar in Eastern Ukraine. At the moment that perhaps the Ministry of Defense in the Kremlin might be wanting to reassert central authority over this conflict at the moment. But the other thing to note here is there are a lot of concerns in Ukraine, that Russia is preparing for a renewed offensive in the spring. This seems to point again to that that they might want this fresh pair of hands to spearhead that offense. We know for example, that they've held back about half of the new recruits that are still in training that might be more evidence of that as well, Christine.",
