Trump also saying clearly on the recording that he knows the material was not declassified. The former president is now facing 37 criminal charges related to his handling of classified documents after leaving the White House. He has pleaded not guilty.Sara.",

      "sentences": "Absolutely, John. So, this new presidential drawdown package will make the total in aid to Ukraine, U.S. military aid to Ukraine, come to over $22 billion since the war began. It is expected to include new Bradley and striker fighting vehicles, which are really important for Ukraine to be able to continue to prosecute this counteroffensive, especially because they actually lost some of those vehicles in the early days of that counteroffensive. So the U.S., obviously, trying to replace some of those now.And they're also expected to get more munitions for their patriot air defense systems, as well as additional ammunition, which is something that the Ukrainians are always wanting for. Now, it, of course, remains to be seen just how this rebellion by Wagner group inside Russia will affect Russia's operation inside Ukraine because the Wagner group had played a really instrumental role in Ukraine, including, of course, in the city of Bakhmut, and was actually among the more competent force that Russia actually had there as opposed to Russia's regular military force there. So, it remains to be seen how this rebellion and Wagner's kind of disintegration will impact the war because Russia had actually been putting up quite a substantial fight in the counteroffensive and had been - it had been difficult for the Ukrainians to break through their defensive lines. But the U.S., obviously, committed to maintaining their support for Ukraine. And this new $500 million package that we are expecting them to announce today is just further evidence of that, John.",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, we are, or we have been expecting this arraignment. Walt Nauta, the co- defendant of Donald Trump, expected all week for the past two weeks to be appearing in court in Miami this Tuesday morning. But just a few minutes ago, when his attorney arrived, he was alone. This attorney, Stanley Woodward, representing Walt Nauta, came into the courthouse without his client Walt Nauta.In recent days we know Nauta has been in New Jersey. He doesn't appear to have walked inside the courthouse. The judge is going to be on the bench just momentarily. And so now it's a question on what's going to happen today. Is this arraignment actually going to happen? Can it if Walt Nauta isn't here, and how does the judge respond to this? We're going to be listening inside court exactly what Stanley Woodward tells the judge about what happened. But we know Nauta was up in New Jersey and there were a lot of flight delays, especially yesterday up and down the East Coast. So it's really unclear exactly what will happen and if there will be more delay, Kate. We already had this delayed two weeks because Nauta didn't have a Florida attorney to get on his legal team and to get him arraigned two weeks ago when he was here with Donald Trump. Now a question of what is going to happen this morning. Kate. BOLDUAN: Yes, I was going to ask you about that because this was - this seems like it would be a delay on top of a delay. But there is definitely no question that weather in the northeast had completely brought travel - air travel to a standstill yesterday. Don't know if at all that's a factor in any of this. But again, when -- this is all about to get underway, right, Katelyn, and we could be hearing - we could -- the judge could be sitting down any - any minute.",

      "sentences": "They sure do, John. And you know that from being there during former -- previous election seasons.But, look, New Hampshire is its own beast. And they expect a lot of retail politics there. There's a very specific way to campaign in New Hampshire. And let's start first with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis because his event will be first this morning. He'll get started here in about ten minutes. We know he's going to take questions from voters. Again, that is key in the state of New Hampshire. They want to have that interaction, that back and forth with the candidate. And that's something that DeSantis has continued to do more of on the trail is to take questions from voters. We're also seeing him trying to go up against this idea that he's not good at retail politics, that he can't interact with people. Really trying to combat that by talking more and more with voters. Now then we're going to hear from former President Donald Trump, who, as you mentioned, will be speaking to this women's group a little bit later this morning. He will be talking with them. And they did release - the events director did release that statement saying that this was a distraction. It's unclear how much this is the Trump campaign trying to kind of gin this up, but the fact remains that New Hampshire is a very strong state historically for the former president. You'll remember back in 2016 he had an overwhelming victory there. They really tend to respond to him in the state of New Hampshire. So, we are expecting to see both of them. Interestingly, though, John, their paths will not cross today. It is a small state, but they will not cross paths.",

We've seen that even before DeSantis got into the race. That seems to be their strategy, just go right at him.DeSantis has a little bit of a different strategy that we've began - we've begun to see develop on the trail, and that is that when asked about the former president, he will attack him. He will criticize him. But he doesn't bring it up naturally, say, in his stump speech. So, the question is, will that be enough to convince voters who think, is DeSantis strong enough to take on the former president? That's really his challenge is to win over people who likely voted for him maybe twice in the last couple of cycles but are looking for a fresh face without insulting the former president. So, they're really trying to kind of toe that line. And what will be interesting to see, John, today, is if they get - if he gets any questions about that. We'll be watching.",
