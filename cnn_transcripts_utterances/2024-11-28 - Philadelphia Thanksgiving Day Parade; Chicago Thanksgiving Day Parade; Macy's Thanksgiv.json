Joining us live right on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway you see a drill team that is now taking aim straight down this iconic parkway where you're seeing, again, despite that rain, these folks turning out. A lot of these folks I've had an opportunity to speak to. A lot of parents, a lot of grandparents hoping to catch a glimpse of their children. Let's check out some of the crowds here with me. You have some new friends from south - south New Jersey there. And plenty of folks that are lining this parade route, 1.4 miles of color on this gloomy day. And this is something that, again, has continued already for - for decades. So, this little bit of rain is not going to change things. When you hear from some of the folks in the crowd, spoke to some people from Indiana, they're here to see their son Jack marching in this parade. So, this really just speaks to the excitement. A lot of people have reason to be thankful, even for the rain, amid a pretty nasty drought. So, there is a little bit of thanks there. But in terms of what we're seeing, again, a lot of smiles as I stand out here, Erica, John, soaked to the turkey bone. It is not raining on anybody's parade. All of this ending straight down the parkway on the iconic Rocky steps. That's where some of the folks are going to be seeing performances the rest of the day, as we send things from the city of brotherly love back to the big apple.",
