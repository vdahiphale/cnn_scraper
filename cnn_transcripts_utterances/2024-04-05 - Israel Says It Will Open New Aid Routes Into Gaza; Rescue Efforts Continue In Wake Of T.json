The Israeli leader also pledging to announce measures to prevent such a mistake from happening again.The White House says Mr. Biden demanded specific concrete and measurable steps to protect civilians and aid workers in Gaza or the U.S. would reconsider its own policies. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KIRBY, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: Hopefully, you know, it won't come to that they'll be able to execute and implement on these things that we've asked for, these things that they've committed to doing.

Also approving the use of the port of Ashdod, some 20 miles north of that very same crossing to be used to bring in additional humanitarian aid. Now this is significant for a few reasons. First of all, this will allow more aid to be brought directly into northern Gaza where the looming famine is most acute. More than a million people in Gaza currently on the brink of that famine. And even as we have watched the ramp up in air drops, for example, this new maritime corridor to bring in more humanitarian aid, it's very clear. And every humanitarian aid agency has said that it is land crossings that are necessary to bring in the scale of humanitarian aid that is necessary. And beyond that, we know the U.S. has been pressuring Israel for months now to open up more land crossings, including specifically this Erez crossing. And yet, even as Israeli officials for months have said they are doing everything they can to get in enough humanitarian aid, tonight we are clearly learning that they could have done more sooner. But instead it took the deaths of these seven humanitarian aid workers and this massive international pressure, including from the U.S., to actually result in the opening of this crossing.

And many decisions had to be made on the fly as the situation sometimes changed minute to minute. CNN's Kylie Atwood with that.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): New transcripts, exclusively obtained by CNN, show the chaos on the ground as the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan mirrored the chaos behind the scenes at the state Department. The department had no working emergency evacuation plan. That is the stark testimony from three State Department officials to the House Foreign Affairs Committee. And those three officials were rushed into Kabul in the days surrounding the Taliban takeover with virtually no time to prepare. MICHAEL MCCAUL, U.S. HOUSE REPUBLICAN: The Biden administration's failure to plan for their withdrawal threaten the safety and security of us personnel in country. ATWOOD (voice-over): The interviews are part of an ongoing investigation led by the committee's Republican chairman, Mike McCaul, into the chaotic evacuation that resulted in the deaths of 13 U.S. servicemembers in a terrorist attack outside of the Kabul airport. One official testifying, quote, we had to create from scratch tactical operations that would get our priority people into the airport. He added, we were roughly as effective as we could be under the circumstances. Another saying he was never briefed on an established evacuation plan because, quote, were already in the midst of executing an evacuation that substantially exceeded the scope and scale of what had been contemplated. The top U.S. military generals suggested that the damage could have been mitigated if the State Department had called for an earlier non-combatant evacuation. GEN. MARK MILLEY, FORMER UNITED STATES CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF: It is my assessment that decision came too late. GEN. KENNETH F. MCKENZIE, FORMER COMMANDER, U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND (RET.): We struggled to gain access to that plan and work with them over the months of July until we finally got a decision to execute. ATWOOD (voice-over): Those accusations have been disputed by the State Department. VEDANT PATEL, DEPUTY SPOKESPERSON, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT: The U.S. did not want to publicly announce planning for or the start of a EO, so as to not weaken the position of then-Afghan government, potentially signaling a potential lack of faith. ATWOOD (voice-over): Another state official testified to the setbacks on the ground due to a bleak reality. The Taliban were largely in control, quote, it was what will the Taliban allow? Will they let people move through and how will they do it? And as someone who's worked in Afghanistan for 19 years, it's a little bit wild to tell people that you can trust the Taliban, hold up your American passport. But it did kind of work. Those descriptions a far cry from what the department said at the time.

Earlier, I spoke with Daniel Cusworth, leading author of the study and director of science at Carbon Mapper, which is what the research teaches us about our dumpsites. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DANIEL CUSWORTH, DIRECTOR OF SCIENCE, CARBON MAAPPER: Solid waste emissions are thought to constitute about 20 percent of all human-made or anthropogenic methane emissions, both in the United States and globally. But the current methods to track that at the landfill level or at the national scale is really based on assumption and not based on empirical measurement. So we conducted a survey of hundreds of landfills in the United States using direct measurement with NASA technology called imaging spectroscopy to understand the complex dynamics of landfill emissions and what we found was that over 50 percent of the landfills we surveyed had very large outsized emission sources that can be localized to certain areas on the face of the landfills. So you might call these point sources and in some cases, these would constitute super-emitters. These are important because they're outsized in the total contribution that they make against that landfill sector. And they're just very hard to understand and characterize in absence of direct measurements and they're really ripe for mitigation activity or progress because they can be local.",

So anytime methane is admitted, we live with that impulse for about 15 years compared to carbon dioxide, which can linger for centuries. So that means that there's actually real short-term gains that we can realize if we go after methane emissions, because it gets removed from the atmosphere so much quicker. So it's a more powerful greenhouse gas but because it lives for less time in the atmosphere, if we prioritize and find the big sources of methane, we can really realize some great climate progress.

This year, it is at solar maximum, which means it's going off. And so when the eclipse happens, while most people on the ground will watch it for four minutes. Some very lucky pilots and scientists from NASA will fly special WB-57, 60,000 feet up into the sky and stay under the eclipse for six hours measuring the corona as it morphs around as the moon swallows the sun up there. And then there are other experiments involving rockets. It's hard to study the ionosphere with planes or satellites, planes are too low. Satellites in the wrong spot. So they're going to shoot three rockets into the eclipse, which will release these sort of two liter-sized instruments to measure the ionosphere. As the sun comes up wherever you are on the planet, those charged particles get really active and then they dim down as the sun sets, wherever you are. This affects communication on earth between satellites, between terrestrial communication. There are even some amateur sort of citizen scientists who are participating on Monday, by using their ham radios to time transmissions and see how the ionosphere activity is changing over that four-minute period. It's so easy to nerd out about this stuff, such a rare glimpse to share the sense of wonder, both as spectators, but just think about how excited they are at NASA headquarters.
