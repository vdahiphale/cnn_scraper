      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, French President Emmanuel Macron sparksmajor debate in Europe after saying he's not ruling out Western troops in Ukraine, the rest of Europe says otherwise. Also ahead, Hamas and Israel seem to contradict President Biden who raised hopes that a Gaza ceasefire could be possible by next week. This, as the reality on the ground worsens every day. The head of MSF joins me this hour. And then later, the White House today talks of incredible importance as Mr. Biden and top congressional leadership try to break the deadlock on foreign aid and a looming government shutdown. But first, this evening, President -- French President Emmanuel Macron has come under fire for suggesting the West might deport troops to Ukraine. But despite that backlash, the Elysee isn't backing down. A palace source says Ukraine's allies must debate the issue. The source says there are all kinds of things ruled out two years ago that are no longer ruled out. And that France fears giving credence to the possibility that Russia can win. All this after Mr. Macron's comments -- if you remember, on Monday, and to be clear, the French President didn't actually say he wants to send troops to Ukraine. He only said, it's been discussed with other leaders. Here's what he told reporters after Ukraine Aid Summit. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) EMMANUEL MACRON, PRESIDENT, FRANCE (through translator): There's no consensus today to officially send support and to take responsibility for troops on the ground. But as things develop, nothing should be off the table. We will do everything necessary so that Russia cannot win this war. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Officials from a growing list of countries -- you can see there, including U.K., Germany, Spain, Italy, Slovakia and Poland all say they have no plans to send their forces to Ukraine. And NATO official tells CNN the alliance won't be deploying combat troops either. And the Kremlin has also responded following Mr. Macron's comments. A spokesperson says conflict with Russia is inevitable if the West sends troops to Ukraine. And we've just seen the last few minutes, in fact, that the  State Department has also commented on this. The State Department reiterating that President Biden has ruled out sending U.S. troops to fight in Ukraine, in response to Macron's comment saying, sending Western troops to Ukraine cannot obviously what Macron had cannot be ruled out. So, we have response now from the U.S. State Department. Our Melissa Bell joins me now for more. And Melissa, I mean, it's clear that -- as we've just outlined there, the European leaders have been pretty swift in their response to Macron's comments.

I'm joined now by Rym Momtaz; she's a Research Fellow for European Foreign Policy and Security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Welcome back to the show. You would have seen -- you would have heard them, Melissa Bell talking about this in detail, but you would have seen Rym, the European leaders being kind of very swift, very quick as well, and tough on their response themselves, really trying to distance themselves, I should say, from Macron. What do you make first of all, Rym, of how Macron framed it here? RYM MOMTAZ, RESEARCH FELLOW FOR EUROPEAN FOREIGN POLICY &amp; SECURITY, IISS: So, for -- you know, unlike his usual way of talking, Macron was pretty prudent in the way he answered the question, what had happened is that before this conference that he had organized with about 20 heads of state and government, mainly from Europe to look at how European countries can do more to support Ukraine in its fight for survival. The Slovak Prime Minister had raised this issue of possibly sending Western troops to Ukraine. He had not talked about Western troops engaging in any kind of frontline combat, of course, against Russian troops. And so, at the presser, Emmanuel Macron was asked to comment on that statement by the Slovak Prime Minister, and he basically said this had come up during their conversations. And there are discussions during that conference, and that nothing could be ruled out. And that the main message should be to send to Russia is that the Europeans are going to do everything that is necessary in order to ensure that Russia doesn't win. So, he was quite non-committal because -- go ahead, Isa, yes.",

So clearly, not backing down at all. But we've all -- we have heard in the last -- well, few hours, I should say, support or so, Rym, from some allies. Well, a friend of the show here, the Lithuanian Foreign Minister who said -- I'm going to bring it up, \"Europe's fate is being decided on the battlefields of Ukraine, times like these require political leadership, ambition and courage to think out of the box.

You heard Schumer talk about how the meeting was intense, but he also called it productive. Now, he said that Biden in this meeting really emphasized what's at stake when it comes to the government shutdown, Biden emphasized that it will really do significant harm and damage to our economy. And when it came to passing aid to go to Ukraine in its fight against Russia, they really emphasized -- this is what Schumer said was that Biden was really talking about how Ukraine really needs this aid. And if they do not get the necessary funding from the U.S., then they will potentially lose this war against Russia. So, as you can see in the days ahead, lawmakers say that they're going to come together and really try to negotiate a deal where both sides are happy. But at this point in time, Schumer says what's urgent and what's important is passing funding to keep the government open and to be very fast and to try to pass something when it comes to Ukraine aid. Now, House Speaker Mike Johnson stressed the importance that he's focused on these two priorities as well, but he made it clear that he wants to see something happen at the border, and that addressing issues at the border is his top priority. So, Schumer and Johnson are going to have to come together at some point in time and try to work out this deal on where both sides are going to get kind of what they want or meet in the middle or compromise to try to make something good happen when it comes to providing aid for Ukraine and also providing the necessary funding to address some of the issues alongside the border.

Dating back to Ronald Reagan in the 1984 campaign when he was facing questions about his age, and he made one of the great jokes of all time in presidential debates about it. But the question is, will voters buy it? I think it's a deep concern of many voters, not just about Biden's age now, but the fact that he would be 86 by the time that his second term would end. I don't think the White House is addressing that effectively so far, and they've been late to this question, which I think is really quite pervasive among people throughout the country.

So, almost 80 percent of those surveys support the protests and 46 percent strongly support those protests. 79 percent say that the influx of Ukrainian food needs to stop and they don't accept the argument that this decision could hurt Ukraine, which is fighting Russia. And according to that new survey, I'm quoting the survey for OKO.press and Tok FM, the people surveyed support the farmers more than they support the E.U.'s Green Deal. In another survey, almost 70 percent of participants blamed the E.U.'s decision to open the European Union market to Ukrainian agricultural imports for the difficult situation of Polish farmers. Now, the Polish Prime Minister, Donald Tusk, said that the E.U. has to solve the problems created by that decision. \"No one has the right to think that the Czech Republic and Poland do not support Ukraine, but, but we will work together in Brussels for corrections that will protect our market against the negative effects of this decision,\" Tusk said. The Speaker of the Lower House of the Polish Parliament, Szymon Holownia, met with the farmers today. He said that all of the problems they highlighted will be solved, but that -- also the undoing of some of those decisions at the E.U. level will take weeks. He also stated that the E.U. should create a mechanism which would allow the food surplus to be bought from the farmers, and that mechanism could perhaps allow for those products to be moved somewhere else, perhaps to Africa. He also said that perhaps European bureaucracy created a situation where some unnecessary burdens have been placed on Polish farmers. Also, he added the E.U. subsidy system should be improved. After meeting with representatives of the government, the protesters said that no agreement was reached and that they would protest again one week from tomorrow.",

For the second day in a row, Jordan and Air France -- and France I should say, dropped food and other aid to people in Gaza. This time helped by the UAE, Egypt, as well as Qatar. Jeremy Diamond shows us how desperate operations led to some very desperate scenes. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DIAMOND (voice-over): Gaza's humanitarian crisis looks like this. Palestinians desperate for food, paddling and swimming out to sea, after at least one plane airdropping aid appeared to miss its target, sending pallets of food crashing into the sea. In Central and Southern Gaza, hundreds crowding the beaches to try and secure their piece of the rations. But this is the other side of desperation. Groups of men wielding whips and bats, steering crowds away from their precious cargo. Months of hunger and war triggering fights for survival, when there is not enough for everyone. This is what they are fighting over, ration packs, a lifeline for the lucky few. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I was lucky and able to get one of these aids. But what about all those other people who were not able to get this aid? Look, this one didn't get any, and this one didn't get any. DIAMOND (voice-over): But so much more is needed. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I'm asking from the Arab nations, we are thankful for the aid through the parachutes, but we need more, and we need it distributed in a better way. This will not stop our hunger. We don't need a capsule, because when we eat this, we will eat it. And that's it. It's finished. DIAMOND (voice-over): But nowhere are people more desperate for food aid than in Northern Gaza, where women and children wait in long lines for what now passes for food. A cloudy soup mixture made with dirty water and whatever grains can be found. AMAL MOHAMMAD NASEER, GAZA RESIDENT (through translator): There is no food or drinking water. No flour or anything. There was no cooking oil. Not even drinking water. Death is better than this. DIAMOND (voice-over): Humanitarian aid deliveries this month dropped by half compared to January, according to a United Nations relief agency, which blamed Israeli military operations and the collapse of civil order in Gaza. In Northern Gaza, aid groups suspending aid delivery amid looting and attacks on aid trucks, leaving many with few options to stay alive. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Look, we are eating animal feed against our will, but have to eat it. DIAMOND (voice-over): Without food or clean water, their voices are all they have left. AHMAD ATEF SAFI, GAZA RESIDENT (through translator): The suffering of Gaza is extremely difficult. Where are the authorities? Where is the government? Israel made us hungry, and our government made us hungry, and people are stealing. Shame on you, Arabs. Where are you? DIAMOND (voice-over): But after nearly five months of war, is the world listening? Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Tel Aviv. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Essential, yes, but being able to have humanitarian workers who can carry out sustained high quality medical care is a complicated thing in any resource poor setting. Let alone one where there's ongoing indiscriminate bombing. And that's really why we keep coming back to the point of making this really exceptional call for MSF, which is to call for an immediate ceasefire, a sustained ceasefire and a ceasefire without conditions. Because without the indiscriminate bombing stopping, civilians are going to be arbitrarily killed in the way they have been for the last few months, and we're not going to be able to provide high quality medical assistance.",
