I think what the -- what we need to see now is, is not just the opening of the Kerem Shalom crossing sustainably, but the -- we need to see a real surge in the number of trucks that make it that make it into Gaza. There are thousands of them being lined up on the Egyptian side. I think what the -- what we are doing with the U.N. and other agencies is just trying here. I mean, really with the scale of needs and, you know, the compared -- the aid that is coming in, we're barely scratching the surface here. I think what we're looking at here is probably the worst humanitarian catastrophe that we have seen in the Middle East over the past decade. And, you know, the Middle East has seen what it has seen over this decade. We need some serious negotiations now for a ceasefire. We need serious negotiations for, you know, an upsurge in the number of trucks that make their way into Gaza.

For every day this is delayed, people die. For every day this is delayed, the situation gets worse. As bad as it is and hard to believe it can, it does.

No one knows. And I know that, you know, pressure can come in from diplomatic corridors, from the U.N., from Arab countries, Arab states as well.

And now 50, you know, 50 of my colleagues themselves have been displaced. They hardly, you know -- their children hardly eat. Their children are now intense and there is no hope of going back home anytime soon for these people. [00:10:16] I mean, it's going to take months to just clear the rubble from all the destruction.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Ten Americans who've spent months and years imprisoned in Venezuela are now back in the United States. Six men who were officially listed as wrongfully detained by the U.S. government touched down in San Antonio, Texas, Wednesday night. Among them, Joseph Cristella, Eyvin Hernandez, Jerrel Kenemore, and Savoi Wright. ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We have no higher priority than doing everything we possibly can to bring our fellow citizens out of harm's way. LAVANDERA (voice-over): Also included in the deal is Leonard Francis, the infamously corrupt military contractor known as Fat Leonard. He was the mastermind of the largest bribery scandal in U.S. naval history. He fled to Venezuela after his conviction in 2015. The U.S. had eased some economic sanctions against Venezuela as the country took steps to open its elections and agreed to return Alex Saab, an ally of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Saab was facing prison time in the U.S. on corruption and money laundering charges. The Venezuelan government is also releasing 20 political prisoners, some seen leaving prison by a CNN team in Venezuela. The Biden administration says this deal is a sign of improving relations between the U.S. and Venezuela, and part of its effort to push the socialist dictatorship toward more democratic reforms. But the deal comes as the Maduro regime is threatening to take over part of a neighboring country. Guyana sits just east of Venezuela, and Maduro wants control of the small country's oil reserves. And a senior administration official says Maduro still faces criminal charges in the U.S., including drug trafficking and corruption. President Biden is vowing to keep the pressure up on the Venezuelan president.",

You know, we do have evidence in polling and I think even this case has the potential to have the impact where the indictments obviously have not been a huge problem for Trump, even in the general electorate, certainly not in the Republican primary electorate. But there is reason in polling for him to worry that actual convictions by a jury of his peers or courts of law on the serious charges he's facing would have more of an impact on the willingness of voters to put someone who has been convicted of a serious felony back in the White House.
