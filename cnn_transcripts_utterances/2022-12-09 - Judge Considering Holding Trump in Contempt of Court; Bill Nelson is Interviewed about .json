And so they do not want another situation where there is a search warrant, where the FBI is showing up and searching Trump properties. That's why they hired their own team. And they have told the Justice Department, look, we searched these four properties, we found these two documents with markings, we've handed them over. The Justice Department is saying, this is not good enough. We need you to designate a custodian of records. You need that person to sign a statement saying that we have handed over everything in our property with these classified markings. The Trump team has been really resistant to do that, in part because they think anyone they designate is immediately going to be in legal jeopardy and they're not going to be able to find a person who can comprehensively state, yes, we know exactly what's been happening with these records since Donald Trump left the White House, how they've been managed, how they've been stored.",

And what they'll have to show was that there was some intentionality, some knowledge by Donald Trump's team that they knew they weren't really handing over all the documents, that they were intentionally withholding some documents. If they can make that showing, then the judge has the power to say, OK, I hold Donald Trump's legal team in contempt. And the penalties there in this case are primarily going to be financial.

The committee has sort of slowly dolled it out bit by bit and now Merrick Garland just said last week, he said, we still don't have all the evidence. We want it. We need it for our investigation.So, whether the committee makes a referral or not, it certainly seems they will based on our reporting. That's politically significant. That's a strong statement.
