You have Netanyahu making the case for why it's so important to hold on to this poorest part of the border into Gaza, which would be the transit, this sort of overland route from Egypt into Rafah, into southern Gaza, where Hamas is able to get so much of its supplies. And he's trying to sell a very skeptical public who has just seen six Israelis die. He's trying to sell them on we cannot fold even as you want a hostage deal. I wonder how you think he's able to convince them or not. ROB D'AMICO, FORMER DEPUTY OPERATIONS CHIEF, FBI HOSTAGE RESCUE TEAM: We'll see. What I see on the negotiation side, he's still passionate about that. You can just tell his body language. He is not -- this has been his -- his setting point that he's not going to give up. So I think that we know that now. We know why he's coming to the public and saying this is why. Yes, it's cost us Israelis now but, in the future, it's going to cost us a lot more Israelis if they can easily bring weapons in through a border that is not controlled by them. And he pointed out -- and he goes back in time to where this was also an issue. So I think it's really him looking at a national security thing that he just cannot take off the table because he sees what the cost is going to be down the road. Everyone -- when your families are involved or you have personal acquaintance involved in the hostage thing, it's so hard if they're involved in the negotiations because you're looking at this from a different point of view. And you can't blame them. But he's looking at it down the road and the number of Israelis I think that he knows that will be lives will be taken because of the ability to get weapons. It'd be like opening up our southwest border to the drug dealers if we're trying to go on the war on drugs. That's where it's all going to come from because Egypt is not going to guard it like Israel is.",

I can't say very enough. Not only happy Labor Day to everybody out there, but I moved here from Pittsburgh. My son is a steam fitter in Pittsburgh. Joe Biden is loved in Pennsylvania. He beat Donald Trump there. This is one of the places she really needs him. And another reason why I told folks that she picked Tim Walz, Tim Walz has a great labor record. And in Pennsylvania, much like Michigan that you were just talking about, and Wisconsin, there's a big -- this is one of the last bastions of old-school white working-class folks who worked with hard hats, work with their hands every day, and take a shower when they're done with work.",

ERIN PERRINE, FORMER COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR TRUMP'S 2020 CAMPAIGN: There's certainly risk with bringing Joe Biden out on the campaign trail. The risk was seen and it was felt certainly for Democrats after the early debate, which pushed Joe Biden off the ballot. Well, it's nice to have him out there. The closer that Democrats and Kamala Harris get to Joe Biden, the more a reminder that this is not a change election, but more of the same. Kamala has said in interviews that she would continue to pursue the foreign affairs strategy of the Biden Harris administration, that this would not be much of a change election. And that change idea right now is really what is propelling Kamala forward in the polls. If they continue to have her with Joe Biden at campaign events, they will begin to lose that change narrative, right now, which is helping them bringing in those marginal Independent swing voters that are so critical to a successful campaign in November.",

Last year, the military mandated active-duty servicemembers, who meet the criteria, enroll in what's called the Exceptional Family Member Program to help ensure for that their families are assigned to locations that are best suited to accommodate their specific needs. But according to a Department of Defense survey, only 43 percent of these families are satisfied with the support that they're getting. We're joined now by Michelle Norman, the executive director and founder of Partners in PROMISE. It's a group that advocates for military families with special needs. Michelle, thank you so much for joining us to talk about what's really is -- this is a critical issue to the military and keeping people in it. You started this group after dealing with a gap in assistance firsthand. You're seeing less than half of families surveyed are satisfied. I suspect you were not surprised by that number. MICHELLE NORMAN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR &amp; FOUNDER, PARTNERS IN PROMISE: Absolutely. So a little bit of background about me. I have been a Navy spouse for over 29 years. And I am a mother of a beautiful adult young adult daughter who has spent her entire life within this military system and in the EFMP program that the survey was made for. And I was fortunate to testify a little over 4.5 years ago in front of Congress to talk about the issues that our military families with disabilities face. And our families are struggling. They're struggling for that to have some continuity of care of their loved ones as we move so very often within this highly mobile lifestyle. We move, as you know, every two to three years. And so that really did lead to a co-founding Partners in PROMISE where we conduct research. And we also are able to use that data to be able to inform, educate and empower our military families. Because what we're finding through that research is that that really is a gap of support. Every time we move from these station to another, our families, they are waiting. They're waiting months to get medical care every time that they move from one station to another. They're waiting months for individual education programs, which are the special-ed programs our kids are in, to be able to receive the supports and services every time they move. And so you can see it's a cycle each and every time you move. Finally, by the time you do get those services, you're up and moving one more time. So, again, our kids are falling through the cracks. And EFM Program is supposed to be able to make it a little bit smoother. But as you noted, some of the data supports that that's program is not working the way it's intended to be.",

You know, maybe they put up with one duty station where their kid is not getting what they need.But often the second time this happens, they're thinking, I'm wanting to get out of the military.
