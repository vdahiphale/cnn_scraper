I'm Zain Asher. You are watching CNN Newsroom. Just ahead, going to the polls, millions across the UK are casting their ballots. We are live outside a London polling station. And U.S. President Joe Biden vows to remain in the presidential race, while his challenger Donald Trump claims that he is not fit to serve.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his wife voted earlier in Mr. Sunak's Yorkshire constituency in the northern part of England. Labour leader Keir Starmer and his wife cast their ballots in London, also voting in London, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey, also joined by his wife.

We have seen, of course, weeks of campaigning taking place. Today is the crucial day where voters are heading to the polls. As you mentioned, polls open at 7 a.m. this morning. They will close at 10 p.m. local time, around 5 p.m. Eastern Time in the U.S. And of course, it's then that the action really starts, the vote counting begins. And many people will be staying up overnight to watch that counting process, with the results coming in constituency by constituency. Now, of course, we do expect to see exit polls overnight, but the official results will be declared tomorrow. That counting will take place into the early hours of Friday morning. So, many will be staying up to watch those results come in. At this stage, of course, we are a little restricted on what we can report because of those restrictions around the coverage of this election so as not to sway voters. But, we've been seeing many people coming into this polling station behind me throughout the morning. They will be continuing to come in to cast their ballot until 10 p.m. tonight across the country. And of course, many will be waiting to see those first initial exit polls later tonight, just to get a sense of where this country is heading in terms of the next government. A number of key issues, of course, on many voters' minds. This will be an election that really captures the attention of all across the country. Zain.",

As you noted, our colleague, MJ Lee, yesterday pressed White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on this issue, and she specifically asked whether the President had undergone any medical exams since his physical in February. She answered that question, saying, no, he had not. This morning, the White House is saying that the President did in fact receive an examination from his doctors in the wake of the debate where aides had said that he had been experiencing a cold. This White House spokesperson said that several days after the debate, the President was seen to check on his cold and was recovering well.The White House official described this checkup as a brief check into the President's health following his experience on that debate stage with that cold. It also comes as POLITICO is reporting that the President had privately told the Democratic governors gathered here at the White House that he had undergone a medical checkup after that debate. But, it all comes at a time when many Americans continue to hold concerns about President Biden's health and ability to serve into a second term.

But, what you also may notice is just how windy it is, and that is part of the issue here, spreading fires. We've seen some places where the fire has burned down a house, and right next door to the house, it's totally fine.What's also noteworthy is that here in California, according to CAL FIRE, we've seen a 1,600 percent increase in the number of acres burned so far this year versus last year. So, you're talking about 7,500 acres burned at this time last year compared to more than 130,000 acres burned so far this year. Part of the issue is that the last two years had been very, very wet, and that means that's given a lot of growth of vegetation. That's the problem. In fact, take a listen to what CAL FIRE says this means for the fire year. NICK SCHULER, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, COMMUNICATIONS &amp; INCIDENT AWARENESS FOR CAL FIRE: This winter we had a significant amount of rain, but with rain brings growth, and the challenge with that is that fuels and vegetation continues to dry out, and in California, that spells the next large wildfire.",

We understand from an Israeli official familiar with these discussions that mediators will be talking to the Israeli leadership in the coming days to decide if they need now to go to the next phase of negotiation. It's effectively the Israeli Prime Minister's ultimate decision whether he would do that or not. But, it seems as though there is something that they can work with. At least this is what we're hearing from the Israeli side. So, it is creating some hope.But, I should caution, we have been here a number of times before, only to see the talks stall. From Hamas' side, they've said that they're looking at this positively. They have said that they've reiterated the fact they want a permanent ceasefire and they want a complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. Now, the difference now from the last time when these talks stalled several weeks ago is the fact that we've now heard from the Israeli Prime Minister that the level of intensity of the fighting in Rafah appears to be coming to an end, not saying the war is coming to an end, but certainly that fighting in Rafah is coming to an end. So, potentially, from the Israeli military and political point of view, they may feel that they're now at a better point in their minds where they can agree to this complete ceasefire. But, as I say, this is an ongoing process. It is one where we have believed to have been close to an agreement before, only for the talks to have stalled. Zain.",
