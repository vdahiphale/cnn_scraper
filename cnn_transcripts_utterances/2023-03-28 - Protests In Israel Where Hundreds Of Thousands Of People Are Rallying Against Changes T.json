      "sentences": "Coy, it has been a record-breaking season of snowfall across the sierras this year. Take a look at this video.The snowfall piling up as high as a two-storey house and then some. This video is even taken back on February 28, and they`ve had even more snow since then. But here`s the thing about the sierras. It`s broken into three separate categories. You have the northern, the central, and the southern region of the sierras. And all three of them, when you look, have actually been very impressive this year. But specifically, the southern sierras picking up 200, 86% of their snow water equivalent. What is that? Basically what it is. It takes into account all the snow pack that`s on the ground. But then if you melted it, what would the water equivalent be? And in the case of the southern sierras, it`s been record breaking snow water equivalent. But how does this year compare to other years in the past? Let`s break it down. This year has been extremely impressive, 228% of normal for that snow water equivalent. When you look back at the previous years, they haven`t even made it to normal amounts, let alone the impressive amount that we`ve had so far this year. But one thing to note is the impact it`s had on the drought. Now, when you get numerous systems like this and we`ve had at least a dozen atmospheric river events back-to-back, basically all of that water has to go somewhere. It`s not just the rain coming down from the sky, but it melts some of that snowpack. And then all of that water flows into rivers, creeks, and streams, and also onto roadways, into homes, into businesses, because those rivers, creeks, and streams end up becoming swollen and it`s too much for the ground to absorb all at once. Now, in the short-term, however, though, this has been very beneficial for the short-term drought. Look at California just back on December 6, when we had the extreme and exceptional drought categories. Fast forward to just a few days ago. Not a single portion of California is in those exceptional and extreme drought categories anymore.",
