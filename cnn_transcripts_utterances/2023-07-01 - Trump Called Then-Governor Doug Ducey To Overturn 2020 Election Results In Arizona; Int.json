Jim Acosta has the day off.And we begin this hour with new evidence of former President Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election. A source telling CNN that after the votes were cast, Trump called then Governor Doug Ducey of Arizona in an attempt to pressure him into overturning his state's results. Sources say the former president also pushed his then vice president, Mike Pence, to help him in this pressure campaign. CNN's Jeremy Herb joins us now. All right, Jeremy. The former governor is downplaying this alleged call. What have you learned?",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right, Paula. The former governor's spokesman basically said that this call is old news. And while it is true that we knew about this call after it happened in 2020, what we're learning today is new details about what President Trump said to former Governor Ducey. And sources telling CNN that the president pressured the governor to try to find enough fraud so that he could overturn the results of the election in Arizona.We're also learning from sources that President Trump pressured his vice president, Mike Pence, to go to Ducey to also take part in this campaign. And while Pence did speak to Ducey about the election, a source tells CNN that he did not follow through with the request to pressure the governor. Now if this sounds familiar, that's because it's similar to what we heard from the Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, in 2021. Trump asked Raffensperger to find enough votes for him to win the state of Georgia. There are a few key differences. And the first one is that request that Trump made to Raffensperger to find votes. We have not heard from our sources that that's what he asked Ducey. He asked Ducey instead to find fraud. And that is a key distinction particularly could be affirmed when it comes to the special counsel's investigation. The second distinction here is that there is no recording, according to our source, of this Ducey call unlike the Raffensperger call. One thing that's interesting here is that we actually have video of what appears to be President Trump calling Governor Ducey in the middle of Governor Ducey -- his certifying the election in 2020. You can watch the tape here. And you'll see here that Governor Ducey, he's signing the papers to certify the election. And you can't hear it on this video, but he gets a call. It's a \"Hail to the Chief.\" You can actually kind of hear it a little bit there. You hear that ring tone. And what Governor Ducey said was he had set that ringtone early in the year specifically so that he could get a call from the White House and know it was President Trump or Vice President Pence. In this case he chose to ignore that very call. Now in a statement to CNN, a spokesperson for the governor, as you said, Paula, downplayed the significance of this call telling CNN, \"Frankly nothing here is new nor is it news to anyone following this issue the last two years.\" The spokesman also said that Ducey has not been contacted by the special counsel. In a statement he said that -- sorry, excuse me. In Arizona's 2020 election, he certified the election, he made it clear that the certification provided a trigger for credible complaints backed by evidence to be brought forward. None were ever brought forward. Now while Governor Ducey has not heard from the special counsel, we know the special counsel is interested in a number of these state- level officials including Secretary Raffensperger. So this will be an interesting story for us to watch and see if it develops further in the investigation -- Paula.",

If there's not, they very well could come back and say, we looked, there is nothing there. So it's -- there's nothing about that that particularly surprises me.

You know, while I may not agree with everything that they were doing, that is an investigation that's run by professional, experienced criminal prosecutors.But it is more along the Mar-a-Lago side of things where they were not trying to seek any cooperation. They were being a lot more oppositional. They were, you know, allegedly threatening a witness' attorney. They were committing misconduct before the grand jury, things like that.",

They're required under the rules to remind everybody that these are mere allegations, the defendant is innocent until proven guilty.And then the defense attorney has the opportunity to respond. So this whole thing has been very oddly handled by them.

Now, whether or not it's going to be a bloody house cleaning, sort of like Stalin and the other guys did during the great terror when you had so many people who were killed simply because there was some question about them, or whether it's a little more subtle than that, hard to tell.Putin certainly knows how to do that and has all the tools. We've seen the tools of assassination that he has, but it is interesting that although President Lukashenko in Belarus says, oh, yes, Prigozhin is here, as well as many of his forces, we have yet to see any real evidence of Prigozhin himself. There has been a little bit of evidence that he is coming out, that the forces might be arriving.

So it is important to speak to the Russians in language that they use themselves and that they understand. So when the director of CIA calls and says, for example, this is an internal matter, we had nothing to do with it. I don't know how many times I've heard, you know, standard argument of internal affairs from autocracies like Russia and China. So it's important for them to hear that from us. It has not only a calming effect on Russia, but it robs them of a propaganda opportunity to say, oh, well, this was a foreign intervention of some type.
