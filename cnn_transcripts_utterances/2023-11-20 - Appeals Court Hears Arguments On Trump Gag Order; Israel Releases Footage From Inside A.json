We start this hour with dozens of newborn babies who were trapped in a war zone now safe. Earlier today, a convoy of ambulances made the treacherous journey through Gaza to the Rafah Crossing, where medical staff were ready, waiting with incubators to transfer the newborns to Egypt, 28 babies in all. Their fight, though, far from over. Doctors say that every one of them is battling serious infection, their transfer the latest fallout from Israel's controversial raid on the Al Shifa Hospital last week.",

That was back on October 7, the day that Hamas carried out the massacres in Israel.You can see one person apparently being rushed through by force and another on a stretcher. Now, the IDF also shared footage inside a tunnel shaft on the hospital compound. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is tracking this story in Sderot, Israel. Jeremy, Israel is claiming that Hamas was using Al Shifa as a command center. What evidence of that have we seen so far? JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, the latest evidence that Israel has presented is certainly the most concrete that we have seen so far of evidence of tunnels below Shifa Hospital, but it stopped short of proving Israel's broad claims about a massive command center below the hospital. The Israelis insist that evidence will eventually come to light. But what we are seeing right now from the Israeli military is this video showing a drone going down this tunnel shaft, where you can see some kind of a spiral staircase. And then, in the tunnel shaft there's video, perhaps taken by a robot with a camera or some kind of an animal with a camera, going down multiple meters down this tunnel. You can see the kind of curved ceilings that are very typical of Hamas tunnels in the Gaza Strip. And then it arrives at a door, which the Israeli military says they have yet to open because they fear that it may very well be booby- trapped. Now, again, the Israelis have made broad claims about Hamas having a massive command center below Shifa Hospital. We have yet to see evidence of that. But, meanwhile, the Israeli military is also answering questions and criticism and condemnation of a strike on the Indonesian Hospital in Gaza. Twelve people were killed, according to health officials in the Gaza Strip. And the United Nations -- the World Health Organization, actually, is condemning this, saying that they are appalled that a military would have struck a hospital. The Israeli military, for its part, says that it was responding to gunfire from the hospital, from militants inside the hospital. They say that they did not fire any shells at that hospital, but, again, just the latest incident that we are seeing of civilians, in this case, patients and at least one medical staffer, being caught in the crossfire.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, this was a really treacherous, dangerous journey from Al Shifa Hospital.And, of course, you have just been talking about Al Shifa and the war basically that was brought to their doorstep. Many of the patients there and the doctors described being trapped inside, including was neonatal babies. They eventually had a corridor, a safe passage to leave. And they made that journey yesterday, going to the Emirati Hospital at Rafah. They had to be stabilized. But I want you to think about just what it meant to be in Al Shifa Hospital as a premature baby, no oxygen, no real access to milk and clean water, no real heating, no incubators. So we're talking about very catastrophic conditions. And the doctors in Al Shifa Hospital tell us that five of the neonatal babies, tragically, died. There were 36 initially that the Egyptians were waiting for. They got 28 today. It was a big move. The Egyptians had been waiting for over a week, and they had been describing how ambulances and doctors were waiting at the border every single day, going home disappointed that they weren't able to evacuate these tiny little babies. And we have seen the images, the crying and just what it was required in terms of medical intervention. Eleven of those babies, according to the World Health Organization, are in critical condition. They are all fighting infection. They had to be stabilized first, because they apparently were very stressed. On the Egyptian side, they have all been taken to hospitals. We know they already are in safe hospitals at the moment and, of course, being assisted as much as possible. We know that they're very underweight, which is indicative of the fact that they didn't have enough milk. And, of course, those incubators were absolutely vital. Now, we caught up with the Egyptian health minister last week, and he was telling us that he was receiving images of three babies being put into one incubator, which, of course, is not viable, when such a vulnerable patient needs to be taken care of with every little resource available. But it wasn't a possibility in Al Shifa. The Egyptians say that only four mothers were accompanying the 28 babies and six nurses. They don't know where the rest of the family members are, whether they're alive. But we know international organizations have said they're going to try and track some of the family members now. But now the most important thing, the priority is to get the babies stable and, of course, focus on their health in the coming days.",

There are multiple groups potentially holding them beyond Hamas, as Islamic Jihad reportedly had some of these hostages held. So you could argue that these hostages are probably broken up in multiple locations controlled by various factions. And that's the challenge. They're in such a large number, and the fact that they're in the tunneling systems. And a lot of -- we know that the Internet service has broken down. Cell phone towers have broken down, so the communication challenge to try and get information on where these hostages are. That's why I don't think the world has seen a dynamic situation in terms of international hostage crisis to the scale and scope that we're seeing in Gaza, which just complicates everything and that, if a deal is made and can be pulled off, it will indeed be a miracle. MARQUARDT: Avi, we just played those videos at the IDF released showing the hostages that were taken to Al Shifa Hospital. We have now seen that -- more of that tunnel that the Israeli military found in the hospital complex. Do you believe that the IDF needs to show more conclusive proof of what they have alleged is a large-scale command-and-control center?",

This has been reported in previous rounds of fighting, including by \"The Washington Post\" and other journalists, who reported seeing Hamas terrorists roaming the hallways of Al Shifa.And there is obviously a very broad knowledge of an underground complex that exists there as well. I think the expectation that Israel was going to unveil this dramatic complex immediately were somewhat far-fetched. You have to understand, Al Shifa is a massive, massive hospital complex, and Israel did not want to go in with all its forces, which, of course, would have caused significant damage and loss of life. It did so very deliberately, very slowly. And as things have been uncovered, they have been revealed to the world. I would not be at all surprised if we saw additional findings coming out in the days ahead as Israel continues its very careful and deliberate approach in the hospital complex, ensuring that as many individuals and innocent people are spared as it goes to uncover the Hamas terrorists infrastructure that exists at that site.",
