I think it's more likely they will win one or two.Nigel Farage will almost certainly, I think, win his seat, which is Clacton. He will be in parliament then, and so, therefore, he will be a prominent voice and he will be something that the conservative party have to deal with.

We see it in France with Emmanuel Macron.In the post pandemic world, governments are very unpopular. A lot of the cost of living crisis that came out of the post-pandemic environment that we all had to live through, that has caused a lot of voter resentment. People call it inflation poison. So the conservatives, not only did they have COVID, they had to get through Brexit, which, of course, was very tumultuous. Whatever one thinks of it, right or wrong, it was very difficult for the conservative party to get through that moment. So they had Brexit, and they were just with Boris Johnson had this big victory in 2019, and they just seemed to be on the cusp of coming together and pushing on as a successful government when COVID struck. And then they had to go through all that. And it was COVID that got rid of Boris Johnson, who was probably the most charismatic.

He has been very good at maintaining party discipline in a party that is really struggling with party discipline and had a very radical left that he's brought into line in many ways. He will be Britain's first openly atheist prime minister, which I think is an interesting aspect not often talked about. I mean, 30 years ago it would have been impossible to think of an atheist British prime minister. And now it's very interesting that nobody talks about it. But there are fears among some conservatives that he's much more radical than he's let on, radically left wing, I should say, and that to some extent he's been a submarine candidate who once he gets into power, will be far more left wing than probably most British people are comfortable with.",

So the overall number might not be catastrophic, but the pace at which that dropped it is significant, but beyond that, I think the bigger -- the bigger percentage to look at is, and I'm not trying to make a case here, I'm just thinking like if I'm Biden's advisers, I'm looking at the 72 percent of Americans who don't think he has a fitness. I'm looking at the 74 percent of Americans who think he shouldn't be on the race. At this point in time, even though the Democratic bench is very deep and there are lots of folks who can step up to the plate who would do better than Biden, it's risky to do it last minute. It's risky in terms of fundraising and moving those funds over to a new candidate and selling that new candidate. And this is not somebody who's been tested and Biden has been tested. So there are all of these reasons why maybe Biden should stay in the race and the biggest one maybe being that people in positions of power don't like to give up power that's why Donald Trump is running again. But the end of the day, it looks bad for Biden. He started with very low approval ratings and those have only dropped and time is very short.",

I will say as somebody who researches the presidency in gender and race, being a woman of color means that she will have some barriers with some voters that are non-Democratic. But that's a fact. And so there are questions though about, ok, so let's say she's not the most competitive in the bench if you passed her over, do you disaffect black voters, do you disaffect voters of color in the Democratic coalition. So that's a risky move. There are lots of kind of safer bets with, you know, white men who are not going to face those barriers, I think for example, like a Pete Buttigieg is going to face LGBTQ plus bias. Josh Shapiro is going to go in to face Jewish bias. And if you're looking at this from a pure strategy perspective, you put a white dude in there who doesn't have any marginalized identities that might cause some voters to be turned off.
