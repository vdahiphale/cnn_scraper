And the eclipse reminds us it's always available to us.Next month, people should take a drive out to outside a city to see the Milky Way. That's always available to us. So I just have to say, before we go anywhere with the science, I just really needed to say how beautiful this has been. Your coverage has been great. And I've really - I'm getting all but clumped.",

And I know you're only a few minutes away from totality. But what I want you to notice are the color changes that your eyes are going to see. The camera will not see those color changes, but your red cones will not see the reds anymore as we get darker and darker and darker.So red things like my tie maroon will turn black and yet my blue shirt will stay blue because it's a different wavelength, a longer wavelength. So that is one of the cool things that we're going on right now. But something else that's going on, it's dark out there. This is a visible satellite of what the satellite is seeing in the cloud cover. No, the clouds didn't go away. They are still very much here, trust me. But the satellite can't see them visibly anymore. We can only look at them temperature wise. And yes, we have storms firing as we thought. There's already a new tornado watch that was just issued for east of the path of totality. That's some good news. At least we're not over the people that are there. But certainly if you're traveling back home tonight, you want to keep an eye on the weather because this isn't really over down here yet. In fact, just getting started. Even for Harry - Harry - looked like he was, like, doing the pig pen dance out there in Buffalo because there was clouds and mist and the maid of the mist everywhere. Maybe it's clearing up just a little bit coming in from the west, we'll see. There's a chance. The other chance here is down to the south, too. We are going to see, of course, the severe weather today. So we'll keep an eye on that.",

That's the fact of the matter. We lose in football, but we come back the next season. We lose the sun because of the clouds, but that is not going to get in the way of us having a fantastic time. I always thought that I was so into snow, and that was the biggest weather event that I could possibly have. And I was almost joking about those people who chased the solar eclipses. What are they doing? Now I understand what they're doing. Because - I mean, unbelievable. Unbelievable, that's the only word. Unreal. Look at these folks. And then the sun slowly but surely is no longer shielded by the moon, and the light is coming back. But for those few moments, those few moments, we felt something truly miraculous. And there it is. And now it's over. But for that brief moment in time, we felt something that very few of us will get a chance to ever see again. We haven't had an eclipse in Niagara Falls in 99 years. We're not going to have one - another one, for another about 120 years. And I'm just so grateful that my job allowed me to come out here and experience this, because there are very few people who are as lucky as I am to be able to witness an event such as this. I just don't even know what else to say. You know I'm a man of many words, but in a moment like this, I can only help but be a man of very few words, guys.   SANCHEZ: It is something amazing to experience, as we just did here in Indy. So, Harry, we totally relate to that sentiment. I don't think that Buffalo Bills construction worker could be so poetic. That was incredible, Harry.

So it is not time to take off your solar eclipse goggles just yet. That has to be in complete totality.The crowd here is obviously peering up into the skies. They've got their cell phones out. You can see some hooting and hollering. We all hear it. I'm going to put my glasses back on and talk you through what I am seeing. And what we cannot wait for is that moment when the shadow of the moon races across the planet, across the valley to my right here at 1,500 miles an hour. That is going to be phenomenal. Here it is. You can hear the incredible sounds here from the spectators, the umbraphiles, listen in.   Moments before totality and I want to explain to you another rare occurrence that is happening right before our eyes. We've witnessed this. There is cirrus clouds, which are ice crystals in the sky, and you can see a circle that forms around the sun. The solar eclipse has a parhelic arc. There it is, scattering the light around the sun. I'm expecting that to completely disappear as we go under complete darkness and complete totality. I'm seeing right now, this is incredible, the diamond ring effect. This is what we all wait for, that moment for the moon to cross in front of the sun. Listen. Yes. There it is. Yes. Listen to this crowd. Look at the stars that have popped up. Look for the planets. Venus will be to the west. There is a comet that is visible to the naked eye. This is just incredible to see. Right now, we are in a solar maximum. It is an 11-year cycle. Look at the fellow umbraphiles. We are seeing a moment that is just transcending this actual experience. I mean, we are watching Baily's beads.
