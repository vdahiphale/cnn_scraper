We don't know because we don't know exactly what he said to prosecutors. A source close to Patel insists that he will continue to be, quote, \"loyal\" to the former president. What does that mean to be loyal when you're answering questions from federal prosecutors about potential crimes happening on federal property? I don't think we'll know Patel's definition of loyalty until we learn more about what he told prosecutors.",

Let's take a look at these numbers. If we look at illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths, all of them have nearly doubled in the past week. Hospitalizations rates have not been this high this early since 2009. The obvious step we all need to take, get a flu shot. It is not too late. The season hasn't peaked yet.

And it protects 77 percent against RSV hospitalizations. That is a really impressive number. And it could be in the U.S. by not this winter but the following winter. They have already applied to the FDA for approval. I don't know if you, Bianna or Victor, know anyone who has children who had RSV, it is terrible. When I think about the people I know -- a dear friend of mine, his son, my nephew, you have this very healthy baby and, all of a sudden, in what seems like five minutes, your child is in the ICU.
