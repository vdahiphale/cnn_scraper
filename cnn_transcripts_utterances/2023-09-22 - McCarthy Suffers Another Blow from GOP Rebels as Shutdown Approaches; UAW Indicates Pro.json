He says, more workers at multiple General Motors and Stellantis locations will join the picket line, but he raised hopes that progress is being made in talks with Ford. So, they will not expand the strike for now at Ford. Just Stellantis who makes, you know, Dodge and other things, and GM, but not Ford.All right. CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich here with the breaking news.

But he did signal that Stellantis and General Motors needs some pushing. Sudden real progress at Ford. And he said that Ford went ahead, and in their latest offer, reinstated cost of living adjustments, something that the workers gave up in 2009 and were fighting for.But he announced 38 locations with GM and Stellantis now going on strike. That is all of their parts and distributions center. So, that is a key component of the manufacturing process for General Motors and Stellantis. He said that that is going to happen at 12:00 p.m. noon. So, just in a short time, we're going to see those workers head to the picket lines, across various states, joining those three other plants that were initially on strike. The one Ford plant that was initially on strike, that Ford plant will stay on strike but no additional Ford plants will be authorized to strike. So, we should not see any more Ford workers heading to the picket lines.",

There was some hope in what he was saying. That they could get there. That they could make deals with all three, Ford leading the way on their offer. General Motors and Stellantis needs some pushing, according to Shawn Fain.But as we have seen with the three plants that are on strike right now, there have been ripple effects. So, we have seen layoffs at the direction of the companies. We have seen Ford announce layoffs of 600 people. General Motors has idled 2,000 people. Stellantis about 70 people with 300 coming, just because of those three plants that are on strike. So, you imagine as you now have 38 additional locations for General Motors and Stellantis. We could start to hear from those companies that additional ripple effects, these layoffs, will soon follow.",

And at the time, everybody was like, what is going on here? We've been kind of tracking that group for the last two years. Most of those -- the hundreds of people who were there that day went home, but some stayed and left their families and ended up living in Dallas for months at a time.

The kind of long story short of this belief is that, you know, JFK Jr. Faked his own death, he's working with Trump to save America, QAnon type cabal stuff.

There are 43 million prescriptions for amoxicillin and that includes the liquid formulations which are the ones on shortage and also the pill and tablet formulations written in 2021.This shortage started in October of 2022. And really, you know, from drugmakers, there are four listed on the FDA's drug shortages website, only one of them actually gives a reason, and that is increased demand. But when we reached out to these drugmakers, one of them came back to us and pointed out this is a really inexpensive drug. It costs about $10 per bottle. And if you compare that with some other medicines, for example, Keytruda, this is a very popular and powerful cancer medicine that's newer, that costs $10,000 -- more than $10,000 a dose. And so, drug shortages experts I've talked with point out, a drug like Keytruda, that's not going to go into shortage unless something really bad happens, because the incentives are there to make sure there is enough of that drug. But for cheap medicines that are generic like antibiotics, $10 a bottle, the profit margins are so small it's really difficult for drug companies to find the incentives to invest in those.",
