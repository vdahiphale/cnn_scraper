That is down from more than a million on Friday.And more than 12,000 of those homes without power are in western New York. And many of them also without heat after the storm dumped nearly four feet of snow there. We know a driving ban is in effect for Buffalo as blizzard conditions have made roads impassable with zero visibility. Buffalo could still see another 14 inches of snow with alerts still in effect until tomorrow morning. And we are monitoring a briefing from officials later this hour. But, right now, CNN correspondent Polo Sandoval is reporting from there. We're also joined by Erie County New York Sheriff John Garcia. Great to see both of you. Polo, let's go to you first.

You're talking people have basically been stuck in their homes all weekend, so officials are sending out those crews as soon as they could to make sure they could provide some kind of help.This is what it looks like right now, actually. We saw a plow truck just go through here a short while ago. But you mentioned those guard members, Jessica. They are going to be such a tremendous help for first responders, many of whom have been working for at least two days straight, if not more. You see this has been an all-hands-on-deck situation as they work to respond to calls for help over the weekend. As we heard -- over the weekend from Erie County officials that this was the first time in the fire department's history that they were unable to guarantee a response to any kind of medical emergency. And, sadly, we did see -- or we did hear from authorities who confirmed that among the people who died as a result of this storm are individuals that could not receive help from EMS during the height of that storm when these roads were just impossible to drive. I mean, you're talking - you couldn't even look beyond your hood, that's how bad the situation got here today. So, today, there is hope that as those weather conditions do continue to improve, even if it's just a little bit, they're going to be out there to provide any kind of help for folks who need it.

I know that one Erie County official told my colleagues earlier this morning that the Buffalo Fire Department historian said that this storm was the first time ever that they couldn't respond to emergency calls because of how severe those conditions were.

I think the toll -- that toll is going to go up. And, again, you know, when you have 420 EMS calls that are unanswered, it's just gut-wrenching. And, you know, Buffalo, we deal with snow all the time. Back in November, during Thanksgiving, we got bombarded with snow. But the conditions were different because with the gusts of wind, I could tell you firsthand, zero visibility. I couldn't see two feet in front of my vehicle. And we had to rescue deputies. We had to - so, we brought in snowmobiles, UTVs, ATVs. When fire rigs are getting stuck, that heavy equipment, you can imagine what happened to the public. And people went out.

You have to make sure that those drains are ready to take the water or else your roads are just going to freeze.Something else that's going on in the airports, too, I've been noticing this morning. Some of the planes and the crews are not where they're supposed to be. There's a plane in Atlantic City but the crew is stuck in Chicago. So, you can't get that crew on that plane because it's not going to get there. There's nothing going -- so this is going to take a long time to filter through. Buffalo had 43 inches of snow on the ground as of yesterday morning. We're still waiting for the update from this morning. That number is likely over 50. Why does that matter? Because if you add a few numbers to this, 93 or so inches of snowfall this season, the normal is 95 for the entire winter. And it's still snowing. They probably had between six and 10 inches of snow overnight to add to that 43. Here comes the snow still. It's the cold air coming over the warm water. Big snow is just on the (INAUDIBLE) side of the lakes. Big snows in parts of Ontario as well. You don't want to kind of focus on that. We don't have any crews up there, but there's a lot of snow around Barry and places north of there, coming off of Lake Huron and also Lake Superior. But there's the warmup. There it is right there.

Over the holiday weekend, some were forced to sleep outside in the freezing temperatures. At least 300 people spent Christmas Eve at the El Paso convention center.

They said the buses came from Texas. They were supposed to go to New York City but were diverted because of the weather there. And they said this is just part of the stunt that Texas Governor Greg Abbott has been pulling for months now as buses have arrived on almost a weekly basis, including to Harris' home. Now, the administration, in the meantime, has to keep preparing for what may happen at the border when Title 42 lifts, if and when it lifts. And that includes helping cities like El Paso and also keeping an eye, especially at the White House, at the Supreme Court and what they decide.

And that is what's worrying. That is what the Pentagon has watched, not only, of course, over the weekend, but over recent weeks. China launched 47 aircraft into Taiwan's self-declared air defense identification zone. And that means that 47 of those aircraft crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan says there were 71 total aircraft that China launched in -- rather around Taiwan, but a number of those didn't cross that crucial centerline of the Taiwan Strait.China said these exercises, as they called them on Sunday, were in response to provocations from the United States, though not specifying what specific provocations there were. Crucially, though, these come just days after President Joe Biden signed the NDAA, the National Defense Authorization Act, that had a number of measures for Taiwan, specifically to help Taiwan. Take a look at this. Crucially a defense modernization program for Taiwan's military, as well as a contingency weapons stockpile for weapons on Taiwan in case there were a conflict, a military engagement or an all-out effort by China to try to take Taiwan by force. It also authorizes the president to give Taiwan up to $1 billion in weapons and munitions. China always looks at those as provocative and generally responds when there is an announcement of a foreign military sale of U.S. weapons to Taiwan. So, you see - you can see this in that broader light of trying to carry out exercises, trying to show the force of its own military whenever you see, or shortly thereafter seeing efforts from the U.S. to aid Taiwan's military and strengthen Taiwan's military.
