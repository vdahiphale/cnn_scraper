So, Donald Trump put out a statement about Kamala Harris not being here. Kamala Harris saying, look, her schedule, as you might imagine, because she was just sort of ended up at the top of the ticket was very tight. She couldn't make it here or virtually at the time. Now they're planning something for September, but Donald Trump capitalizing on that saying she is disrespecting the National Association of Black Journalists by not being here and he is showing up. From the people that I've talked to here, from the journalists that are here, no one feels disrespected. They are here to listen to this robust conversation. They are hoping that some of the issues that have been brought up in the past about the Black community vis-a-vis Donald Trump will come up and they're expecting them to. But this is really a packed house. So, anyone who was extremely upset about this. They've shown up here, there are more than a thousand people. Every single chair has been filled here inside of this large convention hall inside of this Hilton. And there is expecting to be news made today because of some of the questions that will be asked, this all came together over the past 36 hours. It's when we all learned that Donald Trump would be here. But the Harris campaign is also responding to some of the sleight, some of the attacks when he called her for example, crazy Kamala is not showing up. And she's like, look, he needs to be fact check. They're very concerned about some of the lies that they believe he has told about the Black community and his role in trying to help the Black community. We will see what happens but we're expecting some news to be made this afternoon here, Boris, Brianna.",

This will actually be Harris's third time speaking of the Divine Nine event just this month as she is seeking to mobilize Black female voters heading into November's election.Now, the Divine Nine does not endorse political candidates but its vast alumni network, which includes Harris could try to mobilize both Black men and Black female voters heading into this election. She will be speaking here just a few hours after former President Donald Trump appears at that NABJ convention in Chicago. As was spoken about earlier, she's unable to attend virtually or in person due to her schedule this week. But the campaign is working with NABJ to try to schedule something either in person or virtually for September. But ahead of Trump's appearance there, the Biden campaign -- or the Harris campaign is pushing back and criticizing Trump saying that he has denigrated members of the Black media and attacked the media writ large. And they also have argued that he will lie about his record and what he has done for the Black community there. [14:05:04] Now, while Harris will be making -- giving her pitch here in Houston, Texas, she is also in the thick of searching for her running mates. She's continuing those discussions throughout the week at a time well we know that several of the contenders include Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, and also Arizona Senator Mark Kelly. And just a few moments ago, Harris actually sent an e-mail to her supporters asking them to sign up to learn first about who her pick will be. If she actually does announce this via text message or e-mail, it will actually be the same way that Biden announced Harris as his running mate back in 2020. He had told his supporters the very first time who his running mate would be via text and e-mail just four years ago. Now, Harris, once she has selected her vice presidential pick, she is expected to hit the ground running with that pick starting with a battleground state tour beginning in in Philadelphia on Tuesday, she is set to hit all of the battleground -- key battleground states with her new running mate, really giving American voters the first full view of that Democratic ticket. Now, I'll also know while she is here in Houston today, she's also set to raise more money for her campaign. I'm told that this Houston fundraiser came together in just four days and raised $2.5 million exceeding the initial goal that they set out, just another side of the donor enthusiasm for Harris since she launched her candidacy about a week and a half ago.",

And we'll see before too long, precisely what he's going to do.I would certainly expect him to focus a lot of his remarks on inflation, and on housing costs, and on the cost of rent. And on the economic issues that we know from poll after poll really resonate with African-American voters, regardless of their partisan identity. I think as we've been talking about Trump addressing the NABJ, and a lot of the kind of awful criticisms he's made targeted toward, especially Black female journalists, that has taken up sort of a lot of bandwidth and attention. But I do think it's important to remember that journalists are not really a constituency, they are part of the public. And the NABJ is a conduit to African-Americans all over the country who are news consumers, whether it's in print or on T.V. or on audio. And so, this is an opportunity for Trump to continue to court, particularly Black male voters, I think with the reset, and so much of what we're seeing this week is about President Biden's decision -- late decision not to run for re-election and the scramble that not only Vice President Harris dizzying to do but that Donald Trump and J.D. Vance are having to do to completely reorder their plans, their strategy, their messaging, enthusiasm among the African-American community and younger voters and voters of color has shot up measurably in recent days. We don't know how long that's going to last. Can she carry it forward to November? But now, former President Trump and his campaign have to reset the narrative around themselves and have to try to recapture some of the headlines, if not -- if not all the enthusiasm, and that's part of what we're going to see.",

      "sentences": "Well, Boris and Brianna, no change from the Federal Reserve that was widely expected. But there is some good news here for borrowers. The door does look like it's wide open for an interest rate cut at the next Fed meeting in September, which by the way, is the last time the Fed meets before the election.Now, the Fed made some significant changes to the statement that they just put out a few moments ago, adding in some new language about the jobs market, saying that job gains have \"moderated\" and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low. That is brand new language, they did not have in there during the last meeting. The Fed also said that the committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of the dual mandate. Remember, the Fed is responsible for not just inflation, but also for keeping the jobs market healthy. So, this is Fed speak for interest rate cuts could be coming soon. That makes sense because thankfully, prices are no longer skyrocketing. They're still going up but just at a more gradual pace. And yes, there are some cracks in the jobs market, the unemployment rate is still low, but it has moved noticeably higher. Remember, the Fed spiked interest rates two years ago to multi-decade highs, right, trying to put this inflation fire out. They've held rates. As you can see, I'm not sure they held rates at these very high levels for the last year. But now they do seem to be setting the stage for a potential interest rate cut in September, Fed Chair Jerome Powell, he's taking questions from reporters in just a few moments. So, Wall Street's going to be on high alert for any more significant hits, hints of an imminent interest rate cut. And then as far as what all this means for borrowers, this, of course, would be good news, if the Fed is finally able to cut interest rates. If you're out there trying to get a house right now, obviously, mortgage rates are very high. This would mean they would go lower, same thing for trying to finance the purchase of a car, student loans and everyone who's trying to pay off credit card debt right now. Record high credit card rates. So, that would all be very good. And of course, there'd be political implications to here. This would give Vice President Harris and her running mate something else to talk about, that inflation isn't just down, borrowing costs are as well, but Republicans of course, would be criticizing the Fed for any pre-election interest rate cut, Boris and Brianna.",

This was all started with a bad energy policy by Joe Biden.By the way, just if I might, I was running against a man named Biden, you probably saw that. And he was losing very badly in the polls. And then he had a rather bad debate. I would say it was a bad debate, I would say it was one of the worst, worst debates in history. And his poll numbers crashed. And instead of saying, you know, let's keep going, and maybe something happens the other way. They said, oh, we're going to replace him. Let's just replace him. That's like you're in a fight. A prizefighter is in a fight. He's not doing what you say, let's bring in another fighter. So, our whole campaign was steered toward him. And now we have to steer it to her. But ultimately, it's the same because they have bad policy. They have policies of open borders, unbelievable open borders, horrible energy policies, they want to get rid of, as you say, gasoline and cars, they want to get rid of oil, they want to get rid of efficient, efficient heating, environmentally what they're doing is killing our country. They're absolutely destroying our country. But the inflation is the thing that's hurting the Black worker, the Black population and every other population within our country. Inflation is the worst it's been I think it over 100 years. And they'll fact check it, they'll say it's only 58. Whatever it may be, they don't add all the numbers. They don't add the really bad numbers. And you can check that too. But inflation Harris is absolutely destroying this country and the people in our country. Yes, ma'am?",
