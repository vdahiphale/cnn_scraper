That's according to the European Commission president who posted the photo we just showed you a short time ago. The United Nations Security Council is holding an emergency session this afternoon. And in an Israel, the war cabinet meeting for hours, met to decide how to respond to Iran. One hardline Israeli minister not in the wartime cabinet, but in the cabinet, Bezalel Smotrich, called this a, quote, \"moment of truth\" that requires a firm response. Over the course of five hours last night, Iran launched about 170 attack drones, more than 30 cruise missiles, more than 120 ballistic missiles, according to Israel, which said that more than 99 percent of them were intercepted. Israel says a 7-year-old girl, an Arab-Israeli girl was injured by shrapnel in the attack. President Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu that Israel should consider the overall results a win and that the U.S. would not participate in any offensive operations against Iran. That's according to a senior Biden administration official. Let's bring in CNN correspondent Jeremy Diamond in Israel right now in Jerusalem to be precise. Jeremy, the Israeli war cabinet still meeting. Tell us more.",

The Israeli war cabinet is currently meeting -- has been meeting over the course of the last several hours to discuss what kind of response Israel will have to this large scale, unprecedented attack that Iran carried out on Israel last night. As you mentioned more than 300 drones and missiles. The first time that Iran has ever carried out a direct attack on Israeli soil.The fact that very few of those missiles actually made it through Israel's defense system certainly one of the components that this war cabinet is going to be talking about as they work to decide exactly how Israel will respond. One Israeli official put it to me this way. Will they go with a response that will, quote-unquote, \"break all of the dishes,\" or will they instead go for something more measured, something that will not further escalate this situation. We are already starting to hear from some of the members of this war cabinet, including Benny Gantz, who is Prime Minister Netanyahu's top political rival, but he is a member of this war cabinet that is making these decisions. And he said that Israel will, quote, \"exact a price from Iran in a way and time that suits us.\" We have seen in these videos from this war cabinet meeting that you have Netanyahu there, Gantz, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as the Israeli military's top general, top intelligence official. So all hands on deck certainly for this moment, Jake, that could certainly be a major inflection point for the region.",

I do know that Israel has a very clear military doctrine and that is that they respond to attacks by responding to those with something much more severe. It is how they have survived. This is a country, a Jewish state that on its very first hour of existence was attacked from multiple directions by multiple countries, and it has not stopped since then.They have faced constant existential threats to their existence on a repeated basis throughout their history. In fact, their history is defined by that. And so they have made the decision on their military doctrine that they respond to attacks on Israel disproportionately and it is the reason why we have not had another 1973 or a 1967 situation. Now, look, this is -- I imagine that Israel does not want a full-scale war either. And one of the ways they have prevented it in the past is through the kind of deterrence that comes from firm attack. So I expect that they will respond. I don't think they're going to ask us nor do they need us to help them in that regard. Ours has been largely a defensive posture. What I don't understand is why Joe Biden and the administration would leak to the media the contents of a conversation in which he tells Netanyahu he doesn't think Netanyahu should respond at all. It is the continuing part of this public game that they are planning which frankly encourages Iran and Hezbollah, which we haven't even talked about, and the Houthis and all these other elements that are targeting Israel.",

They're not asking for that. They're not asking for it. But I think we go from that to the other extreme, which is Joe Biden telling Netanyahu, take the win, don't do anything, and then his people leaking it to the media, leaking it to the press. And what it sets up is they know that Israel is going to respond. They know this for a fact. So why would the White House leak it? There's only one reason they leaked that, and that is that so when Israel does respond, the White House can say, we told them not to do it, and at least somehow, in some way, appease these so-called peace activists, by the way, the so cease-fire now people, who were out yesterday cheering the launch of hundreds of rockets and drones and missiles against Israel. People that are out there cheering military attacks of this scale and scope are not peace activists. These are antisemites, anti-Israel, pro-terrorist elements out there, and we need to stop calling them peace activists. They are not peace activists. You don't -- peace activists do not cheer massive attacks against other countries, which is what they were doing yesterday.

I think it really demonstrates how it's astonishing that we are not standing firmly with Israel, and there should never be any kinds of conditions and all that. When a nation can launch hundreds of drones towards Israel, I'm not going to be talking about conditions ever. And second, I think that also was Iran had to have some fireworks after Israel smoked that Iranian general. And I am here for that. And I think it's just a matter of theater, part of it as well, too.

Do you even know how many we manufacture in a year, Jake? Five hundred and fifty. We cannot possibly -- I have repeated this for years now. We cannot possibly support Ukraine and Israel and our own defense needs in the way that these guys demand. So I think we should focus. I think Israel is a much closer ally. It's a much more core American national security interest. And, of course, we have got to focus on ourselves. That means encouraging the Ukrainians to take a defensive strategy.

I think if we want to reestablish deterrence, the most important thing is not how we or Israel respond to this attack. It's how we focus on the long term, on rebuilding our country.People aren't worried that we're not thumping our chest enough. I know that's the John Bolton response to this. People think that the United States is a paper tiger right now. We have got to rebuild our manufacturing capacity. We have got to rebuild our capacity to support our own troops and our allies with weapons systems. That is what will reestablish deterrence.
