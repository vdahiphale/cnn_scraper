Again, three people are confirmed dead two of whom are police officers again police are confirming that to CNN.A number of questions are lingering tonight that we are trying to answer as we speak one exactly. Where did this happen? Was it a home? Was it a business? This has been described as both a shooting and stabbing but we don't know the exact timeline of how that all played out. At one point, there were reports that a manhunt was underway for a suspect a man wearing camouflage, wearing sunglasses, wearing a hat. That narrative seems to have changed according to local officials. There is someone believed to be barricaded inside some type of building in this general vicinity where this took place. In fact, we are also getting some reports, recent reports of the sound of a gunshot exactly what that means. And if this is related, that still needs to be seen. We should point out that as you mentioned that gun violence in Japan is very rare in 2018. Nine reported gunshot deaths compared to more than 39,000 in the United States. Just to give you some perspective, gun ownership also in Japan is relatively --",

And in just a few minutes, we'll take a deeper look at her life her legacy, which goes well beyond music as well. The Wagner Chief says his fighters are starting to pull out of Bakhmut the scene of the longest and bloodiest battle in Russia's 15 month war on Ukraine. For its part Ukraine says the mercenaries are being replaced on the outskirts of the besieged eastern city with regular Russian troops. But as Wagner fighters remain inside Bakhmut itself, it comes as Russia launched a new wave of air raids across Ukraine using 36 Iranian drones. But President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says none of them reached their targets. CNN'S Fred Pleitgen joins me now in Kyiv. Bring it all together for us, Fred.",

That of course, could be an extremely big deal because the battle for Bakhmut really has been the bloodiest and the most intense in Ukraine over the past couple of months.It was really something that this continent that Europe and basically the world has not seen over the past several decades, the intensity of the brutality with which these two sides were going at one another there of course, Wagner, known for tactics that were brutal not only against the Ukrainians that they were fighting but also on their own fighters as well, in part using people that they recruited from prison, that other times, using people that they made run towards machine gun nests, barely any sort of protection. So this morning, Yevgeny Prigozhin was pictured in Bakhmut, going through that town, going to his fighters, and telling them to essentially pack up their stuff, and that they were leaving now. He told them on this video that they were going to arrest, regroup and replenish and then await further orders. Let's listen in. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And certainly this was one of the most egregious moments in an awful 90 days in Rwanda in 1994, almost 30 years ago, where they people, many thousands of them sheltered in a church in Rwanda. This Fulgence Kayishema is now in custody.He is accused and faces indictments of war crimes and genocide. They purchased gasoline, they torched the church. And when that didn't kill the people inside allegedly, he got the heavy machinery to collapse the church with the people inside. This was one of the last major figures in the Rwanda genocide that was being tracked for many years by a team of investigators. There have been complaints over the years by the special tribunal that the South African government in particular was not cooperating in finding this man. But that has certainly changed. According to the Chief Prosecutor, I spoke to him a short time ago he said the South African government was instrumental over the last year. In finding this man he was tracked to near Cape Town apparently working on a farm according to the Chief Prosecutor, he said, well, all the cases in the Rwandan genocide are egregious. In this case, it was not just a mastermind, but a mastermind and someone who physically did the killing that they have now called. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
