      "sentences": "OUTFRONT next, the knives are out. Republicans lashing out at Republicans. McCarthy allies kicking Pelosi out of her office as retribution. This is our Congress, America.And the Donald Trump show is over. Those are the words of the New York Attorney General Letitia James, firing back at the former president who is on trial for fraud and could well lose his business. Plus, new troubles for Putin as video appears and we just have to show Russia shooting down one of its own prized fighter jets, as a former Russian journalist is sentenced for her bold antiwar protests on live television. She's my guest. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, chaos and fury. The House of Representatives has now been without a speaker, permanent speaker, for more than 24 hours. And right now, it's still all out mayhem, chaos on Capitol Hill. Republicans tearing into each other, blaming the group of eight, the members in their own party who kicked Kevin McCarthy out. And they're flailing to such an extent now that they are blaming Democrats. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MARKWAYNE MULLIN (R-OK): They're Republicans by name and registration only. If they were for the party, they would have done what was best for the party. Now we're not able to do anything. REP. DERRICK VAN ORDEN (R-WI): When Matt Gaetz said I want to make sure we get appropriations bills through and get back to regular order, the only word I can describe for that is he's either a fool or a liar. REP. CHIP ROY (R-TX): We don't have a single, with all due respect, Democrat, even I got some friends on the other side of the aisle, that are working with us. (END VIDEO CLIP) BURNETT: Now, on this Democrat point, just to be clear, Republicans took out their own Republican speaker because the party in power picks the speaker. The other party does not help. That is not how this works. For example, Pelosi did not get a single Republican vote. So that's not how it works. Whatever Democrats may get in place of McCarthy, though, it's not on them that he's gone. But that is not stopping Republican ire including from McCarthy himself. Because two Republican sources are telling CNN tonight that McCarthy was the one behind the decision to kick the former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the former Majority Leader Steny Hoyer out of their offices. In fact, our Jamie Gangel tonight reports that a Republican source tells her of the evictions, and I quote, Kevin is on a revenge tour, this was Kevin's call. The chaos is so bad that both sides in the Senate now are worried about what's next. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JOHN CORNYN (R-TX): Unfortunately, it means we can't do other things which I would like to be doing. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): The House can vote on no bills, no appropriations work can get done. SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA): It's messy. There is no denying that. SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL): We don't even know what's happening in the House of Representatives. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Others are saying they need to raise the threshold to prevent this from happening again, and also, Erin, one key policy issue -- Ukraine aid hanging in the balance.

And I appreciate your time, sir. So, the House is in disarray. It could be a week or more before we know who the speaker is. The business of governing is not happening, as you and I sit here tonight. Was your vote worth that? REP. KEN BUCK (R-CO): Erin, let's make something clear. When we got the schedule in January as to the weeks that we would be in session, we were out this week and next week in our districts doing district work. So, to say it's in disarray, it would've been in disarray if Kevin McCarthy was still speaker and we were still in our districts. We were not supposed to be convening this week or next week. The reason we were convening or we are convening is the fact that we have not passed the appropriations bills. We didn't start working on those in May or June or July. And we didn't take any time in August to come back and work on those appropriations bills. And the reason is very simple. This leadership team wanted to make sure that they jammed us as best they could by not passing appropriations bills and trying to pass a continuing resolution and then an omnibus, one large bill, at the end of the year. Twenty-seven years in a row, the House has not passed its appropriations bills. This year we have not passed a budget yet.
