      "sentences": "Thanks for joining us. The White House is telling Hamas leaders they should accept the latest proposal by Egypt to end the war in Gaza. One Israeli official tells CNN that mid-level Israeli security officials will travel to Cairo on Tuesday if Hamas goes as well.The leaders of Egypt and Qatar say they spoke by phone separately with U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday. They discussed the possibility for a ceasefire and a more permanent solution to the conflict. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is traveling from Saudi Arabia to Jordan on Tuesday. He boarded his jet just moments ago. He says the current proposal is, quote, extraordinarily generous. But inside Gaza, not much has changed. Early Monday, an Israeli airstrike killed at least 22 people in Rafah, according to hospital officials there. CNN senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman joins us now live from Rome with more. So Ben, what is the latest on Egypt's new hostage and ceasefire proposal, a deal that Hamas is considering at this time? BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well we understand that this proposal has two parts, Rosemary. The first part would involve the release of 33 Israeli captives currently being held in Gaza. And the idea is that for every day there will be one hostage released. So perhaps we're looking at the possibility of a pause in the fighting for as many as 33 days. Now, the second phase could go on for much longer. During that phase, the remaining Israeli hostages would be released. In exchange, Israel will release some of, it's not clear how many, the approximately 9,500 Palestinians, either prisoners or detainees, being held in Israeli jails. Now, a diplomatic source says that this proposal, the first phase and the second phase, would basically amount to a permanent ceasefire, in his words. Now, permanent ceasefire is a somewhat dubious idea, given that in the absence of an actual resolution of the Palestinian-Israeli struggle, it will be at best a temporary ceasefire that might last a little longer than usual. Now, we're now on day 207 of this war. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, 34,488 people have been killed. It's believed that at least 70 percent of them are women and children, in addition to thousands who are believed to be still under the rubble, dead, of course. Now, as you said, an Israeli delegation from Mossad, the Israeli foreign intelligence agency, is expected to go to Cairo today. We do believe, it's believed that Yahya Sinwar, the head of Hamas, will give some sort of response to the Egyptian proposal, either today or tomorrow. Rosemary.",

The administration is clearly in a hurry. Without this Israeli-Hamas deal, and they've been pushing as many people as they can, the Egyptians, the Qataris, anyone with influence on Hamas to encourage them to accept this. Without this deal, the administration can't even begin to deescalate Israeli military activity in Gaza, free any of the hostages, and or surge humanitarian assistance into Gaza, let alone activate and put on the table its regional peace initiative. So it's clear that the Americans are in a hurry. The Israelis, I think, are under a little bit of pressure, more pressure perhaps than any time since mid-November during the last exchange. The question is, I think, whether Yahya Sinwar, the only decision-maker on the Palestinian side who's ensconced in a tunnel somewhere below Khan Younis, Rafah, or maybe even in Sinai in a tunnel, whether or not he believes that this deal serves his interests. And that's, I think, very few people, even those intimately associated with the negotiations, can read what Sinwar wants. That's what it's going to depend on. And I just don't know what his calculations are. Trading hostages means giving away cards. He'll still have 50, even if this deal goes through. But at the same time, I suspect we probably are in a better position and closer than at any point since the last exchange in November to do a limited exchange, limited exchange.",

And you know the Israelis are tracking, potentially, trying to divine where he is, because where he is is where the hostages are. But after six-plus months, they still can't find him.I think it's going to be tricky for the Israelis. A permanent ceasefire, I think, is beyond their capacity to accept. And I just wonder, even if they agree to a sustainable period of calm for six weeks, even several months, they are determined to ensure that Hamas as a military organization is undermined and not in a position to do another October 7, and they're determined to kill the senior leadership. So you have to wonder what kind of commitment the Israelis are prepared to make. And above all, if in fact you don't get some sort of Palestinian governing structure or Arab force boots on the ground to maintain security, I don't think the Israelis are prepared to accept a situation where they cannot, when they want, enter Gaza to deal with the potential threat of a resurgent Hamas. Hamas is an insurgency, launching rockets or even trying to attempt another cross-border incursion. So I think that's going to be very tricky. And I think ambiguity here may well serve this deal. The question is whether or not, if this deal goes through and you can advance to a final stage, whether there's any way to create what I think everybody wants to see, which is a end to this war, security for the Israelis and much better security and prosperity, humanitarian assistance and reconstruction for the 2.3 million Gazans. I suspect there are a lot of moving parts of this, Rosemary, and I think whatever expectations there are for post-conflict stability, I think they're going to be sorely tested if you get through this phase and into the next.",

The U.S. says those violations happened long before the start of the current war with Hamas. Four of the units are said to have taken action to remediate those violations. But the U.S. could restrict military assistance to the fifth unit.CNN's Kylie Atwood explains. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  The State Department announced that they found five Israeli security units to be in violation of gross human rights abuses. That is according to the State Department deputy spokesperson. But all of these units are still eligible to receive U.S. arms. And here's the breakdown of what this process called the Leahy Act is actually looking like right now. Four of those units have actually taken remediation action that the United States has said is credible action. We don't know exactly what that looks like. Presumably, it's those who are involved in these incidents being punished. But we don't know particularly what the back-and-forth between the U.S. and Israelis on that is. And then with regard to the one unit, the one IDF unit that is still being looked at for these incidents, the United States is still in touch with the Israelis on this unit. The Israelis have provided more information to the U.S. on this, according to the briefing that we received. And the State Department deputy spokesperson, Vedant Patel, was very clear to say that remediation across the board is consistent with regard to all countries that are required to be looked at under the Leahy law because they are receiving U.S. arms to make sure there aren't violations of human rights abuses. But he also went on to say that remediation is also a country-by-country process. There's no time frame here for when this process needs to be concluded. So we'll be watching to see when there's a final decision over this IDF unit, if it is still eligible to receive U.S. arms. But as far as we know, that is still subject to the conversations between the U.S. and Israelis on the topic. Kylie Atwood, CNN, the State Department. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Vitel'Homme agrees to meet us on his turf. Flanked by his followers, he leads us inside this flashy mansion. And so is this your home?

Our dream is to rid the country of the corrupt oligarchs and politicians who are holding us back, he says. We need to get rid of the system and return stability to Haiti. He speaks with intention and calls for greater dialogue. But if it's the same system that's been in power, then as armed groups, we will never put down our weapons, he says. And so do you have regular communications with, as you say, the other armed groups? (voice-over): Yes, we're united, he tells me. The gangs have formed a coalition known as Vive Ensemble, or Living Together. And collectively they push back on foreign intervention, holding tight their grips over a fractured state, some using terror tactics like kidnapping, rape and murder to sustain control. Is that something you've participated in, in ordering your men and women to kidnap? (voice-over): He says he hopes to defend himself in court against those allegations. And while not denying his followers have kidnapped people, he deflects blame to outside forces for creating a state of corruption as he sees it. He's eager to show us parts of his home and territory and introduces us to his top commander. So you're his cousin? (voice-over): Security experts suggest Kraze Barye has more than a thousand armed gang members, including recently escaped inmates. As you can see, a lot of his armed soldiers and followers are around us. And he's suggesting that we follow and drive with them. (voice-over): He brings us to the edge of his territory. We notice his guards, normally curious and watching us, are instead looking outward, cautiously, toward another gang's territory. A reminder that the coalition of gangs might be more fragile than portrayed. In the midst of our tour, a disturbing video starts circulating on WhatsApp. It reportedly shows the devastating and deadly aftermath of an allied gang attack on a community a few miles from where we are. The destruction, the violence, the deaths that have played out. Do you take any responsibility for that? (voice-over): He only says he made mistakes and is not perfect. He blames politicians.

Coal is the world's dirtiest fossil fuel, and ending its use has been a controversial topic at international talks. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANDREW BOWIE, U.K. MINISTER FOR NUCLEAR AND RENEWABLES: (inaudible) historic agreement. Something that we weren't able to achieve in COP28 in Dubai last year. So to have the G7 nations come around the table and send our signal to the world that we, the advanced economies of the world are committing to phasing out coal by the early 2030's is quite incredible.

      "sentences": "Argentina and China have had a fluid commercial relationship over 20 years, since 2004. Regardless of who was in office, whether Peronist or not, all this time the relationship has grown till China became its second commercial partner.Until now. That is, with Javier Milei as president, who has said he was not going to do business with communists. Even though for years China was the principal buyer of soy, the main Argentina export, and of 80 percent of the exported ravine meat, the commercial relationship has been losing strength since 2023, with former Peronist president Alberto Fernandez. But now, with Milei in office, the European Union is about to take China's place. According to official statistics, Brazil is still the first, but in December as well as in March, the second place belonged to the European Union, and China has been relegated to the third place. Only in January, export increased by 10.7 percent, but the rest of the operations continue to have negative numbers. Despite the figures, the relationship remains strong. By 2020, Argentina was considered the South American country with the largest Chinese investment in infrastructure. Two years later, the country formalized its entry into the New Zealand route with the promise of new investments of more than $23 billion. Nevertheless, during his campaign, Milei said he refuses to do business with either China or with any other communist country. Some weeks ago, already as president, he has reiterated that he is not aligned with communists. However, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Argentina and the president of the Central Bank have traveled to China to revive commercial relations and ensure the continuity of the swap enforced since 2009. A portion of that swap, $5 billion, was used by Argentina to pay Chinese imports and to the IMF. 1.6 billion of that amount due in June, but as Milei said many times, there is no money. Now everybody is expecting the results of this trip. Will Argentina reinforce its relationship with China? Will pragmatism or the need for financial help impose over President Milei's wishes of not having a relationship with countries that he considers to be communists?
