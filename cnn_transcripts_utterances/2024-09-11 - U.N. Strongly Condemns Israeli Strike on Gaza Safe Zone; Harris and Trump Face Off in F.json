The U.N. spokesperson says: The Secretary-General strongly condemns Tuesday's Israeli airstrikes in a densely populated Israeli-designated zone in Khan Younis and the killing of civilians including women and children. The use of heavy weapons in densely populated areas is unconscionable. Gaza officials say at least 19 people were killed and 60 others injured in the strike. The IDF says it was targeting a number of senior Hamas terrorists in the area. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This was their first presidential debate, and she said Trump, quote, sold us out to China to, quote, improve and modernize their military.OK, let's dig into this. Now, Trump, when he was president, he launched the tech war and the trade war with China. In 2020, the Trump administration added China's top chipmaker, SMIC, and dozens of other Chinese tech companies like DJI and Huawei onto an entity list, effectively cutting them off from U.S. suppliers in tech. Now, look, condemning China has become an exercise in bipartisan unity in Washington, with both sides out to prove that they are tough on China, which is, of course, the world's second largest economy. And despite starting a trade war with China, Trump, he has showed an appreciation for Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Like, after he was a few years ago, you know, given this red carpet treatment during a visit to Beijing, Trump called Xi the, quote, king of China. He also praised China for becoming president for life and consolidating power. And during this debate, Harris took issue with that, slamming Trump for his affinity for Xi. Watch this.

Less than a day after the launch, the civilian crew of SpaceX Polaris Dawn mission has already made history, reaching the highest ever orbit around Earth, surpassing a record set during the earliest days of NASA in 1966. The crew hit a peak altitude of just over 1,400 kilometers above Earth a few hours ago. But there's much more on their to-do list, including the first commercial spacewalk set for Thursday. A retired NASA astronaut told CNN about the dangers of this mission. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And also having to depressurize the whole cabin of the spacecraft in order to do that because there is no separate airlock.And but, you know, after I considered it a little bit, I do know several senior folks at SpaceX. I know that they take safety very seriously. They're technically excellent. And so I have confidence that it's going to go OK. But it's still, as you say, it's risky to put a suit on, go outside and even more so with a brand new one while your crewmates, fellow crewmates are in a depressurized capsule. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And we will hope to bring you a live report on that just coming up.But for now, let's move on to the EU's top court that says Apple must pay more than $14 billion in back taxes to Ireland. It dates back to 2016 when Brussels accused Apple of getting illegal tax benefits. After the ruling, Apple said the European Commission is trying to retroactively change the rules and that the company's income was already taxed in the U.S. Chinese tech giant Huawei has revealed a competitor to the newly announced Apple iPhone 16. Meet the Mate XT, a model the company claims is the world's first tri-fold smartphone. The phone boasts a screen just over 10 inches long with three panels that can be folded up to three times. Do we need three times? Nearly 4 million of the phones have already been pre-ordered since Saturday, but it costs about $2,800 and that's just for the base model. Now, Australia is the latest country trying to rein in children's social media use -- talking about phones. It plans to introduce a minimum age limit likely between 14 and 16 years old, fighting concerns over children's mental and physical health. The government says it will first work on technology to verify the age of social media users before any laws go into effect. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says he wants to see kids spending more time outdoors. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The Pope will be meeting with young people for a discussion about inter-religious dialogue too. Also in the background to this trip is China. The Vatican, of course, seeking to rebuild its diplomatic relationship with China. It signed a controversial deal with Beijing in 2018 over the appointment of bishops. And I imagine that when he's in Singapore, the Pope will have a chance to swap notes with Singapore's leaders. Of course, Singapore has a good relationship or has historically had a good relationship with China. Both the Vatican and Singapore, small city-states with global interests. So the Pope will have an opportunity to try and improve the Vatican and the Holy See's geopolitical influence --",
