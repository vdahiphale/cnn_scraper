The people here want an immediate deal to bring those hostages back home. And they blame the government of Netanyahu, Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, for failing to secure the agreement. There's a sign over here, look, blaming specifically Netanyahu for the deaths that we've seen, the six hostages who were executed by Hamas last week, and all the others as well, abandoned by Netanyahu. They're all shouting, now, now. People don't care at this point here what the price of that deal is, whether it's territorial evacuations by the military inside Gaza, whether it's the release of hundreds of convicted Palestinian prisoners, some of them convicted on terrorism charges and held in Israeli jails, these are the things that are the sticking blocks for a deal at the moment, according to all the people negotiating it. But there are a growing number of Israelis now that are angry that more is not being done by the Israeli government to get those hostages out of Gaza as soon as possible.
