That is the time when the water at the base was known to be contaminated with a chemical called TCE. The veterans and family members could now be eligible for benefits. CNN's senior medical correspondent, Elizabeth Cohen, is with us now. Elizabeth, toxic exposure of servicemembers has obviously been an ongoing issue for decades now. What did researchers learn in this case? DR. ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, researchers were looking at exposure, the Marines exposed at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, to Chloroethylene. It's a chemical used in all sorts of manufacturing processes. It was in pretty high levels, very high levels in the water for decades at Camp Lejeune. And so what they did is they did something very interesting. They compared the rates of Parkinson's disease for Marines who were there at a certain period of time to those who are -- to Marines who were at Camp Pendleton. So all Marines just in two different places. They found the risk of Parkinson's was increased by 70 percent among the Marines at Camp Lejeune. And the concerns really -- for this study, this study was just about Parkinson's disease but there are also concerns about links between this chemical and things like miscarriages and cancer -- Brianna?",

The bill's fate is now back in the hands of the state legislature where a Republican super majority could override that veto. CNN's Dianne Gallagher is tracking this story for us live from Charlotte, North Carolina.

      "sentences": "Boris, next is that expected override vote in both the House and the Senate. But that's the key.You mentioned that Governor Cooper has been zeroing in on specific Republicans. And that's because of the margins here in North Carolina. Republicans have the exact number of members to make up that super majority. What that means is they can override the veto. But what it also means is that if just one Republican either defects or is even absent, that the veto would be sustained. Effectively killing this bill. And that is why the governor has essentially traveled across the state. This sort of pressure campaign on those four Republicans that he has zeroed in on. Now two of them have pushed back, Senator Michael Lee and Representative John Bradford, saying they don't feel that their past positions are in conflict with this bill. But there are two others that most politicos here in North Carolina and constituents as well are watching very closely. One of those is Representative Ted Davis. He is the only Republican in the House who did not vote for that abortion bill when it was rammed through less than 48 hours after it was introduced about a week and a half ago. He has told CNN he has no comment on this pressure campaign or how he will vote. And then there's Representative Tricia Cotham, who you may remember infamously switched parties from Democrat to Republican just last month. She did vote for this bill just about a week and a half ago. But she also is a sponsor on a bill from earlier this session that would have codified Roe. And she has been a major proponent for abortion access for more than a decade here in North Carolina. The governor, again, is homing in on that and asking constituents to make their voices heard. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. ROY COOPER (D-NC): Now we need people all over this state to learn how bad this bill is. And maybe it will be a friend, a family member, a minister or even a doctor of one of these Republican legislators who convinces them to step up and do the right thing. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Why the outcome could be critical for the U.S., also for NATO.And a kayaker's relaxing fishing trip interrupted by a giant shark. It was all caught on camera. We'll see more just ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [13:40:26] KEILAR: Turkey's consequential presidential election is now headed for a runoff as its leader, the current president, faces the biggest challenge of his 20-year rule of the country. Nearly all the ballots have been counted. No candidate hit the 50 percent threshold needed to win outright and avoid a runoff. State-run news reports that the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, leads with just over 49 percent of the vote while the leader of the opposition just under 45 percent of the vote. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh is in Istanbul for us. I guess the big question now is, where do the votes of the third-party candidate, who got close to 5 percent, go? I imagine there are spirited negotiations under way.",

He spoke a short time ago with our colleague, Becky Anderson, saying that he is in consultation with the rest of his four-party coalition to decide where they're going.It's quite complicated. This is an ultra-nationalist who was running as a presidential candidate in this election and his electorate just over 5 percent of the vote. It's a combination of nationalists who are not happy with President Erdogan's alliance. And then you've got, on the other hand, some of these protest voters who were not happy with the choice of candidate that the opposition went with. So we'll have to wait and see what happens, whether they're going to follow whatever this presidential candidate, Sinan Ogan, decides in the coming two weeks, or are they going to go their own way and decide to vote for either of those candidates in the next round of voting? And then you've also got the undecided voters, Jim. We'll have to see if there's any major changes. But we have to look at President Erdogan's performance here, Jim. Going into these elections, everyone knew this was going to be a tight race. But he has divided expectations. This is not a victory that the president is used to but it certainly is a win. Ahead of the elections, polls had the opposition's candidate, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, with a slight lead. And now you look at it, and it's the other way around where President Erdogan, despite all the criticism, despite the fact that his ratings have been on a downward trajectory, he has managed to gather around 50 percent of the vote. A real reflection here of the state of polarization in this country -- Jim?",

The parents of all four victims were there to accept their loved one's degrees posthumously. Saturday's graduation was exactly six months after the students were killed. The man charged was a graduate student at nearby Washington State University. Also, a lone fisherman off the coast of Hawaii unexpectedly -- look at this -- drifted into -- it looks like a scene from \"Jaws.\" A giant tiger shark jumping out of the water trying to eat, attack his kayak. He was only about a mile offshore from Oahu. [13:45:02] A go-pro camera mounted to the kayak captured this sneak attack. The fisherman luckily was not hurt. He just kept on fishing after kicking the shark away. And Taylor Swift taking time out of her own concert in Philadelphia to defend an audience member. She was in the middle of singing her hit song \"Bad Blood\" when she suddenly started yelling at a person in the crowd, who one person, actually my producer, Margaret, who went to this concert, said appeared to be security at the concert.

The Memphis Grizzlies have now suspended him from all team activities after another incident involving a gun and social media.An Instagram Live video over the weekend appears to show him in a car flashing a firearm. CNN has reached out to Morant's representative, the Grizzlies and the NBA for comment. Remember, in March, the NBA suspended Morant for eight games after another social media incident, that time a video, again on social media, showing him at a nightclub flashing a gun. Joining us now is Bomani Jones. He's host of the ESPN podcast, \"The Right Time with Bomani Jones.\" Bomani, you've spoken out with your concerns about Ja Morant's mental health. You say that we're watching someone self-destruct. Why? BOMANI JONES, HOST, ESPN PODCAST \"THE RIGHT TIME WITH BOMANI JONES\": Well, I mean, obviously everything we've seen him do has been trouble for no actual benefit. The idea of pulling out these guns, things that look like guns, whatever they happen to be, to put that out for public consumption, the only thing that you can get from that is trouble. He seems to be willingly walking into these things. What I can't help but wonder, from where I am, is whether the pressure that comes from being 23 years old and having the burdens that he has, that come along with his job that everybody else says they would love to have, but and he's the only one that has to live with the consequences that come from it. I worry more about how he's doing than anything else. I think hopping up on some hyper-moral kick about the idea of him having a gun gets us to our American confusion about guns. But in the short run, and just looking at how it affects him, I just worry that he keeps doing things that don't hurt anybody but himself as of now.",
