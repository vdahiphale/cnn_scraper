Hamas failed to come up with yet another list of women and children that could be released. And we know they're holding additional women and children, not combatants, not female IDF soldiers, but innocent civilians, women, and children that they have that they couldn't put on a list and turn that in. So unfortunately, the negotiations have stopped. That said, what hasn't stopped is our own involvement trying to get those back on track and trying to discuss with those partners and all those interlocutors, see if we can't get it back in place.(END VIDEOTAPE)",

So, that there is early indication suggesting that this may have been a family dispute that took an absolutely horrifying and bloody turn.It was just past five Sunday morning when 911 dispatchers received a call from a young caller telling police that her cousin was killing her family. It was shortly thereafter, two police officers arrived on scene and that is when police say they encountered a knife wielding suspect identified as 38-year-old Courtney Gordon. After this altercation, investigators say that Gordon attacked these two officers. Those officers sustained non-life-threatening injuries. One of those officers opened fire shooting and killing the suspect. And it was shortly thereafter that they were able to discover an 11- year-old little girl who had been killed at the scene and that the house there in Queens was on fire. It wasn't until firefighters were able to extinguish the flames that police went inside of the home and located three additional victims. A 12-year-old little boy, a 44-year- old female and a man in his 30s. Additionally, we understand that a woman in her 60s survived the attack and is currently listed in critical condition.
