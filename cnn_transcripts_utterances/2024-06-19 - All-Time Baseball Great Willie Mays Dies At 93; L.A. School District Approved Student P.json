People speaking, the vibration of the telephone, a ding that emanates from the telephone may actually alert someone who wants to cause harm to the students. We're going to evaluate all of the options, the benefits, also the challenges, and come up with the best possible way of securely, safely isolating students from the cell phones during a period of time when they should be engaged in learning, social interaction with one another, and not be victims to social media attention that is causing harm to them.
