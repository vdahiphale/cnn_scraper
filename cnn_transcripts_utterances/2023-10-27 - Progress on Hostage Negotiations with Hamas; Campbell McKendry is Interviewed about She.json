But the negotiators say that there are still issues that remain. CNN's Becky Anderson is joining me now. Becky, what are you hearing at this point as far as what the sticking points are, and where they are in these negotiations?",

      "sentences": "Well, that is some news that at least the families can hang onto. I know everyone - every one of those families are watching and waiting for their loved ones to be released.Becky Anderson, thank you so much for that reporting and breaking news for us, that the negotiations are going well, and they are ongoing. Appreciate it. I want to go ahead and bring in retired U.S. Major General James \"Spider\" Marks. We're going to talk about a couple of things that have happened. First of all, the breaking news that we've gotten from Becky Anderson's reporting, talking about that these negotiations are on a good footing right now. What does that tell you about what they're asking? Because Hamas is basically asking for a humanitarian corridor, which has been asked for by the rest of the world. But how does this play out in the middle of an official war that Israel is in? MAJ. GEN. JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, you can do both. You need to be able to provide for the humanitarian requirements of the Palestinians that are in Gaza. You've got to be able to have a release valve. Rafah should be open. Egypt should acknowledge they can be part of the solution, just like Jordan should acknowledge they can be part of the solution. And, at the same time, Israel can continue its prep tasks for what looks like a ground invasion that will take place. Now, all of this, with the hostages, means it might be on pause as we've seen. We're -- let's be frank, it is on pause. And I think what that really means is, let's go slow to go fast. Let's take a pause right now, breathe through our nose, figure out if we can get as many of these hostages back, because that's all that Hamas has for leverage. Other than a wild Arab streak that wants to support the Palestinian cause, yet has wrapped it up in terms of support for Hamas, which is bizarre and should really be decoupled completely. But it's OK to take a pause, figure out -- have Israel figure out additionally what task they need to take and put in place because they still reserve the right to conduct this operation. And I wouldn't - I would not put it past them to go ahead and execute some form of that. But it's great to see what - what can happen with those hostages in terms of their release.",

Four have been let out, two who area American citizens, and two who are Israeli citizens.I do want to ask you about the ongoing war because this -- for a second night in a row, the Israeli military went in on the ground in a -- what they called a targeted raid in Gaza. But they did go in on the ground. What kind of complication does this create? Because, obviously, if you have hostages, up to 220 who are still underground, this has to be a very, very difficult scenario as Israel tries to do a ground operation.",

      "sentences": "Yes, absolutely. I mean you are walking a very, very tight line. But what Israel is doing right now is very deliberate preparations for the entrance and the, you know, the bringing forward the forces that are going to conduct this ground operation, in whatever - whatever color, whatever size, whatever type of force structure they want to do. But they are taking the time now to prep for that. In their mind it's an inevitability. It's mission number one and it has to be done. So, that's number one.Number two is, by doing that you also give yourself, at least the Israelis have an opportunity to do some very good intelligence collection. To refine their plan. To get some environmentals. Do some gathering. Maybe even go after some ambush sites that they know exist. They've already located. And you can do some very pin-point targeting from the ground. And then the third thing might be, might be deception. Get Hamas to focus in on where they're conducting these operations, and that's where they're going to put most of the bulk of their effort, and then you go someplace else. I mean, frankly, it wouldn't surprise me if the Israelis start doing prep tasks in a whole bunch of locations to try to confuse Hamas.",

A shelter in place order still very much in effect for some 700 square miles in this area. Lewiston, of course, is where the shootings took place. It is home to Bates College, a wonderful liberal arts institution. Classes canceled there once again today. The shelter in place order in effect. Campbell McKendry is a student at Bates and also an intern with Every Town for Gun Safety, joins us now. Campbell, thanks so much for being with us.
