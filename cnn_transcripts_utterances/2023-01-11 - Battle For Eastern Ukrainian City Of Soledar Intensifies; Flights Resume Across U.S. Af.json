Tonight, thebattle for Soledar intensifies as one Ukrainian soldier tells CNN we're hanging in there. We'll have a report from our correspondent on the frontline. Then flights resume in the U.S. after a major system outage grounded thousands of planes. Plus Brazil reinforces security across the country as Bolsonaro supporters call for nationwide protests in the wake of the attack on congress. We are live for you in Brasilia with the very latest. But first, U.S. President Joe Biden is ordering an investigation into a major system outage that resulted in thousands of grounded flights. Normal air traffic is gradually resuming across the country after a key safety system failed at the Federal Aviation Administration. But thousands of flights have been delayed and actually canceled as a result. We're going to bring you a live update in just a moment from one of America's busiest airports. But first, let's go to Ukraine, and the fierce battle for the eastern town of Soledar. This is what it sounds like. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (GUNFIRE) (END VIDEO CLIP)",

On Tuesday, the head of the Russian mercenary company Wagner claim that his forces had taken control of Soledar. The Kremlin walked that back, reporting only a quote, \"positive trend\". Ukraine denies it outright. Soledar is a smaller salt mine town in eastern Ukraine, it's very close to Bakhmut. If Russian forces capture it, it will be their first gain in the Donbas region for months. CNN's Ben Wedeman is within earshot of all that fighting you just heard there. And he brings us the very latest. I want you to listen to his report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  Soledar is just behind us. We're about 5 miles, 7 kilometers from the site where this battle is raging. You can hear artillery, most of it outgoing in the direction of the town. That town has been the scene of intense fighting in recent weeks. And it appears that the situation for Ukrainian forces is increasingly difficult. Now, Russians sources, particularly the so-called Wagner Group; that private military company says that they've taken essentially control of the city. But the Ukrainians insist that they still have control of parts of it at least. But it's questionable how much longer the Ukrainians can hold out as this goes on. I'm Ben Wedeman, CNN, reporting from outside Soledar. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

I want to start by talking about Soledar because the Wagner Group initially came out and said, yes, they've captured Soledar. Russia or the Kremlin, rather, walked that back slightly, saying no, they haven't quite fully captured it yet, but there certainly has been positive momentum. What is the truth here? How much of that territory have the Russians captured? YURIY SAK, ADVISER TO UKRAINE'S DEFENSE MINISTER:  Zain, we need to understand that the situation in Soledar indeed is very difficult. Soledar is one of those cities in Donetsk region which has been under intense fire for months now. And as you've rightly said in your earlier report, Russia is at the moment desperate to get any military success because since -- literally, since July, since their movement into the city of Lysychansk, they have not had any military success. So the situation is very difficult. It's -- I could say critical, and it will remain critical for the next couple of days. But our armed forces are still there, and the -- you know, Russians are not in full control of Soledar, and that's indeed a game of propaganda.",

And of course, at this stage -- at this stage, the most important thing for us is to continue to receive the military assistance that we require, because situations such as that in Soledar could have been avoided, you know, if we would receive those tanks which have been mentioned already on this program sooner. So, right now, the key priority number one, and this is what our President Mr. Zelenskyy says, this was what our Minister of Defense, Mr. Oleksii Reznikov says, we need tanks to win this war, to protect cities such as Soledar, and of course, we are grateful for all the support that we receive. But at the same time, we look to the United States to continue to be the leader when it comes to providing military support. Because this is how it actually worked with, say, the latest example is the Patriot systems. As soon as the decision was made, the political decision was made in the U.S. to provide Ukraine with the Patriots systems, the European allies have also decided that they can do that. So we look on to the U.S., and we hope that the next lunch time meeting which will take place on January 20th will be the platform where these important decisions will be actually reached.",

And you know, for us, the loss of every soldier is the loss of the whole world. Because you know, for Ukrainian army, we have fighting IT specialists, doctors, opera singers, so we are very concerned about the safety of our servicemen. This is why we need western tanks because they are safer. And look, we know that there are thousands of these tanks that are at disposal in our western allies countries. So, and we just need a fraction of that. And since we are fighting the freedom war, right? We are fighting not just for some cities and villages in Ukraine. We are fighting for common-shared values.

It's about that ripple effect. As flights are delayed in the United States, as they were grounded in the United States, and they continue to scramble those airline staff there to try to get those flights off the ground. We're beginning to see concerns about delays and cancellations across the U.S. and Europe. There are hundreds of flights that fly between the Atlantic, between the United States and Europe every single day. So those are absolutely a top priority to airline officials right now. And we were ringing the phones earlier, tried to understand the impact of this calling airlines, calling airports, and I can tell you just from speaking to a few of these major airlines, Air Canada, which is one of the major flights, one of the major carriers into the United States, saying that it had disruptions, that it was operating on a goodwill policy with travelers to try to help get them where they needed to go. Virgin Atlantic as well, saying that they were experiencing delays to those going to the United States. British Airways was saying that they were trying to cope with these possible delays and cancellations. And we started to see on the board inside Heathrow Airport, our producer started to see some delays as well. But as you heard from Amara, the impact has been minimized I think in some ways, Zain, by the fact that this is the down season, right? We're off the back of a holiday season. So we are hearing that airports are beginning to resume  travel as normal to the United States. But I do want to point out that of course, these airports have their own issues. Here in Heathrow for example, over the holiday period, there were nationwide transportation strikes, that had a huge impact on travel. There's been difficulty as well across Heathrow Airport because we've spoken to a couple of passengers who told us that they sat on the tarmac today for three hours. They were on a flight between London and Dallas, and they sat on the tarmac here in Heathrow for nearly three hours before taking off. So we are seeing delays but again, with it being a slow period, that ripple effect, that knock-on effect seems to be minimized on that.",

This is because of that lack of respite, that lack of break in between all of these storms over the last two weeks. The mud and the soil has had no opportunity to dry out in between these storms. And so what's happening is that you are seeing hillsides just completely collapsing on itself. Trees have been uprooted. Vegetation is falling. This is just a small example of what we're seeing all across the state. It is creating very dangerous situations. You mentioned 17 people have died. That includes a 5-year-old boy who was swept away in floodwaters. In other situations, trees are toppling on cars.
