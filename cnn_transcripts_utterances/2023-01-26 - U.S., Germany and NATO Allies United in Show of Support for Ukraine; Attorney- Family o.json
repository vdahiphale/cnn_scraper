Germany did not want to send tanks on its own. It's absolutely gotten the wish. The United States is sending over 30 Abrams tanks, and across Europe, some 80 Leopard tanks making their way to Ukraine.It's important to read the message here behind this announcement. This is absolutely a huge strategic shift. This is a West that was extremely reluctant to provide tanks at the beginning of the conflict. Now, the United States is making it clear, it sees Russia as less of a threat. It absolutely believes that Moscow is weakened by this conflict. President Putin has lost tens of thousands of troops on the ground. According to U.S. officials, he's running out of weaponry. On the other hand, Ukraine seems to have a bottomless pit of support. We have those Abrams tanks -- rather, the Leopard tanks that should arrive on the battlefield in under two to three months. Training for those tanks will begin in Germany immediately. The United States time line is much longer, months be for them to get into Europe, months more for training. So that might not make an impact when it comes to the counteroffensive that Ukraine is preparing for this spring. But already we're hearing rumblings from the Kremlin coming in the form of waves of attacks this morning, 30 missiles shot across Ukraine. Air defense systems were activated. Many shot down. But we do know at least one person was killed and two others wounded by one of these missiles. Overnight, also more than 20 drones were fired at Ukraine, but of those shot down as well. But Ukraine really preparing, bracing for that spring offensive and waiting for those tanks. They can't come fast enough.",
