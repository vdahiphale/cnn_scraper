I'm Max Foster joining you live from London with our continuing coverage of Israel at war.The Gaza based militant group Hamas has released two more people they had abducted from southern Israel earlier this month. The hostages identified as Israeli citizens, Nurit Cooper and Yocheved Lifshitz were handed over to the Red Cross at the Rafah border crossing into Egypt. They were carried away in ambulances and taken to a medical center in Israel, where they were reunited with their families. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ETI UZIEL, HEAD NURSE, ICHILOV HOSPITAL (through translator): We received the first two abductees a few minutes ago. We were very emotional. They look OK. Their medical condition is OK. They're talking. At first we immediately brought them to their family members. It was a very, very emotional meeting. Right now, we will let them rest a little with the family. After that, we'll conduct a comprehensive physical examination. They'll stay with us tonight and tomorrow we'll know exactly. But right now, for them and for the family members, it is a very, very emotional situation and we're happy that they're here with us. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In a statement, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked the Egyptians, thank the Red Cross, but pointedly didn't thank the Qataris, perhaps because they actually host some of the political leadership of Hamas in Doha. Hamas, which of course, carried out this terrorist attack on October the 7th.So those two hostages are now free. Before they were released, there were still 222 people that Hamas had kidnapped and was holding hostage in the Gaza Strip. And obviously there's very much -- there's hope now that four women have been released, that more will be released in the coming hours, in the coming days. But of course, we don't know, and I suppose this of course, is one reason why we're seeing a delay to the much-expected ground invasion from Israel because of those hostages. Even before they've gone in, it's complicating matters for the Israelis. And of course, if and when Israel does go in on the ground, that will also be a complicating factor in their battles with the militants of Hamas and other groups such as the Islamic Jihad.",

It was -- it's couched in terms of humanitarian sort of sort of nod to humanitarianism. We, you know, can't be forgotten within that 220 civilians that are being held.

In previous hostage situations, you tend to have had clarity on exactly where the position of the hostages are and the position of where the hostage takers are. So you have to really think this out. I mean, in Munich 1972 it was Entebbe in 1976. You have that kind of control over the area to know exactly what you're dealing with.Here, you're absolutely right, we're dealing with a people that can be hidden, particularly within tunnels quite spread across a densely populated area. And always a calculus with these kinds of events is the need to try to minimize risk to force. So that's the minimize the risk to the rescuers, as well as the risk to the mission, and that's in particular to the hostages. So that is the extent that we've seen some limited incursions yesterday. There was one unfortunately where an Israeli soldier was injured and killed into trying to sort of test the groundwaters. The aerial bombardment will be trying to break down as much infrastructure to if they decide to go down that route that they have cleared the way as much as possible to make the mission a success.",

In the same way it wasn't a choice to have to be in this position as it stands. We've heard reports that the U.S. have sent in strategic advisers to look at how the U.S. are going to -- how Israel is going to be doing this. We know that the. U.S. has forces in place to support. I think U.S. is primary concern is also to avoid as much spillover as possible and to make sure that -- as was noted before -- that Israel is going to go in, it can do so in a way that can avoid minimal damage to the humanitarian crisis.

As Iran tries to take advantage of growing anti-Israel and anti-U.S. sentiment as a result of the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.We have seen a series of several drone and rocket attacks against U.S. forces in the Middle East. But this would be an escalation of that. Also certainly worth noting, that we've seen the Iranian backed Houthis in Yemen launch an attack using land attack, cruise missiles and drones that was supposed to reach Israel -- according to the Pentagon and U.S. officials -- before it was intercepted by a U.S. destroyer operating in the Red Sea here. It is worth noting the distinction between this involvement here versus Iranian involvement with the Hamas terror attack in Israel on October 7th. U.S. officials say there is no indication of direct Iranian involvement or knowledge or a green light for the attack on October 7th in Israel. Even though Iran does broadly provide funding, backing and training to Hamas. This is different than that. Here there's a much clearer link between Iran and the actions of Iranian proxies. Encouragement, funding, training and a general sense of backing of these Iranian backed proxies attacking the U.S. forces even if there isn't a specific green light. It is because of this growing threat that the Pentagon authorized the deployment of a THAAD missile battery, which is a medium and long- range air defense system and a Patriot battalion to the Middle East as a means of providing more air defense. And the Pentagon has also put more soldiers and troops on \"prepare to deploy\" orders because of the situation in the region. This is on top of the forces that were already ordered there, which is a carrier strike group in the Eastern Med. Another carrier strike group on its way to the Middle East. And an amphibious ready group that's already in the Middle East. So you see the U.S. preparing for the possibility at a serious and severe escalation as the Biden administration and senior officials here warn others, including Iran and its proxies, not to get involved.
