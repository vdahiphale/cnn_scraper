And we start with a breaking news from Georgia.Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis can keep her election case against Donald Trump because her top prosecutor has now resigned. That was the one big condition that the judge said had to be met after he decided in a ruling earlier today not to disqualify Willis from the case. This is a win for Willis. If the judge had ultimately disqualified her, the entire case against Donald Trump and his allies likely would've crumbled and perhaps never even gone to trial. On the other hand, though, these disqualification hearings have left a mark on the district attorneys reputation before a jury will hear this case. The biggest one perhaps of her career, and one of the biggest cases in the nation right now. CNN's Nick Valencia is outside the Fulton County courthouse in Atlanta. Nick, Nathan Wade, he's resigned.

His resignation coming just hours after a judges order basically laid out that he was either him or District Attorney Fani Willis, that had to get off this case in order for it to proceed, and we had all assumed that it wasn't going to be Fani Willis.And this is what Nathan Wade is saying in part of his resignation letter: I am proud of the work our team has accomplished in investigating, indicting and litigating this case, seeking justice for the people of Georgia and the United States, and being part of the effort to ensure that the rule of law and democracy are preserved. It's been the honor of a lifetime. Wade was part of this case, an instrumental part of this case for 865 days, joining the team in November 1st of 2021, and part of the team that issued historic indictments against the former president and his allies, and also part of the team that was able to secure four guilty pleas. But ultimately, Fani Willis was the one that had to stay and she highlighted these accomplishments in a glowing response to Nathan Wade's letter and this is what the D.A. is saying in response to the resignation. Quote: I will always remember and well remind everyone that you were brave enough to step forward and take on the investigation and problem prosecution of the allegations that the defendants in this case engaged in a conspiracy to overturn Georgia's 2020 presidential election. So, what happens next? Fani Willis could proceed with the team she has now, or she can go outside and try to hire a special prosecutor. But if she does that, that comes with its own set of unique challenges, not just the media attention around this, but politics as well as the safety issues. The bottom line though, is Fani Willis is in place and she's the most important team, the most important part of this team -- Abby.",

J. TOM MORGAN, FORMER DEKALB COUNTY, GEORGIA DISTRICT ATTORNEY:  Abby, happy Friday. I hope you all are doing well. A couple of points, the defense can appeal, and I'm sure they will from what Mr. Sadow has already released in the judge has to decide whether he's going to let that appeal go forward. If you less appeal go forward to the court of appeals, this case could be delayed as much as a couple of years. Secondly, this is a perfect example of be careful what you ask for. Mr. Wade is no longer in the case. So you have a lead. Prosecutors never tried to felony case before out of the picture. And this gives Ms. Willis, a chance to put in a prosecutor who is experienced to what they're doing.

Defense attorneys want a 90-day delay. And, Abby, as we've seen, if you grant one delay, there's always a possibility you come back, ask for another delay.

Alvin Bragg said that he would be open to delaying the start part of that trial by 30 days. But today, lawyers for Donald Trump said that's not enough. That's because federal prosecutors just handed over more than 30,000 documents in this case, the trial was set to begin in 10 days on March 25th. CNN's Paula Reid and Elliot Williams are back with me now. Paula, what's going on here? First of all, it's interesting that there's so many pages of documents being handed over at the last possible second, it seems. REID:  Yeah. As you said, this was supposed to start in ten days. This was the one criminal trial against former president Trump that appeared to be firmly on the calendar. And then you see even prosecutors are saying, look, were okay if you delay this a month, whereas defense attorneys want to push this case back three months so that they have enough time to go through these tens of thousands of pages of new evidence. And this new evidence comes from a federal prosecutor's office in New York. This is a state case. Now, these are being handed over right now, even though the district attorney actually requested these documents from federal prosecutors over a year ago, earlier this year, though the Trump team subpoena these documents and have been a lot of accusations flying back and forth to prosecutor sit on these. That's what defense attorneys allege that prosecutors are alleging that the Trump team just waited to the last minute to try to subpoena these. There's also conflicting accounts of how relevant these documents are. So, Abby, this will all be up to the judge overseeing this case to maybe press the parties for some clarity and then decide where on that crowded calendar this trial is going to go.",

It can be a lot of forwarded emails and attachments and so on. So it's hard to know what exactly is in there.Now, in terms of the 30 versus 90 days, certainly both parties are in agreement about extending the timeline somewhat and it's just a question of how much time they actually need. I can't underscore enough though how delicate this area of criminal prosecution is. Prosecutors, Abbey, have an obligation under law to turn over documents to the defense at the start of litigation. And frankly, the one way to screw up a prosecution is to mess this up. And if there is an error in not making a defendant -- giving defendant an ability to review documents, that can actually get a conviction tossed out if he's ultimately convicted. Now, that said, the former president has a long documented and demonstrated history of trying to slow cases down.

Russian missiles first hit a residential area and then struck the first responders trying to save lives on the scene. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy called it, quote, a despicable act of cowardice. While in Russia, brave acts of defiance on the full first day of voting in so-called elections there. A woman in Moscow poured green dye on the ballot box. Russian media reports, she could face up to five years in prison. Another in southwestern Russia similarly destroyed valets, actions Russia sees as provocations rather than protests. Putin himself chose to vote online. And he's expected to remain in power. And now to Gaza, you're looking at the first shipment of aid to reach Gaza by sea. World Central Kitchen led by chef Jose Andres organized this delivery. Gaza's population is teetering on the brink of famine right now as aid groups accused Israel of obstructing deliveries of aid by land.

A settlement announced today eliminates the 6 percent real estate commission, which was the standard in home buying. As you know, you usually have that commission goes to the seller's agent. The other half goes to the buyer's agent. And if a judge approves this agreement, buyers could shop around now for agents who are offering to charge less. And in our national lead, we are learning new details today about what may have caused that Latam passenger plane to take that terrifying nosedive during a flight to New Zealand earlier this week. \"The Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that a flight attendant may have accidentally hit a switch that pushed the pilot seat into the controls causing the planet in to suddenly drop. It injured dozens of people after some passengers were thrown into the roof of the cabin. Let's bring in CNN's Pete Muntean. Pete, wow, what happened and what might have caused it.

Abby, because the Boeing announcement to airlines to say that they should inspect the pilot seats combined with reporting from \"The Wall Street Journal\", really raises a new set of alarm and a new warning for investigators to look deeper into this account about the pilot seats.The account from \"The Wall Street Journal\" after speaking to two U.S. officials, says that there was a flight attendant on board in the cockpit of this 787 serving meals on Monday when they accidentally bumped into a switch on the back of the seats here on the 787, that switch will actually actuate the seat 4NF (ph). It's located right about here. And that can slide the seat 4NF. And after on an L-shaped track, it's covered by this plastic panel here you flip that panel up, you can move this switch in the two positions. The track is here, and the thinking is that the seat went toward the control column here and ended up pushing the control column forward and the nose of the airplane down. That was a really scary moment for a lot of passengers on board, ultimately about 50 passengers treated after this flight landed in Auckland, New Zealand, about 12 of them seriously play and they said that they were thrown up to the ceiling of the airplane. It really flies in the face of the account that passengers got from one of the pilots as they were exiting the plane that the pilot said that their screens initially went dark, causing them to briefly lose control of the airplane. So this is something where the investigator haters will also need to look at the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder. The flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder make up the two black boxes. The flight data recorder will be key because it will be able to show if the linear movement of the seat translated into the linear movement on the control column here. Also the cockpit voice recorder will be key because the sensitive microphones inside the cockpit that well be able to pick up if there was some sort of struggle with the seat. If somebody said, hey, stumps have stopped, the seed is moving. So this is a really interesting development here. Abby and investigators really have their work cut out for them.",

Governor, you've been out there. You've been touring the damage and Ohio. Tell us what you've been seeing and what the reaction has been to all of this. GOV. MIKE DEWINE (R), OHIO:  Well, we're at Indian Lake High School. And what you see behind me, I think gives you a pretty good indication of how resilient, how tough, how strong, and how caring people are. They've just flooded this gym with -- you know, with food and with clothes. I had the opportunity this afternoon to drive and see -- (INAUDIBLE), just hundreds and hundreds of residences are they're either gone or dramatically hurt. We talked to one person, have a couple that crawled out of -- out of a crawl space. They've literally got there just in time. For that description of that that you've heard of a freight train going over and that's what -- that's what they heard. But this community's tough. Ohioans are strong. They're coming back. They want to rebuild. This is a beautiful lake. People come here all year, that live here all year, but we have -- also have a lot of people who come in during the summer. The fishing is good and -- but if you just go around, you'll see so many of the businesses that we all know have either been totally destroyed or significantly destroyed, and then so many other, other residences.

So they have the chance to kind of sort what they have out here.So, you know, people are being very, very generous.
