      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, a day of diplomacy. Volodymyr Zelenskyyis trying to shore up U.S. support In the midst of a grueling counteroffensive. We are live in Washington and Ukraine. Life imitating art. Rupert Murdoch announces he will step aside and hand off the family business to his son. Will this succession have a happy ending? And a very public ground. India calls Canada a safe haven for terrorists as accusations fly after the murder of a Sikh separatist. If we don't get the aid, we will lose the war. That's what Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has reportedly told U.S. lawmakers today. The wartime leader is in Washington, hoping to keep military aid flowing to fight Russia as some Republicans grow skeptical. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy avoided being seen publicly with Ukrainian leader, but post for photo during a close-door meeting. A short time ago, President Zelenskyy took part in a wreath-laying ceremony, honoring 9/11 victims. And in the coming hour, we'll expect it -- we're expected to meet with President Biden, of course, when that happens, we will bring it to you. Let's get the very latest from our Natasha Bertrand. So Natasha, really, an important meeting for President Zelenskyy, how much support though is there from both sides of the political aisle to continue back in Ukraine with an election, of course, in the United States around the corner?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Isa, well, look, I mean, among mainstream Republicans, there is still that support forUkraine, understanding of course, that Russia might not stop at Ukraine and might try to attack NATO if Ukraine does in fact lose. And that is something that Republicans understand. Democrats of course, still stand very firmly with the Ukrainians. But among kind of the more fringe elements of the Republican Party, and of course, Republicans that matter when it comes to getting necessary votes to continue funding Ukraine, there is a lot of skepticism. And they say that they want to know more about the end goal here. They want to know what Ukraine's strategy actually is to win the war, and if they have a possibility of actually doing that, because otherwise, they say this could just be a forever war that the U.S. will continue funding really with no end in sight. And so, the president here, he is going to be walking a very fine line when he meets with President Zelenskyy, understanding that support among the broader American population, kind of is on the side of those Republicans who are asking questions about why this war is worth funding and supporting. The president has, of course, reiterated multiple times that the U.S. stands with Ukraine and will continue to do so for as long as it takes. But crucially, Ukraine is not going to be getting everything that it wants out of this visit. President Zelenskyy is not going to be getting at those long-range missiles that he has been asking for, for months and months now. It remains to be seen, you know, whether the Ukraine supplemental funding that the White House has asked Congress for is going to go through, and of course, that would really dictate how much the Pentagon is able to send Ukraine with regard to weapons and ammunition. And so, all of this is a really -- it's a fraud moment for Zelenskyy. He comes here at a very different moment than when he came to Washington last year, when it was much more unified and more united in terms of support for Ukraine. This time around, it's much more tenuous, and you really can't -- by not take into consideration the fact that, of course, there is a big funding and spending fight going on, on the Hill --",

I think for me what stood out was the very first line. He said those that think peace can prevail in the Middle East without Palestinians enjoying their full, legitimate national rights would be mistaken. I see that is a very clear message to what we have been talking about for the last day or so, which is about this Saudi-Israel normalization. So much of that has been, what about the Palestinians? What would the Palestinians potentially get out of a deal like this? Saudi Arabia has said the Palestinians have to be a part of this equation. But it was interesting to hear from crown prince Mohammed bin Salman that he was to ease the life of the Palestinians but he did not mention an independent Palestinian state. So where do the Palestinians play into this? That why you are hearing Mahmoud Abbas addressing this. He talked about things he has talked about so many times before, demanding an end to the occupation, recognizing the independence of the state of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital,  resolving the issue of Palestinians refugee. He was also calling for Israel to be held responsible for their actions the same way that other countries are being held responsible for their actions. This is something we've  heard from a lot of Palestinians, especially since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. They'll say Russia is being held to a different standard than Israel is being held to. We haven't heard the end of Mahmoud Abbas' speech. But I want to hear how he addresses the issue of the Saudi Arabia normalization. We know that they have made several sorts of demands or what they would expect from all this. But the big question is that, could any of that actually happen in reality?
