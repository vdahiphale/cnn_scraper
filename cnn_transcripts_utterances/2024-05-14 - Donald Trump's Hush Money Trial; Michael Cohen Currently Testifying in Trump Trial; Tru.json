Text messages in January 2018 around this time of \"The Wall Street Journal\" story. Bill Brennan, I mean, these are the cards, that the prosecution has been dealt. They have, this witness who is admitted to have told lies. What is the best way to present this information, this potentially damaging information to the jury? WILLIAM J. BRENNAN, FORMER TRUMP PAYROLL CORP. ATTORNEY:  Well, Jake, Susan Hoffinger is smart to get it out ahead of time because certainly Todd Blanche will do it. But with all due respect to Lanny's recitation of, you know, he lied. He came clean. The mea culpa. He lied. And then he lied again. And then he lied again. He lied to the newspaper. He lied to Congress. He lied on his tax returns. He lied when he did the refile (ph). And every time it's, I'm done lying. I know this, jurors can tolerate a lot. They really don't like liars. And if there's a moat between everything we've heard so far and the felony, that second crime, and he's the bridge across the moat, the jury's going to have a tough time with that, and the judge will instruct them false in one, false in all.

He's not the defendant in this action. But certainly, as somebody who's on the stand, the defense is going to try to use all the things that Paula has talked about. His credibility, the fact that he has admitted to lying, not only as part of criminal cases, but also in furtherance of the defendant in this action.

Look, I think it's fair to say, at best, Michael Cohen is an approval seeking lackey. And he was Donald Trump's lackey. And as in organized crime cases, you have the underboss being very, very, very loyal to the boss. Not just lying for him, but in more serious cases, committing murder and committing mayhem and committing arson all for the boss. Then when you feel betrayed by the boss, as Michael Cohen's story goes, then you turn on the boss with the same degree of visceral anger for which you committed your crimes for the boss. It is a common story, a common narrative. And I think the mistake that defense lawyers tend to make, generally, is you can attack the witness as much as you want, but you also have to attack the underlying story. What is Michael Cohen saying that you can prove is not true with respect to the actual charges? And that always becomes the problem, and that's why the worst killers and terrorists and awful people who are given the best deals to testify end up being believed by juries. Not because they're credible people or even tolerable people, but because the story they're telling sounds true and is corroborated by other evidence and other witnesses. COATES:  Important point. Again, you know, you don't have crimes committed in front of buses full of nuns, and certainly the people who are going to be the ones to witness falsification, allegedly, of business records are those who engage in falsifying behavior. I want to go to Kristen Holmes on this as well, because, you know, he brings a really good point here when you talk about what they have to show. On the one hand, to discredit him. To suggest that Michael Cohen has gone completely rogue. That he does his own thing. He never would have done anything. He doesn't -- following orders from Donald Trump. Also mean Donald Trump was not in control of his own business. It also means that he has to, by trying to paint Michael Cohen as the ability to be a rogue actor, then he is clearly not really the man. KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, obviously this is something that Donald Trump is not going to like. But I do want to point out, you know, what we're seeing here, at least reading about how Donald Trump is in the courtroom right now as these stories are unfolding. He's sitting back, his eyes are closed. He has remained relatively calm. Same thing we are hearing from Michael Cohen. That he has had a measured voice. That he has stayed on message. These are two men who are not known for their discipline. These are two men who are very reactive. Both of them right now are on their best behavior. Donald Trump has been told not to react, not to have the same kind of reaction he did to Stormy Daniels where he was cursing, muttering, actively hitting his attorneys, rolling his eyes, that kind of thing. Instead, he is sitting there looking forward. Michael Cohen has obviously had hours and hours of preparation. What will be interesting to see is if any of these changes when the defense does their cross- examination. As you said, is some of this going to get under Donald Trump's skin? Some of this going to get under Michael Cohen's skin? Obviously, the defense is hoping that it gets under Michael Cohen's skin and they see some kind of reactive moment because that is what they're hoping to do as they try to paint him as this kind of reactive character who, as you said, went rogue.",

Even if the jury were to disbelieve Stormy Daniels, which at this point, given the job that was done by the defense and sort of scoring an own goal with her cross- examination, I think the jury probably does believe Ms. Daniels. But even if they didn't, it becomes sort of the same issue that you can falsify business records, and you can pay cover-up money for stories that are not true.And we know that from this case because there was a story that Donald -- a false story, that Donald Trump had fathered a child that was being peddled by a doorman.

That as a candidate for the presidency, that his speech is political speech. That it should be granted the highest protection, and that he should not have restrictions in terms of the people he can attack.Now, under this gag order, he can attack the District Attorney Alvin Bragg. We know he can and he does. Also same with the judge, Judge Merchan. He rails against the judge almost every single day. But he is prohibited from attacking any witnesses in this case, which includes Stormy Daniels and Michael Cohen. Also going after the prosecutors or members of the judge or other people's families. Now, with Michael Cohen, I do want to caveat the fact that there were some alleged violations of the gag order recently that had to do with Michael Cohen, and the judge actually let them slide. He said that you can't prove beyond a reasonable doubt that these, considering the attacks that he faces from Michael Cohen, are not political speech. But here, this appeal of trying to get the gag order overturned or undone has not succeeded. So, that's not a surprise. But they have been railing against this. Litigating against this This is a pet issue for the former president. It is not a surprise that he has not been successful in getting this overturned.

Because we know that the judge was asked if Donald Trump were to take the stand, which we know it remains a very big if that he doesn't have to decide until after the close of the prosecution's case here. But if he were to take the stand, the prosecution wanted to mention the gag orders in front of the jury, the violations.And the judge said, with respect to the gag order violations, he wasn't going to do so. As the judge, these juries are around him the entire day. They have a level of respect for him. So, to hear his decision that there had been a violation might be unduly prejudicial.

And a judge's power is at its absolute height when it comes to protecting witnesses, jurors, and other trial participants from danger and intimidation.So, that was -- this was always going to play out the way it just played out. The fact that they can't mention the gag order violations should Donald Trump testify is irrelevant. They have more than enough material, and I think Judge Merchan made the right call. But I think we should stop speculating about whether or not Donald Trump's going to testify and instead speculate on what excuse he's going to give for not testifying. So, on my bingo card, I have him saying, there was no case anyway. So, why should I bother? They never had a case. I'm not going to testify. That's my bet on what he's going to say when he doesn't testify. Other people should weigh in.",
