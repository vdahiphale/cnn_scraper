      "sentences": "Well, as soon as today, former President Donald Trump could face yet another indictment. The grand jury that would ultimately vote on that, well, they're expected to meet today. And all of this comes as CNN has learned that special counsel Jack Smith has new documents to pore over, and they include papers from former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani's team, the same team that tried to find fraud after the 2020 election.The documents appear to include affidavits claiming that there were widespread irregularities and analysis supposedly revealing fraudulent activities. I want to now bring in CNN senior legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid. So, Paula, clearly Jack Smith's team still has more documents to review. What does this tell us perhaps about a potential indictment timeline?",

      "sentences": "Well, they can certainly indict someone and then continue their investigation. That's exactly what the special counsel team did in the Mar-a-Lago documents investigation.They indicted former President Trump and his aide Walt Nauta, and then they continued investigating, even sending at least one new target letter. So, with the January 6 case, here's what we know, Rahel. We know that the grand jury usually meets on Tuesdays and Thursdays. But our producer Casey Gannon is on the ground over there at the court. She has covered this for months. She knows all the players over there. She's very familiar with how this works. And, at this point, she has not seen the grand jury come in today. So that suggests they may be coming in later today, or they may not be meeting today. But, look, even if the grand jury is not there, even if prosecutors are not presenting new evidence or a possible indictment, they do have other things to work on, like those documents you mentioned. In the past 48 hours, the special counsel has received thousands of documents from the legal team headed by Rudy Giuliani that was assembled after the election to try to find evidence of this alleged fraud. Now, these documents came from former New York Police Commissioner Bernie Kerik. He has been in conversations with a special counsel about a potential interview. And CNN obtained many of these documents last night. A team of us went through them. And, Rahel, after reviewing them, it doesn't appear that this is the kind of evidence that you would have to complete a review of before charging former President Trump. This is not like the Mar-a-Lago recording. This is nothing that speaks directly to the heart of their case. Now, in addition to going through this document -- these documents -- we also know they have at least three witness interviews over the next few weeks.",

And he was in a McDonald's All-American, competed in a slam dunk contest. So, Bronny James has played hundreds of thousands of minutes of basketball, and at a very high level at the high school level. He was going to USC to be a freshman. Many thought, if it went well that freshman year there with the Trojans, that he could make the jump to the NBA. And we have heard LeBron say for years now that it's one of his dreams to one day play with Bronny in his final seasons. Of course, now you -- we were going to have to wait to see if that was going to happen anyways. But, at this point, we wish the -- we wish the best for Bronny and hope he's doing well, and because he's -- he's a rising star in basketball, especially in the college ranks. People are going to definitely be filling the seats there at USC to watch him play. And it's -- we hate to see something like this happen, and we certainly hope that he's going to be OK.",

Basketball fans of my age will know the names Hank Gathers and Reggie Lewis. And those two, we believe, were vastly different -- so I'm going to look at you over here -- vastly different circumstances, Sanjay. So, cardiac arrest, what exactly does that mean, as compared to a heart attack or heart failure?",

      "sentences": "Yes. I think the answer that is yes.We were just looking at some of that data, in fact, as this news started to break. First of all, it tends to happen more in men than women. Tends to happen in athletes who are competing at a higher level. Basketball is one of those sports where you tend to see these types of sudden cardiac arrests more. And the more minutes that you're playing, the higher likelihood of it happening. Now, again, this is rare. So I just want to be clear that no one is suggesting that you're going to tailor the number of minutes and things like that. But built on that is dehydration and other things that are causing the heart to work harder, possibly bringing something like this on. So it may have been an underlying condition. That may not have posed a problem yet in someone's life. But as you're going through these different paces, different conditions, taxing the heart harder, it could have elicited an electrical abnormality, it could have elicited something with the muscles of the heart now leading to the sudden cardiac arrest.",

      "sentences": "Sanjay, help us understand what happens now in terms of treatment for Bronny.As we heard, he is out of the ICU, he is stable, but walk us through the types of things that will happen in the hours and the days to come. GUPTA:  So, I think, if they let him out of the ICU, that basically -- what they're saying, and all we can really infer from that is that they felt that his heart was now stable, it was beating in a normal pattern, and they had no reason to believe at this point that he would have another sudden cardiac arrest. Keeping him in the hospital to do these tests, sorts of tests that you do, you may put an ultrasound on the chest wall, looking at the heart, looking for any structural abnormalities of the heart, again, what I was talking about to say, is the muscle of one chamber of the heart bigger than it should be or bigger than the muscles of the other chambers of the heart? They're going to look at the electrical pattern on his heart, and probably over a period of time. So, at baseline, it looks like it's fine. Oh, but look over here. He's having certain spikes, certain changes in those electrical patterns. They may have things that are stressing the heart. And they're actually having him go on a treadmill or something, or giving a medication to sort of speed up the heart and seeing if those electrical patterns change. These are the types of things that they do. That's exactly, again, the type of investigation that was happening with Damar Hamlin, who, by the way, was a lot sicker than it sounds like Bronny was. You will remember Damar Hamlin was in the ICU for a period of time after that cardiac arrest and was unconscious for a period of time. With Bronny, again, given the fact that he's out of the ICU, there's a great deal of comfort in that. But these investigations into what exactly triggered this, they have to happen. And there's a good chance there will be an answer. It's not 100 percent. There are situations where someone has a sudden cardiac arrest and there's never a very clear reason as to why it happened. But more times than not, they will figure it out.",

I suppose one thing we do not know yet and one thing that will be important to assess from Bronny James is, how long was he out for? Did he need to be resuscitated?",

      "sentences": "Well, it's so hard to live up to the expectations when your dad is LeBron James, right?I mean, we rarely see the superstar athlete and their kids follow in their footsteps. But to this point, Bronny, he at every single level was kind of reaching that threshold. He started at Sierra Canyon, like I mentioned, was an All -- a McDonald's All-American, competed in the dunk contest. And when LeBron said, like, oh, in my later years, my dream is to one day play with my son, a lot of people thought, well, that might be a little far-fetched to have those kind of expectations that your oldest son is going to make it to the NBA in time for you to still be there. But that certainly was a possibility. Bronny was a four-star prospect going there to play at USC playing in Los Angeles, so his dad could still attend all of his games. And, as Sanjay mentioned, the signs right now look positive that he's already out of ICU. And we saw just a few years ago a star player for the Florida Gators Keyontae Johnson, he collapsed on the court while playing for the Gators in a game, went to the hospital, was in critical condition, was in a medically induced coma for a few days. Before he got out of that coma, doctors were able to, like Sanjay said, diagnose what his problem was. He transferred to Kansas State. We just watched him star with the Wildcats in the NCAA Tournament. He ended up getting a second round draft pick by the Oklahoma City Thunder just earlier this month. So the hope is, John and Rahel, that Bronny is going to have a similar path that Keyontae Johnson had, right, they're going to be able to diagnose what his problem is, and he's going to be able to get back on the basketball court and perform at a high level like he's used to.",

But what will be useful for the special counsel here is to show this through line, that, beginning as early as early 2020, and going -- going throughout is a thread that the president at the time was being told that, in fact, that there were no problems,there was no demonstrable fraud, certainly none that could have overturned the results of the election.
