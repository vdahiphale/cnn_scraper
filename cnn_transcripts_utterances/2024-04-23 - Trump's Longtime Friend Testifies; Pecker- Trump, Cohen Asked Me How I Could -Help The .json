Former tabloid publisher David Pecker, under oath and on the record, revealing just how far Donald Trump wins, allegedly, to protect his 2016 presidential campaign. But when it comes to whether Trump committed a felony in the process, how damaging was today's testimony. And that infamous meeting in August 2015, what Pecker said went down in that room that could hurt Donald Trumps case nearly nine years later. Plus, Trump's legal team admonished in court today, scolded by the judge over social media posts by the former president that prosecutors say violated a gag order.

Tabloid mogul David Pecker testified in front of his longtime friend, Donald Trump, revealing details about there shall we call it symbiotic relationship and the extent of the Trump teams say, over the popular national enquirer tabloid, including weighing in on running negative stories about Trumps political opponents. Now, to refresh your memory of how deep in the tank the \"National Enquirer\" was for Trump in 2016. The editors were not only buying negative stories about Trump in order to not run them, to bury them, to hide them from the public. But here's a look at some of those covers of the \"National Enquirer\" during the campaign. \"Hillary: six months to live\" blared the tabloid nine years ago. \"Hillary going to jail\", and one that said \"Corrupt\". On the stand today, David Pecker also revealed how at a meeting in 2015, former President Trump and his attorney and fixer Michael Cohen, asked Pecker how he could quote, help the campaign. Pecker testified he agreed to be the eyes and ears of the campaign and would notify Michael Cohen if he ever heard of any women selling any stories about Trump than he would act to buy those stories and then kill them to benefit the Trump campaign, he testified. Michael Cohen would also call Pecker and ask the \"Enquirer\" to run negative stories about Trump's opponents, such as Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz. Here's one of the ridiculous Ted Cruz smears on a cover shown in court today from May 2016. \"Ted Cruz father linked to JFK assassination!\" Now, obviously, this is deranged nonsense, but we should know this story came out in May 2016 when Pecker testified Ted Cruz was gaining popularity during the Republican primaries. Another sleazy, baseless hit piece against Ted Cruz, Cruz's five secret mistresses, not true, vile, unfair to Cruz, horrible to his wife, horrific to their two daughters unfair to those five women. Pecker also testified about the first time he ever paid to kill a story about Donald Trump. It was apparently November 2015 and Pecker had former \"National Enquirer\" editor and chief Dylan Howard pay $30,000 to a doorman who was selling and apparently false story about Donald Trump allegedly father and his son with someone not his wife. Pecker said that the story turned out to be 1,000 percent false. But quote, I made the decision to purchase the story because of the potential embarrassment and would have been to the campaign and to Mr. Trump Pecker testified about a second catch and kill deal, this time involving 1998 playmate of the year, Karen McDougal and the ten-month romance. She alleges she had with Mr. Trump. Pecker testified today that when Donald Trump heard that her story might come out, Trump told Pecker, quote, anytime you do anything like this it always gets out. Okay. Who knows what Donald Trump was thinking when Mr. Pecker testified all of this in court today? When the \"National Enquirer\" endorsed Trump back in 2016, Trump, after all, returned the favor.

And you could see the jurors eyes following him back to the prosecutor, who would then ask the follow-up question.So, a bit like a tennis match for their heads going back and forth. We also saw there was some evidence introduced today, some emails. This agreement, that was painted Trumps the doorman at Trump Tower that came into evidence and you can see the jurors looking down at the monitors. They all have a monitor that shows what the email is that's being displayed to the courtroom and also to them individually. So we saw a lot of them looking down, paying attention to the exhibits that were being entered into evidence today, but could see some people were pretty engaged, paying attention following the testimony and following the back-and-forth between the questions.",

Now the flip side is that we anticipate Donald Trump argued there's lots of reasons to kill stories about affairs, could have to do with reputation, could have to do with his wife.

The meeting was an August 2015, about two months after Trump came down that golden escalator at Trump Tower, launching his 2016 presidential campaign. Now, Pecker testified today that his meeting was with Trump and with Trump's lawyer, Michael Cohen. He said, Hope Hicks came in and out of the room at the time. And today, Pecker testified Trump and Michael Cohen asked him, quote, what his magazines could do to help the campaign, magazines such as the \"National Enquirer\". Pecker recalled saying he'd, quote, run or publish positive stories about Mr. Trump and published negative stories about his opponents, unquote, and if he heard of women's selling stories about Mr. Trump who he called an eligible bachelor, although he was married, Pecker said that he would notify Michael Cohen and he'd have the stories, in other magazines. Pecker also testified, quote, in a presidential campaign, I was the person that thought that there would be a lot of women who would come out to try to sell their stories because Mr. Trump was well-known, is the most eligible bachelor and dated the most beautiful women, unquote. Pecker also said if he heard women selling stories. He'd notified Cohen. He'd had the stories killed. He said, I think it was a mutual benefit. It would help his campaign and it would also help me, unquote. The tactic discussed in that meeting, it's called catch and kill. Buy somebody by the rights to a story, and instead of running it, kill it. It's not illegal. It's not illegal at all. The practice of buying silence to squash an unfavorable story. But it did become central to the health of former President Trump's 2016 campaign. For example, just days before voters at the streets, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that \"Enquirer\" parent company, American Media Incorporated run by David Pecker, paid 1998 playmate of the year Karen McDougal, $150,000 for the rights to her story. As David Pecker put it today, her story about a, quote, romantic relationship with the Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. And before Karen McDougal, David Pecker acknowledged and other catch and kill story involving now disproven claim, a false claim by a doorman who was claiming that Trump had fathered a child with a woman outside his marriage, that doorman was paid $30,000. Pecker testified today he agreed to by the story which Cohen replied, the boss will be very pleased. It's a story that Pecker are today said was 1,000 percent false. All this is prosecutors are working their way toward the Stormy Daniels allegation at the center of the case. Joining us now to discuss, Kim Masters, the editor at large at \"The Hollywood Reporter\". Kim, thanks for joining us. So you've been reporting on powerful people and their scandals and their attempts to hide and suppress those scandals for decades. What was your reaction watching Pecker describe his, quote, mutually beneficial relationship, unquote, with a presidential candidate. KIM MASTERS, EDITOR-AT-LARGE, THE HOLLYWOOD REPORTER: It was really quite nauseating, I would say, as you as you mentioned, this is legal. And so, ridiculous lies are published to help a candidate, that is not journalism. But they've been doing it for years.

That changed when his power started to diminish. But as that emerged, you know, Harvey, suddenly, I was not the one doing the story at that time. It was \"The New York Times\", and Ronan Farrow for \"The New Yorker\". But I first, I had a fake reporter call me to talk about Hollywood, then it turned out later that that was a Harvey emissary to see what was on my mind since he knew that I knew. And then he got in touch with me and he said he wanted to give me a book offer and I was a little, like why would he do that? I don't even think the Weinstein Company is really publishing books but he was like, it's perfect for you. It's great. To my regret, somewhat, I cut him off before he could offer me a number because I really would like to know how much does he think my silence is worth.",

Trump was cautious and frugal with money Pecker said, so much so that he personally reviewed invoices and signs checks. He was meticulous, he said. Trump and Cohen and Pecker had this in-person August 2015 meeting where they agreed that Pecker would be the eyes and ear's of Trump's 2016 campaign.

That's not going to sell very well with them. So that'll be part of the competition, in the suburbs.Legally, a couple of very important points there. Number one, Trump was hands-on with the money. Trump often says if these payments are made, somebody was taking care of it. I didn't know about it, I didn't know about the specifics anyway. His friends saying he was hands out with the money. It's important. Plus the Trump defense team is going to savage Michael Cohen and his credibility through Mr. Pecker today, prosecution did get this on the record. How important Michael Cohen was, how trusted he was by Donald Trump back in the day. So they will savage him saying he's lost his credibility.

Shimon, when talking with protesters, the ones that claim to be peaceful, do any of them, when you ask -- if you ask, deny what happened on October 7th, the Hamas attack on Israel today, support what happened on October 7?

And I think that's part of the frustration certainly for the university and trying to negotiate with them to bring some kind of resolution to this, because it just does not seem that this is coming to an end at any point. We're outside the university and on almost on a daily basis, we'll see a small number of people gather outside the university chanting their support for Palestine, saying -- calling for a ceasefire and they usually try to stand outside the gates of the college, close as to where the encampment of those really hundreds of students now. Today, interestingly enough, the university came out and said that what the students on the inside are doing in that encampment is against regulations. So now the question is, well, what will the university do? They're saying this is not allowed, but yet there still allowing it to continue. The last time they came out and said this, Jake, they had the NYPD come in and clear out the entire encampment. We'll see if that happens again.",
