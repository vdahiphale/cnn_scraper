And so as long as our party leaders, as long as Kevin McCarthy and others and these candidates for president -- I mean, you look at Ron DeSantis.

Ninety-one counts against the former president and current front-runner, we should note, for the Republican presidential nomination. With us, CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson. Former federal prosecutor Michael Zeldin back with us. Michael, let me just begin with your reaction to what we just heard there from -- from Geoff Duncan, who was lieutenant governor during the time that all of this was going on, all these shenanigans.

Even more historic place, classified documents. Even more historic place, you know, as it relates to the January 6th issue. And now, here we are again. Here we go again.You know, I think first of all, in response to your question, Phil, you know, sort of like people have stripes. If you're Republican, this is all nonsense. It's political. It's our system coming after us. You know, I think it's time to call it for what it is, right. And I think the -- what I'm reading is an indictment which is very specific, which has allegations, which are really just essentially horrifying. You look at this issue of a criminal enterprise as we talked about. You look at the pattern acts. which talk about that criminal enterprise with respect to really just overturning this election. Soliciting people to violate their oaths of office, breaking into computer systems, intimidating witnesses, the list goes on and on. And then you look, because we've gotten to this free speech issue. And the issue is, it's free speech. I can say whatever you want. But one of the interesting things the indictment talks about many times are these overt acts. Now, let's talk about that just for one minute. When you have a conspiracy, which are a number of people enter into agreement, two or more, right, to break the law, what happens is, it's not only the speech. We can talk about anything. It's the action which translates the speech into conduct. And there are, what, 160-something acts that it lists that move it from, Hey, let's just talk about this, to let's get it done. And so it's hard to argue with regard to the specificity of this indictment, with regard to what the district attorney did in matching the facts to the laws that were broken, to say this is just a political enterprise, particularly when you had a special grand jury of 75 witnesses that met from May of '22 to January of 2023. And then you had an actual grand jury, who could issue an indictment, issue the indictments. It's part of our process that's really a sad thing to see. But this is our reality.",

It's important to note that a grand jury assesses this information. They establish not proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but whether there's reasonable cause to believe a crime is committed, and the subject of the indictment committed it. Different standard.But as I read it, Phil, I mean, there's some pretty specific information in here with respect to what people have done in terms of perjury, in terms of, again, soliciting people to violate their oaths of office and breaking into computer systems. Why is that relevant? Because generally, when you're looking for people to flip, you're looking as a prosecutor, right, to garner the evidence you need to move forward successfully in your prosecution. And so you lose leverage when the prosecution already has the information. What's important to me, really, because of the consequences here -- we know about the whole issue of the pardon. Right? We just spoke to that issue -- is whether this goes first in time. Maybe they speak with each other, all the prosecutors, and this is a prosecution that takes somewhat a priority.",
