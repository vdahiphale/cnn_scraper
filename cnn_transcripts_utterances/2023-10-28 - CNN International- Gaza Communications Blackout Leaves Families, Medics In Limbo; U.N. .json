Basically, we have also patients who are in the intensive care unit connected to life support machines and oxygen. That means they are also in danger of losing their life due to the cut of electricity.

I talked to some of the organizers who said they had no idea he was going to make this announcement.Now, I will note former president Trump, Pence's former boss, is currently on stage and has not said anything about Pence dropping out of the election. Of course, as you noted, this comes amid Pence struggling to get donors, to get support behind his campaign. And what's really striking about this, Nick, is just how much the Republican Party has changed. It's in the last two presidential cycles. If you'll remember back in 2016, Pence was brought on to Donald Trump's ticket to essentially be a voice of reason among conservatives to make people feel at ease, to help with evangelicals. He's a big part of the Republican Party. And now we're looking at two cycles later in which Pence himself doesn't have a lane. Now, of course, we have to mention that Trump and Pence had a falling out after Pence certified the election. Trump had tried to encourage him not to, actually, demanded and put pressure on him, not to overturn -- I mean, not to certify the 2020 election, but he did, in fact, do that. And that led to a fracture. And I will tell you, I talked to a number of voters on the campaign trail who still hold that against Mike Pence. They say that he should have tried to block the election results. And it just gives you an idea of where the Republican Party is right now. This is no longer the party that existed in 2016. This is Donald Trump's party. And it was clear when he walked in the room tonight. He got a standing ovation here in Las Vegas. One of the only people to get a standing ovation. And again, it's just a striking moment for where the Republican Party has come. And I will mention one other thing here. We have talked a lot about donors. Pence had not yet qualified for that third presidential debate in two weeks. We are told that that played a significant role in this, but they just did not believe they could get there, and they did not want to face that embarrassment. Nick.",
