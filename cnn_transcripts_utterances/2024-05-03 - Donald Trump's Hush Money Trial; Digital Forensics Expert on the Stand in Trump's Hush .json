A prosecution digital forensics expert is still on the stand after giving important answers. Just a few moments ago, he's testifying about Michael Cohen's devices and if the evidence gleaned from those cell phones can be trusted.Let me go to you, Elie, on this because we've been watching these clips pop up on screen during the commercial break. There's this back and forth between the attorneys and this forensic expert about whether or not Michael Cohen's phone could be trusted. Just a few moments ago, he was saying no evidence of manipulation or tampering, but at the same time, Bove going back on cross-examination, saying, hold on a second. Do you see gaps in the audio? This has been going back and forth. They're trying to shoot holes in the credibility of this audio, which is obviously, as you were saying a few moments ago -- ELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK:  Crucial",

I mean, they seem to be kind of dabbling it in for the jury. LAURA COATES, CNN SENIOR AND CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR, AND SIRIUSXM HOST, \"THE LAURA COATES SHOW\":  Well, they are well aware of the clock. They know it's Friday. They know that the weekend is looming. And they're going to have to have an opportunity for the jury to think about what is less and fresh in their mind. Remember, the whole strategy, if you're presenting evidence, presenting a story, primacy and recency and repetition. What you heard first and last are going to be the most impactful. And what you continuously hear, you add credibility and give further gravitas to. They know they want to get whoever comes in the afternoon, that they want a time as such that the direct examination, possibly, will carry over until the Monday. That's a strategy of thinking who they want to have. They don't want to have a cross and try to tear down one of their witnesses in any way, or leave it even at an objection. But also, we've also talked about how delay, delay, delay was a tactic for the Trump litigation team. Prosecution team, wants to expedite the entire thing. But delay does not stop once the trial actually begins. It is within the best interest of the defense to continue to try to delay that much longer. The longer it takes to get all the evidence through, the more that you have a witness coming in and explaining to people what Truth Social and Twitter is, and perhaps the Wayback -- I mean, I get the Wayback Machine. It sounds very back to the future and I don't know if they're going to have -- a doctor's going to come. I mean, maybe DeLorean's coming at a point in time. But all of it is important to have them suggest, hold on, if I'm the jury, the defense wants you thinking, for this I got up in the morning. For this I got called jury duty. For this, you know, I had to rush through my coffee. For this we're indicting a president of the United States -- a former president of the United States. And so, they want that feeling of dragging on that's why they won't stipulate. They know they could expedite all of this, but they don't want to. The quicker they can get through a presentation of evidence means that you have an uninterrupted story. Imagine you are binge watching something. The longer you take away from each episode, the more you get distracted, the more you might not be willing to go back and lean in again. If you can binge watch over the course of a weekend, you are a fan of the show. If you can't, you are going to be disjointed. This defense wants you not to binge watch the presentation of evidence. They want it to be structured in a way that makes you want to leave, come back, and maybe the focus on his eyes being closed. But is their mind wandering when you have mundane details? The defense wants that.",

But as one of the lawyers noted earlier, the issue is it's not -- it has nothing to do with Stormy Daniels, right? They're discussing the payment for Karen McDougal, not the Stormy Daniels payment, which is at the heart of this case.So, I think it is notable to hear them discussing a hush money type payment. But again, it's not the one that's at the heart of this case, so that's not going to make or break. We're still waiting for that evidence to connect the defendant directly to this alleged scheme to falsify documents.",
