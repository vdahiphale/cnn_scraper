As you heard there in the lead-in, FBI officials saying that at this point, they have no leads. There is a collection of reward money that is now being offered in the hopes that that will generate some sort of leads, $80,000 in all. But we still have not heard any updates if that reward announcement has generated any possible leads. Investigators say at this point, they believe the suspect could be anywhere. They lost his track on him Saturday night, where they found clothes and the cell phone that he had been using. Investigators say they believe that he had been communicating with some friends, but that didn't lead them to his whereabouts. Yesterday, as the governor of Texas was announcing this reward money, he went out of his way to describe the five victims as illegal immigrants. That has forced the government to be under some pretty intense criticism for using that kind of language in this kind of tragic situation. And the sheriff here in San Jacinto County says he doesn't care what the immigration status is of the victims, he's just incredibly hurt by what has happened here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

A lot of people fighting for -- against climate change.Of course, at the heart of this is very much an anti-capitalist feel. That's what you'll see is the First of May, traditionally a day of protests for the left across Europe. What authorities here in France expect today, Kaitlan, is that this is likely to be one of the biggest First of May protests that we've seen simply because of what we've been covering here for the last few weeks. There's pension reform protests. The latest on that, of course, is that raising of retirement age from 62 to 64 is going ahead. It is going to become law. But that hasn't really dimmed the enthusiasm of the unions for coming out on the street and continuing to cause as much trouble as they can. And that's what's going to be at the heart of these protests again today. Authorities say they expect about 500 to 6,000 people out on the streets. The unions are hoping for much more than that. There are, Kaitlan, 12,000 police officers out on the streets to try and keep things in order because authorities fear that once again we're going see violence. What they say is they figure that there are about 1,000 to 2,000 people determined on causing violence today, Kaitlan.",

I do think that Congress will probably revisit that question over time. They may raise the cap, they may insure a portion of deposits well above that up to some limit.

The US naval ship, Brunswick is the first US military ship to do this trip across the Red Sea. There is likely going to be more because there are still Americans who are in Sudan waiting for a way to get out of there.
