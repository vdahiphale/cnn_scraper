More than 30 million people are under air quality alerts this morning as smoke from wildfires in Canada is pouring to the south, shrouding U.S. cities across the northeast, mid-Atlantic and Midwest. New York City Public Schools have canceled outdoor activities today because of the air quality. At one point yesterday the city topped the list of the world's worst air pollution. And you can see in these pictures, New Yorkers could barely make out the city's iconic skyline.I took some of this video yesterday. This is from midtown Manhattan. And there is some video also coming in from the upper west side. Hard to see those buildings there in the background. Now, in Canada's capital city of Ottawa, an orange haze took over the skyline for weeks now. Firefighters in Canada have been battling wildfires in Alberta, British Columbia and Nova Scotia. Take a look at this satellite image from NASA. It shows smoke from the wildfires moving south. Quebec is the biggest hot spot at the moment with more than 150 active wildfires burning. All of it is expected to keep U.S. cities blanketed with smoke into tomorrow. CNN's Athena Jones is joining us from here in New York. What are the conditions now? I can see a little bit of haze still out there behind you.",

You can see another sightseeing boat taking off.We've seen a lot of people trying to go about their daily lives, running. Some of them wearing masks. Some of them not wearing masks. But certainly the hazy conditions, the smoky conditions continue. This is all about health and safety. This is why we're seeing officials here in New York City and officials and agencies up and down the northeast, all the way down to Raleigh, North Carolina, I should say, telling people to be cautious, to limit their time outdoors. This looks a bit better than it did at least to my eye last night. It looked last night like there was a cloud that had descended straight on the city. But if you look at the numbers, they're still at very unhealthy levels when it comes to the air quality index. And these are pollutants that are among the tiniest and most dangerous pollutants. It's called PM 2.5, particulate matter. And that means it's so tiny that when you inhale this stuff it can go deep into your lungs and get - and pass into the bloodstream and cause all sorts of health problems, like asthma, respiratory issues, heart disease and it can make any other -- anyone who's suffering from that sort of thing, the symptoms much, much worse. And so that is why we're seeing schools here in the city and upstate in central New York, ten school districts canceling outdoor activity. We know that Mayor Adams - Mayor Eric Adams here in New York is about to hold a press conference next hour to give us an update on what to expect. But we know that of course you don't want to be at the top of the list of most polluted cities in the world. And that's why New York has been over the last couple days. Sara.",

And to answer your question, I think we've got at least another daywhere we're going to have this brown hazy smoke in the sky. Now, you may have enjoyed maybe the beautiful sunrises and sunsets as this cloud is in the upper levels of the atmosphere, too, and it blocks out the sun, it filters out the short wavelengths and leaves us that red hue, but it's when it settles to the ground that it becomes an issue. And Athena has been appropriately reporting on that because obviously this has major health implications for people like myself who is an asthmatic. Just take a look at the National Mall in Washington, D.C. It's not only New York City, it's also Philadelphia, it's also Baltimore and our nation's capital. The big apple, though, jostling with what was the notoriously most polluted city in the world. Delhi, India, one time, of course, topping the list of the most polluted cities in the entire planet. Just incredible. Now, you have to look to the satellite imagery to see what's going on. And quite literally last night we saw a wall of smoke progressing across Lake Ontario from the wildfires in Quebec. And that is what we will see in the hours and days to come because, look, the fires aren't going anywhere. They're going to be burning for several more days if not weeks. And that smoke, all dependent on the wind direction, is going to filter it into some of the most populated areas, all registers unhealthy to hazardous levels of particulate matter that Athena was talking about. Here is the smoke forecast. You can see kind of another large area, a plume of smoke will be filtering in through the rest of the workweek, and that is why we have so many million Americans under this air quality alert currently impacting not only the quality of the air, but also the visibility that you and I see as we step outside. So, if you're an asthmatic, don't forget your inhaler, right, Sara.",

Vatican officials say the pope, who is 86 years old, has been placed under general anesthesia to fix a hernia. And he's expected to remain hospitalized for several days for recovery afterward.CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta, he joins us now for more on this. Sanjay, so the word from the Vatican is that the hernia surgery is intended to fix what they describe as, quote, recurrent, painful and worsening symptoms. What can you tell us about this surgery? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, this is almost assuredly related to an operation that he had back for his colon back in 2021. When you do that sort of operation, you're opening up the abdominal wall, you're doing the operation that needs to be done on the colon, and then you try to repair the abdominal wall as well. Sometimes that repair of the abdominal wall becomes loose. So, your abdominal wall actually starts to splay open a bit. And as a result, you know, you may notice sort of just pooching, which is not problematic, it's just cosmetic. But ultimately if that opening is larger and larger, you can start to actually get bowel, you know, the rest of the colon, small intestine, whatever, sort of pooching through there. And that - that's what's quite painful. And that is what is called an abdominal hernia. And I just want to tell you, Kate, a lot of people hear the term hernia and they immediately think of a hernia that's located in the groin area. This is different. This is really probably due to the incision that he had back for that original operation and sort of the opening of the - of the skin and the muscle around that operation. That's what - that's what the hernia is in this case. Most of the times it does require a surgical repair, as you can see there. So, this is not that surprising, but that's likely what he's undergoing now.",

Because really in many ways you're focusing on the muscles, the skin, you may put in mesh to try and create a solid sort of closure there.But he's 86 years old. I've got to tell you, I've operated on patients even this week that are older than that. So, you know, you can have patients that go through these types of operations and come out just fine. But those are the -- probably the biggest risks. [09:10:02] You know, we know, obviously, about the pope's health. And most of his health history has been recent. He had this - he's had - he had a fever in May, as you may remember, and there was some concern at that point just over the infection. He's had lung surgery when he was very young and then he had this colon surgery back in 2021. But there's not a lot of other, you know, cardiovascular sort of health concerns that we know about with regard to the pope. Obviously, they're going to try and do this as quickly as possible so he's under anesthesia as little time as possible. But, yes, I - you've got to take this seriously given his age, given the anesthesia and I'm sure that's what they're doing right now. I mean I think this operation's currently undergoing.",

This is the second time the bridge has crumbled in just over a year. Indian officials have ordered an investigation but they still haven't said publicly what caused the first collapse. CNN has not confirmed reports of any injuries there. Kate?",

They believe that there are persuadable Republicans who want a conservative leader and that they believe that Mike Pence will be able to sell that message here in Iowa. And that persuasion begins today.They do acknowledge that Pence, yes, is well-known to Republicans, that he is 100 percent name ID. What they may not remember, though, is that he has decades of leadership as a governor of Indiana, as a conservative leader in Congress. And they say that in that launch video you heard those messages kind of harkening back to those conservative ideals, especially of a former president, that of Ronald Reagan. But you may also notice he did not say Donald Trump's name. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE PENCE (R), 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're better than this. We can turn this country around. But different times call for different leadership. Today our party and our country need a leader that will appeal, as Lincoln said, to the better angels of our nature. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That retail politics here in Iowa. One to one with the voters where Pence can sell his message, sell his message of faith, of conservatism. He believes that it is here in Iowa that those are the Republicans he can reach who are persuadable.The question, though, Kate, is, are there enough of them? The campaign estimates there's 75 percent to 80 percent that they might be able to wiggle. It's just unclear if that math will stand. Kate.",

How do they take on Donald Trump? Mike Pence, as we've seen, he's much more subtle in how he has separated himself from the president up to this point. We'll see what it looks like from here. Chris Christie, now another candidate, very different approach, going much more directly at Donald Trump. Is it clear that, though, either of these approaches is welcome in today's Republican Party?",

As Kyung was just talking about, the former vice president is going to be making his - you know, essentially calling on his biography and talking about his conservative record. Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is doing anything but. He's going directly at former President Donald Trump. He said that is what the Republican Party needs to do. So sort of a hammer and glove approach, if you will.But take a listen to Christie last night in New Hampshire. Made clear that he is going for the jugular of Donald Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRIS CHRISTIE (R), 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: A lonely, self- consumed, self-serving mirror hog is not a leader. The reason I'm going after Trump is twofold. One, he deserves it. And, two, it's the way to win. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Yes, some people in the Republican Party, and certainly others, independents and likely Democrats agree with his assessment there, but is he the right messenger to make the case that Donald Trump, as he says, is a mirror hog. Obviously, that is not likely to sort of dissuade any Trump supporters.So, we are going to see a variety of approaches here as the summer months continue of how they go after the former president. But one thing is clear, Kate, as the field continues to grow, Trump is still the chief beneficiary of all of these alternatives because it simply splits up the vote. So that is also what worries some Republican leaders, Kate.",
