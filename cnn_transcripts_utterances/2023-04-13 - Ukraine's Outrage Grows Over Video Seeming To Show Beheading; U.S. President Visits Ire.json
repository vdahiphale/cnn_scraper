At least two videos posted online show apparent beheading of still alive Ukrainian soldiers.CNN has made an editorial decision not to air those videos because they're simply too graphic. But a warning you're about to see still images from the scene. If children are watching right now, it would be best if they leave the room. These images again just still shots but many will find them disturbing. Though take a video posted on a pro Russian social media channel last week. Now at the center of yet another war crimes investigation by Ukrainian authorities. It appears to show the bodies of two Ukrainian soldiers next to a destroyed military vehicle. On the video, one person is heard laughing and then saying in Russian, someone came up to the soldiers and cut off their heads. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy described whoever could do this as beasts. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): This video shows Russia as it is. What kind of creatures are they? They don't care about a human being, a son, a brother, a husband, someone's child.

I think it's clear that there is a systemic process here that's ordering these rapes and these murders, and the torture and the kidnapping of children. I think we need to throw that in there.

It's intended to intimidate, it's intended to frighten.But I think we also need to realize that some of this, perhaps all of it is also an initiation ritual. And it's designed to take troops that haven't been properly trained, that have no ethics training, like our troops do, for instance. And it's designed to make them part of a team.

Under the proposal, up to two thirds of all new vehicles sold in the U.S. would be electric by 2032. The end result cutting car pollution that contributes to climate change in half. The EPA says transportation accounts for almost a third of all carbon pollution emissions in the U.S., but right now only about 4 percent of Americans own an electric vehicle. Recent polls suggested U.S. consumers are still skeptical. The U.S. lags way behind Europe and China in terms of making the switch. For more, let's head over to Los Angeles. Margo Oge is with us, chair of the board of the International Council on Clean Transportation.

You know, companies like General Motors has announced that they will phase out gasoline and diesel new car sales by 2035. California and 16 other states have announced the same, that they're going to phase out the sales of new gasoline and diesel cars by 2035. You know, California and the 16 states represent something like 40 percent of cars sold in the U.S. so what -- where we're going today with the EPA's proposal is the right direction because as you said transportation is the number one contributor of climate change. But let's not forget that the industry is a global industry. They're not going to build a car for China or U.S. or Europe. They're going to build a car for the global major markets.

California's leading their way. But California by itself cannot do it. We need the federal government and we have seen that not just the companies are moving forward. Not just EPA's proposing this very strong standards, but we have this massive, massive investments that are going to put -- they're put in place by President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act like $370 billion for clean cars and investments across the country, including tax, you know, tax credits and incentives for tracks (ph) and so forth. So there is a -- there is a great I think time for the country to move forward. We are (INAUDIBLE) to the planet. I mean, let's not forget John the U.S. represents just 5 percent of the population, the global population. It will contribute 25 percent of climate change pollution, so it's about time for the U.S. to move forward, and that's what this proposal is all about. VAUSE: On the other side of this equation, though, how important is it to sort of be upfront with, you know, the American public that when it comes to zero emission vehicles, electric vehicles, there is still an environmental costs here. Those environmental costs are major in the manufacturing stage, and also you know where you actually get your power from to charge the vehicle. So if you're getting your power from, you know, coal fired power plant your Tesla or your Prius isn't as green perhaps as you might think. And so that's why this is sort of an all, you know all of government if you like. All of the -- all of everything approach.
