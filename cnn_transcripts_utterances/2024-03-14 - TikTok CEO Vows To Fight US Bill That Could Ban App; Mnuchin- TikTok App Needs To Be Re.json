And now, he says he wants to buy a tech company in political trouble. TikTok put, as you in Clare were just talking about, that won't be easy, nor will it be cheap. Some analysts think that TikTok could be worth $100 billion. There is no guarantee that Steve Mnuchin can come up with that kind of dough this quickly. But the bigger issue here is no one actually says that TikTok is for sale. I mean, Julia, you and I can say that we are putting together a group of investors, divide the Statue of Liberty, it doesn't mean that the Statue of Liberty is for sale. And I think that's the biggest issue here is that, as you were just discussing, China has made clear that they have no desire to have this company be sold. Tech analyst, Dan Ives, he told me that China is never going to allow TikTok to be sold with the source code, and without the source code they said this would be like buying an F1 car without the engine, right? It is kind of pointless because that is the secret sauce that makes TikTok so successful. That is the crown jewel, but it also of course goes to a lot of the national security issues here. And so that is why some people think that if this bill goes through the Senate, which is no guarantee, and if it gets signed into law, that the more likely buyer would be a tech company. But you and I, Julia know that some of the progressive lawmakers here in the United States, like Elizabeth Warren, they would not be pleased with the idea of a giant tech company acquiring a company like TikTok.

And the crucial difference there is that ByteDance could sue under the US system as well. I think we can forget the fact that even just the legal challenges that will be presented in the face of this push this way beyond the November elections.

That includes Facebook and Instagram, and YouTube, and the company formerly known as Twitter. All of them are unavailable in China. Of course, they have different political system some there and just because it is going on in China doesn't mean it should happen here. I mean, it is like I tell my four-year-old, right.

And what we saw was a successful launch and separation of the super heavy booster and the Starship spacecraft on top. You can see the liftoff there, very early this morning from Boca Chica, Texas, right on the border with Mexico. Then there was that hot stage separation, which was a success. And that's when things really got interesting because this is when Starship went further and faster than any of the previous two flight tests, and its sent back this incredible HD live footage for almost the entire duration of its 49-minute test flight. And we saw it re-entering or entering the Earth's atmosphere. This plasma - - red hot plasma burning up around Starship. It is the kind of footage that I've never seen before, Julia, before it broke up, likely just over, there it is, that's that red hot plasma that I was talking about, before breaking up just over the Indian Ocean and you know, yes, the ultimate goal, pie in the sky goal was for a splashdown. Starship literally landing in the Indian Ocean. It didn't quite make it there, but you know, Julia, I should point out that in order to get a launch license, SpaceX has to put an ultimate destination even if that's not the primary objective.

At the same time, we definitely need to do more about understanding how this crime is perpetuated and one of our major concerns is the fact that vulnerable people are actually -- trafficking victims are actually used to commit other criminal acts by the traffickers. This is part of the trafficking chain. It is one of the trafficking forms. So the high percentage of women that are convicted as traffickers is for a major concern because it shows, we think to a large degree that what the authorities are looking at is usually what the police are looking at is the low level criminals, those that are actually are the first ones that they would come across, and usually this may be trafficking victims as well.

So that's when we saw an actual significant increase of online trafficking, especially sexual exploitation, the posting of videos, sexual abuse, including of children and we have also new form of trafficking which is emerging and is particularly prevalent in Asia, which is called the cyber scams. Basically people being forced into compounds to commit online scams across the world. So the victims can be anywhere in the world, can be a telephone call.

U.S. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer called for elections in Israel on the Senate floor today. Schumer is the highest ranking Jewish elected official in the United States. He said many Israelis have lost confidence in Benjamin Netanyahu's government. And the White House is searching for answers to the ongoing crisis in Haiti, and they could use Guantanamo Bay, Cuba as a temporary solution. The center has been used for years to process migrants. This comes as concerns grow over a potential exodus from Haiti due to rampant gang violence. And the White House says it's, quote, \"very concerned\" by a suspected Russian attacks on the Alexei Navalny's former chief of staff. Leonid Volkov was assaulted outside his home in Lithuania on Tuesday. Lithuania calls it the first case of, quote, \"political terrorism\" in that country. It's still investigating, but says the attack appeared well fund. SpaceX has lost its latest Starship rocket on re-entry. The Texas launch started promisingly, but then the rocket lost communication and broke apart. Despite this, SpaceX says the launch is still a major success as the rocket reached orbital speed. The Starship made it farther into the test flight than ever before. So far, one of Donald Trump's most effective legal strategies is trying to delay the cases against him and it appears to be working. In Florida, a judge says she'll rule promptly on some of the arguments from Trump's attorneys to throw out the classified documents case against him. The former president attended today's hearing, which wrapped up a short time ago. His attorneys claimed that as president, Trump was legally entitled to take the materials to his estate. Now one of the criminal trials of Donald Trump may be delayed, too, by up to 30 days. New York prosecutors said they will not oppose a motion by Trump's team to delay the proceedings to review new materials. The case relates to alleged hush money payments the former president made to porn star Stormy Daniels. And CNN legal analyst Norm Eisen joins us now. Norm, for our poor viewers who are trying to keep up with all these different cases, be they civil, legal, federal, or state, I think the point that I made at the top is very important. What is consistent among all of these cases is different efforts by the legal teams to delay the process upon which he's actually either appearing in court or facing a jury, in whichever case we're talking about. Talk to me first about the 30-day delay in the hush money payment case because his lawyers were pushing for 90 days, I believe.",

Documents that he asked for a year ago are suddenly being produced at the last minute by another government office, a federal office, in response to Trump's subpoena.

The judge did say that the argument that they seem to be making was, quote, \"forceful,\" but she said, look, that would be for a jury to decide. So she's not going to throw it out. In the end, you have to go face a jury and have this out with them. So to your point, she seems to be at least listening thing to the arguments that they're making. My question would be, if she decided in his favor and said, fine, we throw this out, what's left of the Presidents Records Act?

So the jury is never going to rule for Donald Trump on this count. I don't even think it should go to the jury. That's another issue for far down the line. So Trump will say anything to delay these cases. And indeed, he got some delay in New York. It looks like he's going to get some delay in New York.
