And back in 2020, Hunter Biden, essentially, started paying child support under a court's order monthly. We don't know the amount. But last year, he and his attorneys went back into court and said, you know, his income has changed. We need to readjust what that child support is going to look like monthly.And that has opened up, basically, a pretty messy court fight now. It has allowed the mother of the child, London Roberts, she and her attorneys to pursue a lot of different questions about Hunter Biden and his finances. They're asking for things like, how is he paying for so many lawyers? We know that Hunter Biden has legal issues, not just in this Arkansas court related to this child support case, but also has been under criminal investigation in Delaware related to his taxes and other issues for several years now. And so, she has been -- London Roberts and her attorneys have been asking for financial information. They want to know about the income that he has been generating. If he has income coming in now. How he has properties that he is living in. They also want the child to be able to take the Biden name. Right now, the child's name is undisclosed but isn't Biden. And they say that the judge should consider letting this child have the prestige that comes along with the president's last name, the child's grandfather. And then on the other side of things, Hunter Biden and his lawyers, they do not want some of the people on London Roberts' legal team to have access to this information. They're trying to keep his finances protected. It's all moving towards trial, and that's why they're in court today. John.",

This motion, really, doesn't have any chance of winning.They are seeking to disqualify Willis, and to expunge the special grand jury report from the record entirely based on this argument that we have seen in the court of public opinion which is that this is a witch hunt, this is politically motivated.

It does not smell great. It smells pretty awful over here. And let me show you exactly why. Come over here. This is what happens. It kind of piles up out here and then it decays and it smells, quite frankly, like a rotten egg.So, yes, a lot of tourists are still coming out here but maybe not getting into the ocean as much, kind of trying to find a dry patch. Take a look behind me, you can still see there are tourists here, but they're having to deal with this. And this is not new. This has been coming to the Coast of Florida for years now. What is new is that it is coming earlier, and the record amounts that we are seeing. And when it is out there, when it is in the ocean, in a 5,000-mile body of seaweed headed this way, it is still growing. One scientist said, what we are seeing here is the tip of the iceberg and this can double in size in just a matter of weeks, if not a month. So, again, tip of the iceberg that we're dealing with here. You know, we talked to one couple that came out here to celebrate a 60th birthday, and let's just say that their vacation is not going as planned. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And take a look at who is most likely to experience the loneliness, it is black people, it is Hispanic people, it is people who are of lower incomes. It is also parents, which is interesting. It is also people who are under 25.You know, what was interesting about this essay, it was so beautifully written. But Dr. Murphy talked about his own experience with loneliness. How he felt disconnected from the people who loved him. And he talked about how loneliness and depression erodes your sense of who you are. Chips away at your very sense of self-esteem.
