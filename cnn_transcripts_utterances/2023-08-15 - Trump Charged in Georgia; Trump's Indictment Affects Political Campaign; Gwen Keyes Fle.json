In an interview with Fox News Digital late last night, he said the indictment was, quote, \"tailored for placement right smack in the middle of his political campaign.\"CNN's Alayna Treene is live in Washington this morning. Alayna, I was watching your reporting come through throughout just about every hour last night of where the Trump team was, what they were planning on, what they were waiting for. Now that this has happened, now that the 98 pages are out, what are they doing behind the scenes?",

      "sentences": "Right. Well, they've had to deal with this three times before. They have a playbook that they have used with the previous indictments that Donald Trump has faced and they think it's working. And so they're going to continue to use that, I'm told.And, I did, I spoke with many of Donald Trump's advisers, both in the leadup to that indictment dropping yesterday and after, and they were very prepared. They had been preparing pre-written statements. They had been talking to his surrogates and allies preparing them with talking points and really readying them for when potential charges were filed. And then, of course, once we saw the indictment drop, we saw Donald Trump's allies immediately take to Twitter, go on - you know, span the airwaves and defend him. People like Jim Jordan, who said that he did nothing wrong, people like House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who argued that this was a witch hunt and that the -- President Biden has been weaponized against Donald Trump. And the president himself, the former president, Donald Trump, also, in a long winding interview with Fox News yesterday, also addressed these charges. He said, quote, \"this politically-inspired indictment, which could have been brought close to three years ago, was tailored for placement right smack in the middle of my political campaign, where I'm leading all Republicans, by a lot, and beating Joe Biden soundly in almost all polls.\" And again, Poppy and Phil, we have seen this before. Donald Trump wants to message this on his own terms. He wants to own the narrative here. And I think you're going to continue to see him talking about this, both on truth social, but in additional media interviews in light of these new charges.",

Of course, Donald Trump does not want to be indicted. This is massive legal headache. He recognizes, as does his team, that this is going to largely create problems for his campaign, at least from, you know, a scheduling and logistics standpoint, but also potentially, you know, as they look ahead to not just with primary voters, but if they are able to win the nomination. That's a far way off. But if he is, like, how would this play in a general election? They're very worried about that.But in the short term, they do see the benefits. You'll see them continue to push this on fundraising, continue to talk about it. And I do think that eventually, if Donald Trump does appear in person for a court appearance, again, that's still premature as well.

PAUL BEGALA, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Right. I think it can. It can among those independents that Trump has to get in order to get 50 percent, in order to get back to the White House. First off, can I just say, it's an outrage that the federal courts won't have cameras in them. I mean can you -- the founders wrote into the Constitution that trials have to be in public. If we -- that meant the -- back then the pencil press could come in. That's all we had. It's insane that the federal courts don't let cameras in. This is -- these are our employees, these are our courtrooms. So, I'm sorry to get on my soap box here. The difference here though is, Donald Trump has spent more end on the business - more time on the business end of a camera than probably even more than Ronald Reagan, than any politician in our lifetime. He knows how to perform on camera. The difference is, on his TV show, at his rallies, he's in charge. In this trial, the judge is going to be in charge. The jury - the -- and the viewers, we don't see anything that that judge doesn't want to let in. And I think that could really be frustrating for Trump. He's a - he's a guy who likes to control things. And I think it actually might not work to his advantage. I think he's far better suited, by the way, skipping the debate on Wednesday next week and showing up at the courthouse to be arraigned and he'll show everybody that the ratings for a five-minute statement at his courthouse will be 100 times higher than all of the non-Trump Lilliputians debating. So, I think it's nuts for him to debate. I think he should just show up, be arraigned, and then have a media circus.",

And, you know, Phil, you're an old ballplayer. I'm reminded of what Yogi Bera once said, that when you come to a fork in the road, you take it. Well, if you're a Republican returning against Donald Trump, you have four forks in the road right now, or maybe 91 forks. This would be the time to take one of those forks and use it. We'll ultimately see if that do that or not. But I'm reminded of \"Star Wars\" and the lesson that it taught us, that ultimately Luke Skywalker had to confront Darth Vader. He couldn't sit back and hope that the force or Hans Solo would take care of it for him. And ultimately what we've seen with these Republicans who are running against Trump more in theory than in practice is that they are depending on one thing that in politics you typically say, and Donald Trump is obviously atypical, hope is not a strategy.

The problem was that candidate was running against Republican candidate Burt Jones, who was one of the 16 fake electors in Georgia, which made him a potential target of Willis' investigation. A Georgia judge then blocked Willis from pursuing an investigation of Jones after his attorneys argued her political actions should disqualify her from doing that. The judge, Robert McBurney called the fundraiser a, quote, \"what are you thinking moment,\" and said, quote, \"the optics are horrific.\" But I should note, that same judge has also praised Willis' handling of this investigation.
