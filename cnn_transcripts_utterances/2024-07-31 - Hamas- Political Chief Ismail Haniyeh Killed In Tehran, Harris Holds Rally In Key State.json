      "sentences": "Well, Jessica is really officials are not confirming that they were responsible for this assassination in the heart of Tehran, but as saying that they do not comment on reports in the foreign media, but Hamas, as well as Iranian state media are confirming that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in building in Tehran.The Iranian state media saying that it was an airborne guided projectile that was fired at the building where he was staying. Hamas describing it as an airstrike. What is clear is that Ismail Haniyeh is dead, the target of quite brazen assassination by (AUDIO GAP) which certainly raises the stakes for this region. We just need to take stock of what has happened just the last few days as we have watched, really tectonic shifting of the situation in this region. After earlier this weekend, Hezbollah carried out a rocket attack on the Golan Heights. Israel (AUDIO GAP) you saw that response play out last night as Fu'ad Shukr, a Hezbollah senior military commander, was taken out in an Israeli strike. And within the very same 24-hour period, Israel appears to have then taken this assassination out in Tehran on Hamas's political leader. So not only is this potentially pushing this region closer to the brink of war, a region that was already very much on edge but in addition to that, this will also have significant implications on those ongoing ceasefire and hostage release talks earlier this week, Israel submitted its response to those going negotiations, but for the short term, at least, I think its very clear that those negotiations are going to go absolutely nowhere now. Ismail Haniyeh with the key interlocutor with the Qataris, the mediators in these negotiations. And we will have to see in the medium and the long term what the impact will be. But at least for now, it appears that those ceasefire negotiations, the momentum and at least has been lost -- Jessica.",

An IDF spokesperson saying that strike was in retaliation for an attack earlier this week in the Golan Heights that killed 12 children at a soccer field.

Good morning to both of you. Kim, let's start first with you. This is -- this is a very significant 48 hours that we've seen -- really weaken even back up to the week with the attack on the Golan Heights that killed those 12 children. And now what has followed after this. We have the killing of this Hezbollah top military commander in Beirut and now the Hamas political leader in Tehran. Set the stage for us, where we are this morning as everyone is waking up. How this conflict has evolved?",

      "sentences": "Had it stayed just at the presumed killing of Fu'ad Shukr inside Beirut, this might have been for tat gone back to his below attacking Israeli military targets on the border.Now that it presumably Israel has escalated to killing the political leader of Hamas inside Tehran, we've got a number of layers of complications. By hitting them inside Iran, this man was an official Iranian guest, as well as, of course, as U.S. and Israeli officials tell us, a proxy for Iran. But he was also the more moderate wing of the party. He was the one who most of the peace talks were going through. He'd actually been one of the few voices within Hamas urging a more political track as opposed to Yahya Sinwar and the military wing inside Gaza that masterminded October 7. Haniyeh and many of those in Qatar, the Hamas leaders in Qatar, had said they weren't part of the October 7 planning. That they weren't aware of it. And now that moderate, potentially moderate voice is off the stage, and that leaves Israel -- that leaves Iran and Hezbollah wanting some sort of revenge against Israel. Will lead to something like the 300-missile strike that are Iran took on Israel after one of its own was killed in a presumed Israeli strike? That's the question.",

There have been a number of top Iranians killed inside Iran, even near Tehran, including the head of the nuclear program in 2020 and Israel never said, yes, we did that. But it was done in a similar fashion with a drone or some sort of aerial device.Where this leaves this though with everyone presuming that it was Israel carrying it out is I think were going to see the peace talks get frozen. This is a scary, scary time for the families of the hostages because he Hamas wing inside Gaza was the hardest to convince to take a step towards a ceasefire and exchange hostages for Palestinian prisoners without someone like the political wings leader pushing for that. Without Ismail Haniyeh there, I think we're going to have a big gap before any return to talks.",

And the thing is, and that's why she probably said that yesterday about the debate, you know, say to my face and come here and then let's talk it out.And I think that that's because she's really good at those snappy replies that they haven't been able to master. I think thinking about to her time when she ran for D.A., her first big raise, she was always really snappy, really fast, really quick, and I think that Republicans haven't been able to figure out how to handle that. Especially, you know, we heard J.D. Vance say that, they've also been coming on her for being a woman, for being childless. I think Donald Trumps suggested yesterday that she wouldn't be able to hold her weight against foreign leaders.

She did come out after drug cartel leaders showing her time in California.And I think that that's, you know, a tool that they haven't really spoken about when she was running for VP, when she was running for Senate. But I think that right now, they're trying to emphasize so much is that like prosecutor versus criminal aspect of the race that even going into immigration, she actually has a record of showing, you know, I did come after the guys -- the bad guys. And I think, you know, that border czar situation that Republicans are really trying to nail on it, its going to take them a little bit to not take Democrats a little bit more explaining to figure out what she was actually doing there. She was supposed to be talking to Central American leaders about the push factors and everything. But that's not something you can get on a quippy message. I think that that's going to be a challenge to be like, no, this is actually what she had to do. But then compare that to the rest of her record and see how that goes as a message.",
