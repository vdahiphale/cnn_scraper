Trump's team, the president-elect, announces new picks for the top jobs, including two immigration hardliners. Under fire, a plane hit by gunfire over Haiti, leaving a flight attendant injured and bullet holes in the cabin. We'll have the latest in a live report. Fakes found in astonishing discovery of a huge network of forged artwork in Italy. And misogyny misery. The My Body, My Choice movement hijacked by men and used to attack women. We'll look at how South Korea is responding to similar abuse. That conversation and much more, coming up. But first, the Trump transition team continues to fill key roles in the upcoming administration. The president-elect is expected to announce Stephen Miller, his top immigration adviser, as White House deputy chief of staff for policy. Vice President-Elect J. D. Vance calling it, another fantastic pick. Former New York Congressman Lee Zeldin has been picked to the administrator of Environmental Protection Agency. Zeldin says, quote, \"We will restore U.S. energy dominance.\" This after Trump said he's chosen Tom Homan, as his borders czar to oversee mass deportations of undocumented immigrants. Homan served as the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the previous Trump White House. And the president-elect has picked New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik to serve as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. She is a longtime Trump ally. Well for more, Stephen Collinson joins us now from D.C. Good to see you, Stephen. So, Trump loyalists certainly filling up Trump's wish list. We did see Trump's pick or a suggestion for his pick for Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller. I just want to play some sound from Stephen Miller about what he said about immigrants. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEPHEN MILLER, TRUMP'S EXPECTED PICK FOR DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF FOR POLICY:  America is for Americans and Americans only. You have two policy objectives that you proceed with utter determination on, seal the border and no illegals in. Everyone here goes out. That's very straightforward. You would establish a large-scale staging grounds for removal flight So, you grab illegal immigrants and then you move them to the staging grounds and that's what the planes are waiting for federal law enforcement to then move those illegals home. You deputize the National Guard to carry out immigration enforcement. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He's very much in line with the hardline conservative orthodoxy that there should really be no attempts to flight -- fight climate change. He said in the statement that accompanied his nomination that from day one, Trump would drill baby drill, basically open up vast ways of the United States to oil drilling to make America, again, the world's most prominent energy power. So, as the COP conference begins in Azerbaijan, this is really casting appall over global efforts to fight climate change, not just because the United States plans to pull out of the Paris Agreement in the Trump administration, it raises the question of why should other nations take steps to flight climate change that are economically punitive, in many ways, if one of the biggest polluters, the United States doesn't.",

And he certainly has reason for that. Belief, and that is because in 2020, when Donald Trump put out his peace plan at the time, it did indeed call for Israeli settlements to be annexed into Israeli territory in addition to creating a future Palestinian State that did not include some 30 percent of the occupied West Bank. Now, that doesn't mean that Donald Trump is actually going to go ahead and support annexation, certainly not right at the beginning of his term. Now, in terms of the Israeli prime minister himself, you know, he had the opportunity following that 2020 plan to actually move forward with annexation. He chose not to at the time.

And frankly, today, we have seen only thelatest example of it, this plane, that on Monday morning, was targeted by gunfire as it was approaching landing in the International Airport of Port- au-Prince. The incident did not escalate and that is just a remarkable event that only one person was reporting light injuries, and the airplane was safely diverted towards the Dominican Republic. But footage that we at CNN have verified and photos from inside the plane show bullet holes, both in the main body of the aircraft, as well as in the main cabin where all the passengers were staying. And you can imagine the terrifying scenes that both the crew and the passengers would have gone through by seeing their vehicle, their aircraft targeted by gunfire. It's not a -- this has happened before, Lynda. Just last month a helicopter by the United Nations was also targeted by gunfire as it was flying over Port-au-Prince. And the same happened to vehicles owned and operated by the United States embassy in the streets of Port-au-Prince. It shows the decline situation, the security situation in the Caribbean nation is just getting worse and worse. We learned just in the last hour, Lynda, that all operations at this international airport in Port-au-Prince are currently halted as a result of this incident. But it's no coincidence that just on Monday, a new prime minister was sworn in after a tense institutional clash between the previous prime minister and the transitional presidential power. There is a power vacuum in the country. There is a multinational force in the country led by Kenyan police that is struggling to keep the criminal gangs at bay, and the situation seems only to get worse. And now, well, we know that once the airport in Port-au-Prince shuts down the capital is pretty much cut off from the rest of the country because of the control that these international gangs operate in the countryside off the nation. So, a very worrisome situation. Just 100, 150 kilometers away from Miami. Very, very close to the U.S. shore, of course. So, a situation that we're monitoring very closely. Lynda.",

So, Indonesia, just like Southeast Asia, has been a place for relocation or reshoring. And number two, despite the current trade that is increasing, it is starting from the lower base. Remember, Indonesia is a country of 280 million people and half of them below 30 years old. And this is a highly growing and consumptive country. So, we feel that the trade and investment into the country from the U.S. will only increase. And lastly, I think when we see something like the trade tension between the two giants, such as U.S. and China, we think Indonesia can enjoy two parallel tracks on the technology improvement, especially in the area of digitalization and also energy transition. So, we think it is not all bad when it comes to tariff. In the long run, when you have any increase in tariff, especially trade war is never good for the world.

Number one, Indonesia has grown five X in the last 25 years in terms of its GDP, making it the 16th largest GDP country in the world. And we believe we can also grow five X in the next 25 years. Now, President Prabowo just recently inaugurated October 20th. And, you know, we feel his plan is very clear. He wants to not only grow 5 percent, like what we have done in the last 25 years, but also all the way up to 8 percent by doing certain things. Number one, increasing resilience in food security and energy security, and also increasing growth by pushing agenda on education, health care, as well as housing. But increasing also inclusivity, especially to small and medium enterprises and sustainability as we are a country with huge biodiversity. So, all the countries that play along with this narrative will definitely benefit. And Indonesia is also very serious in doing value added exports, which needs a lot of investments and that investments will only increase over time. So, anybody who would like to focus on health, that should be a beneficiary, education, indeed, and also processing critical minerals, especially making it a high value-added product, battery material, sending it to the western world like the U.S., that would be a big, big advantage for such companies.",

They had a good call yesterday. I'm not surprised, even in this visit that there may be a chance for the two leaders to meet, including, of course, with the current President Biden. So, combination of, you know, China plus one strategy, number two, starting from the lower base and then having, you know, America as a destination as the market is large, I think it's a place to start. And Indonesia will only benefit, and I think U.S. will also benefit because of the natural resources that Indonesia has, the human resources, you know, above the ground and many more. And bear in mind, a lot of us are American trained, including the president of Indonesia, for example, and many of its ministers.

His pick for the top of the Environmental Protection Agency in the U.S., a former congressman named Lee Zeldin, who shows a record much more of fealty and loyalty to Trump than any sort of environmental legislation. He voted against most environmental protection in his career as a congressman from New York's Long Island. He's in favor of fracking. And has said early on in the first interviews from day one they will do strict deregulation and try to strip back as many sort of environmental protections from tailpipes to power plants as they possibly can. A lot of momentum in the United States around electrification. And this particular COP in Baku was supposed to be about finance for the developing world. They need hundreds of billions of dollars. The hope is to get a trillion dollars of commitment from richer countries to those who want to didn't contribute to the global warming problem in the first place and now have to brace for the violent physics baked in right now.

We've been seeing a lot ofanti-feminist, pro-natalist policies, and a lot of conservative men reacting with welcoming these policies as well. And just seeing that unfolding again in the U.S. with Trump being elected, I wasn't surprised, but also very sad to see that it's happening worldwide.",

And 4B, it stands for rejectingfour aspects of heterosexual relationships, including marriage, childbearing, dating, and sexual relationships with men. There have been other precursors of the 4B movement with opting out of marriage and childbearing as a way of political activism around mid-2000s, but this 4B movement is a new wave of young feminists, mostly online based feminist, you know, reacting to the rise of anti-feminist policies and sentiments, misogyny, and a lot of gender-based violence cases.",

And of course, there's no official statistics around how many women are participating in the 4B movement andis perceived almost as a niche movement. But based on my research that focuses on heterosexual refusal involving in depth interviews with 130 South Korean women, I find that while 4B is more of a distinct radical feminist identity, there are a lot of women who have already opted out of heterosexual relationships entirely for various personal and feminist reasonings. And even among women who do not identify as 4B, they find that refusing heterosexual relationship benefits women, and that is -- it is a desirable way of living. And we can see in a lot of nationally representative survey in Korean context where one survey finds that almost 27 percent of women said they do not intend to date anyone in the future. And one of the largest reasons for that is their discontent with the patriarchal dating culture. So, we see that while the 4B is more of a radical feminist identity, there is a wide spread, shared sentiment and narratives around participating and refusing heterosexual relationships in South Korea.",

The 18-year-old lost his life Saturday while fighting a fire near the New York and New Jersey border. The Jennings Creek Fire has burned more than 3,000 acres, that's about 1,200 hectares. It's only about 10 percent contained. Recent rain has helped firefighting efforts and improved air quality. However, the wind is picking up and there could be an increased risk on Tuesday. Well, in our Weather Move, Typhoon Toraji brings heavy rainfall and gusty winds to the Philippines, still recovering from other deadly storms. And it looks like there are more on the way.
