Controversial cluster bombs have just arrived from the U.S. Ukraine's military commander says they will give them the advantage over Russian invaders.

Igor Zhovkha is the Ukrainian president's chief diplomatic adviser. And he is joining us from the capital of Kyiv. Welcome back to the show. So, let's start with the takeaway from this NATO summit. NATO promised more security pledges, including from the G7 as well, training in F-16s, Germany is giving more Patriot missiles.

This same activist tweeted just today, in response to that exchange, that she will have to tell her two children, which she brought up in this exchange, to be \"strategically patient.\" There we see the tweet from Daria.

And on each and every of this meeting, not only we discuss the results of the NATO summit, vis-a-vis Ukraine, and how to proceed. What are the conditions, which (INAUDIBLE)? The conditions are, first of all, the security conditions. Certainly, Ukraine has to win the war in order to become a full-fledged member. We never put it like this that Ukraine has to become a member to NATO before the end of the war. But on these bilateral meetings, apart from this very important issue, we dwelled up on other important issues like further military support for my country coming from these countries. We discussed practical military -- complete military packages, and some of the countries, including the countries you mentioned, announced additional packages. It's very important forming of coalition of (INAUDIBLE) was also the results of the summit. And certainly, each and every leader who talked with my president said that there will be standing next to Ukraine. You heard President Biden saying in the press conference with my president, we are stuck with you. So, this is very positive. We are going together, shoulder to shoulder, with each of our allies in order to win the war. That's the ultimate goal. We all need, only -- not only Ukraine, but all our allies.

How to take the global peace formula summit, where not the representatives only of Europe and the Euro-Atlantic community, but yes, all those countries global countries should be present, to be discussing among themselves and to be active and diplomat in Ukraine (INAUDIBLE) peace formula.
