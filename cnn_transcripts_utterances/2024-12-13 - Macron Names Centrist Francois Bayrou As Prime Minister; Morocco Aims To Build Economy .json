If you take a look at what has been on the market, down 85 at the moment, and as the gavel gets -- let's see what we've got as that gavel -- one, two, oh, there we go. Yes, firm gavels. The markets are closed. It is ten o'clock here in Morocco. A special edition of QUEST MEANS BUSINESS tonight. Emmanuel Macron appoints a new prime minister, France's fourth in a year. Francois Bayrou faces the same budget roadblocks as his predecessors. Celebrations across Syria at the first Friday prayers after the fall of Assad. And a visit to Essaouira, where the Muslims and Jews have lived side by side for centuries. Tonight, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS live from Marrakesh in Morocco. It is Friday, December the 13th. I am Richard Quest, in Marrakesh, as elsewhere, of course. I mean business. And a very good evening to you, wherever you're joining us. The program tonight comes from Marrakesh in Morocco, a special edition of the program. I've been here all this week, filming for \"World of Wonder,\" which, of course, you'll see next month, but it has given me the chance to see this country's lively markets and beautiful ancient sites and we hope to bring some of that to you tonight as well, as well as Morocco's efforts to modernize its society. I've been speaking to the special adviser to his majesty, the King of Morocco about this country's place in the region. You'll hear that conversation within the hour. We will get to all of it, but only after we've dealt with our business and regular news agenda. And we begin in France, where the new prime minister says it is a moral duty to reduce the country's debt. Francois Bayrou is a centrist ally of President Emmanuel Macron. He will need the support of a divided Parliament as he aims to pass his budget. Now, you'll recall it was just a matter of days since his predecessor, Michel Barnier, lost a vote of no confidence. He was trying to force his own budget through. But Bayrou must now act quickly if he is going to keep the government open. There are a variety of reports to what happens and procedures if he can't. CNN's Melissa Bell now looks at the difficulties the new prime minister will face. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELISSA BELL, CNN SENIOR PARIS CORRESPONDENT (on camera): France has a new prime minister, the country's fourth this year. Francois Bayrou has taken over, named by Emmanuel Macron after the collapse of Michel Barnier's government just nine days ago. It had been the failure of his government to get through the 2025 budget that had triggered a no- confidence vote, and many of the same challenges are likely to face the new prime minister. Francois Bayrou, considered a centrist, someone who has been around for decades and who just might be the man to bring together the many disparate parts of France's political spectrum right now. FRANCOIS BAYROU, FRENCH PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Faced with such a serious situation, my course of action will be to hide nothing, neglect nothing, and leave nothing aside.",

Still, it is considered that Francois Bayrou may just be the man for the job. Melissa Bell, CNN, Paris. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

One is the structural problem of many European countries that have two big industries that is currently facing severe competition out of China, that is suffering from higher energy prices. So this is also pulling down the entire economic activity. And then we have so much political ruse like you mentioned in France, in Germany, which is creating additional uncertainty, and we haven't even started to talk about what the next US administration could mean for Europe when there are tax cuts, when there is deregulation, when there are tariffs, which will all do economic harm to Europe.

So thisalso means that we at least have to wait until next summer before we hopefully then have a functioning German government, and probably also will get new parliamentarian elections, but until then, it will be complete political standstill in Europe. So which means the heavy lifting will again be on the ECB and I expect the ECB to cut interest rates even further. But what should Europe do? They should not only watch the ECB. We have to plan. Mario Draghi presented in September a big plan how to restore competitiveness via reforms, via investments and I always have to think about Jean-Claude Juncker, who I think 10 years ago said during the Euro crisis that all government leaders know what to do, but they simply don't know how to get re-elected, if they did, what had to be done.",

If we really are stuck inan endless stagnation as you said, so I think there will be pressure on Europe also to choose sides and Europe is clearly more dependent on China, so it will be hard for Europe to choose. In the end they will choose for the US very clearly, also due to security reasons. But if this stagnation continues beyond the summer, then the ECB could go lower and we might even see something like one percent, not our base case scenario right now, but you know, the ECB might have to go where it thought it would never have to go again.",

And then there's the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which they want to change entirely if they are not constitutionally able to shut it down. This is all an effort to streamline the number of agencies that banks have to report to and that are running the reams and reams and reams of regulations that this industry has had to comply with that has been built up over the last several decades. But Richard, it's important to note that this is a push that has been tried before, notably in the wake of the Great Recession, lawmakers tried to remove some of those regulatory powers from the Federal Reserve, the regional Fed leadership and systems.

Listen, Richard, we know that the police were going through hundreds of tips at thetime they released that picture where you could actually see the face of their suspect who they now believe is Luigi Mangione. We know that from sources, I can tell you at least three names that I was writing down on my notepad hearing that possibly that could be their suspect. So, they were chasing down a number of leads. It's unclear when this tip came into the NYPD, when it finally made its way from San Francisco, to the FBI in New York, to the NYPD, where, in sort of that pile of names or that evidence, or these tips that they were getting in. It landed that didn't really allow for NYPD to actually, you know, go investigate particularly Luigi Mangione. So that's really the question here. That's something we're still going to ask, but you just said it there. This tip does appear to have come in about four days before that arrest actually happened. And according to the San Francisco Chronicle, it was all based from this Special Victims Unit police officer in San Francisco P.D. who was assigned to that missing person's report that was filed on November 18 by Luigi Mangione's mother. So, he was looking into that and then recognized that face based off that photo that was sent everywhere and that's when the tip sort of started its way down the chain into the NYPD.",

Now if that were to happen, we're told the earliest that he can appear before a judge there in Pennsylvania would be on Tuesday. So that means by Tuesday, maybe there will be a decision on this, and this whole process will be expedited and Mangione will find himself back here in New York, but as of right now, you're right, he's still fighting his extradition.
