That margin has been shrunk down by 20 percentage points. And I think there's some question, you know, on this issue of immigration and border security. Is this an issue that Joe Biden could potentially use as a wedge issue to win some of those Hispanic voters back? But take a look here. A better job on border security and immigration, among Hispanic voters, Trump is actually the one who's favored by 12 points.

There are people from Mexico, there are people from Cuba, there are people from Venezuela, from Central America. They vote differently in many cases, and they vote on the same issue that any average American votes on.

And therefore, I think it's better if the Democrats because they have to win this year because this is -- there's a lot at stake.

Meadows is saying everything he was doing after the election with Donald Trump was essentially part of his duties as a federal officer and, therefore, he should be immune from these charges -- these state charges and these RICO charges. What he wrote here, he says, \"Whatever the chief of staff's role with respect to state election administration does not include altering valid election results.\" And -- you know, and that is clear as day.

So even though the former president is not directly impacted by this decision from the Eleventh Circuit today, the reasoning in the decision does not bode well for Trump's claims of immunity. Of course, no board has previously held. There is such a thing as immunity for a former president from criminal prosecution. The cases are only talking so far from the Supreme Court about immunity from civil lawsuits.But if the former president were to prevail on his claim, his argument, which is novel, that there is such a thing as immunity from criminal prosecution, then a court would have to decide what is the extent of it. And in the civil context, courts have held that it extends to the outer perimeter of the president's official duties. So following the reasoning from the Eleventh Circuit today, if what Meadows was engaged in, which was on behalf of the court said of the Trump re-election campaign was not official because it was private and on behalf of the candidate Trump, then similarly what Trump is alleged to have engaged in, both in the January 6th prosecution in federal court in DC and in the Georgia case, very reasonably could be seen as outside the -- or not within the perimeter of his official duties.

There is still money that's supposed to be flowing, but even there on the front lines, they complain about a lack of equipment. So we've never really had great transparency on exactly what is in whose account.But the morale is already low there because of the stall of USAID even just in the last hours. Indications on Congress they're not getting closer to a deal. And still they're dealing with a Russian force that reinvigorated. There were apparently 13 assaults in the area we were filming in just today, according to some Ukrainian reports. Staggering how Moscow seems to have got its momentum back and is pushing again and again. So, yes, of course, there's going to be a serious impact when that American money finally dries up. Remember, the European Union, too, they're stalling as well on their aid contributions. But you're already beginning to see really the winter, the lack of morale, the fact that the counteroffensive didn't achieve what was thought it potentially might. That's beginning to impact Kyiv. And so, yes, I think as the money runs out, that's going to make a significant change very fast. Pamela?",
