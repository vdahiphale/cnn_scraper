I don't know that Trump versus Biden in the fall. I don't know that RFK Jr. makes much of an impact. I think that the Biden campaign would be wise to allow its surrogates to make the argument against RFK Jr. He's not really a Democrat. He doesn't really pull, I think, in terms of traditional Democratic issues. He's a conspiracy theorist with no political experience, never held office, and is running a mate, a 38-year-old tech executive who's never held office. So the idea that RFK Jr. is somehow offering something new. He's not going to be able to guard against this. He sounds a lot like Donald Trump, another 70-year-old guy who came in with no political experience, who promoted conspiracy theories. I don't think that's going to fly well with Democrats come the general election in the fall.

So I think that Donald Trump doesn't have any room to speak, especially considering the fact that he was out there leading chance for lock her up about Hillary Clinton in 2016 and weaponizing government, willing to weaponize the government to attack his political opponents.And still willing to do the same thing right now. So in the end, you know, Trump supporters aren't going to be moved by the outcome of this election, excuse me, by the outcome of the of the of the case. Whatever the verdict is, I think Trump supporters will continue to support him. Remember that Donald Trump said that he could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody. He wouldn't lose any supporters. And you have people like Tim Scott, who is willing to go on CNN, as he just did just yesterday, and deny that Trump was even booed at the Libertarian Convention, which he clearly was.
