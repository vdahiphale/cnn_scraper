So, Israeli officials, as we just heard Jeremy said, they haven't built up their required forces for an offensive into Rafah yet. They say it could be done in short order. I'm wondering what you think still needs to take place, how many troops in advance like that would require, and how soon this could happen. BRIG. GEN. JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Well, Boris, I think what we're witnessing is the Israelis are being a little more cautious. At least, their narrative is a little more conservative, if you will allow me that, in terms of their approach towards Rafah. The rest of the world has been focusing in on it, as have the Israelis, but I would suggest the Israelis have sufficient manpower, troops on the ground and capabilities, in terms of intelligence, collection, logistics support to their forward-deployed forces, and as well as airpower. So I don't think that there is a real requirement for the buildup of additional forces, irrespective of what's being said. I think there certainly is a little bit of a pause until they figure out how they are going to work this out, in terms of their approach. I would also suggest that what the Israelis, what the IDF has learned over the course of the last several months of combat in Gaza is, they have experienced procedures in terms of this type of tactical fight, and I don't expect it to look any different going into Rafah.",

But also, going forward, this road could provide that type of support, over-the-shore type of logistics that would be coming to shore that can further be distributed into the country.

Here in the next hour, President Biden will be plugging his plan to lower health care costs in New Hampshire.And we're also learning more about former President Trump's plans if he returns to the Oval Office. Last night, Trump posted a video of Hungary's far right authoritarian leader, Viktor Orban, praising him after the two met at Mar-a-Lago on Friday. Orban told a Hungarian broadcaster that Trump will end the war in Ukraine, citing their conversation that Trump will not give -- quote -- \"a single penny\" for the war. We have CNN's Alayna Treene joining us with details on this. All right, Alayna, tell us a little bit more about this conversation between Trump and Orban.",

      "sentences": "Right.Well, Donald Trump heaped praise on Viktor Orban after meeting with the Hungarian prime minister at Mar-a-Lago on Friday. And, essentially, we're told that Donald Trump and a small group of his advisers met with Viktor Orban for roughly an hour. One source described it as a friendly meeting. Another described it as a social meeting. But I think what's interesting to note here is that the two of them are very similar in some ways, especially when it comes to their policies on immigration and the border. We know that both of them have called for a strong border to keep immigrants out of their respective countries. And also both have railed against the press, calling them fake news. But I do want to share with you what Donald Trump posted on social media last night of Viktor Orban, praising him. We have a quote here of what Orban said. He said -- quote -- \"He says the following. First, he will not give a single penny for the Russo-Ukrainian war. That's why the war will end, because it's obvious that Ukraine cannot stand on its own two feet.\" Now, we did also receive, Brianna, a readout from the Trump campaign about some of what they discussed. They said that it was mainly about issues important to Hungary, as well as the U.S., and, again, immigration being a key focus of that, and, of course, as we see in this video, the war in Ukraine as well. But what I want to point out here that I think is really important is that Donald Trump has a history of praising Orban, but also other far right authoritarian leaders, on the trail. And when it comes to some of these issues about his stance on the war in Ukraine, the war in Israel, as well as immigration, it's kind of giving you a preview of what we could expect from Donald Trump if he were elected and took over the White House again, what a second administration for him would look like. And he really has been very positive and -- about his rhetoric when it comes to Orban, saying he's a great leader. And Orban himself has said after that meeting with Donald Trump that he thinks the U.S. would be better and Hungary would be better if he were president again.",

Over the course of the day, lots people were poring over differentparts of it and pointing out there were some inconsistencies, and these were bubbling up over the course of the day. And then, eventually, in the evening U.K. time, the main -- the leading picture agencies, Reuters, AP, AFP, started withdrawing their -- withdrawing the picture from all of their clients. So these are the -- some of the parts of the image which have been questioned. We have had a look at them, certainly some issues with Charlotte's sleeve there and also the zip on Kate's sweater as well. This, of course, speaks to a huge amount of conspiracy about whether there's been a cover-up over Kate's illness, something that we haven't really pursued, but we've almost been forced into pursuing it by the palace now that Kate has admitted manipulating the picture. Now, it might have been small tweaks. It might have been tiny little additions or switches. And they have certainly told me, sources, that she was just touching it up to post on social media. But it wasn't just posted on social media. It also went out to the media as a media handout.

Also, a huge amount of time, hours and hours transpired before the palace actually admitted that they had manipulated the image. So there's a big question of trust there. And I think, going forward, that's going to be a bit of an issue, because we do rely on our relationships with the palaces to get accurate information. And a lot of it is smoke and mirrors. We get offered very little detail most of the time. So we're having to rely on those details.
