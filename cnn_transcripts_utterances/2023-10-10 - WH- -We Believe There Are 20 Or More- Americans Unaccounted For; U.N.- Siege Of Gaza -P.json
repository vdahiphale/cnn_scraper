We are talking to our Israeli counterparts on a daily basis about this question. We're looking back through our intelligence holdings to see if we have any further information on that. We're looking to acquire further intelligence. And if there's an update to that, I'll share it with you. But as I stand here today, while Iran plays this broad role - sustained, deep and dark role - in providing all of this support and capabilities to Hamas, in terms of this particular gruesome attack on October 7th, we don't currently have that information. We will continue to look for it. And if we find it, we will share that with you. Yes.",

Also, you are saying that Iran is complicit in this attack. Are you trying to downplay the Iranian role here? What are you waiting for to take an action?And my second question: What assessment do you have on where other militias, other Iranian militias stand now, whether in Iraq. We also heard the Houthis threat now. Can you give us an update? And is there a risk on the U.S. troops in the region? Thank you. SULLIVAN: So, I - on your first question, I laid out our view, which is the broad complicity based on the longstanding support that Hamas is giving to Iran. We don't have specific information that ties Iran to this attack. At this time, we don't have that information. We may gain that information in the hours and days ahead, but we don't presently have it. So, that's in answer to your first question with respect to the intelligence. With respect to the question of the various militia groups across the region, we do believe that they pose an urgent threat and that it is certainly distinctly possible that they choose to try to exploit or take advantage of this situation. And we have been sending clear warnings that doing so will resort - will result in - in a firm response and consequences from the United States. And that goes across the board. And we have been clear also in sending a message of deterrence through the movement of the carrier strike group into the Eastern Mediterranean, as well as through the assurance that we will sustain F-16s, F-35s, A-10s in theater to be able to deal with any contingency that the United States might have to deal with in the days ahead.

SULLIVAN: The President put out a written statement yesterday with multiple elements to it. One of those elements was about the focus that we have right now on protecting Americans here at home against anyone who would seek to exploit or piggyback on what has unfolded - these gruesome events that have unfolded in Israel. Part of that is about protecting places of worship, synagogues, and ensuring that we don't see a kind of virulent form of anti-Semitism sparked by what has just happened. And then part of that is about ensuring that any terrorist threat here in the United States or to the United States or to Americans anywhere in the world, that we are at a heightened state of vigilance to deal with that. That's something the President directed his team. It's something he spoke to yesterday in that statement. And it's something that he will be convening his national security team on this week, because it remains a very high priority. And I'll take the last question.",

And we stand by bringing those people home because that is the duty of the Commander-in-Chief, is to get innocent Americans out of captivity in places that they are being unjustly detained.

Now, in previous flare-ups between Israel and Gaza, the Egyptians were not very open to any sort of flood of Palestinian refugees coming out and, in fact, this time is similar. There doesn't appear to be any willingness by the Egyptian authorities to allow this to happen. They don't want hundreds of thousands of Palestinians flooding into the Sinai Peninsula.Now, in January of 2008, I was in Gaza when Hamas actually blew up a long stretch of the wall that had been constructed between Egypt and Gaza, and what I saw was hundreds of thousands. In fact, more than half of the population of Gaza left Gaza simply because they're cooped up in that place. The Egyptians panicked. They didn't know how to deal with it. Eventually, they had to bring in extra forces, bring the area under control, and force the Palestinians back. So they don't want the Gazans to come out. So, really, there's nowhere else to go. The Israelis obviously aren't going to allow the people of Gaza in. So I'm not quite sure what sort of diplomatic solution there is to allow the people of Gaza to leave. The Egyptians simply don't want them to come in. Anderson?",
