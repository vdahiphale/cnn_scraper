A few miles from here at a bowling alley was where another one of the mass shootings happened.And look, it's why they have put out the picture of Robert Card as a person of interest. It is, as we understand, the person that law enforcement are trying to track down right now, and it is the person they consider armed and dangerous. We know that these were mass casualty events.

It ends at a trailhead where hikers would go and where there is a boat launch. So if we have a planning person who has gamed all this out -- and by the way, my experience with these cases is there is a lot of planning that goes into developing and planning and equipping yourself for the act and not much on the back end. But if there is a back end plan here, that could be where there was a switch car and then, as you said, Poppy, they have to look at in the intelligence cell in that command center what cars has he ever had, what cars has he ever been pulled over in, what cars has he ever received a ticket in, what cars do family members have that he has access to and look for a switch car?

Congressman, I appreciate your time. I know we've spoken about how this has been a very frustrating three-plus weeks for you.

Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DUSTY JOHNSON (R-SD): What's going to happen now is, I think we're going to need to take a little time to decompress from what was a difficult environment, and we're going to need to have some people do some soul-searching. I think we're going to need to find some people who have never thought of themselves in this way, somebody who's not spent five or ten years trying to become the speaker of the House.

And clearly, we want to help our allies like Israel and Ukraine.I do think we need to work with the White House for them to have a stronger value proposition about why these matters. Of course, in the early days of a conflict like with Ukraine 20 months ago, Americans were there. We understand the stakes. We are appalled at the invasion by Vladimir Putin and his thugs. Over time, people get fatigued. They get exhausted, and they ask legitimate questions about, what is the end game? What has this money gone to? And I hope the president steps up and does a better job of explaining what is the mission and how these investments tie toward American interests and a safer globe.",

Less about what is Congress going to do here, because we don't know the type of gun, we don't know how it was purchased, we don't know so much right now.But from the broader context of things, may not be unlike South Dakota, low levels of violent crime, and higher levels than the national average of gun ownership. I know you're a hunter as well. Is this the reality in this country, unlike every other country that's developed, like the U.S.? With the Second Amendment and with gun ownership, this is just the norm? People have to accept this?",

Maine has a yellow flag law, which I think is a restructured version of that, that has a couple more steps to it.Is that an answer here? That ties to mental health, but that's always run into issues with gun rights advocates who are concerned about people's ability to have their weapons taken away.",

So, we're going to continue to see data come out. But again, two years ago when that Gun Control Bill passed, it did more than just red flag laws, it did other things.You're right, I voted against it, but President Biden called this a sweeping piece of legislation that would save thousands of lives. I'm a data guy, so of course I want to analyze the data. But my thought right now is that this gun violence in the last two years has continued unabated. That, in fact, what the president said is not true, that gun control legislation didn't actually move the needle in the right direction. As a result, before we just go piling on more gun control legislation, on gun control legislation that doesn't work, I think we need to talk about root causes.",
