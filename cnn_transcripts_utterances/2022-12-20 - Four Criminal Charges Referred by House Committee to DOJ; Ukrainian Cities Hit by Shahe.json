Thank you for joining us. How much added political pressure is there now on the Department of Justice to charge the former president and his allies? LESLIE VINJAMURI, HEAD, U.S. AND THE AMERICAS PROGRAMME, CHATHAM HOUSE:  Well, I think that you know, the visibility of these hearings, especially of yesterday, that decision to refer is very significant. It certainly adds pressure, but I don't think this is the number one, you know, most important fact. I think the fact that the, that there have been these recommendations that they are recommendations to prosecute matters for the symbolic importance of the hearings. It matters for the narrative that's been told. It gives real weight to the court of public opinion who are, you know, watching these, or many people will be watching them backwards over time, they will be incredibly important for the historical record. Whether this actually turns into, you know, the needle, the thing that changes the needle that moves the dial on the question of criminal, prosecutions I think is possibly unlikely. It certainly adds to what the Justice Department will already be thinking about. But again, you know, my very strong view on this is that the significance of Donald Trump as a political force in the United States will be decided very much by public opinion. We've seen what happened in the midterm elections. We've seen his popularity amongst Republican voters diminishing. And this, these hearings contribute to that very significantly. I don't think it will be the law that will fundamentally be what changes people's opinions. And it's really that ability that he's had over so many years to sway crowds, to get people to buy into the big lie that has been the source of his phenomenal power, which is now again, it seems to be very significantly diminished.",

There have certainly been Americans who haven't wanted these hearings to be so visible, because it's looking backwards.But I also think that a lot of people have learned things that they didn't know, that a lot of people have gained interest in this. It isn't going to be the front story that the sort of justice is slow. Legal proceedings are very slow. Americans are very forward looking. But the broader question of Donald Trump's role in U.S. politics is a significant one. It will be a significant question. And these hearings will affect public opinion and they will affect Republicans views of whether this is a candidate, a candidate who continues to lose and now has, you know, had this evidence, these hearings cast against him in such a focused manner, in such a powerful manner, in such a visible manner. You know, when you look ahead, if you're a Republican in the United States, this is, you know, this is increasingly not the candidate that you think will take America forward in the way you wish it to be taken forward, which is through winning. But there will always be people that stay very much with the president. I think, you know, again, a big point is though that for generations, Americans, people around the world will look back to this period of history, and it's not to undercut the impact of the hearings on the present, but the historical record is really tremendous. It's not a record that a legal process can create. But the videos, the narrative, the interviews and the official record that will be published are really phenomenally important for U.S. history.",

That did not take place as very quickly in the hearing on Monday, prosecutors and Bankman-Fried's local attorney faced off, there was finger pointing and accusations. The local attorney said that he had not been consulted, not been part of this agreement that had been reached.Apparently, according to prosecutors with Bankman-Fried's U.S. attorneys, there were accusations throughout the hearing and eventually the judge allowed at Sam Bankman-Fried's own request a call to take place between his local attorney and U.S. attorneys to try to work out whatever differences have occurred. Shortly thereafter within minutes we saw Bankman-Fried be taken away under heavy guard back to the prison where he is currently being held. Some of his U.S. representatives said that he had been eager to leave to The Bahamas and face his charges against some charges that could leave if he is convicted over a hundred years in jail.

And the preparation here is that there could be hundreds if not thousands that attempt to cross over. And you can even see what's relatively new in recent weeks. This chain link fence along the U.S. side of the border seems to be an effort to then funnel some of the migrants to a certain point to then be processed. Interesting to know what we saw here arriving over the weekend, and I arrived on that side, the U.S. side, El Paso, before driving here to Ciudad Juarez. Let me show you what was inside the airport in the early morning hours of Sunday, late Saturday, just past midnight into Sunday, dozens of migrants camped out on the floor. And I talked to one of the security guards there. They seem unfazed. They say this is something they have seen in recent weeks. And a lot of those folks had started places like Venezuela making their way up. And many of them position themselves here on this side where I'm standing for several weeks, if not months in preparation to cross over. And it's interesting to see what was here when we were here just about a month ago, and we can show you from above, hundreds of camps. They were set up tents. This is where a massive encampment where aid workers estimated some 3,000 people at one point were basically living in preparation to cross over. Now, fast forward to what we saw over the weekend, along this same spot, that same vantage point from above, you can see it was cleared out. And we can show you in late November the clash with police as Mexican officials decided to clear out that camp, evicting many of the migrants who were here and tearing down the tents and having them move along. We talked to the mayor here in Ciudad Juarez. We want to get a sense of what kind of coordination he has with his counterparts in the U.S. I asked him if he's regularly talking with them.",
