Right now, that`s done by X-ray with officers staring at images across their screen, if they become suspicious, they open the package up to determine whether a threat is inside. (Voice-over): But A.I. could revolutionize the way U.S. Customs and Border Protection does battle against smugglers. (On camera): We`re here near Los Angeles International Airport in a facility that processes over 240 million packages every single year. Officers seizing numerous items including counterfeit merchandise, illegal food as well as precursors to the deadly drug, fentanyl. Now, in order to help stop America`s fentanyl epidemic, officers are now relying on Artificial Intelligence like this system. A package is sent through this main system called IDSS, this is similar to what you might find in a hospital or at an airport. A 3D image is taken, and then sent to what`s called the student. This is the halo system, artificial intelligence at work. Unlike old technologies such as x-rays, this system is constantly learning and teaching itself. CAMPBELL (voice-over): The mission of this AI system, part of a CBP pilot program, is to identify patterns, how smugglers are concealing fentanyl in order to evade detection. (On camera): At the end of the whole process, this system will get a grade. After scanning 10,000 images, an officer will look to determine how well the system actually did. Determine whether this is the type of machine that CBP might want to roll out to its multiple facilities across the nation. (Voice-over): This pilot program is currently being used for cargo arriving by air to LAX. CBP hopes to expand the use of AI to other critical points of entry into the United States. One looming question with well-funded drug cartels known to adopt advanced technology of their own, how long will AI provide U.S. authorities a cutting-edge advantage to stay ahead of the threat?
