My favorite? From the BBC, \"Era-defining.\" He truly did usher in an era of television that no one in the world had ever seen before and, I argue, set the stage for today's political landscape. Springer was 79. His family says that he died peacefully, today, at his home, in suburban Chicago, after a brief illness. Reports are that he had cancer. The son of Holocaust refugees, he became a global sensation, as a tabloid TV host. But before that, he was the Mayor of Cincinnati. He was an actor. He was a lawyer. He was a news anchor.

Let's explore the impact that Jerry Springer, and other public individuals, like him have had, on American culture and discourse. Mohamed Younis is Editor-in-Chief, at Gallup, which as we mentioned, has compiled data, on who Americans are listening to, and why. Mohamed, why are we turning away from institutions, and toward individuals? MOHAMED YOUNIS, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, GALLUP: Fascinatingly, Michael, the work we did, with Knight Foundation, actually gets right to that point you made at the end. The number one reason why nine in 10 Americans are now following public individuals? And these are celebrities, journalists, TV show hosts, like you here, tonight, Michael. The number one reason is they trust them, they like them. But more importantly, they're getting a perspective that they feel they can't get, from traditional news sources. And in interesting and twisted way, that really ties into exactly what you were talking about, with Jerry Springer. Tucker Carlson and Rachel Maddow, when we ask Americans, in this study, \"Who are those, who is that one person you follow?\" Tucker Carlson is at the top, with 113 mentions. Rachel Maddow is at the -- right under him with 107. But collectively, they only represent 6 percent of people, in the study. Over 900 people were mentioned. I'll mention that the top 20 names mentioned only contained two female voices. But Americans are now following a more dispersed list of public individuals than they ever have before.",

But they're also listening to a lot of other people that traditionally aren't associated with that news, traditional broadcast or newspapers. This is also happening, at a time, when our historic trends that go back to Nixon, on this item, are at a historic low, in people's trusted news. When Nixon last left office, seven in 10 Americans said they had trust, in the honesty of news in America. Today that seven in 10 has dropped to three in 10.",

Did classroom closures go on for too long? Alisyn Camerota talks with Randi Weingarten, next. But first, 68 years ago, this August, a young Black teenager was taken from a home, in the middle of the night, never seen again, by his family, until he lay unrecognizable, in his casket. His name was Emmett Till. A White woman accused him of propositioning her, inside a grocery store. Witnesses say, he whistled later. Her husband and brother-in- law kidnapped, killed, and tortured, and shot him. They put barbed wire around his body, and dumped him into a river. His mother decided the world needed to see the horror that was done to her son, so she opened his casket, at the funeral. What the world saw inside shocked it, accelerating the Civil Rights movement. That woman, who accused Till, died, this week, at 88-years-old. Despite decades of calls, for accountability, Carolyn Bryant was never charged, for her role. An all-White jury acquitted the two men of murder, for which they would later confess. In recent years, the woman recanted parts of her testimony, to Author, Timothy Tyson. When asked in 2008, Bryant told Tyson, quote, \"I have thought and thought about everything about Emmett Till, the killing and the trial... Telling who did what to who.\" When Tyson asked her, about what happened, she told him that Till did not grab her waist, which had been one of the critical claims. When Tyson pushed her on what did happen, she said this, quote, \"Honestly, I just don't remember. It was 50 years ago. You tell these stories for so long that they seem true.\" One of Till's cousins, saying, today, \"She was never tried in the court of man. But I think she was judged by God, and his wrath is more punitive than any judgment or penalty she could have gotten in a courtroom.\" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
