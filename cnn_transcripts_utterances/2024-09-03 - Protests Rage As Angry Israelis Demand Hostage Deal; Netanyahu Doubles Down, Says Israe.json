He wouldn't give a time frame for when they might actually roll out that new proposal, we heard yesterday from President Biden saying that they are very close to that.And he also said one day at a time, one step at a time, when asked to describe this new proposal that would be put on the table. We have heard from some administration officials describing what would be put forward as a final proposal. That is not how the State Department spokesperson surmised what would actually be put down, effectively saying that the United States isn't at the end of the road here in terms of its efforts, and they really can't be. There are still Americans who are part of that group of hostages that are still being held by Hamas. And we have heard from U.S. officials, from the White House in recent days, that after the murder of those six hostages over the weekend, that the United States is going to hold Hamas accountable. They are going to seek justice for the death of those hostages and ask the State Department spokesperson if they're putting any new resources into that goal. He said they are not. They're not doing anything new to try and pursue that goal. It has been a goal of theirs for quite some time, he said, since October 7th, to try and bring justice to Hamas after the horrific attack that started this entire war. So they're still pursuing that, but that is not something that they're putting new resources into at this time. And he continued to say that the deaths that occurred over the weekend underscore, of course, the urgency to try and get a deal done here, but there still remain those sticking points, as Jeremy was pointing out, and it remains unclear how they're going to actually mount those.

The main one being Hamas' demand that Israel end the war and Israel's refusal to end the war. The Philadelphi Corridor is a made-up problem. It's not really an issue. It's put there by Netanyahu to prevent an agreement.It was reported tonight in Israeli news that not a single tunnel was found by the Israeli army along that 14-kilometer corridor that actually entered Egypt, that in fact the Egyptians have done the job of sealing that corridor over the years. And in any event, if there is a need to guarantee its sealing, it has to be done on the Egyptian side of the border where they are sovereign. I would assume that they would ask for the help of the United States to assure Israel that it is in fact sealed. American verification, American oversight of that border would resolve the issue of Israel needing to stay on the Gaza side of the border. It can be easily removed as a problem in these negotiations.",

I do want to get one final question in. It sounds like you believe the U.S. could do more to perhaps move Netanyahu to accept a deal in which the war would end. I'm wondering what you think they can do to facilitate that, and conversely, if there's anything they can do, as some Israeli officials have tried to argue, to move Hamas as well, to try to pressure Sinwar into accepting some kind of deal.",

      "sentences": "So my understanding is that the most important thing to Sinwar and the Hamas leadership is to end the war. With regard to Israel, Israel is so dependent on the United States. The relationship between the United States and Israel is so deep and so wide. There are so many tools that the Americans have in their diplomatic toolbox with Israel.But the most important thing is to understand it is that the people of Israel are the sovereign, and not Mr. Netanyahu. And if there's a real deal on the table that guarantees the Israeli people that 101 Israeli hostages will be returned, and the war will end, Hamas can be dealt with later, but right now we need to do those two things, end the war and bring the hostages home. I would add, because this is a concern of the whole world and the American people as well, that between 40,000 and 50,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, and Gaza is destroyed, and there are humanitarian reasons why this war should end as well. So I think the United States has an interest in getting this done. It needs to use the pressure that it has over Israel to get it done. It needs to appeal to the Israeli people to stand up and tell Netanyahu that your political career is not worth saving. What is worth saving are the 101 Israeli hostages. We don't know how many of them are still alive.",

Donald Trump's team, they had said this going to be - this being the campaign, it was going to be Trump on steroids, but we really haven't actually seen that yet. We saw one week of several events, and this week he has a streaming of the Republican Jewish Coalition. He is going to speak at the New York Economic Club.He has a potential court appearance, but not that ramped-up visits to swing states that we had heard talk about. Now, I'm told that part of this is because he is holding these policy sessions routinely during the day. He's currently in his Bedminster resort. He's going to be ducked out in Mar-a-Lago over the weekend with various lawmakers, with his senior advisers, getting ready for the debate with Kamala Harris. And even if his team will tell you that he is ready, that he is born ready to debate Kamala Harris, they are still taking this very seriously. They know that he could have issues when he takes the stage against Kamala Harris, and they are hoping to avoid any of those problems. Remember, they were very happy with the way the debate went against President Joe Biden, but leading up to it, they were very nervous. They weren't sure how he was going to react. They weren't sure what it was going to look like. A lot of them brought up that 2020 debate with President Joe Biden in which he was incredibly aggressive. He had to backtrack in the debate after that. So they are still going through the policy. We know they brought in Tulsi Gabbard to play Kamala Harris at some point. Not really play her, but as an expert in Kamala Harris. She has actually been on the debate stage with her. They don't do the traditional kind of debate prep that we've seen the Democrats do with moderators, someone filling in as moderator, somebody filling in as the candidate. Instead, they have conversations. I'll tell you, last time, leading up to the debate with President Joe Biden, one senior advisor told me, we don't use the word preparation when we talk to Donald Trump about getting ready for a debate.",

In fact, the U.S. was generating billions from such tariffs, again, paid by Americans, before Trump even took office. And that is hardly the only claim that Trump has been repeating for years.

You know, you hear old-fashioned football coaches be like, keep running the ball, keep running the ball.
