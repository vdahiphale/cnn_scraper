We'll break down the political impact for the president just ahead of his state of union address and the expected launch of his re-election campaign. And a life-threatening arctic blast is bearing down right now on the northeast. Stand by for an up-to-the-minute forecast on the bitter cold and dangerous winds, putting tens of millions of Americans at risk. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. We begin with the rising tensions right now between the United States and China as that massive spy balloon is still out there flying over the center of the country. CNN's Alex Marquardt has the latest on this international incident and how U.S. diplomats and military officials are weighing their next move. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Tonight, U.S. officials tell CNN the U.S. has not ruled out shooting down the Chinese spy balloon once there's no risk to civilians below, but Secretary of State Antony Blinken telling reporters that China's flagrant violation of U.S. sovereignty forced him to postpone his trip to Beijing. ANTONY BLINKEN, SECRETARY OF STATE: I made clear that the presence of this surveillance balloon in U.S. air space is a clear violation of U.S. sovereignty and international law, that it's an irresponsible act and that the PRC's decision to take this action on the eve of my planned visit is detrimental to the substantive discussions that we were prepared to have.",

BRIG. GEN. PAT RYDER, PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY: We assessed that it does not pose a risk to people on the ground as it currently is traversing the Continental United States.

      "sentences": "Wolf, one reason the surveillance balloon attracting so much attention is simply its size. So big, it was visible from the ground, as you could see from this photograph. We know it's the size of about three city buses, big enough that it caused flights to be diverted in the area for safety and also prompted at least a discussion of the possibility of the U.S. shooting it down. In the end, the decision made by the president not to shoot it down.But we also learned something new today, and that is that this surveillance balloon had some maneuverability, that China had some ability to target its path over the northern part of the Continental U.S. That's key because this was in the flight path of Malmstrom Air Force Base, where the U.S. maintains some of its intercontinental ballistic missiles. That could very much be a surveillance target of a surveillance asset like this. Now, for context, we should note that China has numerous surveillance assets flying over the U.S. with regularity, particularly in space. In lower orbit, those satellites would go over U.S. territory every 90 minutes or so. They have other satellites at other orbits as well with perhaps equal or even greater surveillance capability as this surveillance balloon, and China becoming only more and more active in space. You look at the number of launches per year. It used to be in single digits, now close to 100, really only competing with the U.S. at this point. So, that raises the question, why then a balloon? Is it possible it has surveillance capabilities the U.S. is not yet aware of, or, Wolf, could it be simply sending a message? This is the same week that the U.S. announced a new agreement with the Philippines for basing their, in part, in response to the China threat, was this a deliberate message from China to the U.S.?

      "sentences": "Right. Well, China Friday night here in Asia put out the -- an unusual statement, the Chinese Foreign Ministry, in which it did say, look, this aircraft does, in fact, belong to China. It claims that it is a meteorological research balloon. And it then went on to say, quote, the airship deviated from its planned course. The Chinese side regrets the unintended entry of the airship into U.S. air space and went on to say in this statement that it would -- the Chinese government would continue communicating with the U.S. to help resolve this issue.I have to stress how unusual it is for the Chinese government to essentially issue a form of an apology. For example, the Chinese government is still standing behind the years of its zero COVID policy where it shut down the economy, large parts of the economy, and locked citizens in their homes and neighborhoods for months at a time. It's still saying that was the right thing to do, even though it put a lot of damage on the economy and onto ordinary Chinese people. So, the fact that it's coming forth and kind of saying this, again, I have to stress how unusual this is. Decision-making in Beijing is very opaque. So, we're left kind of speculating. Was this, in fact, a mistake, an embarrassing one at that, or is this a deliberate act of provocation? And we have to stress that Antony Blinken's visit to Beijing, which has now been postponed at the very least, was supposed to be building on President Biden's meeting with Xi Jinping in Bali in November, where he was trying to establish guardrails to the relationship between the two -- world's two largest economies, establish lines of communication that had been all but severed. Those lines have been used between the two governments amid the tension of this balloon continuing to fly in U.S. air space, which Washington is saying is a violation of U.S. sovereignty. Wolf?",

The administration was really targeting until this month, where you see a very clear pop based on that 517,000 number. In terms of the unemployment rate, you've seen a pretty steady decline that started very sharp and has remained extraordinarily low, the lowest since 1969 at the 3.4 percent rate.What you know right now when you talk to Biden administration officials is they are confident in where the economy stands. They think that will be critical for the political world going forward.

Early this morning, it started out just below freezing at about 6:00 A.M. and it's been falling steadily and it is going to continue to fall all night, very, very dangerous temperatures here affecting, of course, not just Boston but the entire corner -- northeastern corner of the United States, with nearly 25 million people facing a wind chill warning or advisory. And so officials at the city and state level, in all of these states being affected are urging people to stay inside and to bundle up if they do go outside. I'm wearing three hats, eight layers on top, four layers on bottom. Here in Boston, public schools were closed today in order to protect the children so they wouldn't have to commute. And their warming shelters have been opened, warming centers, and train stations being kept open all night so the people who have no place to go can at least find a place of warmth inside. Now, these temperatures are expected to get worse late tonight into the early morning hours of Saturday. And we could see wind chills that bring the feels-like temperature down to negative 36 degrees. So, very, very dangerous weather out here. So, take precautions. Stay inside if you can.

And he then matched those casings to casings from weapons that he says were often used at the Murdaugh home that would have come from the Murdaugh home.Now he does say it's inconclusive. They didn't know if they collected the murder weapons because they didn't seize as many guns from the Murdaugh home. That part is inclusive. But he did say that these casings would have come from weapons that had been used on the property before because there were so many of them and they were so widely spread out. Now, on the issue of the finances, they are trying to -- the prosecution is trying to show that Alex Murdaugh killed his wife and son because he was trying to distract from these alleged financial schemes that he was involved in. He was already confronted by the CFO of his former law firm telling him that funds were missing nearly $800,000 in funds. And there was also the issue of this woman Gloria Satterfield. She was a longtime housekeeper for the Murdaugh family. She had allegedly fallen down the stairs at their home. And Alex Murdaugh, wolf, had arranged for himself to be sued. But instead of giving that money after it was settled to family, he kept it for himself. And her son was on the stand today. Listen.
