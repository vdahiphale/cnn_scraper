I mean, I think he -- you know, he bends over backwards to avoid, not that it's really helped him avoid in terms of Republican accusations, but his goal is to avoid the sense of the Justice Department is politicized in any way. So he's probably gone further than he needed to certainly in the Biden classified documents example. But, look, I think all of this, you know, isn't quite symmetrical yet, at this point. I mean, Donald Trump, the accusations that the Special Counsel Jack Smith is investigating Donald Trump are a far more gravity and magnitude than anything they're looking into by all that we know, with Hunter Biden. You know, Hunter Biden's behavior was unseemly and is by -- the testimony we have, his father probably went too far in allowing him to project that kind of air of influence and insider done to his clients. But there is no indication yet, there's no testimony yet. In fact, there's testimony to the opposite, that Joe Biden in any way, tried to do favors for the clients themselves. Republicans have failed to produce any evidence of that claim. And even if there was, you know, I'm not sure that rises to the level of trying to overturn the peaceful transfer of power for the first time in American history. So we'll see, you know, how this how this plays out in the end. As I said before, there are warning signs for Republicans in terms of how voters outside of the GOP coalition are viewing the Trump indictments, if he is the nominee, and he is on trial while he's the nominee.

They say around the village of Robotyne, which is apparently more significant, according to analysts than the amount of territory would suggest because we know that area, the western part of the southern front is one of the most heavily fortified areas where Russia has built up these layers of Defenses, Dragon's Teeth, bunkers, minefields, things like that. So if Ukraine is able to make any progress at all, that may well be the fruits of weeks, days and weeks of work to get to that point. We don't know of course, is how far back those Russian defenses really go and how much more work will need to go into pushing through that direction as they are going to meet that goal of reaching the Azov Sea.

But now they're going to face a continued criticism from Republicans as these legal proceedings unfold. Republicans on Capitol Hill have flirted with a potential impeachment inquiry into Biden when asked about that, the White House has said that that is baseless and a stunt. But it is all to say that the White House continues to face fierce criticism from Republicans over the Hunter Biden probe even in on the heels of this announcement by the Attorney General. The president for his port has not weighed in on this publicly, but previously has said that he and the First Lady Jill Biden love and support their son. Priscilla Alvarez, CNN at the White House.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [05:41:16] HARRAK: Regional leaders appeared to be holding off at least for now on their threat to send troops in Niger to restore the ousted president to power. Reuters reports the Economic Community of West African States is moving towards sending a group to negotiate instead. But the coup leaders have shown no desire to talk so far. While the move comes amid antique French protests in Niger's capital. France is supporting the ousted President Mohamed Bazoum. But some protesters have called for Russia to help drive French troops out of the country. CNN's Jim Bittermann is standing by live outside the French capital. Good morning again, Jim. Still, no letup an anti-French sentiments in Niger. Is Paris at all considering pulling out its troops?",

Their position is that the deal which allowed the French troops to stay in Niger was negotiated with the civilian authorities, a democratic elected president, who of course, is now in captivity, that they are going to recognize that agreement as the one that's operable, and they're going to keep their troops there.Now, having said that, if the military junta should establish itself as a legitimate government, I think the French government is going to be in a very difficult position, they may have to withdraw the troops. That demonstration that you saw with the other day on Friday was in fact, their -- right in front of the military base for about 1500 French troops. And I should say as well, there's 1500 troops as well among Americans, American soldiers who are in the northern part of the country. And there the American position is exactly the same reestablish the democratic elected President Mohamed Bazoum, who is being held, we are being told and this has not been confirmed and held in the basement of the presidential palace. He's been denied water, food and essential medical treatment. There was one report yesterday that he may have been seen by a doctor, but there's been no confirmation of that. He's 63 years old, and he could well become a bargaining chip. And that's because the regime, the junta would know that they -- if they were to release him or to do something that would indicate their willingness to concede some kind of an agreement with the -- you're establishing, re-establishing the precedent, the outside forces might be less severe. Right now, the sanctions in place they started start to cut off of aid to Nigeria, and as a consequence, they're starting to feel the pinch. So it's a standoff for the moment and I think everybody was looking towards that ECOWAS negotiation to succeed, end it diplomatically, but it hasn't come down to fruition as yet.",
