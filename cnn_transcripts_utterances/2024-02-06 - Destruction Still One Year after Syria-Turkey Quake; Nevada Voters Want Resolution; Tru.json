You have people who are renting who are waiting for supply to catch up with demand so that they can actually afford them.And one other unfortunate side effect of this earthquake is that this region in particular was home to almost half of Turkey's 3.5 million or so Syrian refugees. Many of them have been displaced to other parts of the country and they cannot register their kids in school because of a law that requires them to remain in the areas of where they were originally registered. And so the government doesn't keep official data on this, but we talked one non-profit in Gaziantip (ph) that's helping hundreds of kids - well, they're helping 120, but they have hundreds on their waiting list trying to teach them Turkish. They figure that the problem across the country has got to be in the tens of thousands.

One, he will almost certainly order his DOJ to dismiss the two federal cases against him. There's really not much he can do to stop that.

      "sentences": "Well, Phil, this could be a grilling for the head of the FAA. Remember, the agency is now supervising ramped-up overnight of Boeing since last month's door plug blowout on that Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9. And top lawmakers in the House want to know if that is enough.This is the FAA administrator, Mike Whitaker's, first time testifying to Congress since that incident. Also, his first time testifying on Capitol Hill since taking the job about 100 days ago. In his prepared testimony, Whitaker will say this, quote, \"going forward, we will have more boots on the ground closely scrutinizing and monitoring production and manufacturing activities at Boeing.\" The FAA has already launched an audit of Boeing's production line in Renton, Washington. That's where late Sunday Boeing disclosed it found a new problem, poorly drilled holes found in part of the windows on about 50 737 Maxs still in the factory. Boeing contractor Spirit AeroSystems, which builds the Max fuselage, is owning the problem, but that means Boeing is slowing the production of some planes and delaying deliveries. Just yesterday the FAA told reporters that it's reimagining a new oversight plan of Boeing. And the FAA says it has about a dozen inspectors at Boeing right now doing nose-to-tail and wing tip-to-wing tip inspections of planes being built. Here's one more quote from the FAA chief in his prepared testimony. He says, \"let me stress, we will follow the data and take appropriate and necessary action. The safety of the flying public will continue to inform our decision making. Here's the rub, though. The FAA has cleared the Max 9 to fly again. And all but a handful of those planes in the U.S. have been inspected by airlines and are once again carrying passengers. But that is happening as the NTSB is still doing its investigation of the Alaska door plug incident. Preliminary report could come out today, but a final report could take a year or more.",
