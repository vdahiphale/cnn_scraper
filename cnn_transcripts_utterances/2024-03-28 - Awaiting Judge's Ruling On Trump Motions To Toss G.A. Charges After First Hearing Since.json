We're breaking down the first hearing since district Attorney Fani Willis was allowed to stay on the case and why she was a no show today.Also tonight, federal investigators are back on board the cargo ship that slammed into a Baltimore bridge seeking answers as we're seeing the ship heading toward the deadly collision from a new angle. And the Biden campaign is touting a historic $25 million haul from a fundraiser tonight featuring former presidents Obama and Clinton. President Biden getting ready to attend the event as Donald Trump is also in New York trying to grab some of the spotlight and send a get tough message on crime.

But it's also the case that speech can be part of a crime. And you can't say just because words were coming out of your mouth that you're protected from committing that crime. I mean, think about a bank robber who walks into a bank and says, stick them up, I'm here to rob the bank. You can still charge him with bank robbery. And it's not like he can say, well, you can't use that statement against me because I was speaking words out of my mouth. It's sort of the same thing here.

And sources tell CNN's MJ Lee that those grassroots donors comprise about a third of the $25 million haul that's expected from tonight's event.Now, it is a significant figure that $25 million and it would go a long way to widen the cash advantage that Biden already has over his Republican rival, of course, the former President Donald Trump. The March data is not available yet, but in both January and February, Biden raised about double that Trump raised. And at the end of February, Biden had roughly double the cash on hand as President Trump. And the Biden campaign says that the money that it's raising now is going to go even further than Trump's, who's been using his campaign cash to defray his legal expenses. Jeffrey Katzenberg, who's the co-chair of Biden's campaign, says this in a statement, \"Unlike our opponent, every dollar we're raising is going to reach the voters who will decide this election, communicating the president's historic record, his vision for the future, and laying plain the stakes of this election.\" The three presidents are expected to spend much of that Stephen Colbert moderated conversation on stage at Radio City Music hall talking about that record of President Biden's three years in office.

Nia-Malika, how key is President Obama's embrace to help energize so called disaffected Democratic voters?NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL REPORTER: Yes, listen, I mean, we have seen President Obama on the campaign trail before. You think back to 2022 when he played a role in that Georgia Senate race was very good. It really I think stitching together a good coalition to back Raphael Warnock in that race in Georgia. And those are the kind of voters, African American voters, young voters, Latino voters, as well as suburban voters. Those are the kind of voters that Obama is so good at energizing and sort of branding the Democratic Party as a winning party, as the party of the future, as a sort of normal party. I think John rightly points out that part of tonight is just showcasing the Democratic brand. And that's something that Obama can do, I think, for Biden. And he obviously has done that before in 2020. I'm sure his wife, Michelle Obama, at some point will get out on the campaign trail. He has expressed some concern about this election, given what we've seen from the polls, that it's obviously very, very close. So he can really have a sort of all hands on deck really rowing in the same direction all of these Democratic presidents, including President Clinton and getting folks energized and also like engage. And I think Biden is obviously aware that Democrats aren't quite paying attention yet. And so part of this fundraiser is really just sort of piercing the bubble and really trying to break through to average voters that there's an election and the stakes are very high.",

It is his record and his performance that will be judged by the voters in November. I think it does highlight the point that one of the things I have learned in my travels over the last six months or so is that a lot of voters out there, voters who voted for Biden in 2020 and are disillusioned, maybe its inflation, maybe its their own circumstances, maybe they just think Washington is not working. What has it done for me lately? They want to see him. They want him to be more visible. So that's a piece of humor there.But I do think it highlights the idea that, you know, as I said before, there are cracks in the Democratic coalition. And Nia makes a key point. You have Bill Clinton, right, you know, the last president to have a balanced budget. He was the different kind of Democrat, more of a centrist. Obama, more left of center, Obamacare. They want to talk about the issues, reproductive rights. They want to talk about civil rights. They want to talk about gay rights. They want to talk about the issues that they hope will motivate those disillusioned voters out there to remind them maybe there's -- maybe you're mad about something. Maybe you're mad about Israel-Gaza, a lot of young voters very angry at the President right now about that. Maybe you're mad about that. But look at the broader issues portfolio that we put forward, these three Democratic presidents. Then look at the other guy. There's your choice.",

And you see some of this working in some ways, I think if you sort of look at the State of the Union as a time when there was sort of a shift in voter's minds, the voters who watched that, particularly Democratic voters, felt like this was an energized president and then they put a bunch of money into putting campaign ads in swing states.This is going to go to get out the vote efforts as well and really targeting these voters. They've been up talking to African American voters on a black radio. So listen, they have a massive, massive project over these next seven months in stitching together this coalition that is frayed a little bit around the edges with African American voters, Latino voters, and young voters. So, listen, they are going to need billions of dollars to get this done. So this 25 million is in some ways it's a large hole. They're going to keep having to have large halls. They're going to keep having to not only have big donors, but also those small dollar donors, too. And listen, Donald Trump, you know, John King was right, that money doesn't win elections, but it certainly does help. And you have Donald Trump, who so far has been lagging in terms of fundraising and obviously diverting some of that cash to all of his legal issues as well. So, listen, I think you're going to see this over and over again, them trying to gin up support, gin up money because they are going to need it over this very, very important and costly election.",

But property crimes are up, motor vehicle thefts are up. And we've had many crimes, including an officer killed in the line of duty, that are shocking.And they get a lot of attention on television. And so this is one place where there's a disconnect between the crime statistics and the crime perceptions among voters. And it could be a key issue in the suburbs, a key issue with swing voters, a key issue in the place Trump needs to win. So it's an issue he wants to highlight. Again, the statistics tell you crime is in better shape now than it was a few years back. However, some of these crimes are so shocking, Wolf, that they stir people, they stir anxiety. And Trump wants to turn that into votes.",
