And the high price being paid for some individuals for just doing their civic duty. Today, police in Atlanta are trying to figure out how to best protect the grand jurors who earlier this week trying to indict former President Donald Trump and 18 other codefendants. Unlike federal cases, indictments in Fulton County, Georgia, which are made public, include the names of all of the jurors who served on the case. Now, those jurors' names, plus photographed social media information, and even some home addresses, not all of which are even necessarily the right ones, is now all circulating on social media. Experts are saying that some anonymous users are calling for violence against members of the jury. CNN's Paula Reid starts off our coverage today with a closer look at the security risks facing not just the jury, but also a federal judge in a separate Trump case. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Tonight, Georgia residents who served on the grand jury than indicted former President Trump for trying to overturn the 2020 election are now facing threats and getting doxxed online.",

It's called \"GIULIANI, WHAT HAPPENED TO AMERICA'S MAYOR?\" It's a good question. That's Saturday night at 8:00 Eastern, only here on CNN. Joining us now to discuss, Michael Moore, the former U.S. attorney for the middle district of Georgia. Michael, I want to get your reaction to the alleged personal information of some of these jurors being posted online. I understand that when somebody is indicted in Georgia, the names of the grand jurors are included on that indictment. Knowing the sensitivity of the case, though, I wonder if more should've been done ahead of time to prevent something like this. MICHAEL MOORE, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY:  Well, it's a pleasure to be with you. I do think there could've been some steps taken to ask the court to seal the indictment or do some things like that. We do have sort of a balancing of the public right to know, and certainly the accused right to know, who sat on the grand jury? When you think about, it is important for an accused to know that because they can determine whether or not a grand jury might have been related as one of the victims in the case or something. There is a legitimate reason that lawyers and defendants need to know that and, they have a right to look at it. But certainly in this case, I think there were things that could've been done. Look, judges and prosecutors, we expect this kind of thing to happen, this nonsense to happen. But every day layman who serves on pennies a day really on a grand jury should not be subject to this. So, probably the best thing that could happen right now is for there to be some swift action taken to both protect those people if in fact those addresses are correct, and personal information is deemed to be correct, and then also go after folks who might have been sending messages, attempting to do harm. It is public information that is accessible at the courthouse. So, the fact that the names are out there I don't think there will be much done. Other than that, it's protection. Specific threats, voicemails, emails, those types of things, certainly somebody sitting out in front of somebody's house, the car, they need to be addressed quickly by law enforcement to send a message that it can't be tolerated.",

Every single one of these people out there online, doing whatever, threatening not just words but threatening individual or grand jurors or grand jury as a whole. It's committing a federal crime or at least, there is evidence to suggest that they want to undermine the judicial system. That's where it's going to take prosecutors and investigators to investigate them, to let them know that there is no goofing around anymore. That this is -- we know what the threat environment could be for these grand jurors. I have to say one thing about Georgia. This is not a statute that it requires, it's just case law and Supreme Court case law. So, there might -- you know, this is something that Georgia officials are going to have to deal with in terms of not just the protection of these grand jurors, it which may be too late, but of course, the jurors coming up. I'm all for transparency. I'm all four public information. But as Michael was saying, you know, these are ordinary citizens doing their civic duty. They didn't sign up for this.

There's not a day that goes by that he and the first lady aren't thinking about them, mourning with them, and understanding the loss and the sacrifice and the anguish that they are still feeling. And you could hear it in that sound bite. It's clearly there, and we understand that, and we're going to stay with them and support them for the rest of their lives, as we should, as they deserve to. But pulling out of Afghanistan was the right decision for a national security. We are not now bogged down in a war in Afghanistan, we have been able to free up resources and manpower to be prepared for other national security concerns, such as the ones we're going -- we had in the Indo-Pacific, and that we anticipate being able to talk about at Camp David. That war is over. It should have been ended. And, the mission for which the troops were sent there had been accomplished.",

The commanders were on the ground, at the moment of the explosion, there were quite a few commanders there, in charge, and leading. And of course, everybody responded bravely after the attack.
