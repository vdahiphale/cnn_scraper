Also, Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries had private meetings expressing concerns of the democratic caucuses about Joe Biden remaining there at the top. We have not heard an explicit endorsement from Schumer or Jeffries, but that is expected to come soon. Now, this all comes as both sides are now scrambling to figure out what it would mean for the fall campaign with Harris at the top of the ticket.

And they are looking for two things. Do they understand my concerns, my fears, my hopes? And do they have solutions to make my life better? It's both of them. And I'll give you the example. Back in 2008, sorry, 2012, Mitt Romney was able to prove that he had the solutions to people's problems, but he was unable to show the empathy that he understood them. Barack Obama, the public didn't think he had the solutions, they thought Romney was better at that, but they thought that he empathized better.

I think that focusing on the process is missing the real concerns of voters.Inflation absolutely still matters and it's something that both Biden- Harris kind of dismissed. I think abortion rights matter for young women. And in fact, the two groups that are going to be energized from these young women who thought that Joe Biden was too old and they were not attracted to Donald Trump, they were not participating. They're not going to come out in droves because of Harris and the black vote, which really matters in states like North Carolina and Georgia. They're going to participate because of Harris. But in the end, the three states that matter, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, she's got to choose someone and she's got Gretchen Whitmer who said she wouldn't take it. That would be two women on the ticket. If two women can host CNN, why can't two women be president and vice president? I think that Shapiro is probably the candidate that she goes with because that's the state she wants to win.

What Hakeem Jeffries indicated there is that he wants to have a meeting first with the Vice President and with Chuck Schumer, the Senate Majority Leader, who also has not yet endorsed Kamala Harris. He wants to have a meeting with her first and expect that to happen in the next couple of days. But the reason for this here is for Jefferies to really send a signal that the party is indeed coalescing behind Kamala Harris, that they see that this is a new chapter in the fall campaign. This is a party that has been so badly divided over the last several weeks. Jeffries has heard so many concerns from Democrats if Joe Biden were to stay on the top of the ticket. He had that private meetings Jeffries did with the President just before they left town last week. I tried to ask him specifically about what specific concerns he relayed or any light he could shed about that conversation with the President of the United States. He declined to say there's a private discussion that will remain private, instead trying to tout Joe Biden's record. So it's a very much effort here by Jefferies to turn the page past the last few weeks, try to move on to the new chapter, try to get his party, try to frame the debate between Harris and Trump in the months ahead, even if he didn't explicitly offer that endorsement. You can bet that is coming soon, especially since she has no other major rival in this race, but a different attitude from democratic leaders who had been distraught over Joe Biden's chances over the last few weeks.
