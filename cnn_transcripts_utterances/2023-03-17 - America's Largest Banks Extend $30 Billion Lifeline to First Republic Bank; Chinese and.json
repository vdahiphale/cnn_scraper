Xi Jinping will travel to Moscow to meet the Russian president on Monday. Finland's president is in Ankara to discuss his country's NATO bid. And fury in France after Macron's tension overhaul. $30 billion. That is how much 11 U.S. banks are depositing into troubled First Republic in the latest attempt to calm markets and investor fears. Its shares tumbled after its credit rating was downgraded due to fears that customers would pull deposits, forcing banks to act after what has been a tumultuous week for markets. Here is how U.S. markets are reacting at present. Let's take a look at those for you. I'm getting our business anchor Julia Chatterley in place for you. Julia, the Dow off about half of one percentage point. The Nasdaq slightly higher, the S&amp;P off a little bit. Those markets aren't really telling us anything at this point. It has been a bad week for bank and bank shares, though. Is this panic over? Panic averted? Or what?",

I think what authorities have proved on both sides of the Atlantic is that they're prepared to get creative and they can do it fast. I think there is $30 billion deposit dump from some of the biggest banks in the United States, into one of the perceived weakest First Republic. It's an important show of strength. Basically at the core of this weakness and what the cause of all of this is, is this concern from big depositors, so those above $250, 000, that they're simply safer by putting their cash in a bigger bank. And this deposit dumped back to them doesn't address that underlying concern. So I think we still have to be a bit cautious. Glad that the authorities and the big banks are willing to step up and take action, but still cautious that the underlying fear for the depositors, particularly the biggest, still remains. And so I think this is something that we're just going to have to watch. But I think we've made it to Friday. We haven't seen another bank really struggle, and what they're showing here is that before we get to the point that we got to with Silicon Valley Bank, they'll react. And as far as Europe is concerned, the fact that the ECB was prepared to do what it did yesterday is another sign of confidence. So calmer I'll say for now.",

In total, including this new facility for the smaller banks to offload some of their government bond holdings, $165 billion worth of cash being drawn from the Federal Reserve. Now if I compare that to what we saw last week that was $4.5 billion dollars, Becky. Some will look at this and say, look, that's the level of stress in the system. I sort of look at this with a bit of context based on the financial crisis. This is banks saying, look, we're going to hoard cash and make sure that if someone comes to us and says, hey, I want my deposits back, or we've got a problem, we're going to have it to provide.

And yet this is a significant trip because it's President Xi's first overseas trip since his unprecedented third presidential term, you know, paving the way for leader for life, just like somebody else that he's about to go visit, Vladimir Putin, who's also been in power, you know, over many, many terms and doesn't intend to give it up. So Putin is waging this war and Putin needs things like ammunition, he needs weapons, he needs chips. China is already selling semiconductors to Ukraine, or at least the ones that it produces. Not the ones that are sanctioned by the West that are far more sophisticated. So that's a struggle that Russia is certainly trying to work around. But China is doing what they can at the moment to bolster Russia's economy, and in some of these parts that they are supplying are being used in the war effort. But if China decides, despite this public stance about peace in this peace plan to actually provide lethal weapons to Ukraine, to give Putin these things that can actually turn the tide on the battlefield, potentially humiliate the United States and NATO and the West, and also perhaps give momentum to this authoritarian movement in the world. You know, right now it's Russia, in the future it could very well, analysts say, be China trying to take its own territory or at least an island that it thinks it's its own territory, even though they've never ruled it and of course that's where I am right now, Becky, Taiwan.

And from somePalestinians in Jenin they say that it actually started with undercover security forces there before a larger security force came in. Now the Israeli military said that they went in to go after two commanders of what they said was Palestinian Islamic jihad, although we are hearing from the militant organizations that one was from Hamas and one was from Palestinian Islamic jihad. Now the IDF and both the militant groups say that those two were killed. The other two who were killed, you know, IDF says at least one of them they say tried to attack one of their forces with either a sledgehammer or a crowbar. And then they say that there were other exchanges of fire. It's not clear if the other -- how the other two that were killed were fully involved in the clashes or what exactly happened. But as you could see from the video you can see large groups of Palestinians out in the streets. Now according to some reports I have seen they were surrounding cars, they believe held these Israeli special forces. You hear those gunshots. We are also seeing some rather disturbing video of what is claimed to be Israeli security forces shooting at a man who appears to be either badly wounded or already killed on this -- laying on the street. Now Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic jihad have threatened retaliation for this. And sources I have spoken to in the past few weeks in the Israeli security establishment, when we've asked about this sort of regular raids that we've been seeing and why they are at such a clip that they've been at, they essentially say that they are trying to do as much as they can, what they call get all their objectives that they can. That's how they describe it before Ramadan. Remember Ramadan starts this week. There has been huge concerns about that will mean for the situation in Jerusalem, at the holy sites in Jerusalem. But the spokesman for the Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas said that Israel is not at all interested in claiming the situation and preventing its irruption contrary to all international efforts, he says, seeking to prevent escalation in the holy month of Ramadan. As you were noting, Becky, it's only March right now, and already this year more than 84 Palestinians, actually might be even 88 Palestinians. Both militants and civilians have been killed since the beginning of this year. 14 Israelis have been killed since the beginning of this year. All but one of them were civilians. Meanwhile, actually on Sunday another summit is expected to take place in Sharm el-Sheikh between the Palestine Authority, the Israelis, Jordanians, Egyptians, and Americans. This is the follow-up meeting to what we saw in Aqaba a few weeks ago. Again, all of this with the aim of trying to calm the situation ahead of Ramadan and ahead of the overlapping holiday of Passover when tensions are expected to flare if not explode here in Jerusalem. But as we can see on the ground it doesn't seem as though the situation is at all calming down as the days inch closer to those holidays -- Becky.",

The Saudis want to tamper down tensions so that they canreally focus on internal, domestic, economic growth. Obviously China is a big part of that. For the Iranians, it does seem like they, too, want to get out of the diplomatic box that they've been placed in. Better ties with Saudi Arabia could also bring in economic growth. But there are some very kind of unclear elements of this deal like you said. A, are the Chinese really going to be able to sort of muscle the Iranians into stopping their support for the Houthis? But to be one of the big on the military side is the nuclear issue. The Iranians have been -- the IEA said Iran is on the verge of producing weapons to create uranium. And as far as I can tell him from this agreement, there's no mention of getting the Iranians or the Saudis to kind of keep their nuclear programs under wraps. And maybe the Chinese are not concerned about it, as the U.S. and the West is. So I do think there are definitely military implications that the Chinese -- the Saudis, excuse me, have been wanting to develop their own civilian nuclear program. This includes being able to enrich uranium domestically. The U.S. is not supportive of that. The Chinese have some role in that program, in Saudi Arabia. Maybe they're going to be more lenient on the question of the transfer of nuclear technologies to Saudi Arabia. So there definitely are very kind of unknown military security implications from this agreement that no one really knows about right now.",

They know there is a lot of opposition in Congress, certainly the Democratic Party, to both the U.S. Military support for the Saudis and the Emiratis. So I think it's a sign of them sort of hedging their bets. They do not want a confrontation with the Iranians right now. They are not sure what role the U.S. is going to really play to sort of put a halt to the Iranian nuclear program particularly because if they're this close, you know, five or 10 years ago, if the Iranians were enriching uranium about at 85 percent there'd be an absolute international outcry. Instead, it's been pretty measured particularly from the United States. So I think the Iranians and the Saudis are hedging their bets. They're trying to keep tensions down with the Iranians. And that's why we're seeing all this engagement. It's in this environment where all the great powers are sort of realigning themselves and I think both Abu Dhabi and Riyadh are like, we're going to hedge our bets as well because it's really unclear how this is going to shake out going forward.",

The prime minister is facing this much opposition internally, you've got unrest in the West Bank. But you've also had both Netanyahu and Israeli officials say, you know, if the Iranians -- this redline of 90 percent. If the Iranians enrich to 90 percent that's a red line, i.e., suggesting there might be military engagement, military acts. It is a little hard to see Israel kind of engaging in such an operation with this much upheaval. I guess a cynic might say he'd do it to sort of change the political calculation.
