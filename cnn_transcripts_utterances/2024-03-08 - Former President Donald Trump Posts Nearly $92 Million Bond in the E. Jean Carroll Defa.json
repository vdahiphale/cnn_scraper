This is part of a new campaign push to amplify the message we first heard in a confrontation and somewhat unconventional State of the Union address last night. At times, it sounded more like a stump speech. To be fair, he was contending with some heckling Republicans. No surprise, things were politically charged because of that looming election rematch with former President Donald Trump. Let's get you now out to the campaign trail with CNN senior White House correspondent MJ Lee, who's in Pennsylvania for us. MJ, what do we know about this new push by Biden and his campaign?",

      "sentences": "Well, Boris, as is typical after the State of the Union address, President Biden is hitting the road. And his first campaign stop after his remarks last night is here in the suburbs of Philadelphia. And then after that, it's going to be pretty much back-to-back travel. We see him traveling to Atlanta, Georgia tomorrow. On Monday, it's New Hampshire. And then next week, Wednesday and Thursday, he is traveling to Wisconsin and Michigan, of course, among two of the most important and critical battleground states.And the campaign is saying that between the president and Vice President Kamala Harris, the plan is for the two of them to basically travel to every single battleground state in the coming weeks. And that's not including, of course, other travel by cabinet members and campaign surrogates as well. And what we're also seeing is the campaign bulking up their physical presence and also just their personnel as well. The campaign told reporters this morning that they plan to open up just in the month of March 100 new offices and make some 350 new hires for the campaign, and that there's going to be a really strong focus on training up volunteers as we officially really head into the general election season. Now, all of this, of course, is with an eye towards amplifying the message and the vision that we heard President Biden last night trying to paint. This is going to be largely highlighting the strength of the economy. That was one of the major themes, of course, that we heard the president talking about last night. As this is such an important issue for so many voters across the country, here's a reminder of how the president tried to sell that economic message in his State of the Union remarks last night.

And these ads, as you might expect, are going to be largely focused on some of the policies that, again, we heard the president talking about last night and drawing that contrast between President Biden and former President Donald Trump.

      "sentences": "Yeah, we have to take it all together. So we have a really strong jobs number, 275,000 jobs added in February. That is hot, but not too hot. And this also pushed up the unemployment rate to 3.9 percent. But that is because you had more people who were unemployed looking for jobs. But we've still seen a sub-4 percent unemployment rate for many, many months now, a streak really that we haven't seen in decades.Also, the sectors that have added jobs in February are the sectors that have been adding jobs for the past year or so now. You have health care, 67,000 jobs added, government, 52,000 jobs added. And food and drinking establishments adding 42,000 jobs. But as you mentioned, Brianna, it's always important to dig a little bit deeper in this report and look at wages. Wages on an annual basis in February cooled to about 4.3 percent. And if you're an American, you're saying, well, wait a minute, I don't want my wages to go down. But here's the flip side. When wages outpace inflation by a lot, that is actually bad for inflation. The more money we have to spend, the more that pushes up prices. So that is what the Federal Reserve ultimately wants to see. They want to see inflation--wages cooling and inflation cooling, but they want to see that wage rate close to 3.5 percent. Remember, we're sitting at an inflation rate of about 3 percent. They want it just a little bit higher to make sure Americans can still cover all the bills but not be too hot. So they spend and inflation goes up again, Brianna.",

But the revision that we just got in these jobs report signals that we actually only added 229,000 jobs in January, less than what we just got in this report for February. So that is still robust job growth, but not as strong as we initially expected.We also got revisions downward in December as well. So we're actually seeing a really good sort of place with the jobs market right now, where it's not too hot, not too cold. As they say, the Goldilocks, just right.",

Yes. 25 consecutive months with the jobless rate below 4 percent. It's the longest stretch in more than 50 years. Yes. Wages are outpacing inflation. Presidents would kill for those numbers, right?

I mean, consumer sentiment has been as low recently as it was in the deepest, darkest depths of the Great Recession, right, when we were coming out of the financial crisis and unemployment was around 9 percent.I will say that in recent months, consumer sentiment, consumer confidence, other views of economic optimism, those have been improving. They're still not great, but consumers are getting a little bit rosier in their outlook, not actually and objectively a rosy outlook, outlook, so to speak. SANCHEZ: Ron, that grouchiness that Catherine referred to, I mean, that's a real potential liability for the White House. And Republicans are trying to describe President Biden as out of touch on the economy. That was a large part of Katie Britt, the senator from Alabama's message last night.

      "sentences": "Well, it's an excellent question. I think a lot of the stuff in Biden's economic messaging is a little bit silly. The anti- shrinkflation bill that he endorsed, for example. Shrinkflation is maybe more salient today, but it's actually not more common today than it was a few years ago. Things like that. These are sort of populist talking points that he is hoping will demonstrate to the American public that the Biden administration is fighting for their pocketbooks.That said, I think where actually Biden and Democrats have a lot more material to work with is by talking about the Trump economic agenda, because Trump, as much as people remember his economy as being much better, and in many respects it was, whether due to him or not, Trump would implement a lot of policy proposals that would make inflation worse, right? He wants to have global tariffs of 10 percent. Those tariffs, we know, have been passed along to consumers. In the past, the same thing would happen under a Trump administration. That means higher prices for regular people. Beyond that, he wants to shut down immigration, not just illegal immigration, by the way, legal immigration, too. If you look at his actual policy agenda, he would, for example, dismantle the visa program that allows seasonal agricultural workers to come to the United States. What do you think that will do to produce prices? So if Biden really wants to make a strong argument about why he, you know, is better for the economy, beyond talking about these sort of silly, frivolous policies that maybe won't do very much but sound nice that he is proposing, he could draw attention to the things that would be actually damaging to the metrics, inflation, paycheck growth, et cetera, that Americans say that they care about.",

They helped him win the last election. He's having some issues with them. They're not happy with him, especially over the Israel-Gaza war. And they're feeling the pinch. I mean, when you look at people just getting started sort of building their families, child care is up significantly for toddlers and infants.You know, they can't buy homes because they're feeling priced out of that market, and yet rents are high as well.

So, he could appeal the jury award to E. Jean Carroll of $83.3 million dollars. The difference in the price there is due to interest that Trump would have to put up because he's posting this bond. There's question of where Donald Trump would get the money from for the bond, and now we have learned that the bond is being secured by a global insurance company, a very well-known company called Chubb (ph).So, they have secured this bond, and we also can see on the bond that Donald Trump signed it on Tuesday of this week. That was as he was still asking the judge in this case to give him more time to post the bond. So, now that this is kind of settled, the judge has asked E. Jean Carroll's attorneys to weigh in and see if they object to the bond or any of the terms. And if they do, then everyone will be back in court Monday afternoon. Brianna.",

And we expect that the appeals court panel will issue their decision by the end of the month. But again, you can see these deadlines all kind of coming together here because it will be toward the end of the month.March 25th is when he is expected to post this amount of money. And will he be able to get someone to underwrite a bond of that magnitude for an individual? And people close to Trump say, you know, he has the money. He owns all of these properties.
