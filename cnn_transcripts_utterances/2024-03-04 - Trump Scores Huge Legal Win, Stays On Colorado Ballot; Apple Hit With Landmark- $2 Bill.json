Who knows where we're we will end, but things have sort of perked up in the last hour, we might even go positive, I wouldn't put money unnecessarily on that. The markets and the main events that you and I need to digest: The Supreme Court rules to keep Donald Trump on the ballot in all states. It was a unanimous decision. As always though, the devil is in the detail. The EU has fined apple $2 billion over its rules for music streaming apps. And yes, a bad blood in Southeast Asia. Singapore is in hot water into neighbors over payments to attract Taylor Swift for an exclusive series of contracts only in Singapore. Now, we are in New York live, as always. Monday, March the 4th, I'm Richard Quest, and as we start the week together, I mean business. Good evening. Tonight, we begin with Donald Trump, who has overcome a major obstacle in his presidential campaign because of a ruling by the Supreme Court. It was unanimous. The nine justices said the state of Colorado had misapplied the 14th Amendment when it struck him off from the ballot in that state. Two other states, Maine and Illinois sought to disqualify Mr. Trump as an alleged insurrectionist. Colorado and Maine are among the states holding nominating contests on Super Tuesday tomorrow. Republicans now will be able to vote for Donald Trump. He hailed the ruling. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Congress is divided, the president is divided, the parties are divided. The court is just another one of those sort of cracked or divided institutions. But there's something I want to really say about this divide here right now, and the reason why I think the majority went where they did and the dissenters were where they were is that they said that the majority, there's only a specific way that Trump can be removed from the ballot and it is through what Congress does. What it forecloses is the fact that Trump is still facing criminal trials and what if he were to be convicted in the next months? And if he were to be convicted, this decision now precludes a judge from saying he is now, as a convicted felon, ineligible to serve as president of the United States. And so I think that's the real significant part that most people are missing right now, in terms of how this decision was laid out.",

It's going to takebriefs this month, oral arguments in April, decision expected by let us say the end of June. In some sense, what the court tried to do was take two issues, which are really I think, joined -- immunity issues, the insurrection clause issue, did he commit insurrection and trying to crowbar them apart and address them separately, and if the Supreme Court rules as I think they're going to rule and say, he doesn't have absolute immunity, there's a possibility that he can go to trial, possibility he could be convicted before election day, then the opinion that came out this morning precludes a judge from saying you've been convicted of a felony, you can't serve as president of the United States.

We also have the Mar-a-Lago case involving the government documents, which is alleged illegal behavior after he became president, and then we have the case that is going to start later this this month in New York City. So I can see the court eventually perhaps being dragged into these other court proceedings with Donald Trump, as well as perhaps depending on what's going to happen with the Georgia case regarding his efforts to try to interfere in the election there.

So for Spotify, to be able to say, hey, you can get at certain price on the App Store, but you can also get it cheaper somewhere else. There is also an issue here for the EU about the commission fee the App Store charges developers, 30 percent in many cases, which gets passed on to the consumer also saying that is unfair. So while Spotify brought the case, it's not just about Spotify, and Apple is appealing. They don't believe in this ruling at all.

Now in the case of Apple, if you've got the latest iOS in the EU, you can actually download an alternative App Store if you want. So you could buy apps from elsewhere. You don't have to use Apple App Store. It's not easy to do. I was actually having a go at this earlier today. You had to plug in your phone into a computer, you have to change all your settings.

Since the war started, these two men remained political rivals, and frankly, every poll now shows that Benny Gantz is more popular than Benjamin Netanyahu. In fact, if the elections were to be held today, Gantz would likely be the next man to become prime minister of Israel. He knows that, Netanyahu knows that's and the Americans also know that, and so as the United States is looking to the future, particularly as Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly thumbed his finger in the eyes of the United States, as they've been pushing to establish a Palestinian state, once this war is done, the White House is looking for another partner for the future. And it knows that Benny Gantz might very well be that partner. Now, that doesn't mean that the US is going to put its finger -- you know, put its thumb on the scale or try to influence Israeli domestic politics, but they know that Benny Gantz could be the next man and they also think that he might be someone they could work with perhaps even more than Netanyahu going forward.",

But in terms of finding the - - this airplane underwater, not a lot has changed. And I think the contract which they're proposing is a no find, no fee which is a pretty big undertaking, a very expensive undertaking, as you remember from the early searches and in 2014. And so, that part hasn't changed. It'll be a very expensive undertaking, but they do have over 50 to 60 pieces of the plane that washed up on, you know, the shores of the western shores of the Indian Ocean. So, they know for a fact it's down there somewhere. And of course, they didn't have those pieces in 2014 and '15.",

So then of course that led to various criticisms that why didn't you scramble the jet? Why didn't you follow it? Why didn't you do more? And why did you allow the search to go on in the South China Sea for three to four days while the oil Swick and the flotsam and jetsam where the plane had really gone down was now being flung to the four corners of the ocean. Those are the same criticisms that, you know, we had back in 2014. So, there's certainly not a lot of new information on the plane's whereabouts other than I guess I would say the flapper on, the piece of the wing washed up did show according to some experts, not according to all that it was violently ripped from the plane which would suggest that no, as some people theorize the pilot did not commit suicide and let it settle peacefully and gently on the ocean to sink down intact. This plane was ripped apart as it fell from the sky. I guess that's what the pieces have told us.",

That's simply not true. It just did not happen. And so, this, you know, a decade later, yes, there's nothing that says the pilot did it.

This is the backstory. Last week a lawmaker in the Philippines called on his country to pressure Singapore for an explanation. Joey Salceda said this \"This isn't what good neighbors do. It was at the expense of neighboring countries which could not attract their own foreign concert goers and whose fans had to go to Singapore.\" But the allegations were made public earlier by the Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin at a business forum in Bangkok on February the 16th. He said that Singapore paid Taylor Swift up to $3 million per show allegedly on condition of exclusivity of a Singapore-only arrangement in Southeast Asia. And Srettha added this, \"If I had known this, I would have brought the shows to Thailand.\" Now Singapore said it did award Taylor Swift a grant to perform there but it did not confirm the exclusivity clause. And on Monday, its culture minister Edward Tong made new comments about the grant speaking to Parliament, he said this \"there has been some online speculation as to the size of the grant. I can say that it is not accurate and not anywhere as high as speculated.\" Citing confidentiality reasons, he did not reveal the size or the conditions of the grant. This week, Swift is playing six sold out nights to 300,000 fans in Singapore. Her only stop in Southeast Asia. And according to an economist at Maybank, seven intent concert goers are coming in from overseas spending up to $370 million in this city state.",
