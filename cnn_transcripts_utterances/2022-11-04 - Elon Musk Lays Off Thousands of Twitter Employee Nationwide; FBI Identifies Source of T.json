What is going on there?DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, one week and he's let half of the company go. Thousands of Twitter employees overnight learned that they were fired. They learned this to their personal email accounts, because their work email accounts had already been turned off. Now look, the timing of this right before the midterm elections, if you think back to 2020, on election day, election week, there was all of these tweets, all of these viral videos that kept alleging to show voter fraud, voter fraud, voter fraud. Most of them, once they were fact-checked, once we looked into them, all proved to be bogus. And Twitter, at the time, was trying to fight us. But today we learn that Twitter has crushed most -- many of the people they have at the company fighting misinformation. And just a few minutes ago, I spoke to Jason Goldman who is on the founding -- he's a founding team member at Twitter and a former executive. And here's what he had to say about some of the concerns.

They weren't going to do anything, but they're angry, and, of course, that's alarming. Now it's unclear if this person is going to face any charges.But what happened here, is that they posted on this extremist, you know, website -- extremist views on the website which is a form where extremists use are posts and it set off this five-alarm fire. Especially because it made it seem as if this had already happened -- this attack had already happened. Which of course we can bring so many instances, right, in our past where we've known about certain instances on these forums and they haven't happened yet and we always saying, why didn't you listen to the red flags, you know. So, that's why the five-alarm fire went off with the FBI. But there is no longer a threat. It's good that, of course, the law enforcement were able to track this individual. The governor is saying this in a tweet, I want to read it to you. While the specific threat may be mitigated, we know this remains a tense time for our Jewish communities who are facing a wave of antisemitic activity. We will not be indifferent. We will remain vigilant. We will take any and every threat with the utmost seriousness, and we will stand up and stand shoulder to shoulder with our Jewish congregations. So, of course again, it's good that they were able to track this individual of course but also mitigate this for us and respond to it as quickly as they did.",
