Where do we go from now? Well, it comes down to really how much of Russia's beleaguered military, their Special Forces decimated after this ghastly war in Ukraine, where they're frankly, mismanagement has been in evidence from the very first days.It was supposed to take three days. Now here we are 16 months in, and they're still laboring to try and hold parts of territory. It depends what's left of the Russian military to defend Putin do the special forces of the FSB, Russia's security services feel they want to turn their guns on Prigozhin and the men around him, Wagner fighters who've lost thousands of colleagues in the fight for Bakhmut who've put themselves up as the storied heroes, they're brutal fighters make no mistake about it, but the storied heroes of Russia's frontline activity. Are the Russian military willing to turn their guns upon them? Or are we going to see Wagner as it moves, amassing more strength from Russia's military as it heads towards Moscow? I can't believe frankly. I'm even saying this unprecedented territory. And I think it goes to show when you get behind the curtain of exactly what's happening in Putin's Russia about which we know so little.

      "sentences": "Yes, the leader of a whole empire, if you will, Amara. It really is a rise that is also unprecedented inside Russia, but certainly one that also speaks to how Vladimir Putin controls the country. We have to keep in mind that Yevgeny Prigozhin is still known to many people as being Putin caterer or Putin chef because he ran a catering service that apparently also catered to Vladimir Putin as well and then became closer and closer to the Russian president, and started building this big empire which of course, also includes propaganda institutions, the internet research agency, of course, which is known for having meddle the USS in the 2016 election.Yevgeny Prigozhin is one of the individuals who was sanctioned by the U.S. for meddling in the 2016 election. But he then built that empire, including the Wagner private military company. He is, of course, the head of the Wagner private military company, and is one of those things where we've seen that company rise meteorically really over the past couple of years. I was in in Syria, in I think, 2014 or 2015. When we serve first saw Wagner appear on the scene there. They were essentially doing base protection, some of the things that private military companies do. But then continuously got involved in the fight as well. He then branched out into the oil business for the oil fields that the Assad regime had taken back, essentially taking control of those getting a cut of that as well. And then moved operations also into Africa. And built an empire there training African forces, for instance, with his private military company, but then also, of course, getting into the golden diamond trade as well, running mines and the likes. So he certainly became a force globally and someone whose global reach continued. And then if we look at Ukraine, that is where I would say this turn from being a private military company that does security and maybe some training into what we see now which is a full-fledged army. In fact, Yevgeny Prigozhin himself calls Wagner the most powerful army in Russia. He calls it one of the most powerful armies in the world, quite frankly. And a lot of what Nick was talking about before, certainly was a catalyst for that, which is the battle of Bakhmut, which was obviously extremely brutal, where he started using these tactics of taking prisoners from Russian prisons and then bringing them to the front lines to charge Russian positions. I was in Bakhmut for when some of that was going on. We had Ukrainians who were telling us that there were just dozens and dozens of Wagner mercenaries who kept charging their positions all the time, and it was very difficult for them to hold the line. However, he's claims that he had success in Bakhmut and he rubbed that in the face of the Defense Ministry, obviously claim that he was better than the defense minister. And now we see that full on feud out in the open.",

And so the White House says that they are monitoring this very closely taking this very seriously. Now, I have to say Victor that as of last night, the White House and National Security Council have been very particular in what type of information, what type of statements that they're putting out, knowing just how fast moving this situation is just how things can change in an instant. So they've been careful in this situation.But last night, we know that President Biden was briefed on the situation unfolding and Russia, of course, we asked this morning, whether or not President Biden will be briefed again on what happened overnight here in the U.S., as well as we know that the National Security Council, they put out a statement yesterday, I want to read it for you, they said that we are monitoring the situation. And we'll be consulting with allies and partners on these developments. You can see there on the screen there. Obviously, this holds a lot of implications for President Biden, but also for the unity that he has worked very hard over the last few months and years to hold, to really hold Russia's feet to the fire in support of Ukraine. As early as January, though, we know that they were talking about this from the podium that U.S. officials had identified some type of internal struggle happening between the Wagner group and Russia and therefore they were monitoring any intelligence from that point, at least a very closely, just a real window into the fact that they are taking this issue very, very seriously. Now, the question becomes what happens today? We know that President Duda of Poland tweeted a few hours ago that he would be talking to his allies that would include per chance, President Biden. So we've asked, of course, what President Biden's efforts of this are going to be today. Will he talk to allies? And how will he really stay tuned on this very quickly developing situation?

Colonel, thank you so much for joining us this morning. I mean, it really is stunning and extraordinary to see this leader of the Wagner group, which was instrumental in the war in Ukraine, challenging Putin's military leadership, vocally calling it out saying things like that it's incompetent. And now, Yevgeny Prigozhin is refusing to surrender. How would you describe what's happening there on the ground in Russia?COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, it's a confused mess, Amara. And I think one of the key things to think about here is that, you know, the historical precedent is Nick mentioned earlier, is really not there in modern Russia, you have to go back several centuries before you see something like this. It's kind of like Napoleon coming back from Elba and moving up and retaking control of France, except the one big difference, of course, with that analogy, is that Prigozhin has never held power, absolute power in Russia. He's never been the president or the head of state of the country. So it's clearly a power play, at the very least what Prigozhin wants to do is a give his force, the Wagner group, a major piece of recognition that he feels they're not having. But I think he's gone beyond that. He's kind of crossed that bridge of no return. He's made it very clear that what he really wants is absolute power over Russia. And in fact, it seems as if although he's not saying it, it seems as if he really wants to control the entire country, in other words, depose Putin.",

That was essentially armed rebellion on the street.But it's that, Putin is taking this purely as a security issue that he is using anti-terror legislation to allow the army to crack down on Prigozhin and his supporters. That's super clear. But what Putin hasn't done here at all, not one iota, is address what Prigozhin has been saying over the past month, that the war is -- in Ukraine is being fought badly, that there are unnecessary deaths, there are shortages of   ammunition that the people to blame are the defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, Valery Gerasimov, his -- the army chief of staff. So Putin is not dealing with that core question, and that's a question that is actually quite writ large in Russian society. People do ask that, particularly the families of lost loved ones in the fight. That number could be from a 100,000 perhaps to 200,000. So Putin, even after he deals with this security situation is going to have to deal with that question, and his delays in dealing with it so far, make him look weak. How he frames the war going forward after all this criticism, can he really completely ignore it? This is going to be a question that will affect how much longer he can stay in power. He has to stay in the war in Ukraine, to keep a narrative that victory can be had, that success can be had, and that is key, absolutely key to him, Putin, remaining in power.

That is a failure of leadership, and I -- (BOOING) You can boo all you want. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He probably expected some boos or some pushback. But does this in some way help him? If he is trying to run in the anti-Trump lane, those folks who are now in poll say they'll never vote for him. Look at him and see, he is someone who will take it to Donald Trump, to his people in a way that DeSantis and Haley and Scott and the others will not.",

I would call it sort of a minority position within the Republican Party that Chris Christie for reasons best known to himself feels like he has to enunciate.I mean, the reality is, there's almost no path to victory there. The polling shows he is by far -- by far, Victor, the most unpopular of the Republican candidates. What I think is interesting about it is that, there continues to be this trickle of new candidates into the race, and none of them of these new entrants seem to be overly afraid of Donald Trump. I mean, the folks who first jumped in, the Mike Pences and so forth, the Ron DeSantis, they seem to think they can take Trump's base away from him. It's unclear whether or how that would ever happen. And they're having a very hard time getting any traction in that direction. Chris Christie goes in an entirely different direction, is very unpopular with the base, which is, after all, still committed to Donald Trump, but he feels like he has to say something. He hasn't drawn any counterattacks really from Donald Trump, and this is, you know, sort of the evolving field, more and more people jumping in. Former mayor of Miami jumping in. Will Hurd; a former congressman jumping in, lots of people, and they don't fear Donald Trump at this point.",
