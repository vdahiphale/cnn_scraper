And when they located him a little while later, he was in a vehicle just outside of a relief site. Where people had been getting donations. And he had a rifle and multiple handguns on him. Now he's charged with going armed to the terror of the public. That is a misdemeanor charge. And when FEMA over the weekend learned about that threat, the agency quickly pulled its response crews out of the field. The goal was to keep them safe in that part of North Carolina. I asked a captain at the sheriff's office there for his message to the FEMA workers who are scared for their safety.

He says that shortly after meeting him and telling him about his aspirations to make it in show business, that is when Combs allegedly sexually assaulted him.

In court, the truth will prevail that Mr. Combs has never sexually assaulted anyone -- adult or minor, man or woman.
