House Republicans, they're trying and struggling so far still to lock in support for Kevin McCarthy's $1.5 trillion spending cuts bill that he needs or says he needs in order to get him to sign off on raising the debt ceiling. McCarthy can only lose four Republicans, as we know, and still the reality is, even if this bill passes the House, it would then need to get through the Democratically-controlled Senate. And even then President Biden has now vowed to veto it. Next hour, a critical meeting at the White House. President Biden is set to welcome South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol. The two leaders will be marking the 70-year alliance. And this is all starting next hour. They're also expected to focus on many important topics, North Korea's escalating nuclear threat, China's growing influence in the Indo-pacific region and the recent leak of Pentagon documents suggesting the United States has been eavesdropping on allies, including South Korea.

Officials say they believe these four men, Dylan Arrington, Casey Grayson, Corey Harrison and Jerry Raynes broke out of their cells on Saturday night. Police say that's when they climbed on to the roof of the Raymond Detention Center and likely split up to make their escapes. Then, in Jackson, Mississippi, police found the body of a man who had been shot and killed. They believe Dylan Arrington was behind that murder and stole the man's truck. Another stolen car was spotted in neighboring Rankin County, Mississippi. Investigators believe two of the suspects may have been headed there. And more than 400 miles away a Spring Valley, Texas, officials from, an abandoned public works truck. They found that truck there. It's the same one that was seen crashing through a gate late on Saturday night.CNN anchor and correspondent Amara Walker is following all of this. Amara, it sounds like law enforcement is really sort of close on their tail. What more do we know about the case?",

And $100 billion walked out of the door of First Republic. And that was a big, big outflow of money. And it means it's exploring every option it has here basically to stay alive. And so investors were really pessimistic on that stock yesterday so it fell.You know, look, now in the pre-market it's down even more. Another 20 percent. It's down 93 percent since that banking stress began last month. And here's what's wrong -- the problem for First Republic. It has a lot of wealthier customers who have more than the insured amount of deposits there. And so when the going got tough, those people are now finding new places to bank. And so this bank has to really rethink it's entire business model. So, one of the things - we're looking at markets up here today, and so that's good news because yesterday we had a down day. Banking concerns and also some earnings kind of in the mix. There's just kind of a lot going on, but we're watching those banking worries again. I think what we're hearing mostly from bank CEOs and from basically regulators and lawmakers is that the system has stabilized. And this morning, if you look at some of those other regional bank shares, those appear to be stabilizing. And that's what we want to watch, John.

So, we're pouring over every one of these earnings reports trying to see just where the weaknesses may lie and whether those outflows of customer deposits are slowing. And by all - by all accounts it looks like the stress from last month has been contained.But, remember, the Fed has been raising interest rates for a year now. So that low interest rate environment is gone. And these banks really need to adjust -- adjust to this new reality. And so you're seeing different levels of health around the system. Although what we hear from the Treasury, from the Fed, from the White House and from bank CEOs is the overall fundamental U.S. banking system is strong. Much better than it was in 2008. And these episodes can be weathered. First Republic, this is something that is not, you know, a systematic problem in the economy.",

Mostly rural communities, but that's somebody's home, that's somebody's park, that's somebody's business that are being impacted by these floodwaters.You're looking at the current river flooding gauges. We currently have over two does that are under major flood stage. But I want to highlight the attention between Lacrosse and the Davenport region. Those purple dots, that's the major flood stage. But as we advance into the future, this would be the next three days through the course of the weekend, we start to see those dots populate a little further to the south. And that is because we're seeing that river water move further and further south. You can see the flood warnings that stretch the Mississippi River, over 400 miles of flood warnings as we speak.

Emergency rule written by the attorney general of the state of Missouri. And this hearing is scheduled to take place this afternoon here in the state of Missouri. So, again, a continued scramble that we're seeing throughout the day inside of these clinics because if these patients, John, can establish their care today, then tomorrow when the emergency rule goes into effect they can continue that care under this emergency order.
