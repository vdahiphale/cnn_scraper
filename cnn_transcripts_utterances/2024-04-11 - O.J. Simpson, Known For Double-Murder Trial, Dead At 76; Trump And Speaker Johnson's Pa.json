From celebrated football star to the face of Hertz rent-a-car, to a star on the big screen, O.J. Simpson was beloved and then it all took a disturbing turn in 1994. That's when he was arrested and tried for the gruesome murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman. It's a case that became a nationally televised spectacle, beginning when Simpson fled police a white Ford Bronco. The trial became a macabre international focus, where other issues often eclipsed, the fundamentals, such as that Nicole Brown Simpson was stabbed seven times in the neck and scalp, that the gash across her throat nearly decapitated her. And the autopsy confirms she had defensive wounds on her hands. Ron Goldman also stabbed multiple times in the face slashes, leaving his neck sever, plus stab wounds in his abdomen and leg. It's believed Goldman also tried to fight off the attack. The criminal trial of OJ Simpson captured the world's attention and sparked conversations about race and racism and policing and bias. And his acquittal after a mere four hours of deliberation by the jury, exposed deep divisions in the United States. Simpson was later found liable for the two murders in a civil trial, and he went on to write a book that left many wondering if he was confessing. It was titled, \"If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer\". The bottom line is for all the talk of his unique athleticism and the important discussions that his trial brought forward about race, O.J. Simpson is going to his grave, best know for getting away with murder. CNN's Stephanie Elam Kicks off our coverage. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  O.J. Simpson's legacy changed with each era of his life. Some only know him from that infamous slow speed chase, and the so-called trial of the century.",

She ends by saying, O.J. Simpson is dead. May his victims finally rest in peace. And it's also just worth noting how much has impacted by this trial, Jake, so many things happen. We saw policing changing here in the city and it's also worth noting because of that unrest -- that racial unrest in the '90s, that is why so many people who may not have been invested in O.J.

The previous House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, he went from condemning Trump for the January 6 riots to just 17 days later, a flying to Mar- a-Lago to kiss the proverbial ring. There's the infamous photo with McCarthy acting as though he had not just slammed Trump days before saying, quote, had it with this guy. Many Republicans ultimately blamed McCarthy for bringing Trump back from political death with that trip. But despite that loyalty, he showed Trump, all Kevin McCarthy got from Mar-a-Lago was this keepsake photo and perhaps a t-shirt? Trump did not back him when his job was in jeopardy last October. So, current House Speaker Mike Johnson maybe in ways following that same political path, though Trump is far more powerful today than he was in 2021. But Johnson's track record of backing Trump's election lies back in 2020, suggested he and Trump are already in lockstep on this issue. In December 2020, as Trump fought state election results, Johnson spearheaded one of those efforts. He organized more than 100 House Republicans to sign an amicus brief in support of an entirely bogus Texas lawsuit, one that used lies and bizarre claims to try to push the U.S. Supreme Court to invalidate the electoral votes from four states that Biden won. If they had done that, it would've handed the election to Trump, but the U.S. Supreme Court kicked that lawsuit to the curb and on January 6th, just before Trump's supporters overran the Capitol, then Congressman Johnson posted on then Twitter quote: We must fight for election integrity, the Constitution and the preservation of our republic. It will be my honor to help lead that fight in the Congress today. Johnson condemned the violence hours after the attack, but still voted with about two-thirds of House Republicans to overturn Biden's wins in Arizona and Pennsylvania, based on those same election lies and conspiracy theories. In January of this year, Speaker Johnson was still refusing to admit that Biden won the election. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We shall see what that means.Let's bring in Republican governor of New Hampshire, Chris Sununu, to talk about the current state of the GOP. So, Governor, in all likelihood, I'm anticipating that given what Trump and Johnson have said in the past, that their press conference about election integrity will actually be about election lies about what happened in 2020. And I'm wondering how much you think its good for Trump and the GOP for the focus to continue to be on these wildly discredited lies about the 2020 election. GOV. CHRIS SUNUNU (R), NEW HAMPSHIRE:  Yeah, it's not good. No, it's not good at all. And this does follow up. I think the RNC and Lara Trump put out some email blast trying to raise money on election denialism recently. And again, you're not bringing in a single new voter on that issue. My guess is they need to raise money, right? Trump has been outraised and out -- outdriven so far on the financial side. So they're still trying to -- even though he's through the primary, he's really trying to gin up that base, get people riled up, get people to make those contributions, get some of the bigger contributors in there, show some -- some partnership with the speaker. So hopefully he can get a few things done. But at the end of the day, I really think this is about raising money and my hope is that again, because I think to your point, it hurts Republicans. We all have to kind of answer for it. So to say, and none of us want to do that, especially if you're running for office, you want to running drone issues and what you're going to bring to the table. My hope is that a lot of this pivots this summer, maybe its during the convention or shortly after the convention that there's a message pivot here.
