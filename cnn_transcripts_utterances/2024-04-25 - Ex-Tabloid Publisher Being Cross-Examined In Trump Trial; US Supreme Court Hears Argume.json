He is former publisher of the \"National Enquirer\" tabloid on this third day ofhis testimony and prosecutors got closer to the heart of their case, asking him about Stormy Daniels and her story of an alleged affair with Donald Trump. What did we learn? Stormy Daniels was trying to sell the story for $120,000.00. Now Pecker said, he refused to buy it, testifying, \"I am not a bank.\" He also expressed his worry about how some readers might react. He told Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer, I am not purchasing this story. I am not going to be involved with a porn star. Pecker said Cohen told him Trump would be furious about his refusal. Jessica Schneider is in Washington for us and she has been following all of this. Jessica, what are your impressions so far of what we've heard in court. We know obviously we are in cross-examination at this point. What has stuck out to you in this testimony so far?",

      "sentences": "Well, right now, it is really interesting just to see the lengths that defense attorneys are going toattack the credibility as they are cross-examining David Pecker. Right now, they are working to just systematically attack Pecker. In fact, just minutes ago, they were asking about his memory saying he didn't quite remember the exact week of that Trump Tower meeting in 2015, in August 2015. So in addition to attacking his credibility, they are also trying to establish that Pecker's protection of Trump and using the tabloid magazine, the \"National Enquirer\" to promote Donald Trump, they are trying to establish that this was nothing out of the ordinary as Trump moved into the 2016 election campaign. Trump's lawyers at this point have elicited testimony from Pecker, that Pecker had worked to put out positive pieces on Trump for about two decades, they say dating back to the 1990s. And now, defense attorneys are really trying to show the jury that even though you just heard five or six hours of testimony with prosecutors trying to paint this picture, that all of this was to help the campaign, in actuality, the defense says this was standard operating procedure for David Pecker. Nothing out of the ordinary. In fact, they've pointed to other celebrities who they have also paid for their stories talking about Arnold Schwarzenegger, also Tiger Woods. So they are really trying to say, hey, look, this arrangement with Donald Trump, nothing out of the ordinary, and certainly nothing that rises to the level of these criminal charges. So Omar, we do expect this cross-examination to continue probably for the next 30 minutes. Court is expected to conclude around 4:30 today. And then when it concludes, were going to continue to wait for Judge Merchan to rule on prosecutors' request that Donald Trump be fined about 10,000-plus dollars for what they say has been consistent violations of this gag order. You know, prosecutors have pointed in particular to 10 violations that they say, and then they pointed to four more statements that they say he made as recently as this week. So we will see if the judge decides to rule on that today. We have been waiting a few days for that or if maybe he will wait until the final day of court tomorrow for the week or even pushing it into next week. So a lot to happen in probably the next 30 minutes and maybe a bit beyond that as well, Omar.",

And I wonder from a prosecutor's standpoint, there was a moment where during their direct examination, it seemed they wanted to get ahead of the defense in saying that this witness had made a deal for immunity with the prosecution. Why would the prosecution admit that in their portion of things and how devastating can something like that be if they don't do it on the front end and you leave it for the defense to take advantage of.",

The only reason why this witness is testifying as he is, is because of this deal. The prosecution gets out ahead of that by bringing it up on direct. But this is an age-old mechanism in nearly any trial of significance that are going to be witnesses, there are often cooperating witnesses, the success rate in prosecutions does not turn on the fact that witnesses, they cooperate or not. It turns on to what extent the prosecution is able to  corroborate each corroborator's testimony so that they don't have to rely on the person's credibility or motive. Instead, they can establish through building a web of corroboration, the credibility of these witnesses, notwithstanding any motive they may have to testify due to \"saving their own skin.\"",

That New York case is all about 2016, this is all about 2020. And the Supreme Court this morning seem like they are prepared to go down a middle path. They are not -- it sounded like they were not ready to grant trump this sweeping immunity that he claimed he deserves. But they also were not prepared to give a greenlight to Special Counsel Jack Smith to plow ahead with the trial in this case with the indictment as it is currently written. What's the dispute? They are haggling over whether or not the actions in the indictment are official acts that would have some sort of protections and immunity, or were they private acts that are fair game for a prosecution? Jack Smith and the prosecutors say this was absolutely private. These were the actions of Candidate Trump trying to win an election, not a sitting president trying to fulfill his duties. Omar, I want to play for you a very notable clip from the oral arguments today. It is a little complicated, but it was very revelatory. This is Justice Amy Coney Barrett talking with one of Trump's lead attorneys and questioning him on specific items in the indictment. Was this private or was this an official action? The conduct that she is asking about, you won't hear her use these terms, but she is talking about Trump's coordination with Rudy Giuliani. She is talking about Trump's involvement in the fake electors plot, and she poses the question, was this official action or private? And Trump's attorney conceded, he gave some ground here and said that these actions actually were private, that could open the door to prosecution. Listen to how it all played out.

But that is not the way this report played out and it does raise some concerns about tomorrow's PCE inflation report, right? There are some upside risks there that that report could show that inflation was hotter than expected. Now, Julia, you mentioned the stagflation concern, and I think you're right to call it a whiff of stagflation because yes, that is sort of directionally where things are going or feels like they are going, right? Because you do still have prices going up uncomfortably high, also have growth slowing down. You can see it on that chart there, that GDP report. This is the slowest GDP growth in almost two years. But at the same time, it feels like we are still pretty far away from anything close to actual stagflation, right? We still have unemployment extremely low, GDP has been strong for a while, so we are not there, but Julia, we did here, Jamie Dimon earlier this week, raise this stagflation concern, and so I think that is something going to be on the minds of investors for some time now.",

You see Alphabet up 13 percent, Microsoft five percent and that is because we are seeing some big beats there, and you're right, it really is all about AI. Let us start with Microsoft. This is very much the barometer. I think you're looking at AI appetite particularly from investors because this is the company that has the Cloud computing software that underpins so many AI applications around the world. It has its own AI tool, Co-Pilot, which they introduced in November. And of course is a partner with OpenAI with Mistral and for many strategic partners. So diving into the numbers, total revenue up 17 percent year on year and so much of that growth is also coming from cloud service, Azure, up 31 percent year-on-year and guess how much of that growth in cloud services is artificial intelligence? Around seven percent. So you're actually seeing the increase in revenue from that AI demand in Microsoft, which perhaps not seen in Meta, and just to switch quickly to Alphabet, big news here. We are seeing them announce their first ever dividend of $0.20 per share, also a massive share buyback. Headline figures: Revenue up 15 percent, and again, this is another big player when it comes to the cloud. And in that sense a big player when it comes to AI.",

What's interesting here is that Donald Trump's defense team is really trying to maybe do two things. In particular at this point, attack the credibility of David Pecker. They've already brought in some issues with his memory, very minor issues, but saying that he didn't remember the exact week in August 2015 that he had that meeting in Trump Tower with Michael Cohen and Donald Trump. So, again, just trying to chip away and giving jurors may be some doubt about the credibility of David Pecker. And then the other thing that they've been trying to do so far over that hour of cross-examination that we've seen so far is to also say that, you know, the \"National Enquirer\" regularly captured story about celebrities and offered money. And it wasn't abnormal for them to be doing this on Donald Trump's behalf because they worked with other celebrities as well. And they're also saying that, you know, trying to establish that this wasn't necessarily for the benefit of Donald Trump's campaign. They pointed to the fact that \"National Enquirer\" had published positive stories about Donald Trump dating all the way back to the 1990s. So this is all part of their strategy to really downplay the criminal charges against Trump and, you know, chip away at the prosecution's argument. What they've already laid his groundwork during these initial three days of testimony. Omar, it is interesting that, you know, we've been waiting to hear from the judge about this gag order and any possible violation from Donald Trump, any possible fine. We haven't seen anything yet. What we did see, remember, prosecutors alleged 10 violations of the gag order earlier this week and then it was just in the last day that they said, oh, wait, there's been four more violations. We're not sure what the judge is going to do about the first 10 that have been alleged. But he said as to those additional four that prosecutors have alleged he will be holding a hearing on Wednesday afternoon. Remember, Wednesday is typically a dark day for this hush money trial but Judge Merchan does other administrative tasks during this Wednesday, and coming up, next week on Wednesday, he will hear hearing once again on this gag order issue. But this time it will be about those four additional instances that prosecutors have pointed out. So no ruling on the gag order so far. We're not sure if we'll see anything on those first 10 violations that were alleged, but we certainly won't see anything about those initial four violations that were alleged until probably after that hearing Wednesday -- Omar.",

It shouldn't -- well, we don't know at this point. It shouldn't affect the case in Fulton County, which is a state case, although we don't know how broad the Supreme Court might rule. And it doesn't look like it's going to affect the cases that's currently going on in New York. So right now, I think it only affects that one case, which is really the Washington, D.C. case, involving events growing out of January 6th. And that's the sense that I have at this point in terms of where the court was going, and in terms of how it's being framed.

Former tabloid publisher David Peckertook the stand for a third day testifying the entire day. He testified about the deal he helped broker with adult film star Stormy Daniels, who is at the center or at least part -- one of the people at the center of this case. Meanwhile, prosecutors say Trump violated a gag order four more times over the past three days. The former president is barred from speaking publicly about witnesses and jury members and their families in some cases, though the judge did not say when he would rule on the alleged violation. Amy Lee Copeland is a criminal defense attorney and she joins me now. So, I'm curious just for your impressions listening or at least reading the testimony of David Pecker over the course of today, obviously, we got a good portion of direct examination and the start of cross-examination. Do you think the prosecutor got what they wanted out of them? And do you think the defense is off to a good start?",

The other one that was pretty interesting, the state's evidence that really stood out to me is the photograph of him and Mr. Trump that this day apparently introduced, showing them on the White House lawn where he recalls that Mr. Trump was asking him at that moment what was going on with McDougal and thanking him for his help. From what I heard from the defense, they used the word standard operating procedure a number of times to try to stress to the jury that this wasn't anything unusual, that this wasn't a criminal conspiracy, and that this was just how tabloid journalism work. So we only heard or only read a short bit of the defense's case, but this seemed like they're off to a start that they should be on right now.",
