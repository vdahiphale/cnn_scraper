But without naming Donald Trump or really making a direct election year appeal, President Biden also under scored the values that he has previously said are at risk if his Republican rival were to take a second term, for example, protecting democracy and also the NATO alliance.Now on that front, the president talked about U.S. leadership on the global stage, including, for example, again, that NATO alliance, saying, for example, that Russian president Vladimir Putin or testing his assumption that NATO would not be able to unify and support Ukraine from his invasion, saying quote, \"Putin was certain that NATO would fracture,\" and of course there speaking directly to the invasion of Ukraine. And instead, the president said it is, quote, \"The greatest defense alliance in the history of the world.\" Now of course, President Biden has been a defender of NATO, especially earlier this year when former president Donald Trump said he'd encourage Russia to invade those countries that don't meet their NATO obligations. But beyond that, the president also maintained that he's determined not to send any U.S. soldiers to Ukraine. Instead saying still that the U.S. will be a steadfast supporter. The resounding message of all of this, of course, was countering tyrants in the world. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So it should be noted, of course, you know, when Trump tweeted that or sent it on Truth Social of that video, the broader context at play here, right? I mean, this is Trump who has made repeated comments recently about Jews who aren't going to vote for him as needing their heads checked out. He had lunch with Nick Fuentes in 20221, one of the most prominent antisemites in the country. And our colleague Jim Sciutto recently reported that he told his former chief of staff that Hitler, quote, \"did some good things.\" A conversation that Trump denies. So when he made that video with the phrase unified Reich, obviously it raised a lot of eyebrows, but however, according to Enes, that phrase, A, was not referring to World War Two. It was actually referring to World War I, the German empire at the late 19th and 20th Century, and it was texts that was originated as a placeholder text for a video that was only in it for a brief second.

It's his second this week and the seventh lawsuit since November that directly accuses the music mogul of sexual assault.CNN's Elizabeth Wagmeister has more, and I want to warn you that you may find the details disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELIZABETH WAGMEISTER, CNN ENTERTAINMENT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The legal fallout continues for Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, just a week after CNN uncovered this disturbing video of the music mogul throwing then- girlfriend Cassie Ventura to the ground, then kicking and dragging her. On Thursday, April Lampros filed a civil law lawsuit accusing Combs of sexual assault when she was a fashion student in New York in the mid- '90s and shared with him her dreams of working in the fashion industry. Then Mr. Combs love-bombed her, the suit alleges, using flowers and cards like this one, and inviting her to his first Father's Day celebration. But Combs' kind gestures became more aggressive, the suit alleges, leading to a total of four separate sexual assault. The first, an alleged rape in 1995, leaving Lampros nude, sore, and confused. She claims Combs used his power in the industry to regain her trust. But then in a New York City parking garage forced Lampros to perform oral sex. As Miss Lampros' eyes filled with tears, she could see the parking garage attendant witnessing this horrific assault, the suit claims. Lampros says she was caught in an abusive relationship and tried to end it after several years, but after running into Combs at an event, he pursued her and in late 2000s at her apartment, Combs violently grabbed her and forced himself onto her, kissing and touching her against her will. This came, the suit notes, while Combs was in a public relationship with Jennifer Lopez. Combs developed this mobster persona, the suit claims, at one point violently yanking her down to her knees and pulling her hair. The alleged abuse similar to this, when Combs was caught on hotel surveillance in 2016, kicking and dragging Cassie Ventura, then throwing a vase at her.
