Iowans are used to it, but even they tell me that this level of cold is unusual. What the candidates seem to be banking on though is the immense pride that Iowans feel in this process. So the caucus is not like a traditional primary where you can just show up and go vote and then go home. You spend several hours advocating for your candidate. It's a very involved and animated process, trying to convince your neighbors and friends to support your candidate as well. So all of that enthusiasm, the fact that Iowans take so much pride in going first, also candidates have really built an infrastructure to ensure that their supporters get out to the polls, they are doing all of that to combat these bitter, bitter temperatures. But no one knows for sure how this will impact the process. We don't know what it's going to look like in the rural areas, especially where people have to travel a great distance -- Fred.",

All right, thanks, Eva. We've got a team of correspondents covering all the campaigns as only CNN can. Let's start with Kristen Holmes following former President Donald Trump. Kristen, moments ago, he was talking. What's happening now. KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Now, he just stepped off the stage here in Indianola. It was a packed event. This was the only event that he was having over the weekend. He's doing a couple of smaller things, but those are unplanned rallies after the weather caused him to cancel three of the four rallies that he had had planned, and you could really feel the enthusiasm in the room. Now as for what Donald Trump's messaging was, one part of it was, don't be complacent, show up and vote. This is something we have heard from him time and time again. We know that he is privately very concerned about the weather. The whole point of what they are trying to do here in Iowa, is to change the electorate by bringing out people who have never caucused before, so he needs those people to actually show up. But there was another part of his message, too and that was essentially attacking Nikki Haley. Take a listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They have been watching her rise in the polls and they are already spending $4.5 million between the campaign and the super PAC to attack just Nikki Haley. And just for a reference point, they don't have any advertisements right now that are hitting Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. So they're putting everything into hitting Nikki Haley, and it was very clear that Trump himself is still concerned about her since so much of his speech today on the ground in Iowa did revolve around her. And one other note, Fredricka, before I forget, also Doug Burgum the North Dakota governor came out here. Obviously, he had been running for president. He dropped out of the race. He came out today and endorsed Donald Trump on the stage behind us during this event.",

That is how she has cast herself throughout her entire campaign, and it is what she's doing in these final hours before the Iowa caucuses.Now, with regard to the former president, you know, hitting her quite harshly today at his Iowa event, her campaign spokesperson tells me that he is threatened and we're ready. The Nikki Haley campaign has often welcomed those attacks from the former president, because what it demonstrates is that this is turning into, they believe, a two-person race between Haley and former President Trump. That's what they want it turn in to. It shows that the former president believes that's the case. Now, what they're looking at today are those new numbers that came out overnight from the Des Moines Register and NBC poll showing that Nikki Haley has now come ahead of Ron DeSantis. Of course, we'll see if that actually happens tomorrow in the Iowa caucuses. But one interesting bit in that poll is of the likely caucus goers that spoke with the pollsters, 49 percent of Trump supporters say they are energetically enthusiastic about candidate Trump. When it comes to the Nikki Haley supporters, only nine percent cast that type of optimism surrounding, going out for Nikki Haley. Now, Nikki Haley, for her part, told Fox News earlier today that she is not concerned about that. Listen to what she said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, the weather is an unpredictable factor, but Trump's people have for weeks and weeks now have been really pushing hard to get their supporters to turn out at caucuses. They've made the big issue out of that because remember in 2016, he lost Iowa, he did not win the Iowa caucuses. So they've been working very hard to make people understand how important the caucuses are. The problem is, his voters are, a lot of them, out in rural parts of Iowa. They will have to drive further to get to caucus locations. It will be more difficult for them, whereas people who might be supporting Nikki Haley or Ron DeSantis might be more urban, certainly Nikki Haley voters are likely to be more urban. So all of that said, here is what I think is important tomorrow. I think that if Ron DeSantis, who has put all of his eggs in the Iowa basket does not finish in second place to Donald Trump, I think it is very hard for him to continue. I think he has very little runway to keep going into New Hampshire where we know Nikki Haley is much stronger than he is at least based on polling.",

That's where we have wind chill warnings posted for most of the state because this is dangerous cold. We're talking about frostbite in minutes, if you spend any time outside. These are the temperatures -- high temperatures for Monday on caucus day. Des Moines looking at a high temperature of minus four. And we put it also on here the departure from average to show you, yes, Iowans get cold, but this is 30 degrees colder than average for the time of year. So it is not normal to get temperatures like this this time of year. Tack on the windchill, you're looking at windchill times or I'm sorry frostbite times at 30 minutes or less. So again, taking minutes to get some frostbite conditions out there as we go into Monday evening. When you look at all of the past caucuses, most of them have been with temperatures in the 30s and 40s. 2004 sticks out with that high of only 16 degrees and it looks like as we go into Monday, we're going to far outpace that with that, again that high temperatures to only minus four in Des Moines, so that would go down as the coldest caucus on record. Here is a look at the broader picture. You've got windchill alerts from the Canadian border down to the Mexican border with some of the heart of the winter warning, warning for windchills as cold as 45 degrees below zero, incredibly dangerous and life threatening. That's where you get the frostbite conditions in minutes. Now, as this cold air dives south, it is also going to come with a punch of snow.

It is very different than the way Democrats do things and it shouldn't be confused that they don't do it the same way, it is different. Democrats have this process -- had this process where, you know, if you didn't get 15 percent of the vote on the first round, then you would re-sort and you would physically move to other portions of the gymnasium or whatever.

Republicans, it's about 85 percent White. They didn't have the same reporting issues. But because the Democratic Party had become more diverse, they are trying to figure out ways to give other states a chance to go first and be part of this process, that's why President Biden pushed to have South Carolina go first, because South Carolina, you know, nationally is thought of in a general election as a very conservative state.

And now, you're also seeing a correlation with Nikki Haley trending up in the polls in Iowa. You know, the gold standard poll that had come out this past weekend from an J. Ann Selzer has her in second place now in Iowa, and if she were to finish second, that really could be, you know, something where a lot of people are asking when DeSantis would be dropping out, not whether or not he's going to be able to go long term against Trump.",

This information originally came from Texas Democratic Congressman Henry Cuellar, and later corroborated by other agencies. Cuellar said in a post on social media that the US Border Patrol learned Friday at about 9:00 PM that a group of six migrants was in distress. According to the congressman, Border Patrol officials called the Texas military department, the Texas National Guard and the Texas Department of Public Safety, but were unsuccessful in relaying the information by phone. Cuellar also said that Texas military department soldiers stated that they would not grant access to the migrants, even in the event of an emergency and that they would send a soldier to investigate this situation. The bodies of three migrants were recovered hours later by Mexican authorities. The Department of Homeland Security has also confirmed the deaths -- Fred.",

And there's a huge controversy at the border because as we have previously reported, the US Border Patrol has been blocked out of Shelby Park, an area at the US border with Mexico that had until recently served as a holding area for migrants.Last Wednesday night, Texas authorities erected fencing gates and razor wire to take custody and control of the park. That means that Border Patrol agents who, as part of their regular duties, rescue migrants in distress, didn't have access to the area where the migrants are believed to have drowned. Now, you're asking me about a reaction. In a statement, the Texas Military Department said the following: \"At no time that TMD security personnel along the river observed any distressed migrants nor did TMD turn back any legal immigrants from the US during this period,\" adding that \"They were not made aware of any bodies in the area of Shelby Park at that time.\"",

Likewise, Customs and Border Protection said in his statement that, \"We remain gravely concerned by actions that prevent the US Border Patrol from performing their essential missions of arresting individuals who enter the United States unlawfully and providing humanitarian response to individuals in need.\" And Fred, CNN has also reached out to the office of Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who originally ordered the Texas Military Department to take over the park in Eagle Pass.

But if you look at this Supreme Court, led by John Roberts, they chipped away at the Voting Rights Act. When you think about the Trump justices who helped overturn Roe v Wade, which really we know in practice, impacts poor women and women of color at higher rates. So much of what Dr. King fought for, this idea that every single person, no matter who they are, who they look like, where they're from, could participate in their democracy. That's on the line.

But the reality is, people have to show up like they never have before, because Donald Trump and those who support him, have made clear, they want to make it as difficult as possible for people to vote. They lie about the safety and security of our elections, then use those lies to try to make the process out of reach for far too many Americans. I know it here in Pennsylvania where I serve on the State Government Committee, which oversees our election laws.

All those freedoms are at risk. And if we have somebody like Donald Trump, in the White House again, he has made it clear he's not in this election for you. He's not in this election for me or for the folks I represent here in North Philadelphia. He's in it for him. And he's going to spend the next four years trying to get after all the people who stood against his anti-democratic assault on our democracy.But we could do something different. We could elect Joe Biden who has presided over an economy where we see Black wealth growing by 60 percent, where we see the smallest wealth gap between African- Americans and White Americans in a long time, the lowest unemployment for African-Americans, insulin capped at $35.00. You know, both my parents died by the time I was 27 because they didn't have access to the type of healthcare they deserved.
