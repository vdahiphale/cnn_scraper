They say that they have killed over 60 militants over the course of the nearly a week of military operations there. In just the past day, they say that they've struck a weapons storage facility and killed militants firing mortar shells at troops. And it's clear that these battles in Jabalia have been very bloody. We know, according to Kamal Adwan hospital, that at least 12 people were killed overnight in Israeli military bombardments of the area. They say that 112 people have been killed over the course of this expanded Israeli military operation in Jabalia over just the course of the last week. We know that there has been the sound of persistent gunfire in Jabalia. It's not clear of those people who are dead, how many are civilians, how many are combatants, but we certainly have seen images of civilians killed and injured in the very intense fighting, which, again, is happening because once the Israeli military withdrew from that area, they say that Hamas has since returned there, and that is also raising larger questions about the Israeli military's long-term strategy in Gaza, whether this is a cycle that will simply continue to repeat itself until there is some kind of a longer-term plan for post- war Gaza.",

From what we've been able to gather from a reporting standpoint, there was an accident involving a pedestrian, a potential fatality around Valhalla golf course around five in the morning that involved a bus right before the start of the second round of the PGA Championship.Now, somewhere in this time, likely because of maybe increased police presence with officers trying to work through what was ultimately this accident and potential fatality, Scottie Scheffler was trying to make his way through the front gate of Valhalla to start today's second round and was ultimately detained by a police officer, according to Jeff Darlington of ESPN. So, as Scottie Scheffler was making his way into Valhalla, according to Darlington, he didn't realize that a police officer was trying to get him to stop his vehicle. So, he continued on about another 10 to 20 feet. The officer approached Scheffler, asked him to get out of the car, according to Darlington, detained him, put him in handcuffs, and then from what we can gather from what ESPN is reporting, essentially booked him, took him down to the Louisville police station, which seems like it's something of a misunderstanding, according to Darlington's reporting. It seems like Scheffler didn't realize that he was being asked to stop by a police officer. It seems like it was a bit of a complicated situation with so many different officers on the street. Maybe he didn't realize that he was being asked to pull over. But, all that being said, what we know from the PGA tour right now is that the start of the second round was ultimately delayed for about an hour and a half while they work through what happened in this first incident involving this pedestrian who was reportedly struck by a bus and killed, and we're starting to figure out more about what exactly happened to Scottie Scheffler and where he is now, as play gets set to resume a little bit later on this morning.",

So, without the power and the air conditioning, that can really be a problem for people in Houston. So, you'll want to keep that in mind.Here is what's left over from the storms. We've got one line of storms that's really firing up in Mississippi, and then another line that's headed into the Big Bend there of Florida, headed toward Cedar Key, and some of the northern suburbs there of Tampa with some lightning and intense heavy rain. We do still have a severe risk for today. The threat continues along the Gulf Coast. We've got that level, two out of five slight risk for severe weather, meaning that we can still see a couple of cases of damaging winds, large hail, and a couple of tornadoes from New Orleans into Mobile and Montgomery, Alabama, as we go through the day today. So, storms continue to fire up, again, especially in parts of southern Alabama there.

Now, I want to show you that we also put some of these river gauges on here too because these rivers have been really aggravated over the last couple of days because they've had multiple rounds of incredibly heavy rain. So, the rivers were already aggravated going into this event. And then, again, only adding insult to injury as we get more rounds of heavy rain. Look at the rain that we've got over the last 12 hours, widespread, two to four inches of rain. Now, when you look over the last month, over parts of eastern Texas, they've got upwards of 20 inches of rain. That is six times their normal amount of rain, which is why we're having such a hard time with all of this flooding. The soils really literally can't take any more moisture in there. So saturated. We do know that heavier rain is a trend. As our atmosphere is warmer, it holds more moisture. That brings down heavier rain. Fred.",

But, come Monday, the defense will resume their intense cross-examination of key witness Michael Cohen. Trump's lawyers grilled Cohen on Thursday, exposing key inconsistencies in his testimony. The jury could have the case in its hands as early as next week as Judge Merchan told the lawyers to be prepared to deliver closing statements on Tuesday. Donald Trump seemingly had his best day in court so far on Thursday, as his legal team turned up the heat on the star witness Michael Cohen.CNN's Paula Reid has details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Michael Cohen, the only witness being called by the prosecution who can directly implicate Donald Trump in an alleged hush money scheme, has crucial parts of his testimony undercut. Returning to the stand for a second day of cross-examination, Trump defense attorney Todd Blanche grilling Cohen about all the times he has lied, painting him as unreliable and out for revenge after not being given a job in the Trump White House. You were disappointed that after all the work that you had done for President Trump for nine and a half years, nobody, including President Trump, offered you a position in the White House, Blanche asked Cohen after showing him text messages he sent to his daughter about potentially working in the Trump administration. That's not accurate, Cohen insisted, and he began to grow agitated as Trump leaned forward in his chair behind the defense table, at times staring intently at his former fixer. The Trump defense then reached a crescendo, turning to a key moment of Cohen's testimony. A 2016 phone call he says he had with former Trump body man Keith Schiller, who says he then passed the phone to Trump. Cohen says he told Trump on that call how he planned to pay Stormy Daniels to keep their alleged affair quiet. But, referencing phone records, Blanche asked, this is the call that you testified about on Tuesday. It was to talk to President Trump about the Stormy deal and to move forward. Cohen was then shown a text message he sent to Schiller the same night, about a 14-year-old prank caller who had been harassing him. Cohen texted Schiller, who can I speak to regarding harassing calls to my cell and office? The dope forgot to block his number. Schiller texted back soon after, call me. Blanche then raised his voice, asking Cohen to confirm the call was not actually a conversation with Trump about Stormy Daniels but about the 14-year-old prankster. Cohen defended himself, saying part of it was the 14-year-old but I know that Keith was with Mr. Trump at the time, and there was more potentially than this. Blanche shot back. That was a lie. You did not talk to President Trump. You talked to Keith Schiller. You can admit it. Cohen calmly responded, no, sir. I don't know that it's accurate. Blanche responding, a one minute and 36 second phone call and you had enough time to update Schiller about all the problems you were having, and also update President Trump about the status of the Stormy Daniels situation, because you had to keep him informed. I always ran everything by the boss immediately. And in this case, it would have been saying everything had been taken care of. It's been resolved. Cohen answered. He maintained his composure. I believe I also spoke to Mr. Trump and told him everything regarding the Stormy Daniels matter. We are not asking for your belief. This jury does not want to hear what you think happened. Blanche recorded, the prosecution that objected, the judge sustained, and Michael Cohen shook his head.",

It was a good moment for Todd Blanche, after a decidedly underwhelming performance on Tuesday, and some additional meandering that morning and after lunch. It clearly was the highlight. In my view, juries decide on a witness and decide on a case taking the big picture. And there has been a mountain of corroboration of Michael Cohen starting with the August 2015 meeting with Cohen, Pecker and Trump, when we did have another witness. Mr. Pecker say there was an agreement to take these actions to benefit the campaign.And there are additional Cohen-Trump calls. There are two, for example, on the key day, October 26, one at 8:26 a.m., one at 8:34 a.m., that are very clearly based on phone records and Mr. Cohen's testimony, calls from Cohen to Trump directly.

The jury paid close attention, as they generally do. They did not have strong reactions, as they have at other times. I don't think it's a jury that particularly likes Todd Blanche. I've noticed some adverse reactions by them to the lawyer. His shrill attacks that Cohen had lied were objected to and sustained by the judge. I don't know that those landed particularly well.In my experience, over 30 years in court, it takes more than one punch to knock out a case. So, certainly, this was a damaging sequence. But, in the larger scheme of things, there is so much evidence of the alleged wrongdoing that has come in. I don't think that this was the knockout blow that the defense needed because they are behind on points. So, they're not quite there yet. They may get there when we come back on Monday morning.

ESPN was the first to report this story.

The police officer shoved him against the car and immediately placed him in handcuffs. That's according to Darlington's reporting.For context here, Fred, there was a separate incident this morning that caused PGA Championship organizers to delay the start of the second round. There was an accident that occurred in the early morning hours near the course, and according to one of CNN's affiliates, the man who was involved in that accident was killed after being hit by a shuttle bus near Valhalla Golf Clubs. So, that incident did impact traffic. It is unclear right now whether that increased police presence or that traffic issue ultimately affected Scheffler's ability to get where he was going.

So, one out of every seven credit card borrowers from that generation has maxed out their cards, according to research from the New York Federal Reserve Bank. By comparison, less than 10 percent of Gen Xers have the same issue. They're the ones born between 1965 and 1980.CNN's Matt Egan is joining us now with more on this. So, what's going on with the Gen Zers that they're having such big problems?",

But, this is arguably the worst time because those interest rates are just so punishing. But, experts do say there are some solutions out there. One thing you could do is try to transfer that high credit card interest into a zero balance credit card, where you have no interest, sometimes for up to 21 months. You could also apply for a lower interest personal loan. You could seek out nonprofit credit counseling.Of course, in a perfect world, you'd be able to boost your income and cut your expenses. Of course, that's easier said than done. Fredricka, perhaps the best advice that I've heard is to just stay away from credit card debt as best you can because it's just too hard to get out of, especially when rates are this high.",
