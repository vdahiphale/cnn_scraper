That is the biggest week-over-week drop that we've seen in a year. The bad news is, as you can see on that chart, mortgage rates are still high. They've more than doubled from where they were at this point in 2020. And that is very painful because the higher mortgage rates go, the less home that people can afford. Let me show you what I mean here.If you were buying a $500,000 home and putting 20 percent down, you're paying. $1,100 more per month than you were if you bought at this point in 2020 -- $1100 more. And that's not getting you an extra bedroom or a bigger garage. That's all money that's just going to the bank. So if you talk to people who are trying to buy a home right now, they're hoping mortgage rates go much lower because, Brianna, it is very tough out there right now.",

      "sentences": "So Brianna, at this hour, no clear through line. We do know that the Sheriff's Homicide Bureau is investigating the suicides. Again, as you mentioned, three current employees, one retired employee. LA Sheriff Robert Luna says that the department is now in mourning. I'll read you part of his statement.He says that: We are stunned to learn of these deaths, and it has sent shock waves of emotion throughout the department, as we try and cope with the loss of not just one, but four beloved active and retired members of our department family. During trying times like these, it's important for personnel, regardless of rank or position, to check on the well-being of other colleagues and their friends. Now Brianna, this has certainly been a crisis that we've heard about across law enforcement, across this country. And you know, this is personal. I've had former colleagues in law enforcement who have died by suicide. You know, the key that we hear from experts is that officers have to understand that seeking help is not a sign of weakness. It is a sign of strength. We're also hearing calls for solutions. Such as mandatory annual checkups for officers. You know, there's this culture in law enforcement that you just have to suck it up and keep going. It's obviously an inherently dangerous profession that officers are in. They're running calls, interacting with people who are calling 911 on the worst day of their life. And that takes its toll. And so having those annual checkups, we're hearing from experts, will allow authorities to try to get past that stigma of weakness, you know, requiring officers to do this. But finally, it's interesting, I talked to, for example, Chief Charles Ramsey, who's formerly the head of Philly and Washington DC departments and said that he tried this in Philadelphia, sending officers through this mandatory training. He was shocked by how many of those officers came back and said, I want a second appointment. I want a third appointment. Again, it starts with messaging and it starts with ending the stigma of seeking help -- Brianna.",

It's just horrific to hear this.And I do just want to mention that if you or anyone you know needs help or is in crisis, you can call or text 988 to reach the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.
