But the House Oversight Committee is now providing new details about those payments, including that one of the recipients was Hallie Biden. She is the widow of Beau Biden. She was also romantically involved with Hunter Biden after Beau's death. And the House Oversight Committee was able to glean this information by obtaining financial records from an associate of Hunter Biden. His name is John Robinson Walker. He's someone that Republicans have scrutinized for many years. He transferred just over a million dollars to three members of Biden's family after he received $3 million from that Chinese-based energy company.But, I want to be crystal clear here because this memo does not directly tie these payments to President Joe Biden in any way, nor does it provide any evidence that Biden directed these payments or took any action during his time in office to enrich his own family members. Hunter Biden's legal team also says that Hunter pursued these legitimate business deals. That he has a right to do so as a private season. That all the money was earned legitimately. And so I think it's important to underscore here, Republicans, they are continuing to dig on this issue. They are ramping up this investigation but they have not yet proved the entire purpose of their investigation. Kaitlan.",

So that -- we had expected this, but that filing just happened here.And then the other big news is this unbelievable private sector push to shore up First Republic. We learned yesterday afternoon that banks led by JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup, Wells Fargo and others were all kicking in billions of dollars of their own money to cover the deposits of First Republic. So, this was another big effort in the last week to really project confidence and reassurance in the American financial system.

That applies to me, especially with the streaming service that I have on my phone. When I'm watching from the phone I notice everybody's like 40 second ahead of me.",

      "sentences": "Yes, it's a thing and something that I've run into a lot, so I got really interested in this.So, this morning's number is 25 percent because that's the percentage of NCAA fans who streamed at least one game over the last year. So, streaming is becoming a lot more popular. And, you know, you're talking about streaming and someone like me who might be watching on cable and talking about that lag, that lag, right? And it turns out there's a massive lag. So, how much lag behind real-time action? This is an estimate using this past year's Super Bowl as an example. So, cable lags behind real- time action by about 28 seconds. But look at the average streamer, a bundle, let's say your Fubus, let's say your Hulus, let's say your YouTube TV, that lags by an average of about 67 seconds. And so streaming lagged cable by about 39 seconds overall. And I want to give you an idea of how this works in real-time with a good example up here. So, we literally have cable, right? And then we started the clock for 39 seconds. And you'll look at streaming TV. Nothing is going on at this particular point. And why is this so important? Because maybe you want to be texting with friends, Don. Maybe you're on Twitter, right, and you're following the action. Or maybe you have a sports app and it's updating you. And, of course, they get the action in real-time and you're watching, let's say, YouTube TV and all of a sudden the action is happening and you have no idea what's going on. And I, for one, can't stand this, especially when I'm watching an NFL game, and I can't watch my Buffalo Bills streaming, I have to make sure that, in fact, I'm getting it in real-time. And look know, we just hit zero, and the streaming just started. That's how much of a delay that we're talking about here. And so when you're, let's say, texting with your friends on the NCAA buzzer beaters, all of a sudden you might not necessarily know what's going on. So, let's just sort of walk back here a little bit and, you know, again, as I mentioned, it's your friends texting. It's Twitter. It's your sports app. All that lagging really hurts. But, you know what, Americans really hate spoilers. And it's not just about sports streaming, right? Twitter can spoil stream shows. Let's say \"Succession,\" right, for example. And here's where I love that we have polling for everything. About 75 percent of Americans hate spoilers of any type. If they ruin \"Succession\" for me, I'll just be really angry, Don.",
