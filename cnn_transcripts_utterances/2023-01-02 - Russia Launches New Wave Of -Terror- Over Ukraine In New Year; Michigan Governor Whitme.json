Officials there say the targets from Russia are targeting critical infrastructure in the region, like power and water services. Meanwhile, Kyiv's mayor joined a group of soldiers in Bakhmut on New Year's Eve in an effort to bring them hope and tradition going into 2023. We turn now to CNN's Ben Wedeman live for us in Kyiv, Ukraine. Hello to you, Ben. The question is a campaign of terror has not slowed down despite Putin's claims of wanting to negotiate with Ukraine. What are you seeing there from the ground? BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, as you said, there are those 20 drones that were fired at Kyiv overnight. Some of them did damage to critical infrastructure. And so, the authorities here in Kyiv are calling upon people to limit as much as possible their use of electricity. That, in addition to over the New Year's weekend, more than 45 of these Iranian-made Shahed -- the 135 drones were fired. These are drones that explode upon impact. They are sometimes difficult to intercept for the air defenses. Now, over the weekend, one person was killed in the New Year's Eve barrage that took place, and another person has died as a result of the wounds that he received during that barrage. So it does appear that the Russians -- I mean, basically, four out of the last five days have seen these barrages aimed at the Ukrainian capital. The air defenses are working but they are not able to take out all of these incoming drones that the Russians seem to have in fairly decent supply, although the Ukrainian officials are saying that according to their intelligence, the Russians are running out of missiles and drones to fire. But you wouldn't know it here in Kyiv -- Don.",

Here is her reporting. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR (on camera):  So they've only ever known the governor's mansion? G. WHITMER:  They've only ever known this beautiful place, yes. COLLINS (voice-over):  Inauguration Day for Gov. Gretchen Whitmer starts with kibble. COLLINS (on camera):  How are you feeling today? G. WHITMER:  I'm good. I'm excited. I'm excited starting a second term. We've got a whole new Legislature, a whole new environment here and we can get some really good stuff done. So this is my sister, Liz. LIZ GEREGHTY, WHITMER'S SISTER:  Hi. COLLINS (voice-over):  It's 7:30 a.m. The governor's pumpkin oatmeal bake is on the kitchen counter and she's surrounded by her family. Whitmer says she wasn't always confident this day would come. G. WHITMER:  There was so much chaos, politically and in the environment, I didn't know if I would get an opportunity to serve for four more years. I never imagined I'd win by almost 11 points and come in with a whole new Legislature. COLLINS (voice-over):  Whitmer defeated her opponent decisively and with Democratic control of the State House and Senate for the first time in 40 years, is viewing her second term differently. [07:40:04] COLLINS (on camera):  Do you feel, like, battle-tested? G. WHITMER:  It's hard to rattle me now. I will say that. You know, we've had challenge after challenge. But yes, I do.

WHITMER:  For Michigan to be a place where they will make their lives, they better be able to make their own decisions about their bodies and their -- have full protections under the law. And that's why as a mom, so much of what I do is driven by my own situation. Having daughters, I think, is -- makes it sharper and more urgent than if I didn't have them.

I'd be lying if I told you it hasn't -- I'm unphased by it. COLLINS (voice-over):  Whitmer was sworn in just days after two men who led the plot to kidnap and possibly kill her were sentenced to prison. G. WHITMER:  Nineteen and a half years for one of the organizers of the conspiracy to kidnap and kill me. That is a significant sentence. I think it's important to understand I'm an ordinary person. I've got an extraordinary job. I have served in extraordinary times. I'm a mom. I'm a daughter. I'm a -- I'm a -- an average person who is trying to serve my state. COLLINS (voice-over):  Whitmer has chafed in how the matter has been described as a kidnapping plot instead of an assassination attempt. G. WHITMER:  And they weren't planning to ransom me. They weren't going to keep me. They were planning to assassinate me. And the plot has been covered as a kidnapping plot. There was one person who showed up on -- you know, Supreme Court Justice's lawn and turned himself in. And it was covered as an assassination attempt. COLLINS (voice-over):  The whole ordeal made Whitmer question remaining in public service, and she was shocked when her opponent, Tudor Dixon, used it as a punchline on the campaign trail. TUDOR DIXON, (R) FORMER MICHIGAN GOVERNOR CANDIDATE:  Gretchen Whitmer sure is good at taking business hostage and holding it for ransom. COLLINS (on camera):  What went through your mind when she said that? G. WHITMER:  Just how craven and how there are some people who care more about winning an election than the health and safety of our democracy and our fellow Americans. COLLINS (voice-over):  As Whitmer takes her oath of office and begins her second term, it will also be her last due to term limits. G. WHITMER:  I do think people can have some great takeaways from what we did and replicate it in other states. The best way that I can contribute to the national Democratic Party is to be able to be someone that they can point to and say this is what happens when you elect Democrats. COLLINS (voice-over):  But the governor brushed off speculation that she'll seek a future White House bid. G. WHITMER:  I'll be very honest with you, Kaitlan. I have not spent a whole lot of time thinking about that -- no. COLLINS (on camera):  But you've spent some time thinking about it. G. WHITMER:  Well, because people ask me. So, briefly. COLLIN (voice-over):  So what's next in four years when she leaves the governor's mansion? G. WHITMER:  I will stay engaged one way or another. I don't know if I'll ever run for anything again but I will be engaged. COLLINS (voice-over):  But as Whitmer, herself, noted, she's said that before. G. WHITMER:  You know what? When I left the Legislature eight years ago, I never thought I would run for another office again. I know enough about myself to know if there is something that needs to be -- need to get done and I -- there's a role I can play, I will want to play it.",

Because we've lost some of the greatest, like Mike -- George Michael and others during the holiday season. And so, it's these young kids who are trying to get these reactions from their parents. And with Angela Bassett's son, Slater, who is 16 years old -- his joke went, obviously, incredibly badly and obviously really struck a nerve for his mother who, like we just said, lost Chadwick Boseman, her \"Black Panther\" co-star, a few years ago to cancer. Now, her son, Slater, took to social media to post an apology. Here is a little bit of that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) S. VANCE:  I apologize to Michael B. Jordan's entire family, his extended family, and him directly, as he is an idol of mine, and taking part in a trend in like this is completely disrespectful.
