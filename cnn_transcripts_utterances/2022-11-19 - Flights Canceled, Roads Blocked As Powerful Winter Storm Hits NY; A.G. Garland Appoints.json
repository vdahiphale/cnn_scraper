And yes, it's just to the north of Buffalo, just to the north of Watertown, but we also have other areas that are getting hit hard right now because of that wind shift. So again, we're getting a little bit of a break, but it is going to come back down into Buffalo, come back down into Watertown. We anticipate that later this evening right after dinnertime and will continue through the overnight hours, and it's going to look a lot like this.Now this video was taken yesterday in Buffalo, you can see it's not snowing where the camera itself is located, but just about a mile or two off in the distance. That snow is coming down in blankets. And as we mentioned, two three even as high as five inches an hour at times in the last 24 to 36 hours. Yesterday Buffalo topped out at just about 14 inches. That was a daily record for the city. But if you go just a few miles away in several different directions, you're talking Natural Bridge, getting to almost six feet of snow. Orchard Park, Blasdell, Hamburg, all topping out at over 60 inches of snow. For those of you who don't know where those locations are on a map? You can see a lot of it focuses on that northern Watertown region. Also, around Buffalo stretching down through Erie, Pennsylvania. Those were really the target points for the last couple of days here in terms of the snow and they're the same areas that are going to continue to see snow in the next 24 to 48 hours. But also, areas along other lakes it's not just like Erie or Lake Ontario you also have Lake Superior, Lake Michigan they're also going to be experiencing some lake effect snow as we go through the day on Sunday. In all, you're looking at most areas picking up at least an extra half a foot up to about 12 inches. But again, one key thing to note Martin and Amara, some of these areas could still pick up an extra two feet on top of the four to six feet that has already fallen.",

Instead, when it is triggered this unusual appointment of a special counsel, Jack Smith is being brought in to oversee two investigations. And but this appointment by the by Merrick Garland, the Attorney General makes clear, Amara and Martin is that not only is Donald Trump under investigation for these classified documents retrieved by the FBI, in that very unusual, very, very historic, frankly, search of Mar-a-Lago back in August, but he's also front and center of this investigation, looking into the effort to impede the transfer of power.

And Ticketmaster does that on their platform. And, you know, their platform is sort of a combination, a toxic cocktail of preventing fans from getting tickets on the resale markets, of offering up Ticketmaster ticketing services first before any other competitors. But, generally, there's very little incentive for monopolies to really innovate and to provide high quality of service. But I do think that it is very symptomatic of what we've seen now for 12 years, which is Ticketmaster, going to all lengths to lock music fans, and frankly, artists because their monopoly extends all the way up to the artists level into this massive system, where they have incredible market power and ticketing north of 80 percent. They have incredible market power and concert promotion north of 60 percent and have really engaged in practices for years that restrict the resale market that threaten and harass the independent promoters and venues.
