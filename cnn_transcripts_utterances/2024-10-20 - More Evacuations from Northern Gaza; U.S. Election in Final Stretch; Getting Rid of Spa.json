      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to our viewers watching around the world. I'm Anna Coren, live from Hong Kong.Ahead on CNN Newsroom, Israel is ramping up attacks in Northern Gaza, causing another 20,000 Palestinians to leave the area. That's according to the United Nations. 16 days until election day in the U.S., and though millions have already voted, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are making their last minute pitches to voters in battleground states. And though space may appear infinite, part of it is being crowded with so called space junk. How one company aims to clear it away. We begin with a message Israel is trying to send to the people in Gaza with a newly released video of their slain Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar. Israel's military says this footage shows him and his family hiding in tunnels in Gaza just hours before last year's October 7th massacre in Israel. According to the IDF, the video proves Sinwar valued his own well being over that of the people in Gaza, which Hamas calls a blatant lie. Meanwhile Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Saturday's drone attack on his home was a bitter mistake. He's blaming what he calls Iranian agents for the attack, which did not cause any casualties. Tehran is denying any direct role and says Hezbollah was behind the operation. The militant group has not claimed responsibility. In the U.S., an investigation is underway into the leak of highly classified intelligence about Israel's plans to retaliate against Iran. Well, that's from sources familiar with the matter after classified documents were posted on social media in recent days. They contain information about Israel's Air Force drills and plans to move its munitions. In Gaza, about a dozen people have been killed in three separate strikes and shelling in different parts of the enclave, according to Gaza officials. The Israeli military confirms ongoing operations in several parts of Gaza, with the most intense appearing to be in the north. The U.N. says another 20,000 Palestinians have been forced to flee Northern Gaza as the fighting intensifies. Well, Nada Bashir is following those developments and joins us now from London. Nada, we are getting a high death toll, reports of a high death toll overnight in Gaza. Tell us what you are learning.",

I mean, we know that an attack is imminent, but what has specifically been disclosed? BASHIRAnd now, of course this leaked document has been released, according to three sources familiar with the matter, one source confirming to CNN the authenticity of this document, which appears to detail the plans or reported preparations of the Israeli military in preparation for this attack on Iran. This has been described as deeply concerning by U.S. officials, as you mentioned, an investigation, of course, ongoing to figure out the source of this leak. But, essentially, this leak, this document was released circulating online on Friday, dated October 15th, October 16th, it began circulating, of course, after being posted on Telegram where it gained a lot of attention there. It is marked top secret, only meant to be seen by the U.S.'s key allies and of course, this has been described as detailing those clear preparations. Now, CNN is not quoting the preparations outlined in this document. We are not showing these documents, but, essentially, one of those documents shows plans to move munitions around in preparation for this attack. Another details Air Force preparations, in preparation for this potential attack. Again, this is being looked into by U. S authorities and officials who are carrying out an investigation. This would essentially trigger an FBI investigation, although the FBI has not yet commented on this. But, of course, this is concerning for the U.S. and potentially, of course, for the Israeli military as they continue to look into preparations for this attack. And, again, still questions as to what this might look like as the U.S. continues to pressure Israel to be measured in its response.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LLOYD AUSTIN, U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY:  The numbers of casualties have been, civilian casualties have been far too high.

In order for this to be significant, it needs to be impactful. If it is not impactful, then why bother retaliate? If it does have an impact on Iran's military targets, then the Iranians will feel compelled to retaliate. If that happens, then Israel may decide to strike Iran's oil industry, oil facilities, oil terminals, oil ports and so on. If that happens -- and we're talking about a few weeks. We're not talking about a hypothetical or simulation game here. If that happens, then the Iranians may conceivably attack the Arab Gulfs, the Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, their oil industry. That pulls the U.S., right?

The agency's Euclid Space Mission unveiled this week at the International Astronautical Congress in Milan, Italy. The grand mosaic shows about a hundred million stars and galaxies from just a slice of the sky. The mission aims to create the largest 3D cosmic map ever made by observing billions of galaxies.Well, this piece was captured over two weeks earlier this year. It's just 1 percent of the full map scientists expect to create in six years. While space is vast, it's getting a little crowded around Earth. Millions of satellite pieces and other debris are racing around our home world. But as Anna Stewart tells us, one company is creating an innovative vehicle to clean up the space junk. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  170 million pieces of space junk flying around the Earth at speeds nearly seven times faster than a bullet, some as small as bits of paint, others, parts of once working satellites, now dead.",

And the more debris, the higher the risk to other objects in orbit.But an Italian firm called D-Orbit hopes to decrease this risk in overcrowding with a vehicle specially made for relocations, cleanup and repairs, the GEO. LUCA ROSSETTINI, CEO, D-ORBIT:  Once you collect the space debris in the future, instead of wasting this debris, this raw material, you can bring them into a recycling station in orbit in order to produce raw material that is going to be used in orbital manufacturing facilities to create bigger values.",

This vehicle can also guide items toward Earth so they can burn as they enter the atmosphere.If GEO works, there will be fewer dead satellites flying aimlessly around the Earth and a more sustainable way to reduce and recycle them, making way for a safer, less crowded space and more room to explore the universe.
