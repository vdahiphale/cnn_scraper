Russia's invasion of Ukraine has raised international tensions sky high. And yet, when you sit back and examine it carefully, the country that looks most capable of navigating these murky waters is the United States of America.As an essay in the \"Harvard Business Review\" puts it, the current reality of the U.S. economy is that highly profitable firms are employing a record number of workers and paying them rising wages. Americans' household wealth has skyrocketed because of COVID relief. American banks are sturdy thanks to post 2008 reforms. Companies are still posting strong earnings. America has abundant energy. And thanks to the dollar, the American government can run up debts with greater ease than any other country in the world. Meanwhile, Europe faces a dire energy crisis, which will take years to fix. China is struggling to get out of its Zero COVID strategy. Russia has been isolated from global, economic and technological flows. Developing countries face the double whammy of high energy prices and a strong dollar in which a significant chunk of their debt is denominated. America has lots of problems, but if I had to have one hand to play, this remains the best. I've wondered as to why America continues to surprise on the upside. Behind the economic data, there does seem to be in America a spirit of innovation that is unusual and powerful. A recent book that is not directly about this subject at all has helped me crystallize some my own thoughts on this subject. CNN's senior political analyst Ron Brownstein's brilliant history of American pop culture in the mid- 1970s \"Rock Me on the Water.\" Brownstein begins by describing American popular culture in the early and mid-1960s, particularly the movies and television shows as bland, apolitical and lifeless. Hollywood was addicted to World War II movies, Westerns, musicals, and above all gargantuan historic epics like \"The Ten Commandments.\" Television right up to the late 1960s was dominated by what was considered wholesome fare like \"Gun Smoke,\" \"Bonanza,\" \"Where's Lucy?\" and \"The Wonderful World of Disney.\" The rising tide of baby boomers were tuning it out. Weekly admissions at movie theaters fell by over 50 percent from 1950 to 1960. Then came rebellion and revolution in the form of sharp brakes with this conformist culture. First in music, then in movies, and finally in the broadest of all platforms, television shows. By the mid '70s, rock music reigned supreme. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "And the top television show in America was the funny but intensely political and politically incorrect, \"All in the Family.\"This break with the past struck me as deeply American. Young people rejected the wisdom of their elders, dispense with tradition, and forge their own way, making new music, movies and television. They were disrespectful and disruptive, consumed with a kind of manic energy. But that energy created a new popular culture that remade America and the world. It's difficult to imagine that kind of attack on hierarchy and tradition coming out of other more settled societies. It sounds exciting in retrospect, but Brownstein reminds us of how jarring the break was to many, perhaps most Americans. It came along with a disruptive, disrespectful politics that was often more than just angry, it was violent and messy. Those were the years of political assassinations, riots, the black power movement, the Black Panthers, and the Symbionese Liberation Army, the group that kidnapped Patty Hearst and engaged in what was back then the largest police firefight that had ever occurred on American soil. The new left activism of Tom Hayden and Jane Fonda was a wholesale attack on both political parties and the entire American political system. The rebellion didn't last long, and there was a backlash to it. Politicians like Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan rode to power, denouncing the radical youth culture of the time. And yet that culture has proved deeply influential and lasting. In his biography of Steve Jobs, Walter Isaacson ties the entrepreneurial spirit of Silicon Valley in the 1970s to the same spirit of youth rebellion. I do wonder whether American culture today still retains the elements that made it so disruptive in the 1970s. Today feels more bourgeoise, and where there is anger, often on the populous stripe, it's the kind of nostalgic rage that fueled Nixon and Reagan, a surge to take America back, not forward. Still, one has to marvel at America in the 1970s, the world's richest and most powerful country that somehow retained the capacity for massive restlessness, dissent, and radical change. Somewhere in there is the country's secret sauce for success. And let's get started. 2022 has been another stunning trip around the sun. One for the record books maybe. As many around the world started venturing out after hunkering down at home for COVID-19, Russia invaded Ukraine. Oil prices spiked. Growth slowed. Inflation accelerated. Roe was overturned. Two British prime ministers resigned, and their nation faces a long recession. The Queen died. The FBI searched Donald Trump's residence. Protests rocked Iran. Xi Jinping grabbed more power, only to have China hit by protests as well. After which Beijing loosened its Zero COVID policy. The big red wave in American politics, well, it wasn't. North Korea launched missiles on more than 30 days this year. And we still have two weeks left to go. Joining me now to make sense of it all are Zanny Minton Beddoes, the editor-in-chief of \"The Economist,\" and Ian Bremmer, the president of Eurasia Group, a global risk consultancy. Zanny, let me start with you. \"The Economist\" has this extraordinary trio of interviews, including with the head of Ukraine's army, General Zaluzhny, who has been a very hard to get interview, so kudos on that, and what he says, and this is what I want to get at, is the war in Ukraine is at a pivotal moment. He thinks in the next few months, maybe the next several weeks, we will figure out whether or not the Ukrainians are going to be able to really break through or get bogged down. Give me a better sense of where you think Ukraine's elites think the war is headed.",

And then of course the impact on global energy, on global food, on global fertilizer that really makes you much more despondent about the near-term implications for the developing world, the poorest in the world.

I mean I think what we've seen, and I completely agree with Ian, is a huge geopolitical shock, a huge energy shock and a huge macroeconomic shock this year all happening at the same time.The geopolitical shock is, you know, I think the biggest clearly in our lifetime. It's an absolute, you know, attack on the post-war order. This Russian invasion of Ukraine. At the same time, and I'm sure we'll come on to this, you also had a further estrangement and decoupling between the U.S. and China, which is the sort of bigger, longer term strategic rivalry. Those two geopolitical shocks caused a massive energy shock. And I think it's sort of easy to underestimate quite how profound the transformation is that's going on. You know, Europe was Russia's biggest customer for its gas, and Europe is wholesale changing its energy system at warp speed. And what's that done not only has it, as Ian said, caused the commodity price spike that has, you know, caused terrible suffering in the developing world, it's also fueled the inflationary shock. And we've seen, you know, we've seen the highest inflation rates since the 1980s, it's caused a complete transformation in the macroeconomic environment. And so all those three things together I think mean that this has been -- really we often trade in hyperbole as journalists, you know, you always think the latest crisis is the most dramatic one ever. But I really think that I have never, in my career, seen a geopolitical shock, an energy shock, and a macroeconomic shock coming together in the way that they have this year.",

I think you've articulated very well exactly what the U.S. is trying to do, which is to have a sort of surgical decoupling of certain areas to slow China down, particularly in these high tech areas. I think it's also worth pointing out that that's really only one part of the broader U.S. economic -- geoeconomic strategy if you want. The other part is a huge industrial policy at home.One of the other big things we've seen this year is the enormous amount of money that the U.S. has spent on various things from the CHIPS Act to the, you know, poorly named Inflation Reduction Act, which is a huge bunch of subsidies into accelerating the climate transition to the infrastructure bill. Collectively, that's massive industrial policy. I mean, the U.S. now spends more industrial policy that famously (INAUDIBLE) France. And it's done it in a way which is particularly focused on attracting investment into it and focusing on things made in America. So it's quite a protectionist strategy. And the reason I raised that is because that is simultaneously causing some tensions with allies, particularly in Europe. And I think, you know, it's going to be quite a balancing act. The logic of this is both to boost industrialization at home and try and slow China down. But, you know, I'm a good free market liberal. I worry about industrial policy. I worry about export controls. I worry that all of this is hard to pull off in the kind of surgical, planned manner that the Biden administration is trying to do.",

Now what you're seeing is the Zero COVID policy is being dismantled almost too hastily.They are making overtures to industry.

He got his power. He had no intention of moving away from it. The people decided they were going to demonstrate. And then suddenly he backed off. And he didn't just back off, he ripped off the band-aid. He said fine,everyone can get COVID, we're not going to test anymore. That app that was tracking you, gone. You just don't see that from the Chinese dictator. Right? And so it's very startling, and I think a lot of investors around the world that have thought that they know at least the limits on where China can go in any given day are going to be deeply discomforted, very unsettled by what they've seen over the course of the past few weeks.",
