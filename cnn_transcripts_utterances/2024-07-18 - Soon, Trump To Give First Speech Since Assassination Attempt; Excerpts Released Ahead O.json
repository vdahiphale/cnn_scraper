Dana Bash, we have from these excerpts, and Chris Wallace and Kasie Hunt are with me here too as well, Donald Trump saying that the discord and division in our society must be healed. As Americans, we are bound together by a single fate and a shared destiny. We rise together or we fall apart. I am running to be president for all of America, not half of America, because there is no victory in winning for half of America.This is, at least according to these excerpts, quite different from what we're used to hearing from Donald Trump.

The other thing that is clearly going to be the emotional highlight of this speech is the president says that people have been asking about the shooting and what he went through. And he said, so I'm going to tell you, we don't get the details, that's not in the excerpts, but he says, I'm going to tell you, and I'm never going to say this again, because it's too painful. So, my guess is that's going to be the emotional highlight of the speech. And we're told he's going to carry out the fire jacket and the fire helmet of a volunteer fireman who was killed on Saturday. So, that'll be a very powerful part of this speech.

They personally -- several people personally appealed to her, and she had no interest in doing so. Of course, a lot has changed since 2016. Donald Trump was convicted in New York in the hush money case, something that became a real point of division between he and the first lady when that story broke when they were in the White House.
