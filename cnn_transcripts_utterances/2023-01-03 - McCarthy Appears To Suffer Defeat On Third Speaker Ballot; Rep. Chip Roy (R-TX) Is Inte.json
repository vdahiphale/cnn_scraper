      "sentences": "Welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper.For the first time since 1923, that is 100 years, the vote for House speaker has gone to multiple ballots, leaving Republican leader Kevin McCarthy without enough votes to secure his dream job, at least as of the third ballot, which ended a few minutes ago. How long will rebellious Republicans drag out the votes or end up with a new candidate? Let's bring in one of the now 20 rebellious Republicans, Congressman Chip Roy of Texas, a member of the House Freedom Caucus nominated Congressman Jim Jordan for the speakership on the third ballot. Congressman Roy, thanks for joining us. You have been pretty vocal about your opposition to McCarthy to be speaker. You nominated Jim Jordan this third round. You voted for Byron Donalds on the first run. You do seem a little different from some of your other rebels, though, and that you seem actually focused on a set of principles and rule changes that you want to see enacted as opposed to having a personal animus against Kevin McCarthy. Do you agree with that assessment or no? REP. CHIP ROY (R-TX): Yes, first of all, thanks for having me on. I think that's pretty close to correct. I would take some issue with saying that I've been in constant opposition to McCarthy as much as trying to offer changes that I think are paramount to make the House work again. That is, by the way, bipartisan criticism. We haven't had an amendment offered an open debate on the floor of the House since May of 2016. We cannot keep spending money we don't have. We cannot continue to allow our border to be wide open, endangering Americans and immigrants. We cannot keep business as usual going, it's failing the country. And everybody agrees, frankly, both sides of the aisle. So, I've got differences of opinion with colleagues across both sides of the aisle. But the one thing we need to do is change. We need the leadership and the tools to stop the swamp from running over and stepping all over the American people who want change in this town. So that's what I've been pushing for. There's still some things that might change that I could get there. But right now I'm holding the line because I think we need this place to operate differently. And that's not a partisan statement. It's just something that I believe.",

You want an open amendment process. What else would you want to see happen in order for you to get to yes for Kevin McCarthy or whoever -- well, let's just say Kevin McCarthy.",

Without debating the merits of any particular substance in the bill, we can't keep doing that. It was a 10percent increase in defense, a 6percent increase in non-defense discretionary, 45 billion for Ukraine, 41 billion for emergency spending. None of that extra spending was paid for. So, when are we going to stop that? So, we can't stop that if we don't have the tools in the Rules Committee to stop it. I'd love to have open debate. I'd love to have more amendments. The 72 hours rule you were just talking about, that's all good stuff. But I got to take issue with one thing that Jamie (ph) talked about just a minute ago, which she was still on, because I don't want to talk about her in the third person, but she said that were asking for things for personal handouts, spots on committees.",

I hope what will happen is that we will demonstrate that we're all convicted, that we need a different approach, and then maybe we'll have an adjournment and then go step aside and let's go talk about it. That's the way things ought to operate.I've been having conversations with friends on both sides of the aisle about if we do a fourth round, do we then break and adjourn and then go have a discussion? You've been studying the history, you and I were talking about it offline. I've looked at the history. This isn't actually new. It has been 100 years. But you know what's important about that, Jake? It has -- it's been 100 years because the two party system is so entrenched in this town that we don't actually -- we're not able to actually use our power as a single member of Congress to go to the House floor and have debate. I opened my speech a minute ago saying, so this is what a full chamber looks like in debate, right, because we never do that anymore. And I think that's what needs to change.

Now, you're a very hard line conservative, is that something you would be willing to do in the majority?

I've done a couple of others that, did a bill with Hakeem Jeffries, believe it or not. And so, I'm always happy to have that conversation, but I'm always going to start with principle, right?Are we increasing spending? Are we going to be passing more laws that I think constrict freedom and powering bureaucrats down in Washington? And I don't want to do that. I think that, you know, to your point, there is a path for us to be able to sit down. But it begins and ends for me with being able to say no to the powers that be in this town, deciding everything for us. Take Ukraine, for example. Why didn't we just have a separate vote on Ukraine? I support supporting Ukraine, but I want to actually have accountability, know it's paid for, know where it's going, and I want it to be separate from the $1.7 trillion monster spending bill. We should do that. That's the way it's supposed to work from the old school -- you know, Schoolhouse Rocks video. We're supposed to get down, debate it, let's vote on Ukraine, then let's vote on emergency spending, then let's vote on appropriations bills for defense, then let's vote on some other spending. And, oh, by the way, how about we pay for it? Crazy idea. And I think we should put everything on the table, roller sleeves up and do that.",

And some of them, at least in the views of some of your fellow conservatives, like Jonah Goldberg right to my left here are just nihilists and maybe individuals who seem more interested in social media or Fox News clicks than actual governance. Again, I'm not talking about you.And in fact, one of the reasons, as you know, that the $1.7 trillion massive omnibus spending bill passed and why so many Republicans in the Senate were willing to vote for that is because they were afraid that House Republicans are unable to govern, which is something that, I don't know if I were Mitch McConnell right now, that you guys have changed anyone's mind today on that.",

However, that would take the requirement of 218 votes. In other words, they would need help from Democrats.And sources tell us that Democrats are undecided about how they will proceed. They are actively discussing what they would do. Now, they have said previously that they're not going to lift a finger to help Kevin McCarthy. But in this case, Anderson, Kevin McCarthy wants to keep voting. He doesn't want to make a motion to adjourn that's because he's worried that then his critics could really start to mount a challenge. He thinks it's in his best interest to keep voting and really wear his opponents down. So we'll see what Democrats decide to do.

So he -- by doing that, was thinking about the speakership and thinking he needed Donald Trump's support to get there.But what that opened up was a wave of primaries that Donald Trump weighed into that ended up actually costing Republicans winnable seats, running people like Joe Kent against Jamie Herrera Beutler and elsewhere. He is the overarching figure in this chaos that we're seeing here. I was there in 2015, were there in 2016, there's always a few people who vote against whoever the speaker is, whether it was Boehner, Paul Ryan or whoever.

Many of them were my friends today, which is, guys, what's the plan here? If not Kevin, then who? And every time they give me a name, Jim Jordan's name has come up. They nominated Jim Jordan. Jim Jordan can't get elected speaker. Keep in mind, any group of five or six effectively have a veto power right now, so it's almost going to have to be unanimous. And as much as I'd like Jim Jordan, Jim and I worked together for six years, we started the Freedom Caucus together, I'm a huge Jim Jordan fan, but you're telling me there's not five or six moderate Republicans who wouldn't accept Jim Jordan as speaker and wouldn't, I think, more importantly, empower the right wing of the party and reward them for this behavior? No, I just don't see that happening. I think it's either Kevin or somebody that we don't even know about who's more to the center of my party or a compromised person who's a Democrat. I just don't see how these folks who are MAGA Republicans, again, it's not the Freedom Caucus, folks, the majority of the Freedom Caucus voted for Kevin McCarthy today every single time, on every single vote, the majority of the caucus. That's not a Freedom Caucus thing versus Kevin McCarthy, it's a group of people who happen to be in the Freedom Caucus and I just don't see how anybody that they would find acceptable has the votes to get speaker.

But much of what he's asked for, Kevin has already offered him. A lot of the things he's complaining about, for example, the way the $1.7 trillion omnibus was handled was handled by Nancy Pelosi. Some of the things he's asking for, Kevin's not in a position to give. For example, they want specific people on committees. That's not how the Republican caucus works. The speaker doesn't populate the committees. The members vote on who goes on the committees, and they're asking Kevin to give them something he can't give them. I think I wasn't in the meeting today during the House Republican Conference meeting before the vote, but I understand that Kevin got up and said, what more do you want? And the answer was, essentially, we just don't want you. So I don't think this is about policy. In fact, I know it's not about policy. I don't think it's about practice. When we voted against John Boehner, we did it because he was trying to marginalize, in our opinion, the conservatives. Kevin McCarthy wants to make Jim Jordan the committee -- the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. This is something we would never have dreamed of under John Boehner. So I don't think it's practical. I don't think it's policy. I just think it's a combination of they don't like Kevin and they like the attention. And that's a really bad way to run a speaker race.",

If Kevin McCarthy loses, it's a mark against Donald Trump. Yet another mark against Donald Trump. He'll be perceived as being even weaker than he was coming out of the midterms. So, the other person who stands to lose here, because he is invested in Kevin is Donald Trump. I got to think that Trump knows that, and he's going to be working behind the scenes.

I'm wondering if you are in a place where you're starting to think there should be a different candidate. Not Jim Jordan, not Kevin McCarthy, somebody that the entire or at least 218 of you can coalesce around. REP. PETE SESSIONS (R-TX): Well, I think that's a conversation that's taking place about how do we get out of the mess? I think, how do we get out of this is a question that comes about as a result of a desire that the 20 people --19, 20 people have who are solid in their beliefs that they would want something, that they could count on, something that they cannot just take back home, but know that the American people will have a solid understanding that they will achieve the things that are important to our party, but also these 19 people.

And some of the questions are why won't these rebels take yes for answer? It doesn't sound like that's what you think? It sounds like you think they need more and they should get more. SESSIONS: Well, I think that, you know, peeling back the onion, you see that there's much more behind that. And I think the problem is agreement about what the agenda will be. A question about as a Texan, we are concerned, I voted for Kevin, would be for Kevin, we need a speaker, we need to get on with the majority.
