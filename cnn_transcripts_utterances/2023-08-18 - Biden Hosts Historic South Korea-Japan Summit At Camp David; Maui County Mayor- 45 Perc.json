They want to discuss economic prosperity as well as technological advancements. And John it is the site of this summit that is also of significance and really underscores how important this is. This is going to happen at Camp David, a site of historical diplomatic negotiations and the first time that President Biden is convening foreign leaders at Camp David for these talks.Now, when we get into the details of this, this would include according to senior administration officials, talks about annual military exercises, discussing intelligence sharing agreements, setting up a three-way hotline for the three to stay in close touch and coordination, as well as formalizing this summit to be an annual trilateral summit. Now President Biden has tried to foster these individual relationships with these countries. But this is an opportunity for the three to get together to put their fraught history aside and to talk about their shared interests, especially against the backdrop of those mounting security concerns with North Korea and China. But what it is not John, is that there is no expectation that there would be a formal alliance commitment or a collective defense agreement. So the question coming out of this, then is how much of this can be institutionalized and maintained not only over the course of this administration and in the near term, but also in the long term? But what is clear is that what the point of discussion will be today is their shared interest as they have seen security concerns mount in the Indo Pacific. John?",

All those analogies and models they put forth about this impossible amount of paper to read.First of all, this is not paper. This is the 21st century, since the late 20th century, they've been doing electronic discovery. And there's methods of going through, doing keyword searches. This is not like the days where you have boxes and boxes of paper and they're looking at each individual one. There's also tons and tons of duplicates in there, for example, multiple copies of the same e-mail, which is why you use electronic discovery.
