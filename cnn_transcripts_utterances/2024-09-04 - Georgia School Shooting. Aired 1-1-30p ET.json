      "sentences": "Hey, Brianna and Boris.We just got told by a public information officer here for the Barrow County Sheriff's Office that, in about 15 minutes here, the sheriff, Jud Smith, will be giving statements. He will host a press conference here to hopefully get more details into what happened here. We do know from the sheriff's office that casualties have been reported -- you mentioned at least two -- and that one suspect is in custody, clearly a very scary situation for these students and their parents. Blocks away, we saw vehicles just abandoned by the sides of the road. It was parents getting out of their cars and hiking all the way here to the school, hoping to get more answers, hoping to see their children again. And what we're seeing is a very active scene around me, just tons of police vehicles, fire and rescue. We have seen a helicopter up ahead. We know that the students were gathered at a football field. We saw at one point from a helicopter camera students appearing to be praying, a scary, scary scenario. We have been told also by the school district that the students have been allowed to leave the building and that their parents are notifying them on how to pick them up. The school buses will be up and running. But, as of this moment, we have not personally seen any of the students here leaving the area. We have seen parents crowding around the police vehicles, because, Boris and Brianna, it's not just the high school that's here. There's also a pre-K school over there. There's a middle school and an elementary school just down the road too. So you have here very, very worried parents hoping to reunite with their children as soon as possible.",

Former Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis joins us. Ed, based on what you heard so far, what do you make of the response time between the initial report that there was a shooting around 10:20 a.m. and how quickly officers were mobilized and now have someone in custody?",

I don't know how long it took to actually get on scene, but to get a shooter into custody and to get to the point where you can declare that there's no ongoing shooting danger is a huge benefit and a huge accomplishment on the part of the local authorities. They didn't have time to get outside resources in there. It seems as though the local authorities got there, took care of things immediately. And then the chaos is gone a little bit, and you can start to seal things down, lock them down, do things methodically, as opposed to the chaos that exists when there is a shooter on scene.",

But they will be drilling down into the suspect right now. The key thing is to find out what motivated that person, how he got the guns and the ammunition, whether or not there were any accomplices and also whether or not there's an ongoing threat, from someone else, so a lot of very important work going on right now processing the crime scene. It does appear as though all the victims have been taken care of and removed from the scene, which is the first job. But, after that, you will lock it down and make sure where everything is and it's ready for court presentation.",

It could be a high-capacity shotgun or rifle. But a lot depends on the circumstances. Did someone intervene when the shooting started? Was the suspect taken out by a bystander? Did the police get there and tackle him to the ground? It's hard to infer just based upon the fact there are two dead and four injured. That's six. That's six rounds. It could be a handgun, something as simple as that.",

As he said, there are multiple injuries.But we have learned from a law enforcement source who's been briefed on the latest from the scene that at least two people were killed in this shooting at Apalachee High School. He said there are multiple injuries. They are in the early stages here, and he made this clear. And, unfortunately, we have seen the process of this in so many of these school shootings. He said they are in the process of reuniting students with parents. And that means the very real possibility that you have parents learning the worst imaginable news. At this point in time, it seems that they do not have all students reunited with parents. And so they are very much in the thick of this, what happens immediately after these shootings?",

They were placed in lockdown immediately, but police units were sent there, even in the absence of any report, to make sure that not just they were in lockdown, but if something was spinning up there, that police would be there, if something was on the way there, that police would already be present. So the Barrow County people and their local law enforcement partners move very quickly and spread a wide dragnet in terms of protection in this case from the very beginning.",

As you walk up to the camera, there's three things occurring behind you that you're not aware of. So his hesitance to get into a lot of details is certainly understandable. There's also the process of sort of vetting things through the other partners there. There's a prosecutor, there's the governor's office, the mayor's office, and the federal and state partners. You have to come up with a plan on what is acceptable to put out, and it takes some time to make that happen. But, frankly, as John said, this response has all the hallmarks of a well-prepared, well-organized group of local officials who moved on this very quickly and were able to mitigate the threat before too many people -- I mean, it is sort of expanding the number of people hurt. But, clearly, getting somebody in custody within the hour is really a good indicator.",
