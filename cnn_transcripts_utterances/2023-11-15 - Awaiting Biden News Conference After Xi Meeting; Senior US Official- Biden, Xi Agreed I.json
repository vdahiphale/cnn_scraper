      "sentences": "Good evening. In just a few moments from now, President Biden is expected to talk and take questions from reporters about his summit meeting this afternoon with China's President Xi Jinping. The schedule for the press conference has shifted throughout the evening, but it is now expected to begin very shortly. The two leaders spoke for about four hours today at a mansion just outside San Francisco in conjunction with APEC, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, being held in that city.A senior American official saying the two leaders agreed to take steps to curb fentanyl production and restore communications between their two respective militaries. President Xi, for his part, saying afterwards, quote, \"Planet earth is big enough for the two countries to succeed,\" adding that one country turning its back on the other is not an option. CNN's MJ Lee is at the summit location for us. CNN's David Culver is in San Francisco. He reported from China for three years, including at the height of the pandemic. Also with us, CNN Contributor and Biden Biographer Evan Osnos, former Israeli Ambassador to the United States Michael Oren, and CNN Chief Political Correspondent Dana Bash. So, MJ, what's the White House saying about how the summit went?",

      "sentences": "Well, you know, Anderson, as we wait for President Biden to come out any moment now for this solo press conference, I think it is abundantly clear that when he comes out, he is going to herald this summit as having been a success. It is clear that he is going to point to a few of the deliverables that the administration had laid out leading into the summit, namely, the re-establishment of the military-to-military communications between the two countries, and then this significant announcement on cracking down on fentanyl.But I think in the bigger picture, the president is likely to say that he has achieved sort of the overarching goal of hitting a reset on US- China relations. Both leaders, when we heard them speaking at the top of the summit, making very clear that they agree that, even though these are two countries with serious conflicts and areas of disagreement, that what they do agree on is that the two countries must be able to have diplomacy, that there must be communication between the two countries, so that they can avoid any misunderstanding and really dangerous situations where crises might erupt. So I think we are expected to hear President Biden talking about this in terms of, sort of, the success coming out of this. That's not to say that these conversations did not touch on tough issues, areas of disagreement. But, again, I think it is abundantly clear that in terms of the big picture goal of hitting a reset on US-China relations, President Biden and everyone on down, we are expected to hear say that that goal was achieved and that there's going to be more conversations, that this is just the beginning of more conversations and more diplomacy in the months to come.",

You and I have talked about this in recent months, and that's a huge concern.We spent some time in Sinaloa, with the Mexican Army, as they were trying to bust some of the labs. Interestingly enough, Anderson, after we did that report, Mexico's president said they don't make fentanyl in Mexico and then reached out to President Xi Jinping, asking for help when it comes to the ingredients to make fentanyl, what are known as the precursors. That's the source of it all. And that is within China. And it is really easily accessible. Our investigation showed how you can just log on to WeChat, communicate with some of these folks who are representing some of the precursor productions, and you can place an order and have it shipped really anywhere in the world that you wanted, most of it going to Mexico. And even some of those folks who are working for those production factories will provide a how-to guide in making fentanyl. So this is going to take the Chinese government doing a serious crackdown.

You know, there was a time when it felt as if he was riding high. He had just installed all of his loyalists into the senior ranks of the government.But now, of course, the Chinese economy is struggling, as many people know, but also more broadly, and this is one of the things I sensed on the ground when I was there recently. There's just a real sense of frustration. One of the words people use in Chinese is they feel disheartened, \"jusang.\"It's a big deal. And that's a big change from where it was when he came into office a decade ago. And I think that puts him a little off balance. He came into the room today. You heard him making very clear indications that he wanted this summit to be a success. You know, David, a moment ago, was describing how the positive message in the Chinese media, that's not by accident.

The long-term fact is that they are still arrayed across a whole range of issues on very ops terms. I'll give you just one fascinating little detail from the opening remarks today that Xi Jinping, when he was just framing the meeting, he said that he does not share the view that these two countries are in a competition, which is after all at the core of how the United States sees it.But the Chinese would rather not have a competition. They would rather the United States, frankly, move out of the way, take on a smaller role in the Middle East, in Ukraine, in Taiwan. And that is a core disagreement between these two. And that's not going away. That's what you need now, the infrastructure of things like military-to-military communications to try to manage on a day-to-day basis.",

      "sentences": "Yes, this is just the third solo press conference that the president is taking part in this year. It is certainly rare for reporters covering him regularly to get this kind of open and formal opportunity to ask him questions.One thing that I just wanted to note, just jumping in on what Evan was noting before, just based on our reporting, I think it is clear that US officials would sort of carefully and privately say that the dynamics at play for President Xi back at home, domestically, probably had a lot to do with the interactions that we saw playing out tonight between the two leaders. Of course, US officials are very attuned to the fact that there are serious economic problems that President Xi is facing at home. And our reporting was that in the months of planning that went into this summit, that there was a level of anxiety and a level of concern about how this would look for President Xi as he was visiting the US for just a couple of days. You know, this is not unusual, of course. We are talking about a foreign trip for the leader of China. But US officials involved in the planning of this summit saying that that level of concern and the attention to detail down to where he would sit, what he would see when he looked out the window, that it really was sort of unprecedented. So, again, I think US officials might argue that the dynamics that are at play for President Xi back at home had very much to do with the sort of decision to engage US officials in this way right now. And that maybe US officials sort of took advantage of the opportunity here that was available to them, taking into account the fact that they could make the case to their Chinese counterparts. If you did x, y, and z, it could be to your benefit, particularly on the economic front -- Anderson.",

      "sentences": "Yes, and if they're going to take any action, you can bet they're going to want something in exchange. There's going to have to be something that the US goes forward with. And as Evan pointed out, it's a struggling economy. It is a really tough situation right now.Youth unemployment at an all-time high. You've got a housing market there that's in crisis. And so what President Xi is trying to do in many ways is trying to figure out how he can boost his economy and perhaps relying on American companies and perhaps even wooing them to go back. Many of them, I can tell you, left not only during the pandemic, but in the months after because of Beijing's crackdown on corporations. I mean, the government was going after and raiding offices in Shanghai of American companies. And so now you have, just a couple hours from now, President Xi hosting a Welcome Xi dinner, if you will, and it's being put on my two US-based organizations. They focus on US-China relations and, in part, focusing on bettering business relations. And this is a dinner in which President Xi is hoping to rub elbows with some of these folks and perhaps convince them to come back to China if they've left or expand their reach within China. The issue that these businesses have is, can we trust you, President Xi? Can we trust that the government isn't going to go forward with another crackdown? And can we trust that we can get any profit that we make within China out of China? These are all really complicated situations that, I think, folks are going to be hesitant certainly within the business world where many years they saw a lot of money coming out of China and saw it as a really opportunistic place to be doing business. Now, they're not so sure. So, that dinner, by the way, that's going to be happening tonight, Anderson, is really controversial. US lawmakers are weighing in on this. You have the chairman of the House Select Committee that focuses on the CCP saying that this is an unconscionable dinner because of the price that it will cost for those who want to pay to attend. And that's $40,000 for those wanting a seat at the table with President Xi. So, they're looking into this. They want names.",

And the Israeli government has now, I think, tried to meet the president halfway on those measures, understanding the president is under that type of pressure.But on the crucial, crucial issue of the ceasefire, the president and his administration have not wavered a bit. They understand that the ceasefire means Hamas wins, Hamas gets away with mass murder. And they realize that a ceasefire for Israel is something close to death. I mean, we would not be able to restore internal security or restore our regional deterrence. Iran will internalize that they can hit us with impunity, and the international community will impose a ceasefire. [20:15:16] So I don't know how Israel becomes -- you know, remains habitable after that point. So, there, the president, the Secretary of State, have really stood steadfast. John Kirby getting up every night before the press -- the White House Press Corps and saying that we are against a ceasefire.

Lots of questions about domestic issues, unclear if he's going to get those questions about the economy, about the economy doing better. Even this week, we saw numbers where they matter the most to people. The price of eggs, the price of goods, they are better. The inflation numbers are going down. So, why don't people credit him with that? Those are the messages that if he does give a lengthy press conference that reporters will be able to talk to him about, not just international, not just the raw political, but some of the policies that he's hoping he can get re-elected on.

So, on some level, his presence here is a sign that he is willing to acknowledge the scale of concern. And -- but I think in terms of specifics, look, what he would really like is for the United States to say we're not going to impose further restrictions on high-technology exports to China that would go into advanced chip semiconductors, A.I. He's not going to get that. The United States is, at this point, not backing off from that strategy. That is a major piece of how Biden imagines the future of this relationship.

With regard to when is this going to stop, I think it's going to stop when the -- when Hamas will no longer maintains the capacity to murder and abuse and just do horrific things to the Israelis. And they still think, at least as of this morning, they still thought they could. I guess, the best way for me to say it is that I take a look. The IDF, the Israeli Defense Forces acknowledges they have an obligation to use as much caution as they can in going after their targets. It's not like they're rushing into a hospital, knocking down doors and, you know, pulling people aside and shooting people indiscriminately. But Hamas, as I said, said they plan on attacking Israelis again. And this is a terrible dilemma. So, what do you do? I think that Israel is also taking risk themselves about their folks being killed, one to one going through these hospital rooms, hospital halls.

Look, I made it clear to the Israelis that, to (inaudible) and his war cabinet, that I think the only answer here is a two-state solution. That's real. We've got to get to the point where there is an ability to be able to even talk without worrying about whether or not we're just dealing with -- they're dealing with Hamas is going to engage in the same activities they did over the past, on the 7th. So it is -- but I can't tell, I'm not a fortune teller. I can't tell you how long it's going to last. But I can tell you, I don't think it ends until there's a two-state solution. I made it clear to the Israelis, I think it's a big mistake for them to think they're going to occupy Gaza and maintain Gaza. I don't think that works. And so, I think you're going to see efforts to bring along -- well, I shouldn't go into it anymore because those are things I've been negotiating with Arab countries and others about what the next steps are. But anyway, thank you all very much. Appreciate it.",

And, yes, it wasn't -- there wasn't a huge break through on economics and other issues that have been dividing these two countries who compete with one another for decades, but on the basics, just take -- I mean, fentanyl is one thing he mentioned, Anderson. Just take the fact that now there is communication reopened between the two countries' militaries. That's a big deal because it was blown open thanks to a couple of things, including the fact that China sent a spy balloon floating over America for a long time. So, it's obvious that he's trying to be hopeful but also pretty clear that there is a lot of work to do. And Anderson, if I may, on Israel, it was really striking how much he is staying the course on saying multiple times that Hamas (inaudible) Israel again and they must be destroyed, must be taken off the table. Because if not, they will reconstitute, and they will do exactly what they promised to do, giving no timeline to the end of this war except for when Hamas is fully destroyed. And I thought that was really noteworthy because, obviously, he is facing a huge increasing pressure to call for a ceasefire.

So, there's plenty of people who are missing. It's not clear if all those people are being held hostage.I'm wondering what you make of that number.

And I think, you know, everywhere we go, you are really just seeing signs of how much this conflict is following the president around. When I walk into the White House every day for my job, it is pretty typical to be able to hear protests of some kind that is related to this conflict. It wasn't that long ago that the entrance to the White House had fingerprints, handprints that were supposed to mimic blood stains with words like Genocide Joe. And here in San Francisco, while the president has been here to attend the APEC Summit, just last night, when we were walking around the city of San Francisco, we saw a really sizable rally, protest, pro- Palestinian protest, and many of the signs specifically mentioning President Biden. So, I think this moment here sort of captures and really brings to light how many questions President Biden himself, U.S. officials are getting about this conflict as increasingly people, including in his own administration, are starting to voice serious, serious concerns about Israel's conduct.And Anderson, if I could just note one more very interesting moment that stood out to me and helpful because I was sitting so close to the front row. I was in the second row, the first row of reporters in this press conference. When President Biden was asked about the ongoing hostage negotiations, he said that he was mildly hopeful. He started to talk about a pause that Israel may have agreed to. Then he looked over at Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who was sitting in front of him and made some remark about how perhaps he shouldn't get too much into the detail. And Secretary Blinken shaking his head -- shaking his head no, definitely do not get into too much of the details. I thought it was a really interesting moment that captured just how sensitive these negotiations have been. The president, of course, has been sort of optimistic all along, at least in what he has said in his public remarks, that he will ultimately end up seeing these American hostages and others get out. But these negotiations are ongoing. And you can tell, just from that very interaction, that those talks have been incredibly, incredibly sensitive.",

Talking about China, he said the importance is for us to be blunt with one another, so there's no misunderstanding. That's especially important when it comes to China because Xi Jinping has consolidated so much power at the very top that frankly, the Biden Administration isn't confident that when they go through other channels that they are getting a clear message to him.And so, he said this rather unusual thing. I mean, tonight, he said, \"We talked about the idea that I should be able to pick up the phone and call him, and he should be able to pick up the phone directly and call me. I will take the call.\" I mean that is, if there's a core concept in Biden's diplomacy across decades and across issues, it's the idea of being candid, being clear. Perhaps even a little bit too candid sometimes. MJ was drawing attention to a moment when he almost perhaps said something that they are still working through privately. He was also candid when he talked about what he discussed with Bibi Netanyahu and with the Israeli government, the idea that in his mind there will not be an ultimate solution here until there is a two-state solution. So, he is not shying away from the points of disagreement in any of these crucial issues.

He is in the 18th year of his four-year term. He won't stand for re-election because he knows that Hamas would win on the West Bank as well.And Israelis are saying, well, we are going to have a Palestinian state there. It could turn into Gaza. And it's going to be 20 times worse because it's the longest border Israel has, and put most of Israel not just in rocket range, but in rifle range. So they would have to find a legitimate and stable leadership there that is willing to sign on the dotted line of a peace agreement and actually keep it, and keep it in a peaceful way and convince the Israeli public of that. I think that it's worth -- certainly, it is worth exploring and I would wish the president the best of success with it. It won't be an easy task. People have tried it in the past.
