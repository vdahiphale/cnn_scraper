Security Council draft resolution on Gaza, calling for a temporary ceasefire in Israel's war against Hamas. The U.S. has previously resisted calls for a ceasefire, emphasizing what it claims is Israel's right to defend itself. Alexey Navalny's widow Yulia Navalnaya is vowing to expose Putin's regime, who she says is responsible for her husband's death, and she's encouraging Russians to stand with her in her fight. Ukraine's military says it's monitoring how Russian forces are preparing for their next moves after capturing the front-line town of Avdiivka in the east. And Nick Paton Walsh has more on Ukraine's withdrawal from the town and how the political standoff in Washington may have contributed to this loss. A warning that some images in this report are disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): A sight not seen for a while, a Russian flag going up over Ukraine. But Ukraine's withdrawal announced on Saturday from Avdiivka means more than the loss of a town bitterly fought over since Russia first invaded a decade ago. It is perhaps the first sign a delay in U.S. aid spells death and loss here. These images released of their last defenses rushing into support, under fire from a resurgent Russia who President Zelenskyy says sent seven Russian troops to die for every dead Ukrainian. This is what it was like in the basement, defending down to the last, treating the injured in the darkness, yet aware their options, their ammo, their chances were ebbing, shelling endless. It spoiled my drink, this soldier complains. A commander clear Monday why this happened. We didn't have enough people, he says. We didn't have enough shells. We didn't have enough possibilities to throw them back. Russia's Ministry of Defense released images of their final onslaught on that coke plant and what they claimed were the casualties inflicted on Ukrainians as they tried to flee in the dark. Other images and reports emerged Monday in Ukraine of the fate of their wounded, one of whom called home in his last moments. Allegations that, in the horrifying rubble here, both the wounded were left behind by Ukraine but also shot dead in cold blood by Russian forces. Russian drone images of their spoils released, again displaying their odd pride over the rubble. Zelenskyy may have to get used to more of this. Putting on a brave face as he visited troops in the likely next Russian target, Kupiansk, just outside Kharkiv. Although there are different political sentiments in the world, he said, different flashes of problems that distract attention, we still, all together, do our utmost to have the world with us, with Ukraine. Words no longer enough, not in Avdiivka and certainly not in the West, where $60 billion in missing aid now means Putin can slowly edge further and further west.
