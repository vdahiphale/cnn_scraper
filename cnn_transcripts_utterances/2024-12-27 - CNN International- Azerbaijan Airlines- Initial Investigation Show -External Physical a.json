Just ahead, new developments in that Christmas Day crash of the passenger jet in Kazakhstan, what the carrier is now saying about the cause of the disaster?Then chaotic scenes in South Korea's Parliament as lawmakers voted to impeach the prime minister and acting president, plunging the country into political turmoil. And tornados and storms are threatening holiday travel in the U.S. this weekend, we'll have the latest forecast. Two days after a plane crash in Kazakhstan that killed dozens of people, Azerbaijan Airlines is blaming, quote, external, physical and technical interference. Even before that preliminary finding, questions were mounting over whether Russia was behind the disaster. Authorities have recovered two black box flight recorders at the crash site that could help provide some answers. But a U.S. official told CNN, the signs point to Russian anti-aircraft defenses shooting the plane down, possibly in a case of mistaken identity. The Azerbaijani Press Agency says that the airline is suspending flights from the Capital Baku to seven Russian cities. CNN's Nada Bashir joins me now live in London. Nada, external, physical and technical interference what does that mean?",

The political upheaval continues in South Korea. In a contentious session Friday, the nation's parliament voted to impeach the Acting President Han Duck-Soo, after he refused to appoint new justices to the Constitutional Court.That court will decide the fate of the previous president, Yoon Suk Yeol, who was impeached after imposing martial law. And now South Korea is looking at its third president this month, as the finance minister is now in charge. We know it's not easy to keep up with the twists and turns going on in Seoul, so let's bring in CNN's Hanako Montgomery to help us figure it all out. Hanukkah, you would expect three presidents in a month. You would expect something like this to happen in a -- drama, not real life. What is going on here?",

I mean, this is unprecedented, not only for South Korea, but really for much of the democratic world.Now, there are a number of reasons why the Acting President Han Duck- Soo was voted to be impeached today by the country's parliament, but what really stood out is actually a statement made by the main opposition party leader, give this a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LEE JAE-MYUNG, SOUTH KOREA'S DEMOCRATIC PARTY LEADER: We will remove Yoon Suk Yeol from office, uproot his loyalist forces and fully suppress the insurrection. Until that moment, we will pool all our resources and fulfill our historic responsibility. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Now for some background on the events leading to today's vote. We've seen, of course, that South Korea was plunged into a political crisis on December 3rd, after the president declared martial law.Then, very quickly, soon after less than two weeks, in fact, the parliament voted to impeach the president, and he was stripped of his duties. But in order for this impeachment process, this formal impeachment process, to actually conclude South Korea's Constitutional Court must rule to uphold these decisions. But critically, and this is the problem facing South Korea right now, there aren't enough judges within South Korea's Constitutional Court to actually issue such a ruling. And it's actually the job of the Acting President Han to appoint those three vacant spots. But he hasn't done so, which has led to this political dead lock we're seeing right now in the country. Now looking ahead, looking at South Korea's political future as you describe, next in line to step in as acting president is the country's finance minister. But this political saga is still far from over. In fact, this crisis, this political game of musical chairs, if you will, Isabel is really coming at a critical time for the country, as it's preparing to engage with a new Trump Administration like many other countries around the world. There are serious questions and concerns raised within South Korean politics about how well it can engage in diplomacy and maintain stable U.S. South Korean relations, if its own political leadership isn't stable? And Isabel throughout all of this, the question that still remains to be answered is, when will all this political uncertainty actually end? And frankly, that's anybody's guess, Isabel.",

Storms along the Pacific Coast are bringing strong winds, rain and snow, plus thunderstorms across the south on Saturday could bring damaging winds and even tornadoes.The small twists are right here was spotted near a warehouse south of Houston, Texas, on Thursday. Forecasters are telling people in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama to be on guard. Meteorologist Elisa Raffa joins us live. Elisa, we were just talking yesterday about Dallas. We saw how quickly bad weather there could have major travel impacts. So, when could the severe weather in the south really do a bad number to travel? ELISA RAFFA, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yeah. I mean, we're kind of worried about tomorrow, that severe weather will be more intense, more widespread. Planes will probably have to fly around it, because those thunderstorms will be so tall and capable of so much lightning. Today, we're looking at some minor delays possible from New Orleans and Atlanta up towards Chicago and Cincinnati, where we have some of this rain. The Pacific Northwest continues to be a problem, from Seattle to Portland and San Francisco, where rain, snow, gusty winds, just continues to be ongoing as that atmospheric river really just doesn't stop. Here's a look at that severe risk again today on the lower end, but really ramps up tomorrow, a level three out of five enhanced risk for severe weather. That's where we're looking at severe storms could be widespread and likely then that risk shifts to the Southeast. Look at some bigger cities in the wake. Going into Sunday, Atlanta, Charlotte, could all have some of these problems. But going into tomorrow, we're looking at the threat of damaging winds, large hail and some strong tornadoes possible. We're talking EF2 or greater. These, again, would be very tall thunderstorms. When we're talking about December tornadoes, again, not likely, right? You know, we really only see about 43 on average. They would happen across the Gulf Coast if they do. But on average, it is our lowest month for tornadoes, definitely nothing compared to some of that spring season. But we are way above average already for the year for tornado. So again, pretty active, especially considering that it is December. When you look at the storms that blow up going into tomorrow again, these would be pretty intense. That line of storms capable of the severe weather planes would need to fly around it to get away from the tall thunderstorms and the lightning and that could cause you some problems as we go through the weekend Isabel.",
