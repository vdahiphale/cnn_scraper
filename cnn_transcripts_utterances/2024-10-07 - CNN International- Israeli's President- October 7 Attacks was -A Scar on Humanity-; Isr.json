We're live in Tel Aviv this hour.Plus, Israeli airstrikes hit targets inside Gaza and Lebanon as the conflict in the region shows, no sign of letting up. And CNN takes an emotional journey inside one of the Israeli communities that were stormed by Hamas militants and where some residents are vowing to rebuild. Let's start in the Middle East, exactly one year on from the brutal Hamas terror attacks of October 7th, that shook all of Israel, much of the world, and changed the Middle East. A moment of silence there at the site of the Nova music festival, which suffered a horrific attack one year ago today. In all, more than 1200 people were killed and more than 250 hostages taken captive on a day that the Israeli President says left a scar on humanity. For his part, Israel's Prime Minister urged his country to remain resilient. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But what this means for people? Everyone just flinched just now, because not far away there's an artillery position that sort of firing towards Gaza. There's a huge military presence around here, but also reinforcement around Gaza, in essence, to allow this commemoration to happen so close to Gaza, just a couple of miles away. We know that they've been military operations inside of Gaza over the past couple of days. 25 people killed yesterday when the IDF targeted a mosque there. They said it was a Hamas location. It's clear that the temple was picked up in the past few days. But here, I think what you're seeing is the mood set here for a very solemn and very somber day. And I think it was the images from here, a year ago that really were the first powerful images for people as they were trying to grapple with what was actually happening. Of course, everyone here fleeing for their lives, but those images of rockets flying over the musical music at the festival, everyone in panic, everyone running, trying to get in their vehicles. And gunned down, not just here at the festival site, 340 more than 340 killed but people also chased and gunned down at the nearby Kibbutzim all around the area, hundreds more gunned down there. So, this was kind of the moment when the country, when it got the images from here, began to understand and the world began to understand what was happening.",

Around 90 percent of schools have been damaged, completely out of service.Of course, the schools have become vital shelters as well for many civilians, the vast majority of hospitals in Gaza now completely in operational. We know, of course, that so many in Gaza, the vast majority of 2.2 civilians are now displaced. Their homes completely destroyed. And of course, the humanitarian toll has been so hugely significant. Of course, a huge famine now underway, spreading and advancing across parts of Gaza. Malnutrition a significant concern there. We've seen that ongoing blockade, preventing enough aid from getting in to Gaza, enough food, enough medical supplies, from getting to those most in need. And of course, as you mentioned at the beginning there, Omar, the death toll is staggering. More than 41,000 people killed, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. According to U.N. agencies, more than half of them are women and children. The vast majority, of course, civilians, more than 90,000 people injured. I think what's important to underscore as well is that there are thousands of people who are still missing. Believed to buried underneath the rubble. So, the full extent of the death toll in Gaza is still unclear. And of course, access to the Gaza Strip continues to be limited, not only to humanitarian organizations, but also, of course, the journalists as well. This has been the deadliest conflict for media workers, according to the committee to protect journalists, more than 100 killed just over the last year. So, it is staggering. When you look at the figures, the data, altogether, of the impact and the implications of this war on the Gaza strip over the last year. It is difficult to put into it and to really capture how devastating this has been, and yet hopes for a ceasefire continue to feel way off at this stage. We keep seeing diplomatic efforts stalling and stalling, and as this war now spreads and bleeds over across the region, hopes for a ceasefire feel even further away at this stage.",

So normally, on a Sunday afternoon on the Cornish Sea, you'll see people jogging on bicycles, basically enjoying a day off in the good weather that we have at the moment, though, it's a little cloudy today, but now it's just full of people who are homeless, displaced, trying to get by in a country where resources are so scarce and spaces are limited.

The IDF has issued evacuation orders for parts of Northern Gaza, the Jabalia Refugee Camp -- which is effectively most of Northern Gaza, saying that it is still an active combat zone, telling residents to move south to what it calls the humanitarian zone Al Mawasi, where we've heard residents on the ground being skeptical about that move.We've seen Israeli air strikes on Al Mawasi in the past, some are refusing to leave northern Gaza, and at the same time as that, we're seeing fresh evacuation orders for parts of Southern Gaza, as Israel says it will be carrying out significant military operations. Hamas, for its part, is saying that there has been fierce fighting with Israeli troops. So, a year on, we are seeing still Hamas is a fighting force. According to the Biden Administration, it has been degraded significantly, militarily and politically, and could not carry out an October 7th style attack today. But they are still able to fire rockets out of Gaza as well, which we have seen today. On the anniversary we saw five, excuse me, nine rockets fired from South Gaza this morning, and we know that at least two people were injured as one of those landed just on the outskirts of Tel Aviv. And then also, there were five intercepted from the north of Gaza. And we have been seeing casualties increasing once again in Gaza, for example, on Sunday, there was a mosque in Deir El Balah in Central Gaza that was targeted by the Israeli military. They say Hamas was using it as a command-and-control center. What we have seen is that almost 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in the past year alone with this continual fight between Israel and Hamas. Now, there is no distinction in these numbers from Gaza officials when it comes to militants versus civilians, but certainly the images that our teams on the ground have been sending to us show a lot of women and children in the hospitals Omar.",

And there's an extra played from an upcoming 60 minutes to interview with Vice President Kamala Harris, where she was asked if the U.S. had a close ally in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.And she sort of reframed the question to say, the U.S. and Israel have a close alliance. So, I wonder how you look at the relationship between the United States and Israel right now? And whether you think the nature of that relationship has changed over the last year. EL-GAMAL: That's right. I saw that clip earlier, and I thought it was -- it was very interesting, an interesting reframing of the question by Vice President Harris. And I think it was her way of trying to differentiate between this current Israeli government and the overall relationship, she said, between the American people and the Israeli people. And I think that that's a useful distinction. I think it might give us a window into how her policies might differ slightly from that of President Biden. She was making a point to say that the Israeli U.S. relationship is larger than just one government, and that this -- larger than this Prime Minister of Israel. I mean, it's no secret that the U.S. administration has not been pleased with Prime Minister Netanyahu's choices over the last year. But that said they have actually not done everything that they could do, and of course, that's the main criticism against the Biden Administration, is that they have failed to use the immense leverage that they have with the Israeli government to try to shape its response in ways that could have minimized the damage that's been done. U.S. officials will tell you, of course, that their interventions with Prime Minister Netanyahu over the last year have resulted in some, some changes in policy, but the bar is so low. It's something like the Israelis, and in the beginning, didn't want to let in any food or water or turn on any electricity in Gaza, and then they let in a trickle. I mean, that's the type of things that were -- that we're looking at when the Biden Administration officials say that their interventions have made a difference. But when it comes to the overall trajectory of the conflict, of what's been happening in the last year Omar, you'll remember that one of the very first things that President Biden said to President Netanyahu last October was, don't make the same mistakes that we did after 9/11. Don't squander the goodwill that you have right now by making the wrong choices. And unfortunately, what we've seen over the last year is one wrong choice after the other, bringing the region closer and closer. I mean, I would say it is in full blown conflict right now. We're still waiting to see what the Israeli response will be towards Iran. But right now, the Middle East is on fire. It is burning, and there is no prospect towards anything that I would call peace or security for any of these actors or any of the people in the region one year on.",

I mean, it seems like we're further away now than we were even a month or two after October 7th of last year?EL-GAMAL: Omar, the very short answer is that Prime Minister Netanyahu and on the other side, Sinwar Yahya Sinwar as well, are not interested at this moment in making a deal that they will have to be forced to by outside parties. And so, unless that pressure is brought to bear on the Israelis by the U.S. primarily, and on Yahya Sinwar by Qatar and Egypt, we will not see the parties moving any closer towards a ceasefire. There has to be more pressure put on both parties.",
