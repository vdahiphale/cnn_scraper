I have to say that this meeting has a lot of high-stakes to it even if you don't hear a whole lot of specific deliverables at the end.The leaders of the world's two largest economies have never met as president. They've talked on the phone, partly that was because of COVID, but partly, Kaitlan, that was because of the spiraling relationship spiraling downward between the U.S. and China. And we are at the point right now where the relationship is probably the worst it has been since Nixon did the opening to China in the early 1970s. That's 50 years. So, I think what we're looking for on -- out of this meeting is some understanding of what floor the two of them are willing to put under it, a little bit about Taiwan, in which the president has spoken quite aggressively in recent times, saying that the United States would, in fact, come directly to its defense, different from the way we have dealt with Ukraine, and I think from China some sense that the expansion of their nuclear arsenal is something they're willing to discuss.",

There are a lot of people who believe that, in fact, those two countries do not have a lot in common and really can't bring themselves to form a true alliance.But we had a very senior member of the Pentagon tell us last week that, in fact, he thought the alliance was coming together and that has big implications for our nuclear deterrents, for our operations around the world, for the future of Russia's confidence as it stays in Ukraine or leaves. And it also, Poppy, I think, has a big implication for whether or not the United States has to think about defending itself quite differently if it thinks it's facing a joint Russian and Chinese force. So, that's going to be a big subject along the way. President Biden told me in a question I asked at the press conference last week that he did not believe the Chinese had much respect for Putin.",

You saw what happened around Taiwan after Nancy Pelosi's visit. They're trying to set new facts on the ground and at sea to keep the United States pushed back beyond that first island chain and to make sure that it's China that really rules the Pacific.
