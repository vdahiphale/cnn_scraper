We speak in terms of apprehensions, right? It makes me wonder, well, how many are getting through who aren't apprehended? Is there any estimate as bad as the numbers are that I just shared? Is the reality even worse? I guess that's my question.",

So right now, today, a lot of the people that you see on the video loops you just discussed, those are people that are trying to take advantage of loopholes in the asylum system. But the cartel uses that massive number of people to shape the border every single day. What does that mean? That means overwhelm all the law enforcement so they can create gaps to bring in something else.The United States Border Patrol has documented with evidence over 1.6 million known gotaways just since this administration took over. And they report those through court documents and other things. That's 1.6 that million they know about. But what America needs to understand is the Border Patrol reacts into these huge groups that forces them to leave hundreds and hundreds of miles of border completely wide open. And when the border wall system was terminated, so was the technology that was going in with that, the cameras and the sensor systems. So there's literally no eyes and ears on a significant part of the U.S. border with Mexico and for Canada for that matter, when agents are not out there. And right now agents are not out there. They're busy processing.",

And the thing at the end of the day is there has to be a consequence. There has to be some kind of law and order for laws to mean anything we are constantly working on that. So not all solutions are perfect. Not everybody likes them. But you need to put the judicial process in the right order. People should not get released into the United States until a judge has adjudicated their case. The Remain in Mexico program did that.When this administration came in and they turned over that policy on day one, they created a system or they recreated a system called catch and release. And there's really no enforcement you can do at the border that's going to overwhelm that, because what happens when they meet a Border Patrol agent, the chances of that individual getting released into the United States is very high. Their court date is years down the road, and they're never going to be seen again. That incentive is what is creating this massive wave.",

Of course, here in the United States, the administration just said to a half million Venezuelans who are here, you can stay and work for the next 18 months. I get that there are a lot of American employers who need workers like those who will be provided. But how will that message be received back in Venezuela, when somebody's cousin, sister's, nephew's, brother gets the word, hey, they're allowed now to stay and to work.

I made reference to that peer reviewed story that said 175,000 people apparently their ranks easily replenished, are working for the Mexican drug cartels. 37% of them either get incarcerated or killed within the last decade, and they're able to fill their ranks.

That's a real threat to our next generation and our current generation.

I've been hearing fear mongering about illegal border crossings since, like, 1984, when I started really paying attention. Every year it's supposed to be a disaster, but is it really? Well, let me ask you, Chief. SCOTT: It really is. And again, people think this is a border issue. It's not. Look at your own local community. Look at the fentanyl deaths across the United States. Look at the narcotics deaths. Look at the border itself right now, with the massive chaos that's going on. There are more border crossing related deaths than there have been in many, many, many years. Every one of those deaths, whether it's an American or a migrant, is a travesty. And I think we had solutions in place, but they were bipartisan solutions. The border was getting more and more secure. And by the way, a secure border supports legal immigration. And then we can finally get to have that conversation. But if you can't control who the (inaudible) coming into your home, you can't and have that conversation.",

Gender is a huge consideration here, because, for one thing, the business standard, business attire, which is the former senatorial standard, is actually based on a male pattern of clothing the dark suit, the simple shirt. Women, as you suggest, have about a million micro decisions that they have to make from head toe in order to present themselves in public, and each one of those decisions risks tipping you over somehow into inappropriateness. So it's actually much easier for women to have some sort of dress code. It need not be a formal uniform, but standards that at least restrict the very vast number of problematic decisions.

This is why sports teams and the military wear uniforms.\" And then you go on to say, \"A sea of 100 adults all dressed in some kind of instantly recognizable, respectful manner -- a suit and tie, a skirt and a jacket -- creates a unified visual entity, a group in which individuals have agreed to subsume their differences into an overarching, sartorial whole.\" Talk to me about that.",

And we dress bodies collectively, not just individually. And when we can see similarity among a large group of people who represent something larger than themselves, that enhances the idea of unity, militaries, sports teams, certain school teams, when we look at them, we perceive them as a body.And I always say that fashion is very intimate in that it is the place where the culture touches our bodies, and it's where we integrate ourselves into the larger society. Something like the Senate is not your average workplace. It is an august body still that represents our nation to not only ourselves in the country, but to the world at large. And while I don't believe that it needs to be a strict uniform of exact identical clothing, obviously, I do think we want to enhance the perception for ourselves, for the senators, for the world at large, that this is a collectivity that works together for larger goals than just individuals.",

There are a lot of other people who work in the Senate staffers interns. They still will be required to wear formal business attire. And what that will do is create a disjunction between the senators and the rest of the employees of the Senate, which will, oddly, only exacerbate a kind of class stratification.And since clothes only mean things in relation to other clothes, what we're going to have is potentially a bunch of senators in different states of leisure wear being waited on, served, worked for by a cadre of people in formal wear, which will start looking potentially like livery or waiter, staff garb, because everything is relational, right? I do not think that's an egalitarian message, and I don't think that was the impetus behind the relaxing of codes. There's really no such thing as complete freedom in dress, any more than there is complete freedom in how we speak. It's all in relation to other people's speech, other people's garments.

Now, I'm trying to throw any shade on anybody else. Nick Saban is phenomenal. Kirby Smart is phenomenal. Dabo Swinney is phenomenal. There's an abundance of coaches in college football -- Brian Kelly and various others that are exceptional minds and exceptional football minds who have obviously recruited exceptionally well. And we get all of that. But it's hard to imagine that they could warrant to a 1-11 program like Colorado in a Pac-12, which by the way is on the verge of dissolving, for crying out loud, and do what they have done in their first year. So, it remains to be seen if this is going to continue, but think about the spring game. Georgia is back-to-back national champions, Smerconish. Back-to-back national champions. And when Deion Sanders arrived in Colorado for spring football, it was nationally televised. And more people were interested in him and that program than they were interested in an SEC. program, which is clearly the best conference in college football, with the reigning defending two-time national champions. There was more interest in him and that program than there was in the national champion. That's Prime Time Deion Sanders.
