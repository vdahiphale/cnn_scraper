Well, for the next two days on abortion drug, the medical community has deemed safe and effective for decades will remain fully available to American women and girls. But after that all bets are off. The U.S. Supreme Court was expected to issue a decision Wednesday on the future of the widely used medication, but instead announced it would weigh the case until midnight Friday, local time.Earlier this month, a Trump-appointed federal judge in Texas sided with anti-abortion activists to overturn the drugs approval. The Biden administration wants those restrictions blocked. The case is the biggest abortion-related dispute to reach the Supreme Court since last year, when the justices overturned the landmark Roe versus Wade decision that made abortion legal across the United States.

Now at the center of this case is Mifepristone. It is one of two drugs used in a process called medication abortion which accounts for over half of all abortions conducted in the United States.Several weeks ago, a judge in Texas, though, revoked the FDA's approval of Mifepristone. And now the Supreme Court is mulling what happens to that decision, while this case makes his way through the courts. Now they have several options. One is the Supreme Court could decide that they're just going to take up this case, try to decide it before the term ends in June. They could also allow the case to continue working its way through the appeal system potentially eventually ending up at the Supreme Court. But eventually, this issue does have to be decided on the merits. And right now, it is up to the justices what will happen to this medication in the interim. Will it remain on the market or will they uphold that Texas decision while this case moves forward? We expect at this point, the Supreme Court will have another update. Though it's unclear if it will be a final answer by midnight on Friday. Paula Reid, CNN, Washington.",

What impact, what a decision to ban this drug or restricted have on the lives and safety of most women and girls, do you think? GILBERG-LENZI'd like to also point out that first of all, the fact that only 50 percent of women are getting medication abortions, it's -- that is a very large number. But the reality is that because there have been so many restrictions on how we can provide this medication, this is dispensed directly through a doctor's office only. You cannot get a prescription and go to the pharmacy like any other medication. So, that's actually created another obstacle and barrier. Despite that, you're right, Rosemary, it's servicing a lot of women. And I'd like to point something out here. When people start looking and talking about safety issues, if you look at the atrocious and rising rate of maternal mortality in the United States, so we hit a record high that we have not seen since the year before I was born, the high maternal mortality rate in 1965 has now been exceeded in 2020, and 2021. Over 30 per 100,000. And if you're a black woman, it's almost twice that. So, that death rate or complications related to pregnancy. The death rate related to medication abortions, one to five per one million. It's insane. This is not -- this is not about science. It's very, very dangerous.",

It's going to have a chilling effect on research and development across the board. Because that's exactly the question that the pharmaceutical companies who really fund the vast majority of our research and development of everything from vaccinations to the medications that we use on a daily basis over the counter. They're going to be very rightfully concerned about where they're going to put their money. Because if now, if medicine and science is this politicized, and we know that it has been, what will they -- what will they do? So, it's going to impact not just women who want an abortion, it's going to impact everybody. And I think people really need to understand what is going on here. This is a much, much more slippery slope and much more dangerous position than I think people might have imagined. It's really -- it's insane to me.
