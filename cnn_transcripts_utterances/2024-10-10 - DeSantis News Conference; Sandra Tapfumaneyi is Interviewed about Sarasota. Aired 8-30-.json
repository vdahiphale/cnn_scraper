You had resources gathered there. And you can see how impactful this hurricane was.Something you may also be able to see behind me is that there is a pretty decent amount of traffic for this hour, especially after a storm. We - we were able to look in the immediate neighborhood of Tropicana Park, and it seemed as though, at least in the immediate area, there wasn't much flooding, there wasn't much damage to structures. So, right now, it looks like the roof got the worst of it at Tropicana Park. But, obviously, this is one area of St. Petersburg. It doesn't highlight what's happening across Pinellas County and neighboring Hillsborough County as well. We tried to access an area of Pinellas County earlier today that's been shut off. Sheriff's deputies had closed the bridge leading into an area where we understand that there had been some downed power lines, extensive flooding as well.
