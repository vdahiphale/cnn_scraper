Sources are telling CNN he will be traveling straight from Saudi Arabia, where he urged the leaders there to take an honest look at what Russia is doing to his country.Russia's war in Ukraine was the focus of the group's discussions today. President Biden and other leaders unveiled tough new sanctions against Russia this morning aimed at further restricting goods key to the battlefield. CNN's Marc Stewart is at the G Summit in Japan for us. Marc, this is a significant visit for Zelenskyy. He is going to be -- we know -- asking for more support. What are you hearing there in Japan?",

      "sentences": "Hi, Sara. This is a big deal for so many different reasons. First of all, just the symbolism behind this, this is President Zelenskyy's first visit to Asia since the Russian invasion. And, yes, he will be meeting with leaders at the G7 and, yes, he will have a wish list.But perhaps even more significant is the fact that he will also come in contact with other leaders from other nations, not necessarily G7 member states but world leaders, including those from India, Indonesia, Brazil. As one analyst told me today, it is a rare chance for him to have the face-to-face discussions about exactly what he needs from them to help quell the violence in Ukraine. That could be politically, that could economically and, of course, militarily. And that leads me to the other big headline of the day, sanctions. We saw the G7 agree in force that the Russian war machine really needs to be clobbered. So, a way to do that is through economic sanctions and very targeted sanctions, focusing on things such as construction, such as manufacturing, transportation, business services, all components that can help fund Russia's war efforts. Also expect to see oil price caps, expect to see those in place. Sara, again, President Zelenskyy will be arriving this weekend. He will likely have a wish list of his own, perhaps F-16 military jets, perhaps anti-missile systems, we will see happens, what is said, what is presented in the days and even hours to come.",

Russia becomes part of the G7. And then remember President Putin. they actually held a summit in Russia, in St. Petersburg, of the G7, which was now the G8. And President Putin was hobnobbing with all sorts of leaders. And then in 2014, when they invade and illegally annex Crimea, Russia is kicked out.So, I would have to say, if President Putin were looking at these reports today, there might be a little bit of chagrin, although at this point, he does have other friends. And that would certainly be Xi Jinping of China.",

In fact, they need to do a lot of work to keep equipment, parts, semiconductors from being smuggled in through the United Arab Emirates, through China, and so forth. So, this was the easy part, the sanctions evasion.By the time that you see Zelenskyy show up, though, they're going to be on the much harder issues, and that's going to include what kind of future weapons they need. You've heard this debate about the F-16s. It's going to include the question of where they're going to get the stocks for the kind of anti-missile systems that they need and air defenses that they need. At this point, Ukraine is burning through them, probably at a pace that is sort of ten times our ability to go produce some of these weapons. So, there're going to be a lot harder issues. And then, of course, the biggest one of all, which is how do you get this to some kind of negotiating table situation where you could at least get to an armistice?",

Because right now, we know that Ukraine is preparing for this counteroffensive and Russia is not quite sure how it's going to unfold or even where it will unfold. But I think speed and timing are crucial.I was just in Estonia with a lot of people, with NATO discussing that very issue, that the Ukrainians feel that, yes, they're getting weapons, yes, they're getting military help, but it's coming in piecemeal slowly, or at least more slowly than they would want. And they say, as that continues at that kind of slow pace, people, especially in Ukraine, are dying, and so they do not feel that they can really, let's say, take back the land that they want to take back unless they have as much as they want. And that would include, they would argue, F-16s.",

Because if the United States defaulted, if interest rates soared, if the stock market dropped, that problem isn't going to end on American shores. It's going to affect all of them.But I do think that President Biden was in a real bind here because he knew that if he didn't cut the trip short, he would be lambasted by Republicans for being out of the country and not participating in the negotiation. If he cut it short as he did, he was going to lose the opportunity to be the first American president to go down to the Pacific nations, gather 17 leaders from those nations. [10:10:09] And while those all sound like small countries, they cover a huge amount of ocean and territorial waters that the U.S. needs to maintain access to. And guess who else has been down there? Xi Jinping with a big checkbook and a lot of time spent in that region. And so the president is going to have to do a lot to sort of make up for the fact that he has backed away from this at the last minute.",

In a letter obtained by CNN, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis announced remote work days from most of her staff during the first three weeks of August. She asked judges to refrain from in-person hearings for parts of that month as well. This might suggest that Willis expects the grand jury to unseal indictments during that time period.The Armorer who worked on the Rust movie set is trying to have her involuntary manslaughter charges dismissed. Attorneys for Hannah Gutierrez-Reed filed a motion asking the judge to drop the charges just as they did for Actor Alec Baldwin. Those charges were dropped last month. Gutierrez-Reed claims investigators tampered with the weapon used in the fatal onset shooting of Halyna Hutchins, and it should no longer be used as evidence. So, this morning, there is new hope in the search to find four children who were on board a small plane that crashed in the Amazon in the southern part of Colombia. Rescuers say they've now spotted footprints which could belong to the missing children. It's a little confusing what's taken place here. Yesterday, Colombia's president tweeted that the children were found. So, there was a lot of hope yesterday, but he later deleted that tweet, saying information given to him by the country's child welfare agency had not been confirmed. But now these footprints, hope again. The four have been missing for more than two weeks. Sara?",

That's when two other women, Gwendolyn Schofield and her daughter, Melanie, drive up. Police believe that they were attempting to help Voita when they were shot as well.The gunman then kept walking down the road, firing indiscriminately. Police have just released this incredible body camera footage showing the moment that they arrived on the scene and confronted the teenage gunman. We want to warn you, the video you're about to see is disturbing livestock. CNN's Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller is joining us now. You don't see this every day, but officers are dealing with this at least once a week. I think we're covering the stories at least once a week. When you have somebody out there randomly shooting, that's a little unusual. But you hear this officer, this female officer, trying to get back up and help, and she's down.

And that's because they looked at not only the issues that contributed to the suicides that we saw several of them over the course of a few months last year, but also the bigger picture issue.And one of the key findings here, and we have a graphic we can show you this, is that even if there was no direct correlation or cause between these series of suicides, what led to them was a degradation in the Navy's ability to provide for a quality of life. The Navy failed to provide basic quality of life for sailors, and they acknowledged it was a failure of the Navy to address this earlier. It took a major, what they called a mishap for the Navy to address this. That mishap, three suicides in a week amongst the crew of the USS George Washington, a nuclear aircraft carrier, back in April, and then four suicides within one month in December or right before that at a facility in Norfolk, Virginia. It was those moments and those instances, tragic as they were, that compelled the Navy to address this. So, some of the other findings is that sailors were living in unacceptable living conditions and the Navy failed to provide adequate mental health resources to address this. For the first time, the Navy will create essentially a baseline standard for quality of life, not only first within shipyards, which is where those first series of suicides happened but then across that to aircraft carriers, submarines and then to the wider fleet itself. They acknowledge this will take resources, John, more resources that in and of itself could prove a challenge for the Navy.",
