I'm sure many people remember Sha'Carri Richardson, the sprinter. She has now made the Paris Olympics. But in going to Tokyo, she qualified. And then she had that positive drug test for marijuana. And who told the world about that? The U.S. anti-doping agency. Even though people were so sad because that is a banned substance, but clearly, certainly not performance-enhancing the way that steroids performance-enhancing drugs. And the things we're talking about with the Chinese. And yet the U.S. anti-doping agency made that public. And she could not compete in Tokyo. So, there is a way to be transparent over and over again. The U.S. and other countries, Western countries, Asian countries have been very transparent about if their athletes test positive, they have to kick them out. And yet here we have China with secrecy.
