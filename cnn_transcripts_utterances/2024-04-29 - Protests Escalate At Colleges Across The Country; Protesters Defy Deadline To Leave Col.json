While the university remains defiant on not divesting from Israel, or from any other country, one of the protesters key demands, the Columbia administration says they will move forward on holding a commencement ceremony in mid-May. Across the United States right now, at times, violent protests and the arrests are causing faculty and students to call for various college and university presidents to resign, as classes continue to be disrupted, graduation plans hang in the balance.

But compared to what we saw last week to see here, but very different in than just different kind of protests because this is a fixed location. There are students moving from one location or another, like marching through the campus and now, these officers in small strike teams, if you will, going to see another gentleman there, protests are being pulled away in a in a purple shirt, zip tied, and then they're taken down the streets in another location. We saw a sheriff's school van looking -- that arrived here a little while ago, presumably to take away one of these protesters and the pace that this campus is being cleared out now, is really starting to pick up as the officers are mixed faster and quickly, moving -- taking a lot of these protesters into custody.",

But it also, especially like on the other side of this encampment two, they're just a lot of students who are just looking in taking in what is happening. You should point out today is actually the last day of classes here on the University of Texas campus, and the students gearing up for their semester finals and that sort of thing. So this is kind of a bigger picture if we stepped out of it a little bit to kind of give you a sense of what you're seeing here.

But I will tell you that compared to last week where we solved for 60 people that were arrested there at UT-Austin, this appears to be a much more contemplated effort by authorities rather than just rushing in and doing arrest. What we actually saw with first the local police as well as the campus police move in and then Texas state troopers as well, who essentially are providing force protection for those local office misters has a methodically have gone through this makeshift camp in order to try to take people into custody. Of course, a big question, will they be arrested? Or are they just being detained?

Of course, the Texas state troopers worked for the governor.In this instance, what you're seeing is the concept of mutual aid. That is, you know, the University of Texas Police Department, just over 100 sworn officers to protect multiple campuses there in the Austin area. And so, if there's an incident, they will call upon Austin police. This is happening just blocks from the Texas state capital where state troopers have a detachment there. And so they would be on standby and able to come in and assist. But you have an on-scene commander who will make the ultimate call about when we're going to go in. What is that going to be the ultimate goal here? But at least it seems like they learned a lot compared to last week, where this seems to be more structured. The goal is, again, just based on them in circling this group and then taking them out one by one. They're trying to eliminate this makeshift camp, but you don't see a lot of the confrontation that we saw last week, Jake.",

We're obviously poised to assist if there's any type of violence.But same goes for the Department of Homeland Security and other law enforcement agencies. And the reason I bring that up is because to this question about who is organizing this, who was putting this all together? Again, that is a very fine line for law enforcement to walk when they're trying to determine -- well, who are these people? That's one thing. It's much different to launch some investigation trying to determine where their support is coming from because none of that is inherently illegal in and of itself. It is important to know whether people on campus or students are not particularly if it comes to the disciplinary part on campus. Again, you want to know who you're going to suspend whether these are outside agitators, NYPD, for example, their deputy commissioner recently said that they are seeing what he called outside agitators, quote, professional protesters that go to event after event, sometimes protesting various sides of different issues. So that is certainly a concern of law enforcement from a perspective of keeping an area safe and secure, particularly once they're on locked down but investigating that very difficult.",

The Zionist, the Jews, Israelis were not going anywhere. But repeatedly, this is why student activists on campus have repeatedly targeted the admitted student events on campus, handed out material. It's based on what we see online with Jews being compared to roaches, for Zionists go home, Zionist, not welcome. These are the chants that are getting repeated over and over and over again. An unfortunately, few at our community, our standing up for those Israelis, Zionist and Jews on campus. Multiple people have told me that on a recent town hall meeting with arts and sciences faculty, this is the faculty who teach our undergraduate students, that there was one professor, one professor on the entire call who expressed concern about arise in antisemitism.

I think in the -- in the example of Columbia, perhaps what happened is that they allow the students to have the encampments on campus, which may have been not really in accordance with the university's policies for a longer time. And then when it started to get the situation out of control students were being harassed and so forth. Then they tried to bring it back and its much harder to bring the situation under control once they have allowed it to continue for some time.",
