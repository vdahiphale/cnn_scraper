Just ahead on today's show French PresidentMacron holding a new round of crisis talks this Friday as police brace for a fourth night of nationwide unrest. More than 800 people were arrested last night alone. Amid growing outrage over the death of a teenager at the hands of police, we'll have a live report. Plus, new documents shared exclusively with CNN, suggests Russian Generals Sergey Surovikin was a secret member of the Wagner group. He's not been seen in public for days for speculation that Russian forces are out to kill Wagner head Yevgeny Prigozhin too, the latest from Moscow just ahead. On Wall Street, U.S. stocks are on track for a solidly higher open on this last trading day of the month, the quarter and the first half of the year as well. Europe also in the green important U.S. and European inflation data have just been released too, Eurozone consumer prices easing to their lowest level in 50 months, the second straight month of encouraging numbers. Although core inflation rates continue to push higher, encouraging numbers in the U.S. to the Feds preferred inflation measure the core Price Index easing slightly to 4.6 percent in May on a year over year basis, a lot to get through this hour. Then we begin though with France, where President Macron is calling for calm after three nights of disorder following the fatal police shooting of a teenager. Nearly 900 people were detained overnight and around 250 police officers injured in battles with protesters. At the root of it all is allegations of racism and strong arm tactics by police. A swimming pool being built for next year's Olympics was one of several sites damage and a dozen buses were set on fire in the same Paris suburb. President Emmanuel Macron is in Paris chairing a second emergency meeting with Ministers having left an EU summit early. He said the situation was unacceptable and urges parents to take responsibility for their children. But it's come under fire after pictures emerged of him attending an Elton John concert on Wednesday night as the protests raged. Nic Robertson is just outside Paris. I'm wondering how much difference these sorts of appeals for Macron will make when there's so much anger on the streets.",

So, Max, just to give you an idea of the scale of protestsat the moment. 40,000 police security forces deployed last night at the height of the pension protests 13,000 police deployed. So you get a sense of the scale and magnitude but I'll break it down with other figures for you. According to government officials, more than 500 buildings have been damaged, targeted in attacks. 200 of those have been government buildings, 79 of those have been police station, Security Force bases, 34 town halls, 24 schools. And this gets the point of what President Macron is talking about. He says it is not this violence isn't justified anymore. He says it's not justified to target government buildings in this neighborhood we're in 12 buses and one bus station were torched overnight, another 14 buses in the same area and another bus station towards a lot of other damage out on the streets are Tran destroyed. But the total cost just of those vehicles alone $11.7 million. So you get a sense, OK, writ large across the whole country because that's what we're talking about now in the north. And in Lille and Nanterre in the west, -- for the South West, Marseille in the South, Lyon in the center, all of these towns and others getting caught up in this passionate outbursts of aggression against the authorities.

That strange nervous appeal to Wagner forces to abandon their military uprising has not yet been resolved. But you know these documents that were shown exclusively to CNN by the Dossier obtained by the Dossier Center, which is a Russian investigative group. You know, kind of shed some light on what was previously unknown about the proximity of the relationship between General Surovikin and other Senior Russian Military and intelligence figures. And this mercenary group that staged this uprising, and implies an overly close relationship between certain individuals and the mercenary group. It's relevant, because the mercenaries were basically allowed to take over an entire Russian city with virtually a shot not being fired, without shot being fired. And so there are lots of questions being asked in Russia right now about divided loyalties and about whether or not was done by the security services to protect Russian Military facilities from this uprising. And so, you know, the fact that there's a list of 30 people with VIP Wagner membership, who are also in the security services, the military and the intelligence services that may be relevant.",

Roberts writing, the student must be treated based on his or her experiences as an individual, not on the basis of race. Many universities have for too long done just the opposite. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the first woman of color on the Supreme Court issued a fiery dissent, accusing the conservative majority of employing an unjustified exercise of power. That will only serve to highlight the courts own impotence in the face of an America whose cries for equality resound. The two cases were brought by the group of students for fair admissions led by activist Edward Blum, who has fought for nearly a decade to eradicate affirmative action. The case against Harvard was brought on behalf of Asian students arguing they were disadvantaged because Harvard prioritized other minorities and ranked them lower for personality traits.

But then again, Swedish officials constantly say that this is they're not condoning this. They don't agree with this. They've condemned this act. But they say this is what their country is about. This is democracy and it's protected by the country's constitution, freedom of speech, freedom of expression, assembly, all protected by the Constitution. But on the other hand, you've got Arab and Muslim states who are saying they've had enough of this, that these continuous attacks that they have seen, they say against their religion against their holy book, taking place in Sweden, they say under the pretext of freedom of expression, are essentially Islamophobia hate speech, and this should not be allowed to continue. And we have seen over the past 48 hours, so not only in our governments across the Middle East, condemning what has happened. They are also summoning ambassadors and you're seeing obviously, a more radical sort of reaction in Iraq. This is the country from which the man who burned the Quran comes from he's an Iraqi refugee. And there we are seeing these protests. As you mentioned, dozens of protesters did pour into the compound of the Swedish Embassy in Baghdad. There was no violence the Swedish Foreign Ministry said that their staff were safe. But you can clearly see that people were angry, they were outraged by what happened. And today we are seeing more protests. These were all called for by the influential, powerful Shia cleric Muqtada al-Sadr who can really, he can get his supporters out on mass on the streets.

It's the case, especially with the law from 2017, initiated and voted by the socialist government that actually lists circumstances that allow for the use of weapon by the police forces when facing a refusal to comply. And in a way, this law by listing those circumstances has somehow acknowledged the possibility of using weapons. And since 2017, the cases of death after a traffic stop as increased direly in France. So there is a need to address those issues to transform the law to change as well, the way the police are controlled. Right now, the institution in charge of controlling police forces is mostly composed of police officers.
