This as the U.S. is wrapping up pressure on Israel to limit civilian casualties and avoid what President Biden has called indiscriminate bombing.Also tonight, it's now up to a jury to decide how much Rudy Giuliani must pay two former Georgia election workers for the harm he caused by spreading conspiracy theories about them. The first day of deliberations wrapping up a short while ago after Giuliani opted not to take the stand. And Vladimir Putin is vowing there will be no peace in Ukraine until Russia's military goals are achieved. CNN was inside the Russian President's marathon end of the year news conference, his first since the start of the war. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. We begin tonight with the war in Gaza. President Biden stressing just a short while ago that he wants Israel to, quote, be focused on how to save civilian lives. We'll have more on the mounting U.S. pressure on Israel to be more targeted in his battle against Hamas. CNN's Alex Marquardt is standing by for his life in Tel Aviv. But, first, I want to go to Clarissa Ward, who just made a truly extraordinary excursion into Gaza. Clarissa, CNN is the first western media outlet to gain independent access to Southern Gaza without an IDFS court. Tell our viewers what you saw.",

It has not been possible up until Tuesday when we were finally able to go inside with a contingent of medical volunteers from a newly established UAE-run field hospital.Up until now, it's really been the journalists inside Gaza who have been risking their lives and often paying with their lives to keep telling these stories. But still, even the drive-in Wolf, just that 20 minutes to get to the field hospital from the border, offered a rare glimpse, a window onto the conditions on the ground. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WARD (voice over): You don't have to search for tragedy in Gaza. It finds you on every street, strewn with trash and stagnant water, desolate and foreboding. So, we've just crossed the border into Southern Gaza. This is the first time we've actually been able to get into Gaza since October 7th and we are now driving to a field hospital that has been set up by the UAE. Up until now, Israel and Egypt have made access for international journalists next to impossible, and you can see why. Since October 7th, the Israeli military says it has hit Gaza with more than 22,000 strikes. That by far surpasses anything we've seen in modern warfare in terms of intensity and ferocity. And we really, honestly, are just getting a glimpse of it here. Despite Israel's heavy bombardment, there are people out on the streets. A crowd outside a bakery, where else can they go? Nowhere is safe in Gaza. (END VIDEOTAPE) WARD (on camera): And, Wolf, you know, you really have a sense when you see the people on the streets that they're there primarily because there's nowhere for them to go. There's no place in Gaza that is safe right now. And so they have to go about the task every day of working out how they're going to survive, how they're going to source food, how they're going to source drinking water, how they're going to source decent or even any kind of medical care. Every single day is a fight for survival for people.",

One was a man in his mid 40s who had lost half of his leg. The other was a 13-year-old boy whose foot was basically dangling off. Both of those legs had to be amputated in the end.And this was just a brief glimpse, a small window onto the horrors that are taking place in Gaza every single day and onto the reality that it is the civilians of Gaza who are bearing the brunt of that.",

Clarissa, thank you very, very much.I want to go to see it as Alex Marquardt right now. He's in Israel. Alex. President Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, has been in talks today with top Israeli leaders. What are you learning about these key meetings? ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, Sullivan really did meet with the senior most leaders here, from Prime Minister Netanyahu to the defense minister and the head of intelligence. Sullivan and the administration don't want to be seen as telling Israel what to do or being seen as applying too much pressure on Israel. They're framing this trip as coming here to ask hard questions. But it's clear so much of the discussion today, Wolf, was about the conflict where things stand now, where Israel sees things going forward. The administration really wants to see a transition in this conflict soon for Israel to move from what they're calling a high intensity phase, which is what we're seeing right now, to a lower intensity phase, where you'll see much more sort of targeted, you know, counterterrorism operations against leaders inside Gaza. When that transition will happen, no one is going to say publicly. The White House's John Kirby said earlier today he hopes it will happen in the near future. My colleagues and I have spoken to several officials who believe that that could happen in weeks, not months. And President Biden today was asked whether he would like to see a low intensity phase. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This is an assessment from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence that my colleagues, Katie Bo Lillis and Natasha Bertrand, were told about. And in it, it says that some 29,000 bombs have been dropped from the air on Gaza, and almost half of them are imprecise, unguided, so-called dumb bombs, 40 to 45 percent. So, that would mean 12,000 to 13,000 of these bombs are not precise. And, of course, that kind of thing can wreak havoc in such a densely populated area.Now, one U.S. official defended Israel, saying that they've used dive bombing tactics where the planes will swoop down low and drop those bombs from a low altitude. But that is no substitute for a laser- guided or GPS-guided rocket. We did ask the IDF for a response. They initially told me that they don't talk about the munitions that they use. But then once they saw the attention that this report was getting, they came back to me saying that Israel only uses high-quality munitions that are operated by skilled pilots and advanced systems. They went on to say that the munitions used in each strike is determined according to the target, the operational need, and the effort to mitigate harm to civilians. So, you'll notice there that Israel not denying that they're using these dumb bombs. We should note that the U.S. has phased out its own use of dumb bombs but has actually offered thousands of their own to Israel. Wolf?",

They did not do that.And, Wolf, I should remind you of what these two women went through because that is central to what the jury is looking at now. And that could amount to giving them an award of tens of millions of dollars. What they went through was death threats, harassing phone calls, voicemails left repeatedly on their phones, calling them racist names, telling them to be afraid because of what they were doing. They were doxed. They felt that their names were complete mud because of what had happened. Ruby Freeman, she had to change the name of her business. She was afraid to use her I.D. to introduce herself to people. Her daughter, Shaye Moss, she had to essentially have conversations about racism with her 14-year-old son and tell him that she was very afraid of what was happening. He would see her phone and see racist text messages coming into it. And so all of that put together is the type of damages that the jury is looking at to compensate them, to compensate for the reputational harm, the emotional distress, also potentially to punish Giuliani.",

He wasn't the only person that was putting forward this information. There were other places, like news outlets, that were spreading these lies as well, and so that they should have compassion for the former mayor of New York. Now, we did see him in court all day today throughout this week. At times, he was very much looking intently on, but through much of the arguments that Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss' lawyers made today, the closing arguments to the jury, he was barely paying attention. He was on his iPad reading the New York Post outlining things there, barely even looking at the jury and definitely not at the two women who he had defamed.",

There is only one issue for them to decide, and that is how much of a penalty to assess on Giuliani. The fact that he defamed them has already been established in this court proceeding previously, and there's no universal understanding of how much defamation is worth. And so every jury comes to it in their own way. They've seen some incredibly powerful evidence. Shaye Moss and Ruby Freeman are, we know, very strong and very compelling witnesses.

So, he has found ways in other contexts to be able to pay. Now, if they come back with tens of millions of dollars, then that certainly will be challenging for him to have to pay. But there is a wide range of what this, in terms of dollar amounts, of what this jury might come back with, both in terms of trying to compensate the plaintiffs for the actual reputational harm that they suffered, as well as in terms of punitive damages to punish him and to send a message that this type of activity against people like them, just individuals working on elections, trying to make our elections work seamlessly and smoothly is not okay.",

You know, they do orchestrates these things very carefully, and they actually -- you know, the Russian propagandists like to show some kind of conflict or arguments, you know, because then they can defeat those arguments.

MELANIE ZANONA, CNN CAPITOL HILL REPORTER: Well, Chuck Schumer has decide to keep the Senate in next week, and part of this last stitch effort to try to keep a deal on the border, which could unlock additional aid for both Ukraine and Israel. Schumer says he's hoping for a deal in principle by Monday, and he has already pulled a vote on aid package no matter what next week. And, Wolf, there have been some signs of serious progress of the last 24 hours or so, with the White House now signaling they are willing to make some significant concessions on the border. That has Democratic negotiators like Kyrsten Sinema feeling a lot more encouraged about where they are in this process. But, Republican negotiations are far more skeptical that they are going to be able to finalize a deal this week, given how complicated this issue is, and given where they are in the process. Just listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. KYRSTEN SINEMA (I-AZ): Well, the fact of the White House is fully engaged in negotiations has definitely made a difference. It's communicated to Senate Republicans that this is serious, and that we've got a deal in the future. So, that's been really helpful. And we're also beginning to talk in more detail about what some of the elements of a potential deal would look like. SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): There is no legislative texts, the White House just got involved three days ago. You expect to run up the clock, and get it done. Well, I think the best thing to do is to keep talking, try to find a deal that we can all live with that would get through the House, come back in January, and do it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
