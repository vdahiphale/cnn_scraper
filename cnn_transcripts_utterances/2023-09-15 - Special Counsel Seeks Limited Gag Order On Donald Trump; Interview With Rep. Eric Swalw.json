Also tonight, early impact on the first ever strike against Detroit's Big 3, plus the economic and political potholes just ahead. And later, with Hurricane Lee approaching New England, an up close look at what goes into tracking and measuring it, flying above, around, and sometimes straight through the storm. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. We begin tonight with the breaking news, Special Counsel Jack Smith, asking Judge Tanya Chutkan to limit what the former president can say about the federal January 6 election subversion case against him. And just moments ago, the social media eruption response from the former president. I'm quoting now: \"Biden prosecutor, deranged Jack Smith has asked the court to limit 45th president and leading Republican nominee (by more than 50 points and beating Dems!) Donald J. Trump's public statements.\" He goes on: \"They leak, lie, and sue. They won't allow me to speak. How else would I explain that Jack Smith is deranged or Crooked Joe is incompetent. \" Jack Smith's request comes in a newly unsealed court filings. CNN's Jessica Schneider has been going through it. She joins us now. So what have you read?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Anderson, this is the special counsel's team laying out really a long list of reasons why they want the judge here to step in immediately and order Donald Trump to stop making these statements, both online and anything he might say in person that the special counsel really argues could end up intimidating witnesses as they put in his filing, court officials or even crucially here, the jury pool.So they're laying out it in the filing this way. They're saying: \"The defendant's repeated inflammatory public statements regarding the District of Columbia, the court, prosecutors and potential witnesses are substantially likely to materially prejudice the jury pool, create fear among potential jurors, and result in threats or harassment to individuals he singles out. Put simply, those involved in the criminal justice process who read and hear the defendant's disparaging and inflammatory messages from court personnel to prosecutors, to witnesses, to potential jurors may reasonably fear that they could be the next targets of the defendant's attacks.\" So because of this, the special counsel, Anderson is asking Judge Chutkan who is presiding here in DC, to issue this order as soon as possible and they want the order to restrict Trump from making certain comments, like even we've seen on Truth Social tonight. And in the request that we've seen here, the special counsel really laid out a number of previous social media posts from Trump in just recent weeks, you know, that have targeted Jack Smith. We saw it again tonight. In previous weeks, he's targeted former Vice President Mike Pence, the former Attorney General Bill Barr, and even a prosecutor on Jack Smith's team. So right now, the special counsel wants this ironclad order from the judge in an effort really to get Donald Trump to stop here -- Anderson.",

She's already set it for March 4th of next year, so could she bump it up even more? She could. And now, the special counsel here wants the judge to bar Trump officially from making comments about potential witnesses, you know, like Bill Barr, like Mike Pence, and they want it in this official written order that if the judge issues this as they ask, this really could bring legal ramifications if Trump doesn't follow it -- Anderson.",

And frankly, I think this judge has probably shown more patience than any judge that I've appeared in front of as a prosecutor where most defendants acting the way that Donald Trump has, harassing witnesses, harassing the judge, harassing the prosecutor would have been hauled into the court and given one warning and said, if you do this, again, you're going into custody.

So we will be feeling the impacts here where I'm standing in Cape Cod. In fact, on the backside of the storm as it wraps in that kind of northerly wind, we're going to build up some of the water and that means into the Cape Cod Bay. We time that with the high tide as well, so the potential for one to two feet of coastal inundation along with five to 15 foot waves right along the coast, so the potential here for coastal erosion definitely exist with this particular storm. But the fact that it is so large, that it has ballooned in size over the past few days means that this has the potential to take down trees, send power outages sporadically throughout the northeast into New England, and particularly into Canada as well.

Hurricane force winds stay offshore, but the landfall location perhaps into New Brunswick, parts of Nova Scotia, the potential there exists for them to experience those hurricane force winds and remember, this is a very saturated area. It's still leaf season here. So trees have that canopy that almost acts like a sail so it can catch the wind and it topples trees, and of course, if that's anywhere near power lines, it's going to take out power. That really is the greatest threat with Hurricane Lee right now.",
