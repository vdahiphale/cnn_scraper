Donald Trump's former chief of staff makes a play to get his racketeering charges dismissed and indications are the former U.S. presidents might be plotting a similar move.More than 100 people are now confirmed dead following Hawaii's wildfires as U.S. President Joe Biden defends himself against critics of his disaster response and three people arrested in the United Kingdom allegedly for spying. The clock is ticking here in the U.S. state of Georgia where Donald Trump has less than 10 days to turn himself into authorities. While the former president has been charged with 13 counts in a case alleging he and 18 others schemed to subvert Georgia's 2020 presidential election results. Trump is expected to turn himself in at the Fulton County Jail according to the sheriff and the meantime, he's announced a quote major news conference next Monday to present a report from his team on his own allegations of fraud in the case. Well, Trump's former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows is wasting no time attempting to have the Georgia case move to federal courts. According to new court filings, Meadows argues he is entitled to federal immunity since the Georgia charges stem from his time serving the sitting President. CNN's Sara Murray brings us up to speed on what has happened since Monday.

The problem for Mr. Meadows, who's asking the federal court to remove the case, it doesn't happen until the Federal Court decides to do so. The problem for Mr. Meadows, the former White House Chief of Staff is that the indictment alleges that he was essentially engaged in a political election interference. That's political, not official, it says, allegedly, and there's powerful evidence that he was part of an attempted coup following the election of 2020. And of course, that's contrary to the Constitution and our laws if true, so it can't form a basis for removal.

If you look in the constitutional job description of an American president, nowhere in there when you find attempting to hang on to power after you've lost an election as a political candidate. That's political, not official, and it's beyond the output number. So, like for Mr. Meadows, perhaps even tougher than his former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows is the row that Mr. Trump will need to hoe if he wants to achieve immunity or to remove the case.

It has been a month since King dashed across the military demarcation line while on a civilian tour of the DMZ, the joint security area.And it is a very heavily guarded area. U.S. and South Korean soldiers tried to stop him but could not. He was then taken into custody by North Korean officials. Since then, there had been very little known about him. Now we still don't know his whereabouts. North Korea has not told us that. We still do not know his condition at this point. And we have not heard from Travis King himself. What we have heard is from state run media KCNA claiming Travis King had left and gone in to North Korea because of racism in the United States, saying quote, \"He harbored ill feeling against inhuman maltreatment and racial discrimination within the U.S. Army.\" Also pointing out that King had wanted to seek refuge either in North Korea or in a third country because of mistreatment in his own country. Now, U.S. Defense official says that the U.S. cannot verify the alleged comments at this point by Travis King. Again we are hearing this from state run media itself. But they say that their main focus remains on trying to repatriate Travis King, to bring him home safely. Now we have heard from King's mother through a spokesperson for the family. And she has asked Pyongyang to treat her son humanely also saying that she would appreciate a phone call with him. Now there has not been this kind of communication between families and previous U.S. prisoners in North Korea so it is unlikely that could happen. But what we do know at this point is that there are efforts to try and get more information from Pyongyang as to exactly how Travis King is at this point and where he is and what the plans are for his future. But this is all that Pyongyang is giving at this point. But at least it is the very first indication that they're even acknowledging that he is North Korea. It has been a number of weeks since he made the run across the MDL. And it's only now that North Korea is even admitting that he is there, Laila.",
