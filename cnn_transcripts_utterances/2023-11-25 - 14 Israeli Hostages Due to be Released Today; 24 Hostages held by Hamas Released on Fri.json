      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to all you watching us here in the United States, Canada, and all around the world. I am Kim Brunhuber.I want to get to our continuing coverage of the Israel Hamas War. It's 5:00 a.m. here in Atlanta, noon in Gaza, where the four-day truce between Israel and Hamas is well into its second day. In the coming hours Israel is expecting Hamas to release another group of Israeli hostages just as it did the day before. An Israeli official says 14 Israelis are on today's list. According to an Israeli source, several children are also on it. Now, day one of the truce saw Hamas release 13 Israelis and 11 foreign nationals who were quickly taken to Tel Aviv area hospitals for medical evaluations. And doctors describe all 13 Israelis as good and stable. And as part of the deal on Friday, 39 Palestinian women and minors were released from Israeli prisons. Israel says 42 more Palestinian prisoners will be freed today. Now, have a look here, this was the scene last night as the first of the freed Israeli hostages arrived at a hospital near Tel Aviv. As you can hear, there are people cheered as three of five elderly women were transported by ambulance from a helicopter to the Wolfson Medical Center. The first images of the hostages as they were about to be released on Friday was a two-minute video taken by Hamas. It was edited and is mostly silent. Now, CNN had no control over the content, but we're going to play it now. CNN's Matthew Chance explains what we're seeing and why. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): They kidnapped and killed but now Hamas is showing its gunman releasing Israelis in Gaza. For many, these are disturbing scenes. Nine-year-old, Ohad Munder being embraced, as he set free, then a woman being carried by a masked man as Palestinians cheer. For 49 long days of captivity in Gaza, aid workers from the Red Cross drive them through the border into Egypt and to freedom. Egyptian television shows a convoy of vehicles heading to the crossing. Then the hostages including 10 Thais, a Filipino and the 13 Israeli women and children disembarking for checks. Israeli military posted this grainy video of the moment they all finally reentered the country. A step says the Israeli Prime Minister towards bringing all hostages home. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAEL PRIME MINISTER (through translator): We have just completed the return of the first of our hostages, children, their mothers and additional women. Each one of them is a whole world. But I emphasize to you the families and to you, citizens of Israel, we are committed to return all our hostages. CHANCE (voice-over): Most of the hostages released in this first group under the temporary truce were taken from Nir Oz, one of the small Israeli communities near Gaza ravaged by Hamas on October the seventh. At least 38 people there were killed and more than 70 abducted. People like Daniel Aloni, and her five-year-old daughter, Emilia, both freed in this latest release, but the relatives they were visiting when Hamas attacked remain unaccounted for as hostages. Doron Katz Asher and her two young daughters have also now been set free, but her partner remains in Gaza. Behind every release, a poignant reminder of those left behind. Like the family of Omri Almog, his brother-in-law and niece killed, his sister and her three children still hostages. Yet Omri is now optimistic.",

So, it would be the younger children, but very, very young children possibly won't display many, many difficult signs, but withdrawal would be one of the main things that one would look out for now. Now, the ordeal lasted a long time, but it wasn't an extremely long time. So, the chances are that a lot of the hostages, including the children, will adjust quite well to their environment. Of course, there's a lot they don't know. They don't know what happened to some of their relatives. Some of their relatives who are safe or when taken hostage may have passed away. So, there are issues there that, you know, they'll need to catch up with what's been happening. And, of course, that needs to be -- it needs to be drip fed. They can't -- they won't be able to take all this news suddenly. So, there will need privacy. And, of course, they'll have left people behind that they love who are still hostages.",

So, that could be more difficult.Of course, for some people who are hoping that their loved ones will come back, they may never come back and, you know, that is another problem that the mental health and well-being practitioners will need to cater for and these people will need help to overcome this terrible ordeal.",

WAEL HAJ AHMED, GAZA RESIDENT IN WEST BANK (through translator): This celebration is not necessary. They need to be mindful of us in Gaza. This celebration is wrong. I am torn to pieces. Have a little mercy on us. They can be joyful, but the joy is in the heart because we are dying in Gaza. Have some respect for us a little. BASHIR (voice-over): The release of this first group of Palestinian prisoners comes as Israel and Hamas begin a four-day truce, a window of desperately needed respite for civilians in Gaza. According to Hamas-run health authorities in Gaza, nearly 15, 000 Palestinians in the enclave have been killed over the last seven weeks alone. Israel says it is targeting Hamas in response to the terror attack of October 7th, which killed more than 1,200 Israeli cities. But in Gaza, it is civilians that are paying the highest price. More than 8,000 Palestinians remain in Israeli jails, including more than 3,000, according to the Palestinian Commission for Detainees and Ex-Prisoners Affairs, held under administrative detention, meaning no clear charges and no clear legal process. But for those gathered in the occupied West Bank on Friday night, this is a welcome moment of, in their eyes, long overdue justice. UM TARIQ, PALESTINIAN-AMERICAN CITIZEN: People want to gather and be together in this moment. And however folks internalize that, in terms of their own emotional sort of reaction to it, that's for them to speak to. But I think people want to be here to be together, to welcome home these prisoners, and that's part of the spirit of being Palestinian. BASHIR (voice-over): With over a hundred Palestinian prisoners still set for release over the next few days, scenes like this are expected to continue, though some say at too high a price.

A U.S. official says American forces in Iraq and Syria were attacked four separate times on Thanksgiving with rockets and drones. No casualties or infrastructure damage were reported. But U.S. and coalition forces have been dealing with dozens of attacks since October 17th. The U.S. says in retaliation, it's conducted four strikes on Iran-backed militias to send a message of deterrence.Ex-New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is facing a lawsuit from a former aide who previously accused him of groping her breast. Brittany Commisso filed the suit against Cuomo Wednesday under New York's Adult Survivors Act. Commisso claims she was subjected to repeated abusive behavior, continuous sexual harassment, and a hostile work environment as the governor's assistant. Cuomo has repeatedly denied her claims. On Friday, his attorney called the lawsuit an attempted cash grab. A source tells CNN, former police officer Derek Chauvin was assaulted in federal prison with the \"Associated Press\" and \"New York Times\" reporting that he'd been stabbed. He's said to be in stable condition. Chauvin was convicted in the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020 and is serving time at the Federal Correction Institute in Tucson, Arizona. Minnesota's attorney general said Chauvin should have been able to serve his sentence without fear of retaliation. Actress and comedian Tiffany Haddish was arrested early Friday morning on suspicion of driving under the influence. The Beverly Hills Police Department says police were called just before 6:00 a.m. local time and Haddish was arrested a short time later. CNN has reached out to representatives for Haddish for comment. South African prison authorities have granted parole to Olympic sprinter Oscar Pistorius. He was convicted of murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in 2013. He's set to be released on January 5th. Nicknamed the Blade Runner, Pistorius ran on prosthetics because his legs were amputated as a child. Steenkamp's mother says she's not convinced that he's been rehabilitated. She's worried for the safety of other women once he's released. For more on this, I'm joined by CNN Sports Coy Wire. This marks a new chapter in a case that held the world's attention more than a decade ago.",

Oscar Pistorius first made global headlines at the 2012 London Olympics when he became the first double amputee to compete at the Games.But early the next year, his story took a much darker turn when he shot his partner Reeva Steenkamp four times through the bathroom door of his South African home. He denied killing her in a fit of anger, saying instead that he had mistaken her for an intruder. Pistorius was eventually sentenced to 13 years and five months in prison. On Friday, authorities announced he would be granted parole in January. In a victim impact statement, Steenkamp's mother wrote, \"At this time, I am not convinced that Oscar has been rehabilitated. Rehabilitation requires someone to engage honestly with the full truth of his crime and the consequences thereof. Nobody can claim to have remorse if they are not able to engage fully with the truth.\" The now 37-year-old Pistorius will have to continue with anger management therapy as a condition of his parole, that according to Steenkamp's family attorney.

Defense with two interceptions in the final minute, Kim, one of them being returned to the house for a touchdown, Brandin Echols. But the Dolphins said, hold my plate of turkey leftovers, with just two seconds left in the first half, New York quarterback, Tim Boyle, launching the hail Mary from his own 49- yard line. Will it turn into fail Mary? Cornerback Jevon Holland taking it 99 yards for a pick six of his own. The Dolphins would never look back. They cruise on to a 34-13 beatdown win.
