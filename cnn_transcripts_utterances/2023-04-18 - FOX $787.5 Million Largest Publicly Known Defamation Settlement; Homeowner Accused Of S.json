      "sentences": "Good evening.FOX blinked on the day that FOX attorneys and the attorneys for Dominion voting systems the company that is suing them for defamation were to make opening statements in their $1.6 billion lawsuit, FOX decided to settle, $787.5 million. That's how much the FOX Corporation will pay. It is half of what Dominion says they were seeking, but a historic amount nonetheless. The FOX Corporation clearly deciding, it was better to pay the money than have their star anchors try to explain under oath the election denialism and disinformation they either spread themselves or help spread by giving others who are lying a platform night after night after night. In a statement after the settlement was announced, FOX said and I quote: \"We acknowledge the Court's rulings, finding certain claims about Dominion to be false. The settlement reflects FOX's continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards.\" Now I just want to repeat that. The first part of it said, \"We acknowledge the Court's rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false.\" That might sound sort of maybe like an apology, but it's not. They acknowledged the Court ruling doesn't really mean anything in their description that certain claims about Dominion were false is vague at best.   As for the second part of that statement that this settlement reflects FOX's continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards, as Mike Wallace used to say when interviewing someone shoveling crap, \"Come on.\" If there's anything we learned from the depositions, texts, and e- mails that were released by Dominion in the lead up to this case, is that there was no commitment to even basic journalistic standards where the 2020 election was concerned. FOX anchors said one thing on air to the audience they feared might abandon them go over to some other more conservative news channel, and another thing off air in texts and e-mails to one another. What most concerned FOX was not properly reporting on the lies that were being spread by guests on their air or by some of their hosts, no, what most concerned them was losing viewers. FOX argued it was just reporting on claims about Dominion, its voting systems and the 2020 election. But they did that more -- they did far more than that. They were willing participants in spreading false claims of fraud. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I hope you will prove that very soon. You convinced them that Trump will win, if you don't have conclusive evidence of fraud at that scale, it is a cruel and reckless thing to keep saying.\" Again, he never said anything like that on his show.

CLEO NAGBE, RALPH YARL'S MOM: His brothers were supposed to run outside, get in the car, and they come home. And that was what was supposed to happen. And while he was standing there, his brothers didn't run outside, but he got a couple of bullets in his body instead of a couple of twins coming up out and giving him a hug. KAFANOV (voice-over): Lester faces two felony charges in the shooting, assault in the first degree and armed criminal action. (on-camera): The incident unfolded on the front porch of the home behind me, the homeowner telling police that Ralph Yarl came up to his front porch. He rang the doorbell, but Ralph had made a mistake. This home is located at 115th Street, the home he was supposed to go to is one block away right there, 115th Terrace. (voice-over): According to the probable cause statement, Lester told investigators he was in bed when he heard the doorbell ring, then picked up his gun before responding to answer the door. He said after opening the main door, he saw a black male, approximately 6 feet tall, and he believed someone was attempting to break into the house and shot twice within a few seconds of opening the main door. He also told investigators that no words were exchanged, and it's quoted as saying he was scared to death by the teenager's size and by his inability to defend himself. LEE MERRITT, RALPH YARL'S ATTORNEY: He had to face an ugly reality here in the states that the color of his skin is often seen as a threat in and of itself.

Hold strong, one shouts. Everyone sends you a big hello, the voice says. Before being hustled away. But the court rejected an appeal for bail or for Gershkovich to be kept under house arrest instead of in prison. Outside, his lawyer spoke of how he was holding up behind bars. Reading classic Russian novels, one said, and watching cooking shows on TV. But the U.S. ambassador was far more critical, expressing her concerns at his confinement. LYNNE TRACY, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA: I can only say how troubling it was to see Evan, an innocent journalist, held in these circumstances. The charges against Evan are baseless, and we call on the Russian Federation to immediately release him.
