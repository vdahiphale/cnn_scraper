They took a two-pronged approach. They hit Nikki Haley on immigration, trying to shore up Republican voters who generally -- according to polling had sided with Donald Trump. And then they also hit Nikki Haley on Medicare and Social Security, which they were trying to get those independent or unaffiliated voters to come over to Donald Trump and they believe that this strategy worked. Now, the question is, how big is the margin going to be? That is what the senior advisor to asked me today what he was looking for tonight. And how big win would mean that he would potentially be the presumptive nominee or Nikki Haley would potentially drop out of the race. But right now, what I'm being told by his senior advisors, by his inner circle is that if he does well tonight, they are going to start focusing on a more general election approach. They are going to start looking at various swing states. But again, Dana, going into this they are feeling very confident with those poll numbers.",
