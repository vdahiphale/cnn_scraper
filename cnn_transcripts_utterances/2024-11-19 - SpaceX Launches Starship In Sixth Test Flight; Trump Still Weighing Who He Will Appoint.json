That's the most important part.The reentry part of that, super important, to get that down right and then demonstrate that it comes down exactly where they want it in the middle of the ocean.

Never been done before. And that's significant because in order for the future -- a future starship to actually go into orbit, actually fully circle the Earth and then do a deorbit burn to reenter the Earth's atmosphere and come back to Earth, these engines have to prove that they can turn off and then light again in space. So that's something really critical that we're going to be watching in the next few minutes when this live stream starts back up.And then, of course, how much can this starship land or splashdown on target in the Indian Ocean? One of the reasons that we're seeing an afternoon launch from Boca Chica down in Texas, right, on the border with Mexico, is because Space X wanted to be able to see starship as it returned to Earth. All the other return to Earth have been at night. So this time they're going to be able to actually get some cameras in daylight on Starship.

We saw him come on board, spend so much money helping Trump get elected, and now he has really had this kind of relationship with Trump where, you know -- just watching those people who are watching the launch happen, Jake, I was thinking about this access of influence around Trump and how much that has shifted from when he came into office eight years ago. And Elon Musk is a really big part of that.[17:15:01] Because the one thing that I, you know, have noticed in all my conversations that I've had with people is just how ubiquitous Elon Musk is in terms of that. Now, we have heard some skeptics of that relationship raise questions about what that looks like going forward because SpaceX, as we're watching this, has billions of dollars in contracts with the federal government already committed, more to come potentially. Tesla is obviously regulated and investigated by several federal agencies. There's a lot of competing interest here. And of course, foreign policy is also a major factor in all this.
