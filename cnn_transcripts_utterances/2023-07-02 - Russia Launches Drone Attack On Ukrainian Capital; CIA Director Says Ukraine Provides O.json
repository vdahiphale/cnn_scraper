And it's important to note that this is his first presidential rally since the news of his federal indictment and learning of the federal charges against him in the classified documents case.And he spent a lot of time during that speech talking about these charges. He continued to repeat that he denied any wrongdoing. He also argued that others were not being prosecuted for doing the same thing that he did, and that he was entitled to taking those documents with him. Of course, prosecutors argue that he had some of the most sensitive documents in his possession and that his refusal to turn them over amounts to obstruction. So, he spent a lot of time on that. The other thing I want to point out, though, is he also spent a lot of time focusing on his 2024 agenda. Things like immigration, crime, drugs and fentanyl in America, the economy and railed repeatedly against President Biden and argued that they need -- he needs to take the country back from his power. And so, I think focusing on 2024 is something that a lot of his senior advisors have told me that they want him to do. They want him to talk about the future. They want him to talk about the policies that he would implement if he were re-elected to being president. And so, I think we are going to continue to see a lot of these types of rallies throughout the summer. He is not slowing down despite the legal charges that he is facing and he has committed to this very aggressive campaign schedule over the next few months. Victor, Amara, back to you. WALKER: Thank you so much, Alayna. There is also new evidence of former President Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election.

Sources also tell CNN new details that President Trump tried to enlist his vice president Mike Pence in this effort. Vice President Pence he called Governor Ducey several times after the 2020 election to discuss the election, but a source tells CNN that Vice President Pence did not follow through with the request to pressure the governor. This all comes as Special Counsel Jack Smith is ramping up his investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election, including some of those efforts by the president and his allies to reach out to state officials. Now, the governor's spokesperson he downplayed the significance of this call to us saying in a statement to CNN, frankly, nothing here is new nor is it news to anyone following this issue the last two years. Governor Ducey defended the results of Arizona's 2020 election. He certified the election, and he made it clear that the certification provided a trigger for credible complaints backed by evidence to be brought forward. None were ever brought forward. Now, the spokesman also told CNN that the special counsel's office has not reached out to Governor Ducey to set up an interview and to talk about this call. The special counsel did interview this week another state official Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger about the call he had with President Trump in 2021 about finding enough votes for the president to win the election in that state.

The decision blocks millions of borrowers from receiving up to $20,000 in federal debt relief just months before loan payments are set to restart in October. But after a three-year payment freeze, there are a lot of people who are not prepared to add another bill into the budget.Here to share some recommendations on handling those student loans is Betsy Mayotte. She is the president and the founder of the Institute of Student Loan Advisors. All right, so, let's start here with what the President announced on Friday. First, good morning to you, and thank you for being with us. I want to start with this 12-month on- ramp program. And as described by the White House, financially vulnerable borrowers who miss monthly payments during this period are not considered delinquent, reported to credit bureaus, placed in default to refer to debt collection agencies. Does one have to qualify to be one of those financially vulnerable, or should a person with loans here, I've got another year that I don't have to start making those payments?",

Now, whether that plan ends up giving you a lower payment will depend on what your income is, especially in relation to how much you owe in student loans. So, for example, someone that owes, say, 50,000 in student loans, and they made say 80,000 a year, they should see their payments go down as a result of this new plan.However, someone that owes, say, 20,000 in student loans and they make $100,000, they likely will not see a reduction in their monthly payment as a result of this plan.",
