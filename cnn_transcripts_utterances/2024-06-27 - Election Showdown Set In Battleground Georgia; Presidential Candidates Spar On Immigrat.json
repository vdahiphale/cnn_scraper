And this is a city and a state that could be critical to determining who wins in November. Back in 2020, you'll remember the state flipped blue, giving Joe Biden his narrowest victory in any state in the race, and this led to that now-infamous phone call from then-President Trump to Georgia election officials. He was trying to find enough votes to win. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have, because we won the state. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The fallout led to criminal charges against the former president in Fulton County in Atlanta.And there was a break among some Republican leaders here in Georgia and one of those leaders joins us now, the former lieutenant governor, Geoff Duncan. Thank you so much for being here, sir. Always good to have you here. You, of course, were at the center of what we saw happen in 2020. Where do we stand in this state right now heading into this consequential night tonight? GEOFF DUNCAN, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, (R) FORMER GEORGIA LT. GOVERNOR, BIDEN SUPPORTER:  Well, I think the election is close. I think it's close today and it's going to be close on Election Day. And I think the big question for us here in Georgia is where do those 70-plus, almost 80,000 Nikki Haley voters show up on Election Day. Do they stay on the couch, do they show up and vote for Joe Biden, or do they just hold their nose and vote for Donald Trump? We'll have to see where that plays out. But certainly, there is -- there is an angst amongst Georgians here because we have -- Donald Trump has absolutely shafted us so many different ways. I mean, going back to COVID, he second-guessed everything that Gov. Kemp and I did. Obviously, the fake elector scheme, the 2020 election debacle. The lies and conspiracy theories. And so, I think there's a jaded feeling amongst a lot of Republicans. His support is a mile wide and an inch deep amongst Republicans in Georgia.",

He's certainly led this state through a bunch of difficult times and he's used conservative principles to do it.But I think it speaks to the broader sense of Republicans -- that they just had this angst amongst them. We know in our gut that Donald Trump is not the right person. And I can only imagine what would have -- what would have been different if governors and senators in the Republican Party would have stepped up a year ago this time, or two years ago this time, and said you know what -- we know the right thing to do. We're going to publicly support somebody maybe in the short term hurts our political career, but long term helps our country. To me, I think that's going to be the Monday morning quarterbacking after the election -- whether Joe Biden wins and we realize we could have put anybody else that had an R next to their name and a heartbeat and could have beat him, or we got Donald Trump and we get to watch the train wreck and circus happen four more years. HUNT:  Bakari Sellers, I mean, these dynamics -- do you think ultimately this is going to cut in Joe Biden's favor in a way that's enough to get him over the finish line? I mean, what -- and what do you make of Kemp admitting, like, hey, I -- nope, didn't do that? BAKARI SELLERS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, (D) FORMER SOUTH CAROLINA STATE REPRESENTATIVE, ATTORNEY:  First of all, that was just utterly weird that just the juxtaposition of being the sitting governor of a state and not voting for anybody but going to the polls. I don't really know what all of that means. I think Democrats are very pleased and excited with the fortitude of Geoff Duncan and Adam Kinzinger -- that's first. Them putting the country over party is an important principle in our democracy -- in the fabric of our democracy. I think even more so, Democrats are more concerned about turning out because I think this is a turnout race and not necessarily a persuasion race. They're more interested in turning out the base, like here -- Black voters here in Fulton County, Dekalb County, et cetera, than some of the voters -- Republican voters will get around the edges. And I'm interested to hear from both Geoff and Adam because I do think that there are 80,000, as you said, Republican voters who voted for Nikki Haley. But what does that look like if he puts Doug Burgum on the ticket? What does it look like if he puts Nikki Haley on the ticket, which he probably will not do? But what does that look like if he puts Sarah Huckabee Sanders or somebody that's kind of off the beaten path? Are Republican voters then who are putting country over party -- are they then contorting them self to say well, I'm not voting for Donald Trump; I'm voting for X?",

      "sentences": "Right. So we are in the Hank McCamish Pavilion. It's nicknamed \"The Thrillerdome.\" It's home to the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets.Obviously, today and tonight, we will be trading the sports teams for politicos. But look, as you said, Kasie, it's pretty empty right now. But tonight we're actually going to have close to 1,000 journalists from more than 170 countries in this room. And, of course, surrogates from both the Trump campaigns and the Biden campaigns. Now, if you see this area right here behind me, that's where a lot of the exact spinning will be happening. And you're totally right, Kasie. You're going to see surrogates from both sides claiming that their candidate won regardless of what happens on the debate stage. And so, tonight, it's really going to be probably standing room only. It's going to be packed. It's going to be very chaotic with everyone trying to get in their talking points for how they think the debate went for their particular candidate. Now, just to take a step back and give you an inside look into how the Trump campaign is viewing this debate today. They really are going into this trying to manage expectations, but also manage expectations for the former president. You and I have been talking, Kasie, for days now about them trying to raise the bar for Joe Biden and trying to get Americans to raise their expectations for his performance. But I'm also told that they're trying to get Donald Trump to walk into today with a different mindset as well. Now, they really want him to move away from personal attacks. We saw him kind of level some of those personal attacks on Joe Biden back in 2020 when they were on the debate stage then. They do not want Donald Trump to do that today. They want him to be focused heavily on his messaging. And what I found interesting from my conversations with Trump's advisers is that they're also have a different outlook on the actual debate rules. Initially, they did not really like the idea that there was going to be the microphones being cut off at certain points. That there would be no audience. In recent conversations they actually are arguing that they think that will help Trump, especially to help him stay on message and focus on the key themes they think will be best for him tonight -- Kasie.",

It's going to be a very different dynamic tonight.Alayna Treene for us this morning. Thank you so much for being there for us. And tonight, as we noted, the spin room is going to be a who's who of politics -- everyone from campaign staffers to political commentators making the case for their candidate's debate performance. There's no current clear leader in the polls, so everyone on all sides hoping that this debate is going to change things in their favor. Joining me now is CNN senior data reporter, Harry Enten. Harry, this has been an incredibly close -- almost feeling static race. We've seen some slow movement in the wake of Donald Trump's conviction, but this is really the first big moment of the 2024 campaign. What difference could it make?",

There are a lot of people who are sick of this rerun.Look, you can look at the different polling data and you can find different percentage of how many folks are likely to watch. A Quinnipiac University poll that came out yesterday suggested north of 70 percent of Americans were likely to watch that particular debate. And even if they don't watch, right, they may pick up stories from the spin room afterwards. That's why the spin room is almost as important as how many people actually watch because a lot of people are going to be getting these numbers of getting these videos from their phones afterwards. And this is a vastly different dynamic than we were dealing with 10, 15, perhaps even four years ago where people were stuck in their homes because of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
