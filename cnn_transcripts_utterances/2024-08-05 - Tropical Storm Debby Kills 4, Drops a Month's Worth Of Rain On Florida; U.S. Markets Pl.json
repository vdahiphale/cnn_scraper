But now the rain and the wind and the saltwater starting to come on shore in Savannah, in Charleston. Very, very heavy rainfall and the potential, the high risk of flooding because the saltwater wants to go this way because that's the way the wind's blowing and the rain wants to go downhill because that's how the rivers run.They clash right there and it doesn't work out very well. So yes, we are going to have significant amounts of rain and I'm even looking at a couple of models that by the weekend we could have five or seven inches of rain along Long Island as this thing continues toward to the north and to the northeast. Are we record breaking yet? No, by no stretch of the imagination. By any tropical cyclone standard, Florida, over a tropical cyclone, 45 inches of rain would be needed in one spot to break that record and talk about Houston to the west over there, that would be 60 and Harvey, not really worried about that. But North Carolina, 35, South Carolina, 29, the Grand Strand all the way down to Charleston, all the way down to Tybee and Savannah, that's the area that I'm worried about with this onshore flow, with the storm surge from the really the wrong direction. We had a lot of surge here. We had four to six feet of surge here. Do we get four to six feet here? Well, that'd be a problem because I mean, places like Garden City up in South Carolina, they will flood on king tide, let alone a real tide, a real surge in that water trying to run downhill. So yes, big problems when the weather service uses words like catastrophic, devastating in their texts. You know, they're worried and you should be paying attention to.",

JOHN LOUK, EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT DIRECTOR, TAYLOR COUNTY, FLORIDA SHERIFF'S OFFICE (via phone): Well, right now we're, we still have a little bit of a tropical storm force winds that started to tail off the strongest part of the storm that obviously has passed over us. We are just now, most of the storm surge is receding. We're still trying to get some final numbers on our rainfall and the actual, the storm surge amount.

What they're talking about, particularly after that jobs data that we got on Friday and some of the weakness in the manufacturing sector last week, that the risks are rising.And I think that's very clear. And that led to the finger pointing over just why the Fed hasn't started to cut rates yet. And I think that's a reasonable question to be asking. But we have to take a step back. The U.S. economy is still adding overall jobs. And yes, the data is softening, but I do think the Federal Reserve does still have time to cut rates. And it will decide based on the next few data points that we see, I think, just how much they do. So I don't want people panicking about an imminent recession. Don't look at Twitter and social media and think, what's going on here? There is still time for the Federal Reserve to help support this. We just need more data points. And the silver lining, as I keep saying to you, we're not talking about if the Fed now cuts rates, we're talking about how much. And the data will help us tell that over the next few weeks.",

So let's start with the economy, because maybe it's the differences with the market versus the economy, because even when the markets were doing well, we constantly have heard from Americans that they weren't feeling the gains as much in their pockets. And I'm wondering how you read these economic indicators politically and how it may complicate things for the incumbent administration, which in this case is Vice President Harris.",

I don't know how long it's going to last. I don't think anybody does.But that's not how most people measure the economy. It is true that about half the public has some stock investment, even if it's in their IRA or other retirement account. But again, that's not how they measure it. They're much more likely to measure the economy and how they feel about the economy from the price of gasoline when they go to fill up their car twice a week. They go to the store and they look at the price of eggs and milk and bread. That's what determines how people feel. And it's one of the reasons why they have been feeling so badly. And they interpret even good news as bad news or they discount the good news and say, I know what I see at the gas station. I know what I see when I go to the grocery store. So those are the feelings, sentiments that that Vice President Harris has to focus on and will, no doubt.",

He's not sure how much people will agree that Kamala Harris is responsible for what they may see as Joe Biden's mistakes.And so far, clearly, it hasn't hurt her that much. In fact, she's been gaining speed. She's been gaining ground on Trump. So I think it's important that people realize we haven't heard the vice presidential nominee yet. We haven't seen the Democratic Convention. There's a good chance that Harris can keep the positive momentum going through the convention and probably all the way to Labor Day, which used to be, and maybe this year, the actual launch of the general election campaign. So it's just too early to say, oh, this is the end of it. We can call the election now. No, we can't. No, we can't. Also, Trump, if I can add this, he is one of the people who may be helping to talk us into a recession, though I agree with the people who've said that's very unlikely. But his language is always apocalyptic. And it hurts him in situations like this because the news actually is bad. But he always says it's bad. It's awful. It never would have happened if I'd been president. If I were there, I could solve this in one day. You know, even his base must wonder whether that's true.",

She stepped out of bounds a couple of times, likely costing her the gold, but her difficulty level was on such another level that she still won silver. So she leaves Paris with five more gymnastic medals for an American record, 11 in her name. Now, Brazil's 25-year-old Rebeca Andrade, she won her first gold of these games. And check out this incredible photo. This display of sportsmanship afterwards, Simone Biles, fellow American Jordan Chiles, bowing down to Andrade on the podium. I caught up with another Team USA star, Suni Lee, who added three more medals to her name here and asked her about this remarkable moment.
