PLEITGEN (on camera): As you can see here, this building was completely annihilated all the way down to the ground floor and the Ukrainian say the reason why the damage is so extensive is that the Russians used a cruise missile called The KH-22, that is designed to destroy whole aircraft carrier strike groups. And when it hit the building, the building just completely collapsed and buried dozens of people underneath. PLEITGEN (voiceover): A miracle that anyone survived at all Ukrainian authorities say. Katarina Zielinska (ph) was pulled from the rubble by rescuers hours after the strike, but her husband and one year old son remain unaccounted for. And this video shows happier times for the Karnovski (ph) family, father Mihailo Karnovski (ph) was killed in their apartment, their distinctive yellow kitchen like their family torn apart by the massive explosion. 15-year-old Maria was also killed in the blast. Dozens of relatives, classmates and teachers coming to pay their final respects. She was an incredible child, her class teacher says. God is taking the best of ours. This is what happened. The Kremlin denies its forces were behind the strike and instead claims a Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile hit the building. The Ukrainian say that simply isn't true and Dnipro's Mayor tells me his city and the country need more Western air defense systems. Western countries give us air defense systems he tells me, but unfortunately it's not enough and it comes with delays. More air defense systems are the only thing that can save our civilians in our cities.

If a player goes down, obviously he won't know if it's orthopedic or internal medicine. He'll step out onto the field. Our all-call sign is an X. So, if you need him to come out he will come out with an X. All of the important equipment, airway, defibrillator, all the medications are all behind him with our paramedics on our sideline. If a player needs to get taken off of the field the ambulance is going to be in the tunnel to your right. If you need anything at all, we'll be out here for you guys if you need us. Otherwise, hope we have a safe and healthy game. Good luck. DR. GUPTA: Keep in mind, the medical team was able to get to Damar Hamlin within ten seconds. And speed really matters here. Every additional minute that someone in cardiac arrest goes without CPR, mortality goes up by about 10 percent. DR. SILLS: This is a process that's in place for every single game. And we train in the off-season. And just like the players train and practice, we do as well. So I have a tremendous confidence -- but, you always want to see a game with no injuries.

Not long after Musk bought Twitter, laid off 3,700 workers, promising three months of severance, he noted at the time it's 50 percent more than legally required. When the severance agreement arrived, the final offer was for one month's, 50 percent lower than legally required. That was quickly rejected by a lawyer representing a small group of Twitter workers saying that he was basically trying to fleece them. And then came a ruling in a district court last week. Laid-off Twitter workers are being forced to drop their class action lawsuit and go into individual arbitration. So back to the lawyer, who then tweeted, \"We anticipated this and that is why we have already filed 500 individual arbitration demands. And counting. This is not a win for Elon Musk.\" Ok, first up, this legal decision, in and of itself, does look like it's a win for Musk simply because dragging out these social legal battles only harms the plaintiffs who often trying to get a fairly quick settlement and companies usually have, you know, the deep pockets so he can hold out for longer.",
