Danelo Cavalcante now armed and still on the loose.And I got to say, this has been a very active morning along Pottstown Pike, the main search perimeter now just a few miles up the road. Police have closed off this area. But we've seen, as you said, armored cars coming into the area with law enforcement officers dressed in fatigues entering the area. And all of this really started last night. And I just want to emphasize kind of where we started and how we got to this point and tell you what specifically we know at this time. Yesterday, remember, Phil, Poppy, was a pretty quiet day in this search, law enforcement really focusing in this general area of East Nantmeal. It's a small community in Chester County. But, importantly, it is the community where Danelo Cavalcante ditched that stolen dairy van over the weekend. And then last night, everything really changed. We saw a number of law enforcement officers really flying down Pottstown Pike. We saw helicopters in the air and then a few specific things happened. Chester County reported that there was a shooting in East Nantmeal at around 10:10 P.M. in the area of Coventryville Road and Ridge Road. Then Pennsylvania State Police confirmed to CNN at around 10:24 that there was a confirmed sighting of Cavalcante. Then we learned that a 911 call went out, a reverse 911 call, I should say, went out to the South Coventry Township community. Again, that's the community just a little bit up the road from where we are right now, saying they should lock windows, lock doors because Cavalcante may be in the area. And at that time, the reporting was that he may be armed. Well, then at 1:45 this morning, Pennsylvania State Police confirming that Cavalcante is indeed armed. So, this new perimeter, like I said, 3.5 miles up this road, we are at a staging area just south of that particular point. And I should say that this search area is just about 4.5 miles north of where Cavalcante ditched that van that I was talking about earlier over the weekend. So, he has, according to police, stayed in this general area of Chester County. We're still working to confirm some more details about that shooting incident that took place last night. But Poppy, Phil, this really has been the nightmare scenario for this 13-day manhunt that Cavalcante could get his hands on a weapon. Police confirming he is armed at this time as the search continues.",

She issued the emergency order after the shooting deaths of three children this summer that includes an 11-year-old boy shot and killed outside of a minor league baseball stadium just last week as well as mass shootings in the state.

It's unconstitutional. Why do it if it can't be enforced? GOV. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM (D-NM):  Well, that's their opinion. They have no bold actions. They don't have any plans for reducing gun violence. Every single aspect in terms of preventing gun violence, funds, crime labs, more than 150 million for retention bonuses and recruitment of new police officers. I'm focused on one thing. We have the third highest gun related injuries in the country, 90 percent higher than the national average. We lost 143 children between 2017 and 2021.
