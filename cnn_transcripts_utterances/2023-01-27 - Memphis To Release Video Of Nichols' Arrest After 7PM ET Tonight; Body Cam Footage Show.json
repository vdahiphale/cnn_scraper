And certainly, they have my condolences on that.As far as the actions being requested, I'm sure Chief Davis is going to take a very hard look at that unit and any other unit like it. You have to be able to screen the individuals that are going into a unit like that as well as the supervisors. Specialized units are needed in policing. But they have to be well supervised. I know nothing about the Scorpion Unit, whether it should be disbanded or whatever should take place. That's going to be up to the police chief. But certainly when you look at specialized units and you have to have some flexibility to deal with crime that is taking place in these neighborhoods. But the officers in it have to perform their duties in a constitutional way. They cannot be abusive in any way. If you see that, then you have to take the appropriate actions. So I think a lot of people are going to be taking a hard look at their units that are not tied to the radio, specialized unit.",

      "sentences": "Joey, we heard earlier from the police chief that they are now scouring the records of these officers, not just for things that might be in their file, but also looking at other stops that they might have made that perhaps didn't end in someone dying.But they're all now, five officers facing these murder charges and also these kidnapping charges. But some of these attorneys for the accused officers are saying that their clients, maybe they didn't participate in the physical beating. My question to you is, do you think that matters from the perspective of the prosecutors wanting to sustain the charges against all five of these former officers? JOEY JACKSON, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Yes, Abby, so a lot to un unpack. The first thing I'm struck by, before pivoting to the question, is the humanity of the mom. This is a mother who lost her child, whose child meant everything to her. As any parent will tell you, will give their life for their child. Talking about the bond that they shared, et cetera. But yet she gave those police officers what they did not give her son, prayer, right, forgiveness, the fact that, you know, she just holds no hate in her heart about them. And I think that's remarkable testament to her spirituality and what she -- you know, her belief and her faith, which is incredible. Just had to say that. In terms of your question as it relates to the officers, Abby, you know, there's a doctrine of law called Mere Presence. And Mere Presence alone at any criminal event or activity is not enough. You have to establish that you were a participant, that you engaged in some kind of conduct that would lead to criminality. Why is that relevant? It's relevant because, with the charge, what these seasoned prosecutors and certainly law enforcement officials, they know this doctrine. And so what it means to me, if they charged everyone, Abby, is that these officers were collective participants with respect to what happened here. Now, obviously there's due process. I'm big on that. We all should be big on due process, as Ben Crump noted when he was asked a question concerning bail, and certainly these officers will have their day in court. However, to the extent they've all been charged with something similar, what that means to me, that there's a theory that you are acting in concert, that each of you had some role, which was significant as it related to the final outcome here. And so I think, as we wait for this video, Abby, we'll be looking to dissect it to understand what was the immediate threat, if any. Were their actions proportionate to whatever threat was posed and did they act reasonably? All indications to this point are that they did not.",

However, this is the first time we are hearing and seeing everything that happened.There's the 911 call made by Paul Pelosi from the bathroom when all of this was unfolding. There's surveillance video from the backyard, which shows David DePape entering the Pelosi residence. There's that very disturbing body camera video which shows the attack on camera as police responded to the Pelosi residence. And then there's a more than 15-minute interview with police in which David DePape pretty much admits to everything and goes step by step of what he did. So let's start with that surveillance video in the backyard. You can see David DePape go and try to smash through the glass. It shows him trying to smash the doorknob and trying to break in. And he admitted later to officers the glass was very difficult to break through. He eventually was able to climb in. Now, we're going to go to the body camera video just released. I want to warn you, it is very disturbing. And we are showing it in its entirety. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (KNOCKING)",

And his wife, Nancy, says he is still in recovery from that and it could take months.But that interview after his arrest, David DePape's arrest, he lays out everything. It's an audio recording that I just listened to. I took a lot of notes so bear with me a little bit. I want to take you through some of the highlights and what led up to that moment. David DePape admits to breaking in and he says that it was a very big house and he went there to find Nancy and was thinking when he got inside because it was so empty maybe she's not here. He eventually was able to find Paul Pelosi who was sleeping in his bed, he said, and that's when they started talking, obviously. He said that Paul Pelosi was very surprised to see him. And he said that he told Paul Pelosi that he was going to hold Nancy hostage and he wanted to talk to her, but Paul Pelosi said she's not here. And it sounded like, based on his conversation, that David DePape knew that Paul Pelosi was trying to keep things calm in order to not escalate the situation. David DePape admitted to an investigator he wanted to tie him up so he could do what he needed to do but Paul was able to get out of bed and eventually make his way to the bathroom where he made that 911 call, which we've also listened to that audio. And you can hear Paul Pelosi trying to subtly tell the 911 dispatcher that somebody has come into the house looking for Nancy Pelosi. And it's around that time that David DePape admitted to the investigator in his interview he started to get agitated because he was there for a purpose. He said he wanted to hold Nancy Pelosi hostage and talk to her and, if she told the truth, he would let her go. If not, he said he was going to break her kneecaps because it needed to be done. He repeatedly talked about in his interview about going to the Pelosi residence to fight tyranny like the Founding Fathers, that he wasn't actually there for Paul but that he would go through him if he had to. And he didn't want to surrender because he wanted to fight evil. And so Paul Pelosi got the punishment instead. All of this on camera, on audio. And it's incredibly telling. Of course, we've heard about this in the motion to detain but seeing it for yourself is an entirely different story -- Abby?",

Remember that trials are about bringing the jury, in the event it goes that far, to the location to have them get a sense of what occurred, right?That's why you bring forward witnesses and give them and have them proffer information. So it could be evaluated by a jury if it goes forward to make an assessment as to whether the conduct is the conduct as they're being accused of and as is described. Remember, he's facing -- that is, Paul Pelosi's attacker -- both a state prosecution and federal prosecution. The state, of course, charging him with attempted murder, burglary, kidnapping and assorted charges. And the federal government charging him, rightfully and properly, not only as it relates to Paul Pelosi, because he's married to, an immediate family member, the husband of Nancy Pelosi, but for his attempt to kidnap Nancy Pelosi. So I think this goes a long way with respect to actually proving that those charges are correct.",

But what I think we ought to do, when we have had a chance to process this, is proceed with our top gun investigation of the police department, look into enhanced ways to look into the mental inventory of police recruits. But also, look, the Scorpion team was, as I understand it, was designed to, for lack of a better word, through crime data, go into the higher crime data that we're experiencing higher crime at that point, and go after the criminals in search of them. If this is indicative of the Scorpion Unit, obviously it will be disbanded. What I think we ought to do is let's process about what we're about to see and then let's thoughtfully, logically evaluate all this, and what we need to do, and go forward so that we keep Memphis and the people of Memphis safe.",
