      "sentences": "I think -- I think he's shocked. At the age of 12, he was on holiday with his father at Balmoral when they got the news of his mother's passing. Imagine for one moment the shock. We can all remember those of us who are old enough to remember where we were when we heard the news of Princess Diana's passing.I think going back to what Sally was just saying a moment ago and Max, there is a particular fragility -- vulnerability in members of the royal family who find themselves suddenly outside of the system and abroad. And I think that was certainly the case with Princess Diana. It is now the case with Prince Harry. And the parallels are absolutely startling. Just to take your -- you back to those fateful hours of the 31st of August 1997. She had come back from a holiday. Princess Diana at the time was with Dodi al-Fayed. She was rebuilding her life. They'd been on a -- on a yacht of the French and Italian Riviera, as the idea was that she was getting her life back, but being hounded by the press that had this insatiable appetite for any of the details of her new life, for her image, of course, first and foremost. They had come back to Paris for a stop overnight. The Ritz Hotel which is where they were staying which belonged to Dodi Al-Fayed's father, Mohamed, at the time had gone to extraordinary lengths to get them in a car. A decoy had been sent and another car had been brought, there was going to shepherd them to the -- to the apartment where they would stay just off the Champs-Elysees, not far from where I'm staying now. In the end, nonetheless, the paparazzi tracked the car down. And of course, in the chaos that ensued in the Point Loma, that terrible accident happened. And, of course, she was pronounced dead by the time she reached the hospital. It didn't take very long. The inquests have found since then that it was a combination of the prescription drugs and the alcohol, they're in the system of Henri Paul, the man who'd been driving the car, but also the reckless driving of the paparazzi that caused the crash. But clearly, there's no question. This was a woman who was so hounded. We all remember also the words of her brother at her funeral, Earl Spencer, who talked about the huntress now being hunted. That 20 -- a couple of decades later, we should find ourselves again with absolutely known as lessons learned. If it isn't, then members of the royal family that find themselves outside of the protection of the royal family are particularly vulnerable.",

      "sentences": "Yes, how he talked about the terrible situation at his mother's awful death. The last thing she saw was a paparazzi flashbulb, he said in 1997. He wrote about this in his book. He told Anderson Cooper that he always hoped that she might come back for quite a few years.And he also said in the interview with Oprah that his first memory -- his earliest memory is most significant memory of his mother was her crying while she drove the car because he and William were strapped in as children in the backseat and she couldn't drive forward because there are paparazzi everywhere. And she was so upset that she couldn't drive the car. So, it's not only a memory of his -- the death of his mother, but also his own personal memories, one of being chased as a small child, photos of him as a small child. And this is you know incredibly wounding, incredibly triggering. He talked -- he said to Oprah, I -- if I stayed in the royal family, I felt that history would repeat itself. And we know what history he was talking about here. He was talking that he thought his wife and his children would be in danger. Now very significantly, the children were not in the car. They were at home in Montecito. But how terrifying it would have been for how he, particularly that Archie and Lili who -- you know, I -- Archie is about -- I mean Archie is old enough, I think to remember this that he would have been in the car as well. And simply this is a situation that many celebrities go through. But Harry and Meghan are in particular for the British paparazzi top money. They are huge money. And Meghan didn't come to the coronation. It was Archie's birthday. But I do think that had she come to the coronation, we would have seen something similar. Harry is -- you know how Harry, he's a -- he's someone that the paparazzi hunt, but Meghan is hunted even more. So, had she been at the coronation she'd been hunted like this. And it's terrible that you can't even go and get an award without being chased around New York. And certainly, I think Harry is suing newspapers here in the UK for invasion of privacy. He's suing over the security that he feels very strongly he needs and the security he needs. He's suing over that. And I think that he is going to try and use any measure of the law he can to come down upon these people. I know they're in blacktop cars. I know it's hard to see who it was. I think that Harry is not afraid of legal action and he's going to do what he can because this is going to be a watershed moment for Harry -- a watershed moment. Yes, they've had paparazzi intrusion drones chasing but this I think we all agree is the worst they have suffered. And this is a watershed moment. Harry, I think will go into very intense action after this. He is not going to take this lying down.",

Oral arguments happening today before the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. On the state level, the focus is on Carolina right now, where two separate efforts in both North and South Carolina have hit a critical juncture.And South Carolina Republican lawmakers are working toward a near- total ban on abortion. They're back in session right now to continue what is a marathon debate. And in North Carolina, nearly all abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy are banned after the Republican supermajority and the state legislator voted to override Democratic Governor Roy Cooper's veto of their bill. CNN's Dianne Gallagher has been following all of this for us from Raleigh.",

When the two super majorities of Republicans in the House and the Senate voted last night to override his veto, that bill became law. Now, it does not go into effect until July first. But when it goes into effect, it will reduce the cutoff date in North Carolina to obtain an abortion from 20 weeks to 12 weeks, banning most abortions after that first trimester although it does include some exceptions.But Democrats and medical associations as well as abortion advocates have talked about the other changes that are in this law, including the impact it's going to have on medication abortion. It will require multiple in-person appointments to get that medication. It also will add new regulations reporting and licensing requirements, which advocates say is going to make it more difficult for people to obtain abortions even before that 12-week cut-off period. Now, look. Democrats say that they feel that they are going to be able to use this to energize their base. When I spoke with Republicans last night during this vote, they said that they thought that this was a \"mainstream bill,\" especially talking about that 12-week cut-off point. And they called it a compromise. But it is only a compromise within the Republican caucus. Democrats are very quick to point out they had nothing to do with this. And when Republicans call it mainstream, Sara, Democrats point out that that is not what polling suggests the average North Carolinian believes. They say this is something they're going to hit hard on, on the 2024 campaign trail. Governor Cooper is saying that this is something we're going to hear a lot about between now and November 2024.",

Kate, a lot of questions that we need to answer so far because do the parents have to sign their kids up for this interview process, do the investigators come into class, and what kind of questions will they ask them? Of course, the movie was Strange World. And this has really gotten a lot of attention in terms of the themes that were in this movie. The teacher was quite surprised this even rise to -- went to the level that someone who even talked about.But one of the students in that class, their parent was a part of the school board. So, they've raised the idea of the character being in this movie as an issue. And this movie is kind of centered around environmental issues. And the teacher was hoping to kind of show that this lesson plan went along with everything else they were talking about in terms of trying to save the world. So, when you put all this together, now you have this investigation, you have students asking the teacher why does she get in trouble, and this all goes back to the laws that have been signed in Florida, where people are really paying attention to the themes. Not only in movies, but what she was saying before is the fact that this was a PG-rated movie, that it wasn't on a list of movies that couldn't be shown, and now all this is changing. So, this investigation part is something that I don't believe a lot of people have experienced. In fact, I talked to several educators in the state of Florida just this morning, just asking them if have they ever seen an investigation like this take place. What kind of questions could be asked to the students? None of them had the answers for this because this is a new process that they hadn't seen before. So, Kate, there's just a lot of confusion about how this process moves forward. And whether or not this is now a political battle that most teachers think they shouldn't be a part of.",
