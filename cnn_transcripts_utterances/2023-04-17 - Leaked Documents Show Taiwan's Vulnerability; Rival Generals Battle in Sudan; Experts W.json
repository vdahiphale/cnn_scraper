And the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley, he spoke to this just a few months ago. He said that China currently believes that war with the U.S. is inevitable, which is kind of a scary thought. But he cautioned that, saying that, you know, that there tends to be some overheated rhetoric and that it is not clear that China will actually move forward with trying to invade Taiwan by 2027, which we should note Xi Jinping, the president of China, has ordered his military to be prepared for. And, of course, the U.S. would likely come to Taiwan's defense if that were to happen. But there are a lot of questions here about whether the U.S. is sending equipment to Taiwan fast enough, and that is what Milley said is currently a priority.",

And we can't tell for how much longer this will go on because it appears that this power struggle between these two powerful generals in Sudan is escalating instead of deescalating, despite calls from the U.S., the U.K., the U.N., the African Union, the European Union, the Arab League for them to go back to the negotiating table. Ninety-seven people dead so far, 1,100 people wounded. Those numbers will almost certainly increase.I spoke to one half of this conflict, General Mohamed Hamdan. He was not on video because he did not want to reveal any clues as to where he is for fear of getting captured. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MADOWO (voice over): Two generals at war. Since Saturday, the forces of General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group, or RSF, have been locked in battle with the Sudanese army led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. The fighting comes as Sudan tries to finalize a deal to return to civilian rule after two military coups in recent years which temporarily united the army and the RSF. In a phone interview, Dagalo, who is better known as Hemedti, told me ruling Sudan isn't his endgame. MADOWO (on camera): What do you personally want from this situation, General Hamdan? Do you want to lead the army? Do you want to be the chief? GENERAL MOHAMED HAMDAN DAGALO, LEADER OF PARAMILITARY RAPID SUPPORT FORCES (through translator): I don't want to be the leader of the army. There's a framework agreement between all the Sudanese stakeholders that should be adhered to. I don't want to lead anything. These are all propaganda they are making. MADOWO (voice over): As part of the agreement, the RSF, some 100,000 strong, would merge with the army. But differences over how long that would take and who would end up with more power aggravated tensions between the two factions, which have since erupted into open (ph) warfare. Residential areas across Sudan have become battlefields with anti- aircraft weapons in the streets and warplanes hovering overhead. Scores of civilians have been killed. The army blames the RSF for the violence, with Hemedti pointing the finger back at al-Bruhan. MADOWO (on camera): What is your message to the many people of Sudan who are scared about this fresh round of violence? DAGALO (through translator): We offer a serious apology to them because what we can say is al-Burhan is the one that forced us to do this. It was not us who did this. We were defending ourselves. MADOWO (voice over): Doctors' unions say it's been difficult for medics to move about amid reports of many people being trapped near fighting hotspots. Despite a U.N. brokered temporary truce, there were reports of gunfire in Khartoum, which Hemedti again blamed on the army. DAGALO (through translator): We're under attack from all directions, they're attacking us with marked and unmarked vehicles. Unfortunately, they're not stopping.",

Egypt and South Sudan have offered of mediate talks between the two sides. The African Union and the Arab League both held emergency sessions with more calls for an immediate end to the hostilities. The army has said there will be no dialogue until the RS is dissolved. Hemedti says the stakes are so high in Sudan that any possible negotiations would have to be serious. DAGALO (through translator): We are not refusing to go to the negotiating table as long as the negotiation is true and truthful, honest, not playing games. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And in 2018, a federal judge ruled prosecutors improperly withheld evidence that police suspected Green was not the shooter. His original conviction was overturned. The state of Florida could choose to retry Green or release him.In 2021, Green was allowed to go home while his case was being appealed. A year after he was freed, an appellate court ruled against Green siding with Florida's Attorney General Ashley Moody. When asked why Green should be incarcerated, Moody's office said, quote, the Florida Attorney General's Office is charged by statute to represent the state of Florida in upholding judgments and sentences sought by the state attorney in each circuit and imposed by trial courts when they are appealed. The U.S. Supreme Court was his final hope to win his legal battle. The high court declined to hear the case. That means clemency or parole are his only options of freedom. JEANE THOMAS, CROSLEY GREEN'S LAWYER: It's heartbreaking. It's - it's as though, you know, you've given something to him and then -- and then taking it away again. And is -- it's gut wrenching. The context of all of this is that he is actually innocent of this crime, and there's a tremendous amount of evidence. And I think that that would be part of any petition or application to get relief.",
