Tonight, we're learning Arkansas Republican Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders may soon sign a bill that would impose restrictions on drag shows. That's according to \"The Washington Post\".Now, this proposal still needs to make its way, of course, through the State House to the governor's desk, but her spokesperson telling the \"Post,\" \"The proposal is not about banning anything but protecting kids from sexually-explicit drag shows.\" -- unquote. CNN has reached out to Governors Sanders for comment and we are still waiting to hear backup. But that is not all. In her first month an office, she issued an executive order to prohibit critical race theory in Arkansas schools. She also banned the term \"Latinx\" in official documents. And it's not just her. Across the country, more politicians are getting traction with rhetorical and legislative wars on so cold woke culture and language. I want to turn now to \"New York Times\" columnist Nicholas Kristof. He has a new piece out on these language wars and writes, in part, \"I fear that linguistic contortions, however well-meant, aren't actually addressing our country's desperate inequities or achieving progressive dreams, but rather are creating fuel for right-wing leaders aiming to take the country in the opposite direction.\" Nicholas Kristof joins us now on this conversation. I'm glad that you are here. A very thought-provoking column and one that people have been really talking about, frankly, for a very long time. I wonder, in your mind, what is the goal with all of the new words? It is to be inclusive, of course, but you fear that it might be alienating some?",

You mentioned -- you raised the term \"Latinx.\" Okay, you know, 3% of Latinos use the term \"Latinx.\" Representative Ritchie Torres himself Afro Latino, you know, told me that maybe this is more about the agenda setting power of affluent white leftists than it is about the interest of working-class Latinos. Honestly, I'm speaking to you right now from rural Oregon. I think that there are a lot of Americans who, instead of feeling included, feel that the gap between well-educated liberals, often urban liberals who are crafting these new terms, is excluding them and they don't know where to tread and they resent it. And I think that makes them more likely to vote against their economic interests and to support somebody like Governor DeSantis.

You don't want to give aid and comfort to those folks.But that's not the conversation that I'm trying to have. I'm talking about the people who care, the people who really care, but who may be speaking in ways that are confusing or alienating or come across as so morally superior or so intellectually elevated that other people who care feel left out. In other words, in trying to fight alienation, you just sometimes create alienation. In trying to fight exclusion, you might create exclusion. And that is just the moral hazard of trying to move things forward. I think that we have to take that moral hazard seriously. Those of us who do care, I do not want to do anything that's going to make it harder for us to deliver justice. But the way that we're talking sometimes, I think it is actually can be a barrier. Now listen, every generation is going to say, look, we want to do it differently, we want to say it differently. So, you have this generational friction. That is okay. We'll get through it.

U.S. officials say it came into the U.S. over Montano, coming in from Canada, and that's where they began tracking it. First, launching F-22 fighter jets. In the end, a decision was made not to shoot it down.President Joe Biden was asked for military options, but senior military leaders, including chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Mark Milley, advised against shooting this down. Instead, they're keeping an eye on it and seeing where it goes. The Pentagon does acknowledge that this has traveled over several sensitive sites, but they won't specify which sites those are. It is worth noting that Montana is home to ballistic missile silos. So, perhaps that's what this was after. It's also worth noting, of course, that the Pentagon says they are confident, very confident, in fact, that this was launched by China. They brought it up through diplomatic channels both here in Washington and in Beijing, essentially to express how angry they are about this. Tensions with China are, of course, already high. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken is heading to Beijing soon and this will only add to those tensions. Laura?",
