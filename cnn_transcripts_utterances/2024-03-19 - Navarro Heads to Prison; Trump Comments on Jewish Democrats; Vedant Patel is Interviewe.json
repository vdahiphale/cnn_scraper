And when he does, he will become the first former White House official ever jailed for contempt of Congress.In a manner of speaking, he is going to prison for Donald Trump. Navarro refused to comply with a subpoena for testimony and documents from the January 6th Committee. Now Navarro publicly bragged about his work to contest and therefore delay the count from key swing states after the 2020 election. He called it the green base sweep. But he would not testify about it or even take the Fifth. And that is getting him an extended stay in Miami. CNN's Randi Kaye is live outside the prison this morning. How will this go down today, Randi?",

      "sentences": "Well, John, we expect Peter Navarro to show up here shortly. He's actually going to hold a press conference outside this minimum security satellite prison here - satellite prison camp, just before he enters through those doors. He had this emergency request with the Supreme Court, as you know, on Friday to try and intervene, try and remain free while he challenged his conviction, but they rejected that just late yesterday. And now he is expected to serve the four months conviction, the four-month sentence here at this camp.He does now have what's called a prison consultant, John. This is a person who has helped him sort of figure out how to transition from the outside to the inside. And this prison consultant, Sam Mangel (ph), has told CNN that he hopes that Navarro will spend the next four months inside this air condition dormitory for elderly inmates. Navarro is 74 years old. There will be about 80 men in bunkbeds in this dormitory. We also know that he is expected to take classes. He's expected to get a job. We know from the prison consultant that he is urging him to work as a library clerk who could - he could work inside and make - perhaps stay cooler during these warmer temperatures in Florida. And, John, on the inside, Peter Navarro will have access to make phone calls. He will have access to emails. He will also be able to watch the news. So, perhaps he'll be able to pay attention to what's happening in the 2024 campaign. But this is one of the oldest prison camps in the country. And there were plenty of people here from Puerto Rico. This is the closest facility for the Bureau of Prisons to that territory. And we also know that it is right next door, John, to the zoo. And the prison consultant tells us that every day the inmates inside do get to hear the lions roaring. So, for the next four months, or however long he serves here, Peter Navarro will be treated to that as well. And we do expect that he should - he could be out in as little as 90 days, John, according to this prison consultant, because there are laws in place that allow for lesser sentences for an early release for the federal inmates. John, back to you.",

      "sentences": "Right. Well, Sara, we heard swift backlash from a number of groups, as well as the Biden White House and the Biden campaign. I'm going to just read for you briefly some of that response. Here is White House Spokesperson Andrew Bates. He said, quote, \"there's no justification for spreading toxic false stereotypes that threaten fellow citizens. None.\"And then, as you mentioned, we also heard from the Anti-Defamation League denouncing and condemning those remarks as well. But look, the Trump campaign also weighed in. And a spokesperson for the former president defended those remarks. Here's what she said. This is from Karoline Leavitt, his spokesperson. She said, quote, \"President Trump is right, the Democratic Party has turned into a full-blown anti-Israel, anti-Semitic, pro-terrorist cabal.\" So, clearly, very different takes on that rhetoric. But look, Sara, this is the type of rhetoric from Donald Trump that is not entirely new. It is far from the first time that the former president has targeted Jewish Americans. Donald Trump is someone who claims, and I know from my reporting, personally believes that he did more for Israel than any other president in modern history. But there's an interesting distinction as well, Sara, about Donald Trump. And we got a glimpse of it during that interview. He often conflates support for Israel with being supportive of the Jewish population, despite trading in these anti-Semitic stereotypes. And last fall, during celebrations of the Jewish new year, we heard Trump share a post on his social media platform, asserting that liberal Jews who did not support him voted to destroy America and Israel. That was -- those were his words. And shortly after losing the 2020 election, Trump also lamented how his support for Israel didn't seem to resonate with Jewish Americans at the ballot box. He felt at the time, and still personally feels, that Democrats wrongly got a lot of votes from Jewish people. And so, again, this is something that is not entirely new from Donald Trump. We have heard this type of language before. But, of course, some offensive remarks that are drawing criticism from across the board. Sara.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TIM PAWLENTY (R), FORMER MINNESTOTA GOVERNOR: Whatever Trump says doesn't seem to matter. We've all learned that lesson now over years. He can say almost anything, and it doesn't fundamentally change his numbers of support, at least with his base support and with some of the voters that are newly attracted to him.

And I think the case can rightfully be made that Republicans have been strong allies for Israel and the Jewish community. And former President Trump, moving the embassy to Jerusalem, is a big show of support for the Jewish people. And Republicans have been steadfast behind Israel with regard to the invasion and attack by Hamas, strongly believing that Israel has every right to defend themselves and fully supporting Benjamin Netanyahu.And the contrast is what Trump could have pointed out is how Democrats have been extremely divided on this. You have the far left part of the Democratic Party, some even the pro-Palestinian crowd that have advocated for from the river to the sea, the annihilation of Israel, which is absurd. And that is anti-Israel. And then you have many - Chuck Schumer, with the support of President Biden, calling for regime change and Benjamin Netanyahu stepping down or new elections. And the outright continued call for a ceasefire in the midst of Israel trying to defend themselves. Those are key issues that are factual. They are accurate and do show a sign that the Democrats are not as unbored with Israel and the Jewish community as Republicans are. And I think the case could have been made much stronger with the simple facts and not the inflamed rhetoric",

Kelly says that Trump praised Adolf Hitler in his presence. We know from Trump's first wife, the late Ivana Trump, that Trump kept a book of Hitler's speeches by his bed. We know that Trump traffics and anti- Semitic tropes all the time. We know that he had dinner with an alleged Holocaust denier at his lovely resort there at Mar-a-Lago.So, there are facts about Donald Trump and Jews.

They say, well, he's just being a showman.I think it's - it's a lot better, a lot more important for the Biden campaign to be turning it back onto people's lives, rather than simply attacking Trump's character. In other words, attack him on wanting to cut Social Security and Medicare. That's something he said last week. He said he was open to cutting entitlements. That - the president's going to Arizona. Arizona is full of old people, retirees. That's - that's a much more effective attack.

House Republicans now have this like wild twist of Republicans campaigning against other incumbent Republicans, something the House speaker is essentially begging them to cut out. And I'm wondering, what is a bigger challenge that you see for other Republicans this cycle?

So, I think it's best advised for Republicans to run on their own record and run on their own issues and advocate to - directly to the people. And it's proven to be better served if you don't rely on the coattails of Donald Trump in a primary, and especially in a general election. So, in my view, what we're seeing, the stronger candidates out of the primary are the ones who keep Donald Trump at arm's length on the personal level, but advocate for the policies because Republican voters do support Donald Trump because of the policies. And certainly in a general election, his policies are better on the economy, on the border, on national security and safety.
