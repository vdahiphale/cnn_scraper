Just ahead, thousands of people in Ukraine in potential danger as a massive dam is destroyed and rushing water overflows into surrounding areas. The latest on what we know at this hour.Also ahead, Prince Harry in a London courtroom giving evidence in his phone hacking lawsuit against a British tabloid publisher. Details on who he says has blood on their hands. Plus, demonstrators once again take to the streets in France in a bid to stop pension court. Moscow and Kyiv are blaming each other for the destruction of a key dam and hydroelectric power plant in Russian occupied southern Ukraine. Kherson province says nine settlements in the region are already completely or partially submerged, and Ukrainian authorities are urging residents living downstream to immediately evacuate the air area. But flooding isn't the only threat, potentially. The dam supplies water for the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is also under Russian control. The IAEA says it's closely monitoring the situation there and there's no imminent nuclear safety risk. CNN's Sam Kiley joins me now in Kharkiv in northeastern Ukraine. Sam, this information war is raging as to who bears responsibility for this. The dam is located in Russian held territory and there have been reports about flooding and record high water levels lately. What exactly do we know?",

      "sentences": "Well, Bianca, what we do know is that a few days ago, there was a breach of the dam. This dam, as you rightly point out, is under Russian control. The dam -- the lake above the dam was at dangerously high levels, had indeed flooded some residences upstream of that location.And then in the early hours of this morning, there was a total breach. Now, the Ukrainians claim, without evidence at this stage that the dam was deliberately blown up by the Russians in what they say is an ecocide, an attempt to destroy the ecology and cause a humanitarian disaster downstream. The Russians flatly reject that. And indeed, the areas affected are mostly going to be in Russian control. They are going to be on the right-hand side as you look at the map of the Dnipro River, which is controlled by Russia. 80 dwelling settlements, sorry, towns and villages, and indeed the city of Kherson are in potential danger from floodwaters. There have been some evacuations from Kherson. The local authorities there have laid on trains to evacuate people, exhorting people to get out of the low-lying areas. The Russian authorities in Nova Kakhovka say that the town has been completely inundated. And I think, ultimately, the blame for behind -- for who is behind this will always going to be laid at the feet of the Russians because they've had control of that dam for some time and it was breached in the past and they had laid explosives on it. We do know that because that is something the Ukrainians have been very concerned about in the past. It is also slap bang on the frontline between the two sides here, Bianca.",

Thank you very much.Britain's Prince Harry has been testifying at the high court of justice in London as part of his lawsuit against U.K. publisher Mirror Group Newspapers. From the witness box, he accused tabloids of having blood on their hands and said their reporting has caused him distress. MGN has admitted that one of its tabloids unlawfully sought information about Harry on a single occasion, but it has rejected all of his other allegations, saying he has no evidence for his claims. With me on set is CNN Anchor and Royal Correspondent Max Foster. So they're alleging that Prince Harry has no evidence for these other claims. And this is a really key moment for Harry, given that his book, the Netflix documentary, even leaving the Royal family, they're all bound up in these allegations.",

And that information we used in articles which caused him stress growing up, particularly around the death of his mother.This cross examination, which is very unusual to see a royal undergo, and you can feel the sense of awkwardness as well. I don't think he's used to being questioned like this in any sort of forum. But what the cross examination barrister is doing on behalf of the Mirror Group is trying to undermine each of the articles that Harry is pointing to. So he might be saying, do you remember reading this article? He'll say, I don't remember reading this article. So the barrister is saying, how could you have been distressed by it if you don't remember reading it until you prepared for this case? And other examples are that information could not have come through hacking because it was already in the public domain and the palace had already confirmed it in another newspaper. So it's a forensic cross examination which Harry doesn't really seem prepared for. But his general point is always that taken together, these invasions of his privacy caused him distress and made him suspicious and paranoid and affected his mental health.",

Thank you so much, Max Foster.Hundreds of thousands of people across France are taking to the streets for a 14th day of protests against a new pension law. Trade unions insist the fight is not over yet, even after the bill was signed into law by President Emmanuel Macron in April. The reform raises the retirement age from 62 to 64 and was pushed through parliament without a vote, using special constitutional powers. Earlier, protesters stormed the headquarters of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. And CNN's Melissa Bell joins me now live from Paris, where march is also expected to start this hour.

In fact, what the police are expecting is about 600,000 people across France, Bianca, substantially down from before. And that's partly, of course, because the protest movement in terms of its potential to make the government back down, has really reached the end of its road. Parliament is to have a debate, but the government's found a mechanism for getting around any opposition there. So this will become law. And I think that's partly why you see fewer people. It's also why you've also seen, I think it's important to fall, Bianca, in the public support for the movement. This time, it is just 57 percent of the French public, according to the polls, that back today's action up -- down from much higher levels just a few weeks ago. Now, that isn't to say that today will end calmly. They are expecting about a thousand radicals on the streets and have deployed many thousands of policemen. But a distinct feeling that this particular movement is reaching the end of its road ahead of the summer, Bianca.",

And there is no better or more moving place to get a sense of that than where we're standing here, the Normandy American Cemetery.Behind me is Omaha Beach, one of the beaches where the allied forces landed to begin D-Day, to begin the invasion that would go on to liberate Europe. About 160,000 paratroopers, many of them gave their lives. And you can have a sense of that right here. An American flag and a French flag next to every single one of the graves here, marking those who sacrificed their lives. In fact, it was Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, when he was speaking, he made that point. He said he saluted the World War II veterans that were here. About 50 of them were here able to commemorate this event. And he said they saved freedom. We have to defend freedom. And that's the sort of heroism that he views and that so many of those here view those actions and that day and specifically the D-Day invasion itself and the massive operation and the planning that went behind it. Austin also made the connection between 79 years ago, a D-Day, what was a counteroffensive to liberate occupied territory, and what we're waiting for in Ukraine, another counteroffensive, highly anticipated to liberate occupied territory from Russia. Here's what he said earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LLOYD AUSTIN, U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: Every D-Day, citizen by citizen, we remember that we each have the ability and the responsibility to fight for the principles that drove the allied armies forward.

It says Moscow will be responsible if people in Kherson and Crimea are deprived of drinking water. The critical dam is close to the Zaporizhzhian nuclear power plant, but the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog says the situation there is currently under control and there's no immediate risk to the safety of the plant.

We know that the dam was mined back in October last year, and Ukrainian military intelligence warned about that.And that is when there was also a threat that the dam will be blown up before Kherson was liberated, because when the dam was there in place, it somehow opened the way for Ukrainian troops to advance on the other bank of the river. And this is possibly one of the reasons why Russia decided to blow up the dam now, because they are panicking in -- before Ukrainian counteroffensive. They don't know where it will happen. And so they were trying to cut out all the ways which can be used by the Ukrainian Army to move forward. And this is one of the possible areas that Russia anticipates. And now this puts on risk not only the civilian population, but Russian troops itself, because their positions are now flown with the water. And we see videos of the mines blown up because the water is flowing on the left bank of the Dnipro River. And we understand that this -- so the water, the most massively flowing of the water is happening right on the left bank of Dnipro, where Russian troops were located previously.",

The engine department of the dam was blown up. And we saw evidences that Russia was discussing this possibility back in October openly on Russian military channels, discussing that this will stop Ukrainian advance. And all this gives us information and evidence that Russia was planning this kind of attack, terrorist attack, back in October. And now because they're afraid that the counteroffensive might start any moment, they decided to blow it up now. And also it distracts all the attention of Ukrainian special forces to help civilians because now this is a huge disaster happening all along the Dnipro River.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): On the streets, in the skies, and on the sea, rising rhetoric and the U.S. warns real danger of military confrontation, a growing list of U.S.-China flare ups fueling fierce anti-American sentiment among the Chinese public. Chinese state media adding fuel to the fire, blasting the airwaves with outrage. Public perception of the U.S. plummeting.
