More than one million ballots have already been submitted across 30 states.

Aides say the former president is concerned by just how close the polls have been, and he views this election as a, quote, \"all hands on deck\" moment. In CNN's latest poll of polls, this is borne out. Harris and Trump effectively tied at 49 and 48 percent nationally. But this election, of course, it only matters in the swing states really. Today, Donald Trump headed to Georgia and North Carolina. Harris is going to Michigan after campaigning in Wisconsin yesterday, alongside a prominent Republican supporter.

This is what my priorities are. To really a contrast anti-Trump campaign. They want this race to be a referendum on Trump. The ads have gone from biographical and positive to much more negative against Trump. Now in terms of Liz Cheney, they're obviously hoping to tap into the Nikki Haley -- in their minds, the hypothetical Nikki Haley suburban woman vote. And it's unclear -- and it's still unclear if that will be -- if that will be successful. You know, this is sort of an election of strange bedfellows. RFK Jr. RFK Jr. supporting Trump.
