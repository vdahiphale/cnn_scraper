      "sentences": "And I'm Bianna Golodryga.Right now, a critical sit-down set to get underway at the White House. Any moment now President Biden and the first lady will welcome French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife ahead of a bilat between the two leaders. The first state visit of the Biden/Harris administration, the White House hopes that this visit will underscore the deep and enduring relationship between the two countries. But there are, of course, still plenty of issues the two leaders need to work through, including Russia's war in Ukraine, how to approach China, and any potential tensions still stemming from a U.S.-Australia submarine deal that blindsided the French and cost them a multibillion-dollar defense contract. But let's begin this hour at the White House. CNN's MJ Lee is standing by on the South Lawn. So, MJ, what's the president's focus for today?",

      "sentences": "Well, Bianna, just to set the scene for you a little bit here, we've been outside on the South Lawn of the White House where we've been seeing a military proceeding play out. And, of course, the band is playing as well as we wait any minute for the French president and his spouse, the first lady of France, to arrive for a big arrival ceremony. That's really going to kick off the day.And then the middle portion of the day, as you talked about, is sort of the working portion of the day, where the two leaders are going to have a lengthy bilateral discussion on so many things that are at the top of their agenda, including the war in Ukraine, as you said, challenges posed by countries like China, like Iran. And the day will end, of course, with the big state dinner. And one of the reasons, you know, every time there is an official state visit, it is a big deal at the White House. But a reason that there's so much more attention and maybe so much more pomp and ceremony here today and things are sort of on a bigger scale than usual is because the president has not been able to have an official state visit for Covid-related reasons for the two years that he has been in office. So, this is the first time that he is getting to host an event like this. So, my colleague, Kate Bennett, is reporting that some 400 guests are going to show up to this dinner. It is going to be a large tent at the South Lawn. So, in so many ways, there is a lot of diplomacy and ceremony going into the day. Just one more thing I'll note on the bilateral meeting that's going to happen later today. China is going to be an incredibly interesting space to watch, particularly because President Biden, as you know, a couple of weeks ago in Bali, had himself a very lengthy meeting with Xi Jinping, the leader of China. And we are old by officials that the two leaders are expected to trade notes on, among other things, how they sort of manage that working relationship with President Xi. So, that's just one of many issues that the two leaders are going to discuss. And, of course, we're going to be watching that press conference very carefully. A rare opportunity for reporters here and foreign press as well to pose questions to President Biden.",

It's actually Macron's second state visit to the U.S. because he had one here under President Trump. And what's notable here, right, is that relationship was interesting under Trump. Macron trying to establish some sort of rapport there, cooled a bit in the later years. Expecting a lot from the Biden administration, Margaret Talev, but it began with some disappoint. Where does it all stand now?",

      "sentences": "Jim, you're absolutely right. I mean if you compare this relationship to the one with the former president, obviously the Macron-Trump relationship was almost cartoonish in terms of, we're all focused on the what - the size of the parade or the weird bro-man handshake. But there was so much theater. Here, there's much less of that kind of drama, but the drama behind the scenes started right out of the gate with this conflict over a submarine deal that cost France billions of dollars.Now you see a really interesting bifurcation because, of course, Europe, including France, is very happy that the Biden administration is a clear supporter of NATO, clearly embracing the Transatlantic Alliance. You know, they've been important allies, although slightly different positions on Ukraine. But you have those economic tensions. And this is like where the rubber meets the road. In every international relationship, both leaders have their own domestic considerations, as well as their shared international considerations. For Biden, this Inflation Reduction Act, the key vote from Joe Manchin was hugely important for Biden domestically, but it made it harder for non-U.S. automakers in the EV space to sell their products to the United States. So that is a huge amount of conflict between the U.S. and France right now. And so I think you see they're going to be talking about really important areas of agreement on Iran, on China, you know, and on Ukraine, but the sort of trade tensions, and Macron saying, hey, our U.S. environmental policy is protectionist, is something that's going for Biden going to hurt Macron.",

That's likely going to be coming up today as well. MOLLY BALL, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"TIME\": That's right. And that's obviously another really important area of focus for both of these countries. You know, I think, as Margaret was saying, if you sort of pull back the lens from some of the more immediate conflicts and controversies, this relationship is such a perfect window into the difference between this administration and the last one, where, you know, I think a lot of people in the White House feel that the president hasn't necessarily gotten enough credit for the promises that he's been able to keep on foreign policy where so much of what he talked about coming into the White House was repairing those relationships with allies, that - that, you know, he argued that Trump had been so destructive to. And that we saw, you know, Trump, obviously, undermining NATO and the alliance, but also just generally, having, you know, different relationships with our traditional allies. Biden coming in promising to repair that. But, at the same time, as Margaret was talking about, continuing a lot of the Trump policies on trade, not necessarily unwinding various tariffs -",

I think the French president, even as he goes in with that tough talk that we began to hear yesterday, will no doubt continue today, Jim, understands, as Margaret was saying a moment ago, that the Inflation Reduction Act was extremely important for the American president. That these are measures that need to be taken domestically, of course. But he needs to be able to make Europe's voice heard.And, again, because Europe has felt not only that it hasn't been treated right's as a transatlantic partner should on the substance of a number of issues, including this one, but on the form, that it hasn't been kept informed, that it hasn't been looked after and given the love that it feels it deserves. So, we're going to hear from him on all of those issues. And he is, of course, speaking on behalf of all Europeans. It is the German automobile sector that's likely to be hardest hit Europe-wide. They could prepare their own subsidy measures. If ever there was no room for maneuver in retaliation. But it is avoiding that kind of trade war towards which we are slowly headed that he's going to try and find some room for concession, some room for maneuver. And, of course, for the president, on a personal basis, that he has a much easier relationship with than he did the last time he visited Washington for a state visit, Jim.",

We have a little bit more civility in the United Kingdom. Things didn't look that way just a few months ago in terms of the turnover there in prime ministers.You have Angela Merkel no longer the head of Germany.

I don't think we've talked about this yet, so I should tell you, there was an exchange of gifts, which is customary for a visit like this. I'll just walk you through a couple of the things that the French side has presented to the Bidens as a part of this visit. There was a vinyl and a CD of the original soundtrack of a French film. This film happens to be, we are told, the first film that the Bidens went to go see on their first date. So, obviously, personally important to the president and the first lady here. There was also a ceremonial cup, a sweater and a watch. So, a number of things that were presented as gifts to President Biden and the first lady.And, of course, this is just sort of a continuation and a part of the bigger theme that we are going to see throughout the day, really a mix of the American, the French, you know, in terms of the conversations, of course, that they're going to be having, but also just those themes that we're going to see running throughout the different ceremonial events that we're going to see throughout the day and then culminating at the end of the day in the evening at this big state dinner where, as my colleague was laying out before, a lot of the different themes that we're going to see are going to be a mix of the two countries and the two countries' long running relationship and the two different cultures. So, in that sense, you know, it is just going to be a day filled with so much symbolism. And I think for President Biden, you know, choosing President Macron for his first state visit, you know, it's a very comfortable place in a lot of ways for him to be in. This is a country that he has talked about as being the oldest ally for the United States. And I should note, too, yes, this is going to be a very long, bilateral meeting that we see later today. But it's certainly not the first time the two men have spoken. In fact, throughout the president's presidency the first two years, the two men have spoken plenty of times on the phone, in person, including most recently, of course, in Bali, Indonesia, on the sidelines of the G20 summit. You know, one thing that's interesting to note, just to sort of capture how often those conversations happen, you know, President Biden had his big bilateral meeting with the president of China, Xi Jinping. And then, the very next day, there was an emergency meeting that was called in Bali to discuss this missile strike in Poland. And in that meeting, you know, that was another opportunity for President Biden to fill in other leaders, including President Macron, on some of the things that he discussed in that meeting with President Xi. So, again, I think it's sort of not a surprise that President Biden might have chosen President Macron for his first state visit. It is going to be sort of a, you know, a fun day for him because this is somebody that he is very comfortable with, in addition to, of course, being a day that is filled with a lot of work.",
