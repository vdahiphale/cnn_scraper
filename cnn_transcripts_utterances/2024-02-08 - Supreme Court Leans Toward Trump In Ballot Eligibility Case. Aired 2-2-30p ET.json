And it only got more and more. His lawyer didn't face the kind of scepticism we usually hear from justices who are critical of different positions. And then, when Jason Murray got up to represent the Colorado voters, that's when you could really feel like the case was almost over.You know, it really felt like it ended pretty early. And then, in terms of the atmospherics in the room, the justices were not interrupting each other much. They were kind of pulling back, even though they had started the morning kind of on the edge of their seat, waiting to hear the arguments. And remember, to reverse the Colorado Supreme Court, the Supreme Court has to find only one flaw. Just one, anything, of the multitude of grounds that our audience heard today, only one, and that will send it back. But let me just go to, with one comment from Justice Elena Kagan on the left.

While he did talk about it, he did so at his home in Florida, not in front of the court. You hear him continuing to say he has this high level of respect for the court.

So, this is our road to 270. This is our current race ratings. If it's red or pink, it's leaning towards Trump or it's safely in Trump's camp. If it's light blue or dark blue, it's leaning towards Biden or safely in Biden's camp. And the yellow states are the true toss-ups right now. Okay, Brianna? So, I just want to fill in some of that hypothetical.Let's say Donald Trump actually were to win in Arizona. So, he wins the whole Sun Belt. We have Nevada leaning his way, Arizona, Georgia, those competitive states go Trump. Let's say this congressional district in Nebraska goes to Biden in the Omaha area. Okay? And now let's say Biden restores a bit of the blue wall and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin indeed fall to Biden. [14:20:09] Now we have Michigan leaning to Trump right now, but if Trump were invalidated from the ballot in Michigan, like Elena Kagan said today, well, look what happens. He drops down to 268.

We would certainly look at caucusing and removing ourselves from the primary so that we could allow our voters to decide which candidate they want to support and ultimately send delegates to the national convention. But the bigger problem is what happens for the general election. And the other thing that the justices talked about, which I thought, was very thoughtful, is the cascading effect that it would have if they upheld the decision by the Colorado Supreme Court. I think it would be a constitutional crisis in the making. It would create chaos all over the country. And it would have a retaliatory effect with Republican states looking at getting rid of Joe Biden on their ballots. We can't go down that road, and we certainly hope the Supreme Court doesn't.",
