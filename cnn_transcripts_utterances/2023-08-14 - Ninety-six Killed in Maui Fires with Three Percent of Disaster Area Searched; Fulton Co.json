You know, we're saying don't go to the burn zone, unless you're a resident and I haven't been there.We're not here to sightsee. We're here to provide long-term relief. And it's important that I think the world understands that this isn't, you know, rush, rush, rush. This is a marathon. It's going to be a long journey, and we have to embed and take care of those in need. And the world really, I think, needs to understand that the first responders and the individuals doing searches are still looking for bodies. That's a really horrific thing. It's not that they're incompetent, I think it's just an enormous tax, and this is the worst fire and over a hundred years for human loss, and it's a major tragedy. It doesn't need to end when the media cycle ends, it needs to continue. The crisis isn't the fire. The crisis is the human impact to the people who lost their lives.",

You can see their parachutes open as they were expelled from the MiG- 23 on Sunday afternoon. The jet later crashed in the parking lot of an apartment complex in Wayne County. Officials say two people who ejected landed in the lake. They didn't suffer any significant injuries, thank goodness. No one on the ground was hurt either. No word on what triggered that ejection.
