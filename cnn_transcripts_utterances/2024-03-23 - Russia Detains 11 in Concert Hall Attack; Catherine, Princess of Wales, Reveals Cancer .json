ISIS says it was behind the attack. There's disturbing video showing the attack and people running to escape. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRUNHUBER (voice-over):  Other video shows the moment when gunmen opened fire inside the crowded auditorium. In the aftermath, part of the concert hall was engulfed in fire and surrounded by emergency crews. Moscow's governor says the fire is, quote, \"mostly eliminated.\" CNN's Ivan Watson has covered Russia extensively and he joins us now live from Hong Kong. So first, what's the latest on the attack and those detained? IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Right. Well, we've learned now that the death toll, as you mentioned, has grown to at least 93 people killed with Russian authorities predicting that that death toll will continue to grow. It will make it one of the deadliest terror attacks that Russia has seen in years. Among those wounded there are many dozens that are in serious condition, at least 44. And they include two children. Investigators are on the scene of the Crocus City Hall, that concert venue, which was still smoking as of sunrise this morning, with emergency workers clearing some of the rubble. The roof had caved in in places. And meanwhile, the investigators saying that they were able to find some of the weapons that had been used by gunmen as well as their ammunition, that they were going through recordings of security camera videos and starting to talk to some of the survivors themselves to piece together what exactly happened. During this deadly attack that started around 08:00 pm local time on Friday, before the Russian band, Picnic, went onstage. Take a listen to one survivor, in fact. This is a husband of a woman who attended the concert, desperately trying to find his wife in the aftermath of the attack. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  I'm in complete panic, my whole body hurts, even my heart. Blood pressure rose and all that. I took medicine and I felt better. I don't know what to do. Complete hopelessness. My friends can only tell me just to wait for the list of victims, wait for the phone line at the hospital to open up. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He has not come out to address the Russian people at this time, though spokespeople are saying that he is abreast and he's being briefed on this issue.In the run-up to this and I just mentioned connections to Ukraine or alleged possible connections to Ukraine. It is important to note that ISIS has been on the horizon of the Russian security services. At least four times this month alone, Russian state media reported of Russian counter terror operations targeting alleged ISIS militants, killing them, foiling, in their words, a plot to attack a synagogue in Moscow. Go one step further, the U.S. embassy in Moscow on March 7th, published a warning to U.S. citizens, saying stay away from large gatherings of people, including concert halls because of intelligence of possible extremist attacks in the area. An additional wrinkle here, on Tuesday, the Russian president himself, Vladimir Putin, came out on camera and said that these warnings coming from the U.S., which had been delivered to the Russian government, were provocations aimed at destabilizing Russia. So we will be important to see how he then deals with the fact that there were warnings about possible extremist attacks just before this deadly, deadly incident that  Muscovites are still reeling from.",

The Biden administration has been very open and blunt about the fact that they do not support that operation.

A fortnight ago, \"The Sun\" urged all those spreading baseless conspiracy theories about the princess to lay off. We hope the trolls who continue to have vile behavior hang their head in shame today. Will they? BASHIR:  Well, look, there has been intense scrutiny over the last few weeks. We've seen the memes, we've seen conspiracy theories on TikTok. We've seen, of course, media outlets as well, questioning where the Princess of Wales has been. The last time we saw her in public before that video released by \"The Sun\" came out was during Christmas. So, of course, there has been a lot of questions about her well-being, where exactly she is. And the princess actually kind of touched on that in her address. She said that she needs time. She needs privacy as well. And this is a personal moment for the family.",
