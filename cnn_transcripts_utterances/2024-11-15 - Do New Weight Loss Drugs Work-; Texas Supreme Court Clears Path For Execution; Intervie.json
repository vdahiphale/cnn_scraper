His conviction more than 20 years ago was based on allegations of shaken baby syndrome and has gotten a lot of attention. But his attorneys argue that diagnosis has been discredited. I want to bring in CNN's Ed Lavandera. What more can you tell us, Ed?",

There was instant blowback when president-elect Trump announced the MAGA loyalist as his attorney general pick, and the criticism is growing two days later.Lawmakers in both parties are demanding to see the findings of a House ethics investigation of Gaetz that focus on allegations of sexual misconduct and illegal drug use. But that probe ended when Gaetz abruptly resigned from Congress Wednesday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RICHARD DURBIN (D-IL):  I want to know what's in this Ethics Committee report. It's a bipartisan investigation of some extremely serious charges. That has to be public. Let the American people then decide whether he's competent and qualified. The timing of his resignation and flight with president-elect Donald Trump suggests he believes that this report is not friendly and favorable. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Do senators have a right to see the report on Gaetz before potentially voting on his confirmation and do you expect to see it? SEN. ALEX PADILLA (D-CA):  Look, I believe we do have a right to see not just the report, but all the supporting documentation and evidence that has led up to this near-final report. If we are going to be true to our obligation as senators to conduct a thorough vetting and background before we can even consider this nomination, which we know is beyond troubled at the outset, just what's in the public domain is already disqualifying, I believe, for Matt Gaetz. But, hey, this is Donald Trump's choice. And so let's go through the process. What are they afraid of by holding on to the report or even skirting a typical FBI investigation, background for members of the committee, both sides of the aisle, to consider?",

Or is he talking about playing ball in terms of living up to our obligations as a Senate to have genuine confirmation hearings and review of Trump nominees?Look, as troubling as Matt Gaetz and all of Trump's nominees and announcements so far are, the bigger question here is also, this is a test of Senate Republicans, not just Republicans in Congress, but the Senate specifically. Will they stand up and live up to their obligations that they accepted when they took the oath of office, or are they simply going to bend over and rubber-stamp anything that Trump wants? So, the question is on Republican leader-elect Thune and every single Republican in the Senate. [11:45:13] BROWN:  Do you agree with the next Senate majority leader, though, that Trump's overwhelming victory should factor into weighing qualifications in getting some of these picks through?",

Second, if you want to look at numbers and mandates, when President Biden was elected, his national vote margin was more than seven million votes. Donald Trump's national vote margin is half that and shrinking. So it's not a mandate, and it's certainly not moral high ground or moral authority here to just give the president what he wants.",

But I applaud a couple of my Republican colleagues who've already publicly expressed their concern and reservation with some of these selections and announcements.

BROWN:  Sources tell CNN that president-elect Trump's transition team is bypassing the traditional FBI background checks for at least some of his Cabinet picks. They are relying more on private companies to do so. They think that it'll be faster, among other reasons. Does that concern you?",

Who better than the FBI to conduct a background investigation and provide to both the president to consider before he makes a nomination or to the Senate to consider before considering confirming?We have got to ask, what are they worried about? What are they afraid of? What do they have to hide? Second, it's not shocking. I mean, Trump's selection for attorney general is Matt Gaetz, and he is already on record wanting to abolish the FBI. So, this is nothing other than Trump loyalty tests at every turn, both in who he selects, the processes he's trying to follow, that he just wants his people in place to do his bidding, regardless of the law, regardless of the Constitution, regardless of the safety of the public.",

According to a sweeping new study, nearly three-quarters of U.S. adults are overweight, nearly three-quarters. Wow, the study is published in \"The Lancet,\" and it shows a steep rise in obesity rates since 1990. In 2024, many Americans are turning to some popular injectable drugs to lose weight. I bet you have heard of them or maybe you're taking them yourself. Dr. Sanjay Gupta is back with us to answer some of your questions about these medications. Hi, Sanjay. So let's start with a question from Maria in Florida. She is asking: \"Once you reach your weight goal, can you stay in a lower dose or space out injections for weight maintenance and to keep food noise away?\" DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, well, the short -- this is a great question. The short answer is yes. I mean, we're typically used to hearing about a medication being prescribed, taking it at a very specific dose and not adjusting it. But I think people are tailoring these medications, such as Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, Zepbound, which might mean, as you point out, taking a maintenance dose, not increasing the dose, or lowering your dose, or spacing out your dose. That's something that's happening quite a bit. And you should do this in conjunction with a doctor, so that you can just make sure you're doing this appropriately and checking important biomarkers and things like that along the way. I will tell you something that's interesting, Pamela, is that if you look at the data, more than half the people who start these medications do stop taking them within 12 weeks, which I thought was really interesting, because I think the belief was that these were going to be lifelong medications for most people. Not the case. We also find in a new study that about 80 percent of people who do stop the medications are able to keep a lot of that weight off. We're not entirely sure why, but it probably has a lot to do with adopting lifestyle modifications, in addition to the medicine. So it's not just a medication for those folks, but a burst of motivation to sort of get their lifestyle in order as well.",

      "sentences": "OK, well, the first part of the question, I think that there is a pretty clear link between the use of these medications and fertility.It sort of started off by seeing these hashtags, Ozempic moms, people who are not able to get pregnant, went on the medications, and then were able to get pregnant. And then it was increasingly studied. And there -- found to be at this correlation between weight and most likely something known as PCOS, polycystic ovary syndrome, which can be associated with infertility. Lower the weight, lower the PCOS, and that's why they're probably more likely to get pregnant. It's not yet an indication for these medications. So that's the insurance part of this. It'll be harder to get insurance to cover it. But if it's associated with obesity, it'll be a BMI of 30 or higher, then it should be associated -- then it should be covered, Pamela.",
