It just is National Defense Information, something which implicates the national defense. And it seems to me that if you've got documents which are top secret, and compartmentalized that per se, implicates the national defense, so I think his authority to declassify is irrelevant to the espionage charge.

Now, it's been difficult to kind of forecast what's going to happen with the smoke and the wind, and the weather. But officials have warned that conditions could still worsen again later today.

I'm going to step out of the shot while our photojournalist Steve Williams pans in here. He's going to zoom in here. We're at the Marine Corps Memorial in Arlington, Virginia also called the Iwo Jima Memorial. On a normal day, on a straight line, you can see past the Iwo Jima memorial to some of Washington's most famous monuments. You can see right past it in a straight line to the Lincoln Memorial and then to the Washington Monument. But look at the view right now. Look at that haze over the Potomac River and then beyond. You can see the Lincoln Memorial kind of in shadow there. But then look at the Washington Monument behind it. You can barely make it out. And again, even on a rainy day, you can see these things very clearly. But look at this. And even the Marine Corps Memorial, which is about 80 yards away from me, and yes, pathetically I did pace it off, you can -- it's still -- the Haze is kind of affecting your view of it that close. So that's kind of what we're looking at here. We did talk to two people earlier, one commuter and one lady from out of town who were trying to navigate their way through this.

He later said he lied, that they were not where he said they were at all. Now, this morning began around 7:00 a.m. in Lima, Peru at a maximum security facility that Joran van der Sloot was being held at, and the International policing agency Interpol took custody of him at 7:00 a.m. Eastern time according to the Peruvian prison system. They said that they transported him to the Air Force Base in Lima, where U.S. FBI were waiting. They transferred that custody to the FBI.
