And in order to get a reduced sentence, they have to cooperate with the -- with the prosecution. And you're saying in this particular case, he's pleading guilty, he's going to get a reduced sentence, but he's not going to cooperate. Is that right?",

Initially, they were looking to charge him with five counts of perjury.They allowed him to plead guilty to two of these counts on what Prosecutor Gary Fishman had said in court today was that one of the reasons they were agreeing to this deal in this sentence was because of Allen Weisselberg's age. He's going to be turning 77 years old this year. He had already served time in Rikers. But Fishman was saying that it is still important to bring this case because as he put it, perjury tears at the very fabric of our justice system, Wolf.",

Now, Colorado Secretary of State General Griswold has offered some reaction to this.In a tweet, she said that states should be able to enforce the insurrection clause.

The vice president is making her most forceful call yet, for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.CNN's Arlette Saenz is over at the White House for us.

He's also slated to meet here with National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan at a time when the U.S. is trying to pressure Israel on several fronts. One being trying to get more humanitarian aid into Gaza as to alleviate some of the human suffering there but also, as the U.S. is pressing hard when it comes to a temporary ceasefire.Now, this visit from Gantz, Israeli officials say, is not sanctioned by the Israeli government. The Israel's ambassador to the U.S., Michael Herzog, has been told not to participate in the -- these meetings. Of course, according to sources familiar with those talks. And it is, as you noted, notable that Gantz is Netanyahu's lead political rival in Israel. But the U.S. is trying to hold conversations as they're trying to move these negotiations when it comes to a ceasefire along. Yesterday, we heard Vice President Kamala Harris really speak in quite stark terms and forcefully about the need for an immediate ceasefire. That's -- she's talking about a temporary one around six weeks, saying in a speech that Hamas needs to agree to the deal that is on the table. But she's also saying that the U.S. -- that Israel needs to ramp up its ability to get aid into that region. She said that there is no excuse at this time. And so, these are all things that likely will come up in that meeting with Benny Gantz a little bit later today, as the U.S. is hoping that somehow there can be some type of agreement to bring a temporary ceasefire to this conflict.",
