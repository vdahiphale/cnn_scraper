We'll bring you the latest details emerging about what's going to happen in the next 24 hours.

Security preparations are already underway at the Miami courthouse, ahead of Trump's arraignment, tomorrow afternoon. Sources say law enforcement officials are rather worried about the potential for large crowds of Trump supporters outside of the courthouse, given what happened on January 6th.

It's the fact that they are concerned that people who are going to show up here are going to try to start some kind of trouble like we saw on January 6th. And the feelings here are much different, Jake. That's what I have found so striking, are much different than what we saw when the former president appeared in Manhattan. That could be because of where we are, we are in Florida, more supporters here. It could be the nature of the charges, much more serious. But there seems to be this feeling among law enforcement officials that things can get ugly here. A lot of people will show up, and they want to make sure that the local officials are prepared. When I asked the mayor about this he said, well, there's nothing to fear. We are going to be ready. A little shocking to hear him say that. But I want to give you a look, Jake, across the courtroom -- the courthouse here, outside. What it looks like. You talk about really the non-existing security right now. This could change. When you look around from our drone video here, you can see it's a very open area, Jake. So basically, right now, from everything we are told, now this could change. There are no plans to put any kind of metal barriers down, like we have previously seen. And then, Jake, you could also see -- here is that yellow tape, all around the courthouse. I think you can see there. This is the entrance into the courthouse. This is where people go in, this is where the media is gathered, presumably, from everything we are told, that the supporters and protesters will be allowed to gather. We will see how things change as the hours go by, and as we get closer to tomorrow but honestly, Jake, there is some real concern here over the security preparations.

I don't know how much law enforcement here in Florida may be concerned about it. There is a different tone, right, between what people here on the ground are feeling, and thinking, versus people outside of here, who are seeing the intelligence, who are reading information about the people who want to come here.

The indictment alleges he was absolutely involved in that. Now, documents get shipped down to Florida, to Mar-a-Lago. The first place they are stored is in this room, in the white and gold ballroom.

And then finally, this is really the most important place where they land. These documents are moved to a storage room. There's one incident in the indictment where the attendant goes in and find classified documents. They're blurred out, but the indictment says highly classified documents, spilled on the ground. And, the indictment says that this is the storage room right here, it says it was accessible by a hallway, which you could get two from, among other things, the pool patio. This is the poll right here. It was often kept unlocked. This becomes a locust for the obstruction charges. They get a subpoena from DOJ, they move the boxes into the storage room. They get a lawyer to go through it. But in the days before the lawyer appears, Trump has 64 boxes of documents pulled out of there and only 30 returned.

To this case, we know that the grand jury was seated in Washington, D.C.So, pretty much this entire investigation happened up in Washington.

Eventually, prosecutors realized that most of the alleged criminal conduct happened down here at Mar-a-Lago. [16:20:01] So they had to bring this case down here in Florida.

Well, a few other people have spoken out about it.One is former attorney general, Bill Barr. And, he, you know, called it like he sees it. At least most people have known him for a long time say. And her words sort of followed that. But look, there has to be, there is an audience in the Republican Party, and the Republican primary electorate for people who do not like this. So, I think that she's probably playing to some of that audience there. It's interesting, because in the last indictment, some of the candidates went the other way. They were critical initially out of the gate, then they were slapped back. So they reverted to supporting him. So, we'll see if others join her in the support here. But I think she also, interesting, went on to say, there could be another indictment, and another indictment. So she continued on the case here. But the Republicans I've been talking to both in Iowa and New Hampshire today. You know, they voted for Trump in the first place. They believe this indictment is very serious. Most people are not going to read the indictment. I get that. But I think any early polling and things, we just have to wait and see how this settles in.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): Ukrainian military video purporting to show strikes on Russian positions, behind the front lines, as Kyiv says its forces have dramatically ramped up their offensive operations, taking several villages over the weekend in the southeast of the country. This drone video, the Ukrainians say, showing their troops is sweeping a settlement and taking several prisoners. The same unit displaying Ukraine's flag, after the battle. They tried to push back with their artillery, the soldier says, we managed to seize back the initiative and slowly liberated the settlement one house after another. But Ukraine says it's attacking you these Russians in several areas of the vast front line, Kyiv remains coy about whether the long anticipated large-scale offensive has really begun. The head of Ukrainian military intelligence releasing this video, of himself, just sitting at his desk, with a message, plans love silence. But the Russians say they are holding the line in most areas. This defense ministry video allegedly showing a Russian chopper, destroying Ukrainian reconnaissance vehicles, in total, the Russians say they've already destroyed a large number of Western provided armor, including German made Leopard 2 main battle tanks, and U.S. donated Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. But as Russia's defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, hands out medals to Russian soldiers, the infighting between Russia's military and the Wagner private military company continues. Wagner boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, refusing to abide by a defense ministry decree to sign a contract with the Russian army, saying his mercenaries are more efficient than regular troops. Unfortunately, most military units do not have such efficiency, he says, and precisely because Shoigu cannot manage military formations well. Balancing the rival factions in his war machine, a tall task for Vladimir Putin, as the country celebrated Russia Day. Putin urging people to keep supporting his war in Ukraine, while calling it a difficult time for his country. Russia is based on faith and people, he said. People who go from victory to victory, basing their lives, and all their work, on faith -- faith in victory, faith in justice, faith in Russia. (END VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (on camera): But, Jake, Russians fate certainly is being tested at this point. The Ukrainians saying in the past week alone, they took back seven settlements from the Russians. It's not only the south of the country. It's the east of the country as well. Ukrainians are saying they made significant gains over the past couple of days, in the Bakhmut area also -- Jake.",
