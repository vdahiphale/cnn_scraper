It's 10 a.m. across Ukraine where the battle lines are being drawn in the southern port City of Kherson. An advisor to Ukraine's president says the heaviest of battles are coming against occupying Russian forces. Well, right now, fierce fighting is reported in the Donetsk further east. And Russian strikes hits the Kyiv region early today, although no casualties are reported. More than 70,000 civilians have left Kherson in the past few days, along with Russian officers and elite military units. Ukraine says Moscow is sending in its newest recruits, which it describes as cannon fodder. Well, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reports Russia has used 400 Iranian made drones to carry out attacks on civilians and infrastructure. He says between 60 and 70 percent were destroyed by his military. On Wednesday, the Russian president repeated Moscow's claim that Ukraine is planning to use a so-called dirty bomb to provoke Russia. Ukraine and its Western allies. Say that a claim is a -- that claim is a Kremlin effort to create a false pretext for escalating the war. Well, earlier, CNN's Nic Robertson asked the head of Ukraine's defense intelligence agency about the dirty bomb allegation.

They are denying this. The ambassadors you had there denying that Russia has any plans to use any nuclear weapons, but it's confusing coming off the back of the fact that in this conflict so far, Russia is the only party to openly threaten any kind of nuclear activity. We've had a constant drip, drip of these threats over the past few weeks. In the middle of the all this, we saw President Putin on Wednesday personally supervising via video conference, Russia's nuclear drills. These are annual drills. This is routine, but still happening at a time of heightened tension and of course, a warning from him as well, that there is a high risk of global conflict. So, I think the denials from Russia will not stop the concern mounting in the west, as you said, the NATO secretary general, not for the first time coming out on Wednesday and warning Russia, again, not to use this as a pretext for escalation in the conflict.",

They didn't have never taken full control of Donetsk so it continues to be heavily contested. And of course, the other major focus right now in this conflict is the Kherson region.

It's normally, at least, 21 days you have to monitor a situation to see if you're on top of this chain of transmission. They have now got mandatory quarantine, and especially in Kampala, if you happen to be a contact of a confirmed positive case, it's those old school methods of contact tracing, quarantining and isolation, that really will allow the government to stem the tide of this outbreak.

Well, Hadas Gold is standing by in Jerusalem. Hadas, tell us more about this deal.",

Now, Lebanon's gas fields have not yet been fully explored, but the Lebanese are hoping that just the possibility of gas and oil being able -- being able to be extracted from that waters will bring some very much needed investment to the Lebanese economy.Now, what we're expecting now is any moment now the Israeli cabinet is expected to formally sign this agreement. Then it will be flown by helicopter to Israel's northern border. Will be then brought to a U.N. base just on the other side, on the Lebanese part of the border En- Nakur. And then the two sides will be together. There's still -- we're still not sure whether the two sides will actually be in the same room or whether they will both be signing the agreements with the United States in separate rooms. Because again, the agreement is actually not one with each other. They're each country is signing with the Americans. And then what's notable is that each side will also submit these border coordinates to the United Nations. And some analysts are saying it's actually the first time that Lebanon is recognizing, sort of de facto recognizing that the state of Israel is there and that it has a maritime border. And there is a lot of hope that this agreement not only will help economically for Le -- for the Lebanese, will also help the gas supply in Europe, but also importantly, it will keep the security situation between Israel and Lebanon at a calm state.",

His first since becoming leader of the Conservative Party and Britain's Prime Minister on Tuesday. He had only 24 hours to prepare to face the House of Commons and the conservative benches behind him were full of cheers and support for the new prime minister as energetic and boisterous as I've seen them in a number of years.Keir Starmer, the leader of the Labour Party, and Ian Blackford, the leader of the Scottish National Party both sincerely celebrated the fact that Britain's new prime minister is of Asian heritage. Starmer didn't waste too much time on celebration and pleasantries, though before he started asking hard questions. To begin with, revolving around Sunak's reappointment of Suella Braverman as home secretary. So far, his most controversial appointment since becoming prime minister. That's because Braverman was fired as home secretary six days before her reappointment. She was sacked by Liz Truss for a security breach. So there have been questions raised and eyebrows by the Labour Party and other opposition parties as to whether or not there was some kind of deal made behind the scenes between Sunak and Braverman. But in terms of giving his party more confidence and more enthusiasm for the prime minister and the direction of the party, Sunak seems to have delivered. It was interesting to see him go up against Keir Starmer as both politicians have some similarities in terms of their communication style. Known for being serious, having a good grasp of the brief, and detail. Watching them go toe to toe, it seems that Sunak may be able to get his wish, which he said at the beginning of this prime minister's questions, which was to have serious grown-up exchanges with the leader of the opposition.

And clashes broke out across Iran Wednesday as thousands went to Amini's burial site in her hometown to mark 40 days since her death. In an exclusive investigation, CNN looks at the final hours of Iranian teenager Nika Shahkarami who was among the many protestors on the streets days after Amini's death. After analyzing more than 50 videos obtained by CNN and speaking to six eyewitnesses, there's evidence she was chased and then detained by police just a few hours before going missing.
