Maybe not but we know they have oceans of young women who follow them and just as importantly they are young women that Donald Trump has no practical conduit to reach. These people are the conduit to these people and when Trump has been struggling with female votes there's very little indication that he can somehow turn this into something good for him and we know he loves being considered an A- lister.

Remember back in 2020 he had that big rally out in Tulsa and all indications were that a bunch of K-pop fans and TikTok fans, young people signed up for a whole bunch of tickets they had no intention of using and suddenly he had a bunch of empty chairs and a bunch of empty venue space that made him look bad. That could be a reason that Donald Trump is very wary of what young people do and what young women may do and why Charlie XCX may be a lot more powerful than even she knows in this election.

We don't know still to this day who exactly is behind it, who the artists or artists are. The one you showed, that was the first one that popped up. Pelosi's desk, a replica of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's desk. That's on the National Mall right by the Capitol. And you can see that basketball-sized BM sitting on top of it.And on it, there is a plaque at the bottom of the statue. I want to read it to you. It says: This memorial honors the brave men and women who broke into the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021, to loot, urinate and defecate throughout those hallowed halls in order to overturn an election. President Trump celebrates these heroes of January 6th as unbelievable patriots and warriors. This monument stands as a testament to their daring sacrifice and lasting legacy. A little bit, I think, of sarcasm in there. I sense just a little bit. And then cut to Monday when another statue popped up. This one just a couple blocks away from the White House in Freedom Plaza. It is of a tiki torch. It is titled the Donald J. Trump Enduring Flame. And the plaque on this one reads: This monument pays tribute to President Donald Trump and the very fine people that he boldly stood to defend when they marched in Charlottesville, Virginia -- referencing, of course, that 2017 white supremacist march. It says: While many have called them white supremacists and neo-Nazis, President Trump's voice rang out above the rest to remind all that they were treated absolutely unfairly. And I can tell you, having been out there at these statues yesterday, they're becoming a tourist attraction here in D.C. Take a listen. A week out from Election Day, the message really resonating with some voters. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
