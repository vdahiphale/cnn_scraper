He's willing to put the former president behind bars if he once again violates a gag order in the case. Now, that warning came with Judge Juan Merchan ruling today that Trump violated the gag order nine times for a total fine of $9,000. And just moments ago, Trump removed the post criticizing trial witnesses from his Truth Social account and his campaign website, which is what this recent ruling ordered him to do. And all of this was just minutes before the deadline given to him by the judge. Now, the first witness on the stand today was Michael Cohen's former banker Gary Farro. Now, he testified about the paperwork connected to the payment made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. Behind the scenes, the former president appears to be unhappy with his lead attorney, the \"New York Times\" reports that Trump has been complaining Todd Blanche is not being aggressive enough, and that Blanche should be attacking witnesses, the jury and the judge. And note throughout all of this, Trump is not able to speak in court, so likely wants his attorney to do some of that for him. Now, on the left side of your screen, you can see key updates from the trial -- oh, sorry, that's that way. Key updates from the trial, CNN has reporters inside the courtroom keeping us up-to-the-minute on what's going on since cameras aren't allowed inside. Everything they see and hear will appear on that side panel. CNN justice correspondent Jessica Schneider is with us now. All right, Jessica, so, we seem to be getting more into the nitty-gritty details of the case that the prosecution is building today with what we're hearing from witnesses.

Court is now back in session, resuming with the testimony of attorney Keith Davidson, who previouslyrepresented Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougall to Women Central in the prosecution's case against the former president. Right now, they're going through text messages that attorney shared with the prosecution. The \"National Enquirer,\" which was a tabloid that was central in the catch and kill schemes, essentially trying to identify negative stories about Donald Trump and killing them with the collaboration of Trump's attorneys. That is where we are right now in witness testimony. Today though, the jury has heard from multiple witnesses over the course of today, including the former attorney for Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels, who I just mentioned. And Michael Cohen's former banker who provided details about the $130,000 payment to Daniels, which is at the center of the case. Now, at the start of the day, Judge Juan Merchan fined Trump $9,000 for violating his gag order nine times. The judge also warned Trump that future violations could result in jail time. U.S. National Security Attorney Bradley Moss joins me now from Washington. So, I just want to get your read, first on Judge Juan Merchan's ruling on the gag order, including bringing up the possibility of jail time. BRADLEY MOSS, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ATTORNEY: Yes, I think this is a pretty measured approach from Judge Merchan because it didn't cross that line. It didn't cross the Rubicon, so to speak, and immediately go to putting Donald Trump in jail, which would have obvious political, public relations, and constitutional implications if he had done that. He basically gave him a very clear warning. I'm finding that you willfully violated the protective order. I'm holding you in criminal contempt. I'm imposing these monetary fines, which obviously for Donald Trump are nothing. And if we do this -- have to do this again, if you violate this order again, I'm not above just putting you in jail at this point. It's a clear warning. Donald Trump some -- seems to have at least gotten the message for the moment. The posts were deleted from Truth Social as required by Judge Machan's order. So, we'll see what happens going forward. We know he doesn't like sitting in this courtroom day in and day out.

That isn't true. These cases have all gone through the legal system. They've produced indictments through grand juries. But in the hands of a demagogue, really, who is as talented as Donald Trump, that can be a persuasive argument for many voters. And going back to Bradley's point that he was just making there, it's true that there is a rational, legal explanation and path for these cases to take place, a narrative, if you like, what the prosecution is giving to the jury, that this is election interference. The problem is, it's a complicated argument. Does that really break through politically?

I spoke to some of his supporters. And many of them only seemed to be emboldened when that indictment came out. But that was also during the primary process. We're, of course, entering into the general election side of things here. Do you expect there to be a difference in how voters perceive, you know, these mounting, indictments and potential convictions, as opposed to what we saw on the primary side of things?",

I think we know that the Trump campaign is very worried about the possibility of a conviction because they've spent so much time, along with trans legal team, of trying to delay the other cases, many of which get to the -- you know, the attempt to steal the 2020 election and Trump's hoarding of classified documents appear to contain much more serious alleged offenses than what we've heard -- been hearing about in the hush money case, which after all, dates back to 2016, an election that was taking place eight years ago. So, I think there is some reason to think that in the swing states like Michigan and Wisconsin that Trump will visit tomorrow, in some other states like Georgia, where suburban voters, more moderate voters, Republicans who are disaffected with Trump, are very important, it could have an effect. And of course, we know, the margins of this election are expected to be very slim in just a handful of states. It doesn't take much, the swaying of 10 or 20,000 votes in a country of 350 million people can decide who the president will be.",

These are pictures from Chapel Hill,and this is the home of the University of North Carolina. Now, what we understand has been unfolding the last few minutes, and bear with the cameraman there and the camerawoman, because these are very lively scenes. Police in Chapel Hill, this is just from moments ago in fact, are now physically pushing back protesters, as you can see there. We saw earlier students carrying Palestinian flags and chanting. They had breached barricades and surrounded a flagpole, basically. While being pushed the protesters -- we'll just try and see if I can hear them. This is live now, live images coming into us from the University of North Carolina. But earlier, the protesters were chanted that people united will never be defeated. These are scenes, of course, that we have seen being playing -- played out right across the United States, from East to the West Coast, of course. Columbia University was really the epicenter of this all. But we saw similar scenes, if you remember, yesterday in Texas, at Austin University there. But clearly here, tensions running very high at the University of North Carolina as police push back protesters. Now, we are keeping a close eye on these images, as we have done throughout the week. As soon as there are any developments, we will bring them to you. But as I was saying, Columbia University, which really was the epicenter of these demonstrations, now says students occupying an academic building there will face expulsion. Now, overnight, dozens barricaded themselves inside Hamilton Hall. They broke windows, you can see, blocked doors and chanted free Palestine. A law enforcement official tells CNN New York police have no current plans to enter Columbia's campus. Earlier today, the White House said President Joe Biden respects the right to free expression, but demonstrations need to be peaceful. I want to get the latest there for what's happening on the ground. A rare inside look is Julia Vargas Jones. She's a student at Columbia University and works as a reporter here for CNN. Julia, great to see you. Look, yesterday the threat was of suspension. Today, the threat is of expulsion. Just talk us through what the university is saying and what the protesters who are holed up inside are saying.",

A person familiar with the plan says the Drug EnforcementAdministration will move to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug. That would put marijuana on the same level as prescription drug like tunnel (ph) with codeine. Joining us now at CNN, Senior White House Correspondent MJ Lee. And, MJ, I mean, this was pretty significant. Just talk us through what this could mean, how soon this could happen.",
