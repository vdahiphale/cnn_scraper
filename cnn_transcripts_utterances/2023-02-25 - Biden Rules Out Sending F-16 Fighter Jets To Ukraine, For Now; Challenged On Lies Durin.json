They had been preparing for the worst. In fact, all we've seen is an intensification of the fighting along that eastern front. And we've been hearing from the Ukrainian military, again, this evening about the outcome of the day. What they say is that there have been -- there's been a lot of exchange of fire all along that frontline, a number of towns including Bakhmut, of course, the center of so much fighting and violence over the course of the last few weeks, again, pounded as Russians try and take this town, which would be extremely strategically important for them. The Ukrainian military holding their line for the time being. Although what we're hearing on Russian state media, are soldiers -- boasting of the fact that Ukrainian lines are tired, and they believe they will be able to take this town shortly elsewhere on the front line. Still, again, more fighting against leman, more fighting as well in Donetsk region, around Avdiivka. These are towns for the most part that have been fought over so much, Fredricka, over the course of the last few weeks, that you're largely talking about piles of rubble that are now being disputed. But the point is that this is a frontline that is essentially stabilized for so much of the last few weeks. That is being bitterly fought over as Ukrainians try to hold it and advanced with, as Russians try and make either symbolic or significantly strategic advances. The point is, it is a war of attrition that is now focused along a single -- a single front line. And for the time being, there isn't much sign that, that is changing, Fredricka.",

You know, usually over the year we may have three or four incidents at individual airports across the United States, but this is a lot of incidents in a very short amount of time and especially because there's in the middle of what we call the runway incursion and mitigation act. So there's things going on right now to try to improve the runways. They're looking at the geometry and is it -- can you see what's going on outside?But I think one of the things that is less looked at is how much the air traffic controller themselves is seeing or looking at what's going on the field. A lot of times they don't have a visual access to what they see on the runway or what they don't before they give approval to land on the airport.",

They do. So that certainly is a factor in how this goes on. I am concerned about it and I think that not only the NTSB is looking into this, but the FAA has their own division that's responsible for overseeing air traffic and that's within the Flight Standards Division.So it concerns me that the oversight agency is within the same FAA that's doing the air traffic. And there's a level of that. But there needs to be an external look at this and not just an individual one like the NTSB is doing, but an oversight group that's active in participating in these types of events.",

One is the proximate cause, the things that could have -- the last thing that could prevent it before it happened, and of course that is the pilot. And if you notice in each of these, the pilot is a critical factor in avoiding these types of situations. So it's not to be said lightly the fact that the pilots are responsible too to make sure that the runway is clear before they land on it. So that is the part that gives me safety and solace is the fact that the pilots are the last ones that look down and say, hey, is there a runway or is there an airplane on there, and they're doing a good job of that.The reason that it concerns me is why should it get down to the pilots to have to make that? So when you're looking at the investigation, you have to look beyond that proximate cause and look at the latent causes, the things that happened before. Example would be how quickly they allow those airplanes to get dispatched, how quickly the runways are taking off. And just because the air traffic is higher, you have to slow things down and quit letting the airplanes get onto the runway before they're ready. And I think that's the first thing that needs to be looked at to mitigate this problem.",

I think it is truly a systemic issue.It has to do with the entire air system and the fact that we're relying on the proximate mitigation, the last person that can stop it to happen. There needs to be safety up the line, and I think that has to do with the system, but not necessarily anything to do with the airlines or how they're doing their operations.",

So it is 100 percent legal, but not 100 percent agreed upon by our community. I'm a trans person myself, so I was happy to join and happy to defend our rights.

PITTS: As soon as I got my medication, I started getting 100 percent on every test, to the point where my teacher forgot later in the year that I'd ever struggled. COHEN (voice-over): She even won a national merit scholarship. But then, I few months ago, just before exams, right when her BYU application was due, she got this text from her mom, Rebekah, who was at the pharmacy. There's some manufacturer shortage and they don't have any. I don't know what to do. Honestly, I'm just sitting here crying because I can't get you these meds. REBEKAH PITTS, CLARA'S MOTHER: And I spent several hours calling, I think, eight pharmacies. I felt really emotional about it in that first week or two that, strangely, like I had failed my child, even though it wasn't my fault. It was hard to tell her and try to help her to understand, we won't be getting this medication any time soon. And I felt scared for what that would mean for her as a senior. COHEN (voice-over): Clara is one of many Americans impacted by recent widespread drug shortages, of cancer drugs, antibiotics, pain medicines, and, since last fall, Adderall. The FDA says one reason is that demand for Adderall has increased from 35.5 million prescriptions in 2019 to 45 million last year. Plus, some companies that make Adderall tell the FDA they've had shortages of an active ingredient or supply constraints. Another company just says other as a reason for limited supply. The FDA telling CNN, manufacturers are working to meet the demand. And the FDA is helping with anything we can do to increase supply. The FDA doesn't give many details about what's gone wrong or how they're going to fix it. And experts who study drug shortages say that's part of the problem. DR. YORAM UNGURU, JOHNS HOPKINS BERMAN INSTITUTE OF BIOETHICS: I think transparency is extremely important. It's really difficult to be able to anticipate and let alone come up with meaningful solutions if you don't know what the problem is. COHEN (voice-over): Clara did get a prescription for a different ADHD medication, but she says for her it's not the same. In the meantime, her hard work at school has paid off. C. PITTS: Rise and shout Clara. I am happy to offer you admission to Brigham Young University. COHEN (voice-over): Acceptance at her first choice college. C. PITTS: I'm going be a Cougar, mom. I'm so glad. COHEN (voice-over): Thrilled, but still hoping to get Adderall to help her through it. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
