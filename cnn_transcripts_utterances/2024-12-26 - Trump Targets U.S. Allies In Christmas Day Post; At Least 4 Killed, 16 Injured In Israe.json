Look, this strike from Israel on the main airport in the capital, Sanaa, and also on two power plants.This comes after four out of the last seven nights saw people in Israel, across Israel, millions of them, including myself and my 11- year-old daughter on Saturday night scurrying for bomb shelters as ballistic missiles we're lobbed towards Israel from Yemen. Now, Israel says that it was attacking infrastructure that it says was being used by the Houthis to smuggle in Iranian weapons, which it was then using against Israel. And Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, earlier this evening here in Israel, saying that these attacks on the Houthis would continue until essentially the job is done. And that job that Netanyahu is talking about is really dealing with what Israel perceives to be the last man standing almost among the -- what it calls the Axes of Evil of Iran's proxies. In the sense that Israel has managed to batter Hezbollah in Lebanon pretty much into submission and to that cease fire in the north that has decimated Hamas, and which doesn't seem to pose an existential threat to Israel anymore. And the only ones that really seem to be able to threaten Israel. Of course, on top of Iran are the Houthis themselves. Now, others in Israel have suggested that rather than going after the Houthis, they should be going after the head of the snake, namely Iran. That's certainly what Yair Lapid, the leader of the opposition, has been suggesting. But certainly, for now, it seems there will be no letup on Israeli strikes on the Houthis in Yemen. And the Houthis themselves saying that if Israel thinks that it's attacks on Yemen are going to stop them from, in their words, \"showing their solidarity and support for the Palestinians,\" then Israel, in the words of one of their official accounts on X, \"is delusional.\"",
