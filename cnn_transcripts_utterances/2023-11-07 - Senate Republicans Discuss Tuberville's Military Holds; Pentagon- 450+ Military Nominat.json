He said that he will not back down unless the Pentagon scraps its policy that provides reimbursement to military personnel traveling out of state for abortion services.

All of key positions, of course, that are being filled at this point by people with lesser experience or in some cases experienced people are holding two jobs at once.And that is not only affecting, of course, military readiness, but it is also affecting mental health. I mean the deputy -- the Deputy Defense Secretary, said just last week that there have been tragic consequences to this hold, including the Commandant of the Marine Corps, who has been performing two jobs and just suffered a cardiac arrest, something that she said speaks for itself.

And the Pentagon has not said one way or another whether they support a rules change in the Senate to make sure that these nominations go forward.
