In fact, he lost support in the second round of voting. 22 Republicans opting to vote against the Ohio Republican, while his team has vowed, they will keep going.We're joined now by someone who voted against Jordan twice, Florida Republican Congressman Carlos Gimenez. He voted twice for former Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Congressman, great to be with you. Is it time for Jim Jordan to give up on becoming speaker? REP. CARLOS GIMENEZ (R-FL): Well, look, I'm never going to give Jim Jordan advice as to what he should do, but obviously he now had another day to try to convince people to come over his side and it obviously didn't work. He actually lost a net, two votes. I suspect that if we go to a third round, I think we'll probably end up with more people voting for somebody else. And so, you know, he's got to take that -- he's got to do the calculations himself and see what he wants to do. But I'm not going to give him any advice.",

Was the mayor of Miami-Dade County represented 2.8 million people, got elected three times, twice as Commissioner. And so, no, I don't succumb to pressure. I do what I think is right. And you know what? That usually works out in the end. And so I'm very comfortable where I'm at right now.If somebody tries to pressure me, then I go into the wind. I don't go against it. Because what will happen is if you succumb to pressure, then all you're going to do is for the rest of your career, you're going to be pressured and that I don't want to be -- that's I don't want that to be part of my career.",

And, you know in my -- when I was mayor and in Miami-Dade, I had a cup in front of me, it was, you know, service before self -- service before self. That's the hallmark of public service.

And so I would expect for him to say, hey, look, we can -- let's -- we know we have issues here, but we need to get America's business rolling, the Republican agenda moving and so we need to give speaker designee McHenry more powers. I expect that from him. Not this whole thing, do we have to work with Democrats? I don't think we have to.

And so I will -- I will support the right of every group here to demonstrate peacefully for what they believe in. Obviously, I don't agree with this group. I think that Israel has every right to defend itself.Look, if Israel allows Hamas to exist and they're just going to degrade their capabilities. Hamas will rearm and Israel will have this happen to them again. The only way to defeat Hamas is to destroy Hamas.

And I want to mention the name of Hearst Poland, who's a member of my community who's still captive in Gaza. His aunt and his grandmother live here in Skokie. So we're hurting. And it's been very hard.And then we heard about this horrific crime. This horrific murder of a boy because of his religion, because of his identity. Just the murder of an innocent. And just as we've stood out and called out terrorism against our people, we needed to call out this horrific terrorism against a young Muslim boy. And so we went. And it wasn't simple. You know our communities are very similar in certain ways, but also very -- view things very differently in a lot of other ways. But it was important to affirm our shared humanity and to affirm that children deserve the right to not be murdered for who they are. It's a very low bar, but that's we have to at least come together and agree on that. And that's why we went and it was powerful. And, you know, we were -- we were welcomed and we shared our condolences. We shared the fact that thousands of Jewish people from the Chicago area, including local high schools and organizations all have condemned this horrific crime and that none of us, you know, want this. None of us want this at all. And it was -- it was very meaningful to be there.",

You know, when children are actively targeted and killed for who they are, that's evil. And we have to call that out. So I think it's like holding both. We have to be able to hold nuance and complexity and there's a lot of complicated things in the world right now and be able to listen and learn and think openly and expansively about them. But also to be able to strongly say, you know what, evil is evil, murder is murder, terrorism is terrorism, and wherever it happens, we call it out.",
