I want to begin though with President Biden's trip to the UK. Joe Biden said looking to bolster the so called special relationship between Britain and the United States. Right now he is in Windsor meeting King Charles III for the first time since the Royal Coronation. There was a lot of pomp a lot of ceremony as they took part in the inspection of the honor guard. As you see from these pictures the pair is going to be discussing climate change among other issues as well but climate change being the main one. Earlier the President met with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak at Downing Street to talk about Ukraine ahead of tomorrow's key NATO Summit in Lithuania.

Let's not forget, you know, when the UK was a member of the European Union, it had a greater role for the United States as being a voice for the United States inside the European Union. That's gone. President Obama was sort of putting more emphasis, perhaps on Germany and France than he was on the UK. Does this reset with Rishi Sunak? I don't think reset is perhaps the right way to look at it, but it puts it on a firmer footing and this is the sixth meeting that the pair have had in six months.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): The U.S. and China are still rivals but at least they're talking after 10 hours of meetings across two days in Beijing. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she expects more regular communication between the U.S. and China. She added that the world is big enough for both to thrive. In Beijing, Yellen said that she had direct and productive talks to Chinese economic leadership, including Premier Li Chang and Pan Gongsheng the new Party Chief of China's Central Bank. She said the U.S. and China were on steadier footing despite significant disagreements. Here is Yellen at a press conference at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing on Sunday. JANET YELLEN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: But President Biden and I do not see the relationship between the U.S. and China through the frame of great power conflict. We believe that the world is big enough for both of our countries to thrive. STOUT (voice over): Within hours of that statement, President Biden had more pointed comments to make about Chinese Xi Jinping in an interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria.

Tensions have flared over trade targeted sanctions, and access to technology like semiconductors of the U.S. has curb China's ability to acquire advanced microchips fearing that they could have military applications. Yellen reiterated that the U.S. is not seeking to decouple from China, which would be \"Disastrous and destabilizing\". But she added that the U.S. would continue to protect its national security interests. Chinese state media described the talks as productive and said that overstretching of national security does no good to normal economic and trade relations.

So on that level, perhaps in may discuss what might be done about that. But I don't think it will go into any more detail than that, because there are fundamental differences between the U.K. and U.S. governments on that have emerged only in recent weeks, cluster bombs, for example, which is something that Britain doesn't support. That's what the U.S. is supplying to Ukraine. Also, Britain nominated their Defense Minister for the Head of NATO and President Biden reportedly blocked that also Britain relaxing Ukraine becoming part of NATO much more quickly than the U.S. would. So there are tensions there. I don't think in Charles going to delve into that, because that's a matter for the Prime Minister discussed possibly this morning. The climate meeting, though, is interesting, though, because you can imagine in the past, the Queen would have similar meetings like this Queen Elizabeth the second, the late Queen, and they would go retire into the castle, and they would have a tea. King Charles also did that with President Biden. But then they went on to this meeting, which is a climate meeting, Chief execs of American and British banks, discussing how to help with climate change on developing countries. And that's really unusual. And for many people, climate has become a political issue. But for Charles, he is showing his continued interest in that topic, having been a pioneer on it. So I think this is interesting in the sense that is the way Charles is carrying out a new type of monarchy, as distinct from his mother.",

I think that the Queen in many ways transcended monarchy, because she was the longest serving Head ofState in the world and so many other Heads of State would look at her, would love to have that picture with the Queen because she was this historic figure that defined and punctuated so many different phases of history. So that's what she represented. And I think that one of the reasons she kept her discussions confidential was to allow other Heads of State to ask her really frank and honest questions, which everyone knew wouldn't leak. I think it's different with Charles he's been around for a long time as well. The first serving President that he met was President Eisenhower in 1959. So does have that experience, but not such a towering legacy. He's very early in his monarchy. So he's handling things slightly differently. He is more of a campaigning monarch. So he's just doing it slightly different from the Queen. And there's some controversy to that. But I think people also like the authenticity that comes with that as well. He's more honest about his feelings. The Queen never ever gave us any suggestion of her feelings. So we didn't know her as well. But of course, that made her, Zain, a more universal figure, didn't it? Less people objected to her views, but she just didn't ever express them.",

Now, what's interesting about President Biden's most recent remarks on the fruits carriers show was that he puts him in the camp with Germany, which has been possibly among the most cautious, shall we say, in offering Ukraine a clear path to membership. I think it's safe to say the majority of the NATO member states. Certainly the Baltic states, and Poland and a few others, have come to the view that a clear path is necessary not only for Ukraine, to maintain what remains of its territorial integrity, but to prevent the risk of further Russian interventions elsewhere, which is very live, and something that the Baltic States and Poland had been warning about, for many years, frankly, falling on deaf ears.",

But he sort of touched on this idea of there still being preconditions and requirements that needs to be met. Obviously, I know that Ukraine has worked on many of these requirements, especially corruption, but corruption was something that President Biden touched upon. I mean, so what are your thoughts on that? The fact that it might not be as simple as, as soon as the war is over, there is a clear fast track path for Ukraine, but it might take a little bit more than the war to be over. Just walk us through your thoughts on that?",

So we have a 10 year and almost adecade of process related to transformation based on the nature rules and standards. So we have a really good background, and it's already seen by the results on the battlefield. At the same time, we are ongoing through the process of joining the European Union, which is formalized, and which has started after the political commitment given to Ukraine last year with the candidate statues. So we have been under very serious and comprehensive reforms related to judiciary, rule of law, anti-corruption. There are things to be done, but many things are already behind our shoulders. So it's only showing that we are in a process and the commitment is there. And the capacity to deliver is there, despite the very fact the war is raging on. So we have heard the signal from President Biden loud and clear. And we held that overview summit, which will launch the NATO Ukraine council meeting. There will be a discussion on the shape and the format of the political commitment which could be taken, given that the discussion even at the level of the leaders are still going on between our Presidents, the leaders, allied countries at the level of us ministers. And the final vision and the final commitment are not yet there agreed, although the meeting will start tomorrow already.",

So obviously, things have changed over the past year and a half. And Ukraine needs real concrete pledges, a true commitment here. What is Ukraine? What is Zelenskyy looking to get out of this summit that starts tomorrow?",

I mean, kids love this stuff. They add my niece and nephew. I was just in London and it's gone viral over there as well.
