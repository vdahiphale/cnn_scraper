      "sentences": "Right. What I've been told from these advisers, Phil, is that essentially all of this is part of a larger negotiating tactic on Donald Trump's part. Now, what I'm told that the intent really is here is to try and force some of these foreign leaders to the negotiating table.One, to try and help bolster U.S. trade, try to, you know, end what Donald Trump thinks are practices and deals that are taking advantage of U.S. companies. But also to try and curb both China and Russia's influence, abroad. Now let's talk about the Panama Canal specifically for a moment. Donald Trump believes, I'm told, that essentially the canal is taking advantage of U.S. companies. And what he really wants, his overarching goal is to try and lower the rates for different vessels to pass through the canal. He also believes, that China owns a lot of the ports in the canal, and that's effectively given them control over some of these, shipping rates and which vehicles -- or, excuse me, which vessels and ships are able to pass through. For Greenland, for example, Donald Trump believes that somehow having more control -- the United States having more control over what's going on in Greenland or being able, to work with Greenland more could deter Russian influence in the Arctic region. Again, all of this is part of what they argue is some sort of negotiating tactic or really, Donald Trump trying to strong-arm some of these leaders show that he's coming from this position of power to bring them to the table. Now this is what one adviser specifically told me about this. They said, quote, \"Everything has to be looked at in terms of curbing Russia and China influence while also protecting the economy.\" Now one thing that I also found interesting is, it did seem because Donald Trump has been so fixated on the Panama Canal this week, that it kind of came out of nowhere. But when I talk to these people and sources close to Donald Trump, they say he's actually been fixated on this for months. And pointed me to an interview he did with Tucker Carlson on X in August where he brought up the Panama Canal. He said that he thought it was a mistake that Jimmy Carter, then President, negotiated this treaty that gave control of the canal over to Panama, and that essentially he believes and feels that China is now really calling the shots there. So this is something that has been kind of percolating behind the scenes in the mind of Donald Trump. All to say, what you laid out, Phil, is he is he going to be able to buy Greenland? Is Canada be going to become the 51st state? No. I don't think that's going to happen. But what Donald Trump does believe is that maybe some of this rhetoric could help him get some sort of better deal down the line once he's actually sworn in. Phil?",

And fantastic reporters joining me now at the table, CNN's David Chalian; CNN's Kristen Holmes, and Bloomberg's Justin Sink.Guys, what I find so fascinating about what Alayna was just walking through is, there's been a lot of tweets related to Greenland, Canada, and the Panama Canal. There have not been any tweets related to the complete implosion of two of his closest advisers and his base on X over the course of the last 36-ish hours or so. [12:05:00] So much so that, like, even though we can't say tweeting through it anymore, because I guess we'd be Xing through it, it feels like Elon Musk is quite literally trying to tweet through it on some level.

To that point, I think this has been hard to pin down for all of the rhetoric and very clear agenda items on Donald Trump's immigration planning and what he did in his first term. He's always been a little bit kind of back and forth on this issue of high skilled workers, on visas for high skilled workers.He said, was kind of ambiguous about it during his first term even as his administration, the denial rates for these visas, jumped dramatically. They suspended them at one point during 2020. Internally, his team was working hard, it seemed, to cut back legal immigration. I don't think -- it seemed that way that it actually was happening. Externally, the President-elect has said things like this. Listen to the contrast of these two sound bites I want to play. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL- ELECT: Two simple rules: Buy American and hire American. You graduate from a college, I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a Green Card to be able to stay in this country. And that includes junior colleges too. I know of stories where people graduated from a top college or from a college, and they desperately wanted to stay here. They had a plan for a company, a concept, and they can't they go back to India, they go back to China. They do the same basic company in those places, and they become multibillionaires employing thousands and thousands of people, and it could have been done here. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But watching this unfold was very interesting. And I think that, clearly, Donald Trump, and as you saw there in that podcast, has had somewhat of a development on this topic in particular.Now as David said, he has often been opposed to not only illegal immigration, but also legal immigration, particularly if you look at the case of Springfield, Ohio, the Haitians who were there illegally. So, clearly, he is trying to pick and choose here. But what has been so interesting about this is that some of his loudest supporters and strongest supporters, including people who are aligned with Steve Bannon, who have huge followings, Laura Loomer, who is a little bit more on the fringe, but still is considered a big supporter, have been outright attacking Elon Musk and this entire idea. What will be interesting is to see what Donald Trump actually says. He can say whatever he wants on this podcast, but if you look at any of what's going on social media as these fights unfold, you're seeing both sides picking and choosing things that he's saying, saying Donald Trump gets it. Here's what he said at this time. Donald Trump gets it. Here's what he said this time. Now Donald Trump is going to have to weigh in at some point as we move forward and he is getting inaugurated and becoming president. So this is going to be an issue that comes up.",

It's just a really strange message to bring to a base that, in fact, sort of embraced masculinity, embraced, you know, barstool culture, that sort of thing. And, it's going to be an interesting sort of friction for them to navigate.It's not totally on new. Jared Kushner, you might remember, tried to bridge this gap during the first term. And he went and he met with sort of far right immigration groups, and he met with corporate interests. And he came out with an immigration plan that is not dissimilar that to some of what the kind of tech bros this time around are rolling out. And then it immediately hit into a wall because the president's MAGA base said, wait, wait. You're not requiring forms to actually verify that workers have legal status. You're not requiring restaurants to do that. And it just kind of crumbled. And so this is going to be a problem, I think, not just in immigration, but across president's agenda. He's promised a lot of things to a lot of people. And now he's going to have to prioritize or run the risk that none of his agenda gets done.",

You're right that there's long been kind of stories and whispers about members of Congress who have been showing up for a long time and basically not functioning in their job.Their chief of staff tells them how to vote. Their staff does all their work for them. But the difference there is they continue to win reelection over and over again. So it doesn't change congressional majorities. With Joe Biden, you know, age was undeniably one of, if not the central, sort of question of this presidential race. And so as a result, you know, if you're a Democrat, you have to look at what happened and say, do we need to put more guardrails in? Do we need to think about things differently? And Republicans who have seized on it are probably going to go through the same conversation, over the next 4 years as Donald Trump gets older and older and likely faces some of the same challenges that Joe Biden did. So this is just going to be an issue that that comes in front of mind. It's a tough one because we've seen people like Nancy Pelosi and Mitch McConnell be very effective, in the older age.

I haven't had these conversations since I talked to my own parents about, you know, their aging and their limitations.\" Which gets it something that I don't know about you guys, I heard this a lot after the debate from people not in our world who said for them, what they saw in the debate stage was reminded them of conversations they'd had with their grandparents or with their parents when things were moving in a direction that weren't necessarily positive for their health.

And part of that is, like, Donald Trump himself is 78 years old. What he said a week ago or 3 weeks ago, whatever it was, is I am nowhere close to 80. He -- that is how most people think.Now most people don't have the enormous amount of power that these people in Congress and, you know, now Donald Trump will have, but people tend to not be able to actually see themselves deteriorating, which is why a lot of companies have a retirement age capped at 65 years old or at 60 years old.

Those staffers are using their connection to that Congressman when they leave Congress as lobbyists, as consultants, as everything else. The current staff wants that power as well, utilizes that power as well. There's a whole infrastructure behind these individuals. Justin, I was looking at the or watching the chairmanship or sorry, ranking member races in the Democratic House Conference, where you saw some young members were able to actually bounce out or kind of quietly replace some of the older folks. And then you also had Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez lose a race that I think a lot of progressives were really hoping, particularly given the role, as the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, which is a very public facing role, very attack dog role.

And I think for Democrats or politicians on both sides of the aisle, because this is a bipartisan issue and one that both have faced. There is going to have to be this resolution at some point, but I think it -- as with everything, will take a long time and will be a difficult road. And you saw that you know, Joe Biden was able to hold on to power because in a large part, the system was set up to protect the president from primary challenges and from outside bids.
