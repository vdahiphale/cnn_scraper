The question everyone has, that and everything else you need to know about the debate rules. And an OUTFRONT exclusive tonight, former President Trump in never before heard audio gushing over Taylor Swift. You'll here are the word he uses to describe her five times. Let's go OUTFRONT. And welcome to a special edition of OUTFRONT. Good evening from Atlanta. I'm Erin Burnett and I am live from the CNN debate headquarters here. We begin with the breaking news: off the charts. New reporting tonight, just about 24 hours before tomorrow's presidential debate on Biden strategy. The president looking for more opportunities to look directly into the camera during the 90-minute face off. The president leaning on a tried and true technique for him, one that advisors for him say it sent dial testing, quote, off the charts and right now, I can tell you that the stage is set inside the podiums are in place for the current president and the former president. The two men will be standing just eight feet apart, much closer than any other time they've debated. And this is the first time that CNN is revealing the spin rooms. Take a look at that, top allies at both campaigns will be tomorrow night at room trying to say that their candidate won the debate, be up to 700, 800 people in that room, because make no mistake. This is the most important event in the 2024 election so far. Biden spending now his sixth day at Camp David in preparation for the debate. Trump this afternoon, meantime, called into what conservative online channel discussing some of his tried and true favorite topics. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We have tremendous crowds. But the people understand it. We're Leading in every poll and we're leading every swing-state. The mug shot is the best -- it just beat Elvis Presley and Frank Sinatra by a lot, by the way, beat 'em by a lot. But that's the number one mug shot of all time. It's really an amazing thing. It's going to be big. And they say maybe the biggest. Somebody said, this will be the highest rated show of all time. I said, don't tell me that. I don't want to hear that. (END AUDIO CLIP)",

So we're going to answer that for you. Phil Mattingly is going to walk you through that and more from start to finish president. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN CHIEF DOMESTIC CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): President Biden will enter from the right side of your screen. President Trump will enter from the left side of your screen. The podiums are eight feet apart. Directly across from them -- the moderators, CNN's Jake Tapper and Dana Bash. [19:20:03] Now, a reminder that this is a television studio. There's no audience. Candidates will have two minutes to answer questions and one minute for responses and rebuttals. At the moderator's discretion, there may be an additional minute for follow-ups, clarifications, or responses. So how does a candidate know how much time is left to speak? Attached to the cameras in the studio and in the candidate's field of view or the timing lights. When the light show yellow, there are 15 seconds left and candidates answer or response. When the lights flash red, there are five seconds left, and when the display is solid red the time is up. At that point, the candidate's microphone will be turned off and the other candidate will have their microphone turned on. My colleague, Victor Blackwell, has more on that.",

So I'm standing at one podium and I'll ask Phil to come in and take the other podium. And so let's say I'm answering a question. My light is green and I'm speaking.

Trump has not, according to his team, done a single bit of that, saying that debating is more of an attitude, more than anything else. Governor, is that true? TIM PAWLENTY (R), FORMER MINNESOTA GOVERNOR: Well, I think the approach to preparation in this debate reflects the style and the personality and the outlook of these candidates. Joe Biden has spent a lifetime in public service, steeped in issues. He's been in the Senate basically since his 20s and vice president, and Trump is intuitive. He is spontaneous and he's not really going to prepare. So you can have more than one style that could work, but I do think what you just described fits each of these two individuals and how they think, how they present and how they prepare. BURNETT: You know, Andrew, I remember at the -- at the debate that I did out in Ohio, you made some -- I forgot exactly what the comment was, so, now, maybe going against sorry about to say, but the point is you made one very memorable comment and I know that in so many of these debates, that's what it comes down to, right, Kamala Harris is that little girl was me, right?

It's interesting because in this audio clip, we have an intersection of two of the things that matter most to Donald Trump: fame, which Taylor Swift is one of the most famous people on the planet, and his perception of beauty. And I think even Donald Trump knows that Taylor Swift is so famous that he can't go up against her even though she didn't endorse him in 2020. And so you hear him kind of trying to negotiate what to say about her. And later on in the clip, I've been asked if he's familiar with Taylor's music and he says no.",

He is obsessed with ratings and always was.And for him, ratings translates to poll numbers, which translates to popularity, which translates to him getting peoples attention.
