But we've dedicated this week's holiday program to those who are finding common ground around solutions to some of the most dangerous divisions plaguing our entire world. Following one of the most contentious elections in modern history divider-in-chief Donald Trump will reoccupy the U.S. presidency come January. Republicans took control of the White House, the Senate and the House and Democrats warn of the mounting threat to freedoms and democracy. Now with the best will in the world, is it possible for a nation so fractured to come together again? If anyone has an answer, it's the renowned political scientist Robert Putnam. In his landmark book \"Bowling Alone\", he warned of the collapse of American civic life. Before the election, I spoke to him about his latest work, the documentary film \"Join or Die\", where he explores what's driving people apart and what it might take to rebuild. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And we have had periods in our country, most of the time in our country, we've been a nation of joiners. And that's why our constitution, it's not just that the words on the paper are good, they are, but it's that they've been sustained by this living constitution among us. And that's what, you know, 125 years ago, because of the Industrial Revolution, basically, had begun to collapse. We restored that. And now, we've got to restore it again. And in the very short run I kind of fear that we're not going to move in the right direction, but I'm talking about the next decade or two.

Like my grandmother was born in a concentration camp and most of my family was murdered in the Holocaust.And today, like, sadly, anti-Semitism is on the rise. It's on the rise among the right-wing and it's also shamefully on the rise among the left. And because of that, it's very important that this word will not be used to silence real and legitimate criticism of Israel's occupation or of Israel's, you know, horrendous policies all around the land. And when people use this word not only to silence Palestinian critics but also Israelis like me who believe, you know, that what is going on is wrong, they are emptying it out of meaning. And precisely because we should care about anti-Semitism, this is even more dangerous. And I think it's literally putting Jewish lives as well in danger.",

Yet despite those checks, gun deaths and mass shootings continue apace in America. Despite the overwhelming majority of Americans approving of common- sense gun safety laws, lawmakers remain paralyzed, often in hock to the powerful gun lobby.
