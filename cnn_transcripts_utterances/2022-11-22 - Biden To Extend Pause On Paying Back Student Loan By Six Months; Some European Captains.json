For that reason, the sector of education is extending the pause on student loan payments while we seek relief from the courts, but no later than June 30, 2023. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And I blame FIFA and I blame Qatar as well, but mostly FIFA. And here's why. You know, when you choose the country, you choose the consequences. And Qatar has laws on the books. Homosexuality is illegal, with fines and jailtime, up to three years in jail. And so, when you choose a country like Qatar to hold a World Cup, you're going to have situations like this occur. And the pride flag is the universal flag for inclusion, for the gay community, for the LGBTQ community and it's known the worldwide. And they were stopping him because he had the flag and the pride colors on. And it is strictly homophobic. And it's just astonishing and very upsetting to me.",

Now, most of us are not in relationships with dolls, but we are in relationship with these. Increasingly more so. In fact, I would argue that most of us are even addicted to these and what's available on them.Look, algorithms have so much power over us based on the data that's been collected on our habits. They know what we like, what we dislike, what makes us feel good, what we like to buy. In some ways, these algorithms know us better than we know ourselves. And we are certainly spending time with these devices much more than we are spending with human beings themselves. I mean, look at kids, they would rather forego human relationships, relationships with their friends or playdates, then they'd rather be on these devices. And so we really explore the implications and what it means for the future of humanity. I mean, as a species, we need human connection in order for -- in order to be able to survive and thrive.
