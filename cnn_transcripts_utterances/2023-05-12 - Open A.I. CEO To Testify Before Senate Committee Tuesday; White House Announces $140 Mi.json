On Tuesday, Congress is expected to hear from the CEO of a leading A.I. Company. Sam Altman of Open A.I., the maker of the controversial ChatGPT, will testify before a Senate subcommittee. It will be the first chance for lawmakers to ask him questions since ChatGPT gained massive popularity and raised major red flags. In a minute, we'll talk with tech mogul and A.I.

Life is funny. My head of comms sent me to a conference in Italy that I said I didn't want to go to. And my first night in Rome decided to just go out and met with some friends, had a couple too many drinks. And by the time I got him, let's just say I was hung over in the morning.And because I'm addicted to coffee, I wondered downstairs. I asked the nice lady at the restaurant for some breakfast. She said, no, it's closed. But if you really need some coffee, just go sit by the pool and we'll take care of you. And I grabbed the table, opened my laptop and then the assistant of my now wife tried to shoo me away, actually tried to get me to leave, and I refused. And I said that their party was welcome to come join me if they wanted to use the table. And, yes, she turned around, we started talking, yes, the rest is history. So, look, I don't know how it ended up the way it did, but now I can't imagine my life without her and obviously without Olympia. It's pretty wild, so, very, very fortunate.",

But I'm an entrepreneur, so I don't say things that I don't earnestly mean.And so I interpreted that to be a real invite. And I thought, all right, cool. And two weeks later, I'm there in Paris for the weekend and she's shocked that I showed up. But, eventually, you know, we find ourselves on a date together wandering through the streets of Paris. And people would be murmuring. They'd be like, oh, is this, you know, Serena Williams. And then they would look at me and be like, oh, no, no, not possible, definitely not with him. It's okay. It's not Serena. So, it was kind of a fame antidote for her. And we spent the whole day together wandering around and, yes, we did stumbled into the zoo during feeding time and watched the beautiful like snow leopard just eviscerate rabbit, spraying guts and all kinds of stuff, and she tensed up.
