All right, I am standing here on the debate. This is a historic moment on several levels. First of all, we've never seen a president and vice president debate each other to become the president again. Second of all, this is a very different stage. They have a lot of different rules. And so I want to give you a look at exactly what they will be experiencing and what you will be experiencing. So, here we are. The candidates will be standing here on the stage. President Biden will be coming from your screen left. President Trump will be coming -- sorry, President Biden will come for your screen right. President Trump will be coming from your screen left. Each of the candidates will have two minutes to answer the moderators' questions. They will have one minute for rebuttal after that. And then if the moderators decide they need to clarify something, they will get another minute. But I want to give you an idea of what they're going to see. So, my photographer, Tony (ph), is going to come around here to show you their view of this large room. You will see there is where the moderators will sit. Our Dana Bash and Jake Tapper will sit in those two chairs and be speaking directly to the president and former president, asking the questions. We also are giving you a look at what they have. They are not allowed to have notes during this debate, but they are allowed to have a notepad and a pen already set up here for both of them. Let me give you some sense of just how close they will be because this is unusual as well. They're basically within reach of one another, about eight feet apart. And then they're going to see exactly when they are actually on camera and actually speaking and the audience can hear them and when they're not, because they're going to be looking at lights on cameras far over there and they will see when it is flashing yellow, they have 15 seconds to finish up their answer. When it is flashing red, they have five seconds left. And when it is still and it's just red, the mic will be turned off. And how will they know if they're not looking up at that moment? There are two little lights here that will be green when they are speaking to let them know that their microphone is on and it will be turned off when the mics are muted. You know that that is one of the things that is a bit different now, but the really big difference that could have an impact on these candidates is that if you look around the room here, and I'll give you sort of a 360 view, what do you notice? No chairs, no audience. We'll see who that affects more. Kate and John?",

That is something that has been very hard for the former president to do in the past. We see him often on the campaign trail go on long rants and talking about his personal grievances. That is something Donald Trump's campaign does not want him to do.Another thing I'm told that his team are really advising him on as he heads into today is to stay away from personal attacks on Joe Biden. Remember in 2020, Donald Trump leveled a series of personal attacks on Biden, including bringing up his son, Hunter Biden. There are questions today over whether he will go into the recent conviction for Hunter Biden and his gun case. All of that are things that Donald Trump's team does not want him to talk about. They want him to stay focused on three key issues, including the economy, the border crime, all areas where he is polling better than Joe Biden. Now, I'm also told behind the scenes, just to get into a little bit of what Sara was walking you all through with this debate, it's been really interesting in my conversations. There's been a bit of a change in how Trump's team views the debate rules, one, with the microphones being shut off. Initially, they didn't like that. They wanted him to be able to continue speaking, to interrupt if he needed to. However, I'm told in recent days, they really changed their thought on that. They actually think, you know what, this might be better to keep him from coming off as aggressive as he did back in 2020 in that first debate with Biden. The other thing about the audience, they also are starting to believe that's more of a positive as well. Donald Trump likes to feed off a crowd. He often gets his energy and takes cues from people in the audience. With there being no audience tonight on that debate stage and in that room, Donald Trump, they think we'll be able to more easily stay on message.",
