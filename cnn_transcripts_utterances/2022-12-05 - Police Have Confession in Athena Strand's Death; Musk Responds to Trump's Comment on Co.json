She wrote, my princess was taken from me by a sick, cruel monster. Absolutely for no reason. Athena is innocent, beautiful, kind, intelligence and just the brightest, happiest soul you could ever meet.You can imagine the anguish and the heartbreak that this family is dealing with. There were, for several days -- little Athena went missing last Wednesday. Her body wasn't found until Friday. Hundreds of volunteers combed through the area, trying to help the family search for her. But, obviously, this is not the ending anyone there in Wise County was praying for. And as you mentioned, nearly two dozen school districts across Wise County are urging their students to wear pink today in honor of Athena Strand. It was her favorite color. Investigators had said that there was a tip that led them to the FedEx delivery driver. The real specifics about who was behind that tip and how that all came to be has not been shared by investigators at this point. The suspect is expected to make, as you mentioned, a court appearance here this morning at some point in Wise County. We hope to learn more about how this investigation played out at some point throughout - throughout the day.

This feels like Russian disinformation. Maybe it is real. Real arguments about how they should treat this material in an election year. Now, what some want you to think is that this was censorship by big tech, and that's why the president is saying you should throw out the Constitution because big tech is in cahoots with American democracy. That's what the president thinks. But what it sort of shows is a real struggle at an important platform for how to deal with something so outrageous, so explosive, and - and what to actually do with it. What Pointer said, which is a media watchdog group, they said, file this one under -- file the Twitter files under \"m\" for \"meh\" and \"The Washington Post\" said there are no smoking gun here.

So this, again, shows the struggle, I think, Twitter had at the time to being a real arbiter of real information.We know that all of the social media sites have had a difficulty with that.

And this comes, you know, it's -- this total mission will have been about 26 days since that launch right there that you're seeing. It was a long mission. They really wanted to test out these systems on Orion, as Jim said, to make sure that it's safe for people, whenever they put them on board.But there's still one even bigger test ahead, Jim, aside from the burn that we're going to see in about an hour and a half, and that is testing of the Orion heat shield. The heat shield, we talk about it, it's so important. That's what's going to protect the astronauts when there are astronauts on board as this spacecraft barrels back into the earth's atmosphere and protects it from those high temperatures.
