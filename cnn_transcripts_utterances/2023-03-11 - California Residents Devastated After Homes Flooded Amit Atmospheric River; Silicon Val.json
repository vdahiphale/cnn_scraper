I'm Jim Acosta in New York.We begin this hour in California where a series of deadly storms has unleashed massive flooding across the central and northern portions of the state. Just 10 -- just minutes ago, I should say, we were seeing this video of a levee that failed overnight in Monterey County. That has forced evacuations but washed out roads and bridges that cut off some communities in the area. This week's Atmospheric River, the 10th to hit the state this winter, dropped more than a foot of rain in some areas. At least two people have died in this most recent storm and more rain is on the way for some hard-hit areas. Several feet of snow is blanketing the Sierra, Nevada mountains, and forecasters warned that melting snow could cause more flooding. The California National Guard in its high-water vehicles are staged throughout the state. And CNN's Mike Valerio is in Pajaro, California. Mike, it looks bad. What's the latest on the flooding there?",

You can see that there's a little bit of a dry spot in our background. But this, Jim, this flood zone goes about a half mile behind us. And we actually were able to interview within the past two hours a couple and their dog Zeus rescued by the National Guard. They live about two blocks behind us. And they woke up at 8:00 a.m., looked at all the flood water around them. And they couldn't open their front door, they couldn't get out. They called 911 and the National Guard they told us showed up within minutes. Now we also interviewed one of the spokespeople from Cal-Fire who's helping to coordinate the rescue operations which are still ongoing now. Take a listen to what he told us about when they realized this levee had breached and how many rescues they've accomplished so far. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CAPT. CURTIS RHODES, CAL-FIRE PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER: We were notified of the levee breach at midnight last night so we deployed down here. 3:00 a.m. this morning we did have the high-water team with us. That's part of the Emergency Operations Center. They've been countywide this week. They have their high-water vehicles and have been successful in nine high-water rescue situations this morning.

It took just 48 hours for SVB to suddenly implode and become the second largest failure of a financial institution in U.S. history. That means some of the companies that relied on what was known as go- to bank for tech startups are now scrambling to find money to pay their employees. California Governor Gavin Newsom says he is in touch with the highest levels of leadership at the White House and the Treasury Department to stabilize the situation as quickly as possible. And joining us now is the host of CNN's \"NIGHTCAP,\" Jon Sarlin. John, I mean, this has a lot of folks spooked about what's happening with the financial markets right now, the banking industry in general. What does this mean, though, for those accounts at SVB? What do those customers do at this point? JON SARLIN, CNN BUSINESS HOST, NIGHTCAP: It means panic and confusion. As you said, SVB is the bank in Silicon Valley for startups. And those are companies they are now desperately trying to figure out how to make payroll for next week. Throughout the valley, VCs are talking about trying to give bridge loans to companies to that they can pay their employees. And then there's hope that SVB might be sold and creditors could be made whole. But right now we just don't know. And companies are coming out and saying, hey, we're affected by this. Roku, the streaming media company, filed what's called an 8k with the SEC and said they have about 26 percent of their cash reserves, around $500 million tied up in SVB. Now that's a larger company and they say that they still have money in the bank. But for other startups, smaller startups, that might not be the case so they are desperately looking for what to do.",

Analysts who CNN talked to say that they don't think that this will have the same kind of contagion that we saw in 2008. The reason they point to is that this is a bank that was focused on the tech sector. And so that is a single part of the economy.But we don't know what that spread will look like within the tech sector. One thing to look at is crypto. USDC is one of the largest so- called stable coins that operate essentially as a lubricant for the greater crypto market. It's meant to tie one USDC to one dollar. Well, since Circle, the company that issues USDC, came out and said they have exposure in SVB, people started making essentially a bank run on USDC and we're seeing that peg one to one collapse. So right now, as you can see, it's worth around -- it's back up from around 85 cents to 97 cents. So what that means for crypto, we just don't know.

Right now current estimates put that deadline as early as this summer.And I'll just add, Jim, that no one I've spoken with wants a repeat of what happened in 2011 when the government came very close to a default.

President Biden also pushed back on what the House Freedom Caucus had to say. He said that right now he doesn't think there's much to negotiate on.

You know that would -- if they go that route, that would ultimately, you know, if a conviction that happened, that would ultimately mean Trump would have to pay a fine.

There's still no consensus on the origins of the virus that has killed nearly seven million people worldwide including more than one million Americans.The question is back in the spotlight in Washington. The House yesterday unanimously approved a bill to declassify U.S. intelligence information on the origins of the coronavirus. The Senate passed it earlier and the legislation now goes to President Biden's desk. It is not clear yet whether or not he will sign it. The president told reporters yesterday that he hasn't made that decision yet. A theory that the virus may have escaped from a lab in China has been a heated issue of this debate since early on in the pandemic. U.S. intelligence agencies are split on that. And joining us now to talk about this is Dr. Anthony Fauci who served as President Biden's chief medical adviser and head of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for decades, including under former President Trump. Dr. Fauci, good to see you as always. Thanks so much for being with us. President Biden, I guess you've probably heard, said he hasn't decided whether he will sign this legislation. You were once his chief medical adviser. Would you advise him to do it? DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, FORMER DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: Well, Jim, I don't want to be advising him when I'm not in that position right now. I'm sure he's going to make the right decision. One thing we can say we'd like to learn as much as we possibly can about information that hopefully will be available. You know, there's these two sides. You know, one group says it more likely is one or the other. I must say that we all must keep an open mind, Jim, about this, for sure, because nothing has been definitively proven. The thing that's important is that if you look at the available data, not just surmising or tweeting or guessing, but just look at the data, a group of fairly large group of very well-respected evolutionary virologists have examined the epidemiological virologic geospatial data from Wuhan and have come to the conclusion not definitively by any means, but feeling that it is much more likely that it is a natural occurrence from an animal to a human. However, since it hasn't been definitively proven, we've got to keep a completely open mind. That being the case, we want to know arguments or information or data on either side. And that's the reason why as you mentioned in the top of your discussion a little bit ago, we really need to get all the facts so that we can prevent this from happening again in the future.

The JetBlue pilot was able to climb out to avoid a crash but preliminary data shows the plans came within 500 feet of colliding. Joining us to talk about this is retired U.S. Airways Captain, \"Sully\" Sullenberger. Captain Sullenberger, Ambassador, great to see you. You'll remember Sullenberger from the famous Miracle on the Hudson landing - there it is right there - not too far from where I'm sitting right now over on Hudson Yards when he glided his jetliner down the Hudson River after a bird strike caused an engine failure. Sullenberger is also a former U.S. ambassador to the International Civil Aviation Organization, a specialized agency of the United Nations. Mr. Ambassador, great to see you. The Boston incident isn't the only one. We've seen similar incidents at JFK Airport, Honolulu, Burbank. What's going on with all of these close calls? It seems to have been a rash of them in recent days. CAPT. \"SULLY\" SULLENBERGER, FORMER U.S. AIRWAYS PILOT &amp; FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR, U.N. INTERNATIONAL CIVIL AVIATION ORGANIZATION: Well, coming out of Covid, which, you know, pretty devastated the economies of the world and caused a lot of aviation activities to be shut down, we had a lot of people who left the industry. Some retired early. Many of them were not flying as many hours as they had been. And I think, in every way, we're still playing catchup from the quicker than expected recovery from Covid. I think we're still short staffed of air controllers and pilots. They're hiring and training as fast as they can. But it takes many months to hire someone, train them to the proper professional standard, and get them integrated into the operation. It's not terribly surprising that after such a global interruption in air travel, that it's taken some time to recover. I think we're feeling all of these stresses and strains now. All the stressors that we feel in our everyday lives, of course, we take on our airplanes with us. I think it's just an indication of how, in recent times, I'm trying not to sound like my grandfather -",
