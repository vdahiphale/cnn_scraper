A final gut check on the economy before the midterms, the final gut check before the midterms just came in. And a new gut check now for Republicans could come the week after the election as Donald Trump could announce then that he is running for president again.First, let's get to the economic news. U.S. employers added 261,000 jobs in October. That is more than many economists expected. The report is also showing that the unemployment rate ticked up to 3.7 percent. And most importantly, this is the last read on the economy that voters will get before votes start being counted on Tuesday. What the numbers mean for the midterms, we're going to get to in a moment. We're also staring down the final weekend of the midterms, of course, and major political players are hitting the trail alongside all of the candidates including the three last presidents tomorrow, President Biden, former President Obama, and former President Trump will all be in one place, all in Pennsylvania for campaign events, all trying to push their candidates across the finish line in one of the cycles tightest races. And another big name is jumping into that Senate race today too. Oprah now endorsing Democratic candidate John Fetterman, which is most noteworthy because as you will likely remember Oprah Winfrey gave Fetterman's opponent, Mehmet Oz, gave him his first start in television. Let's get to it all starting with Rahel Solomon on the jobs report out this morning. Rahel, what do you see here?",

So 261,000 jobs added in the month of October, as you pointed out, Kate, so that was hotter than economists were expecting, but it is cooler than the 315,000 we saw in the month of September, the unemployment rate that ticked up from that 50 year low of 3.5 percent to 3.7 percent.Kate, when we looked in the report at where we're seeing the most job creation, take a look healthcare that added about 53,000 jobs, also manufacturing, 32,000 jobs. Now, what does this mean about the state of the economy? Well, look at job creation, Kate, over the last year, and you can absolutely see that a slowing is starting to take place. Now in the last hour, we talked to Nela Richardson, she is the chief economist at ADP. That's a payroll provider. And she told our colleague Julia Chatterley that this is the type of jobs report that you don't get when you're on the brink of a recession. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I do think, though, where it will matter a lot is in a crucial state, which is in the state of Georgia.If there is a run off in the state of Georgia and Donald Trump is announcing a presidential run smack dab in the middle of that, I think that absolutely will have a role in that race.

One thing I know that you have been tracking is Democratic outreach to black and Latino voters in these key states.I was looking this morning at the most recent CNN poll and the breakdown that I saw with Latino voter preference is 75, if I could read we will get it right, 65 percent preferring Democrats, and 33 percent preferring Republicans, but Democrats four years ago had a much larger share of the Latino vote.

You know, in a state like Georgia, for example, where black voters are really the linchpin of the Democratic Party, they have to maximize their advantage over Republicans in order to pull out a win in that battleground state. Same thing is true in Arizona and Nevada. I think the reason both Arizona and Nevada are competitive, actually, for both parties is because of Latino voters, and how they are shifting their voter preferences in some ways. The economy here is so important, especially with Latino voters where you're seeing this issue rising above other things in terms of importance, and Democrats have to figure out how to speak to that effectively. It might be too late in some cases, because votes are already being cast. But we have a week until Election Day. I think that's going to be a crucial issue.",

She's the governor right now. And when things aren't going well, whether it's economy, crime, emigrate, whatever it is, you think is not going well, you tend to hold accountable to people who are currently in office, it's the sole reason the New York governor's race is close. It's the sole reason Democrats like Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris are here. It's the sole reason the Democratic Party is spending millions because people in New York are fed up.

You cannot ignore that people feel like things are maybe worse for them today than it was before.And one other point about crime and public safety, it is important, especially for Democrats to not ignore that that is an issue that often disproportionately affects their voters, voters of color.

And yet he continued to fail to do so.At the same time, Kate, we know that the ADL said listen, they can't in good consciousness, except that $500,000 from both the Nets and Kyrie Irving. And then finally, just before midnight last night, Kyrie Irving did send out a statement that included an apology. I want to read part of it to you, it said, to all Jewish families and communities that are hurt and affected from my post, I am deeply sorry to have caused you pain, and I apologize. I had no intentions to disrespect any Jewish cultural history regarding the Holocaust, or perpetuate any hate. Now, again, the big question here is, did it go far enough? He says he first reacted to being called sort of antisemitic that he does have some learning to do.
