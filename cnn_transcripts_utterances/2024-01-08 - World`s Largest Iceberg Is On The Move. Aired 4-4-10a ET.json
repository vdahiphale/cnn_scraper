It was halted for two years during World War II, the crowds still flocked to Times Square. Until 1995, the Ball Drop was managed by the family company of its first creator, Jacob Starr. Since then, there have been many makeovers of the famous ball, including crystals, grindstones and strobe lighting. Whether this enduring ritual has the audience a few or many, it always marks the end of the old, the beginning of the new. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The U.S. National Ice Center assigns names to these icebergs based on where they are first sighted. And then the order in which they are sighted. The world`s largest iceberg is named A23a, it was the 23rd iceberg cited in the A quadrant of Antarctica. The continent is divided into A, B, C, and D quadrants. Did you know? Recently scientists studied A23a as it recently started drifting around the Antarctic peninsula again. This iceberg is about three times the size of New York City weighing nearly a trillion tons. CNN spoke with the Antarctic Survey team about this force of nature and where it might be headed next. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Now, it`s drifting around the Antarctic peninsula. The research team on the RRS Sir David Attenborough, cross paths with the iceberg early December. DR.

Now, many companies offer free returns, right? But those returns might not go where you may think they`d go CNN`s Peter Valdes-Dapena explains. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PETER VALDES-DAPENA, SENIOR WRITER, CNN BUSINESS: Free returns, their customer`s insurance policy for shopping online. But what happens to those returns after you give them back might surprise you. ALBERT PALACCI, CEO, 888 LOTS: So customers really believe that the product just goes into the black hole or ends up being resold to another customer. In many instances, that`s not the case.

But online we get north of 30% returns. VALDES-DAPENA: Accepting a return isn`t always easy either. A warehouse optimized for fulfilling orders now has to receive a product and inspect it. Then someone needs to decide whether it can be resold or not. In the end, an online return can require up to 20% more space and labor than one made in store. Those costs are part of why Optoro, a return solution company, estimates that returning a $50 item can cost a retailer 59% of its sale price. Often, the math just doesn`t add up.",
