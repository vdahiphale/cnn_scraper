He continues to make a remarkable recovery after suffering a cardiac arrest on the field during Monday's game. Hamlin is now breathing on his own after having a breathing tube removed late Thursday. The 24- year-old also surprised his teammates in Buffalo yesterday, facetiming with them on a phone from his bed in the hospital in Cincinnati. CNN's Adrienne Broaddus is live for us from the hospital in Cincinnati and has new information on his medical update. ADRIENNE BROADDUS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes. From the physicians here at the hospital where Damar is receiving treatment, they're telling us he is still in critical condition but continues to make progress. And here is perhaps the line in this tweet the Bills just published that sticks out, \"As he continues to breathe on his own, his neurological function is excellent.\" And many of you, if you've been following this story, you likely remember when Damar woke up, doctors treating him said the game was still on his mind. The first question he asked was, did we win, and doctors responding with, yes, Damar, you won, you've won the game of life. And there was another surprise yesterday. Damar was able to join the team's meeting. He facetimed in and was able to have a conversation through body language and a little communication with the players, telling them \"I love you, boys,\" also kind of flexing on them like this, according to some of the teammates who have shared that conversation with us. Let's listen to the head coach and what he had to say about that facetime call. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now that the leadership of the House of Representatives has been decided, it is time for that process to begin.\" Now the president and his advisers have been watching this race very closely as it now has determined who they will be working with over the course of the next two years. But there have been remarkable split screens that have been at hand over the course of the past week. One of the starkest being as the House was in chaos over this vote for House speaker, President Biden traveled to Kentucky to push this message of bipartisanship where he was joined by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. One of the things that the president has tried to stress over the past week is that he is willing to find ways to work with Republicans. But even as he has a longtime history with Senator McConnell, his approach with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy will be quite differently. The men don't know each other just as well, and there is expected to be more resistance coming from Republicans in the House. There are looming fights expected over things like the debt ceiling and government funding, and also Republicans are readying those investigations that they've promised into the various facets of the Biden administration, ranging from probes into the president's son, Hunter Biden, to the administration's handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan. But the president, as he is now entering this era of divided government, he's trying to argue that bipartisanship needs to be the way in trying to show that he is willing to put that first even as he's expected -- expecting this resistance from House Republicans all along the way.",

That's a good delicate, safe word, in which to describe this.So people watch C-SPAN because we want to see the back channels of a lot of things going on in Washington, on Capitol Hill, and beyond, White House and many other agency buildings. But what was it about the timing here where you all knew to either request or put in place these cameras, make them live, see this kind of sweeping directions in order for viewers to see all that we saw? Because you just mentioned, it is rather unusual to be able to do this. Usually, you have pool cameras. But tell me about the process, who made the decision, how did that decision-making or collaboration end up being everyone's bird's eye view onto the House floor? O'CONNELL:  Sure. So like I mentioned, every two years we put in cameras for the speaker's election, justice like a network will put in cameras for a State of the Union or a joint session of Congress like when President Zelenskyy was in town. But we did know or had an inkling, anyway, that this was going to not be a typical speaker's election. We all read the news articles. So we got together a few weeks ago, myself, my colleague Kristina Buddenhagen who was our production manager, Andrew Jones, who was going to be the daytime director, and we thought the only director, frankly, to discuss what were the stories, who were the people, and what did we think our viewers and the viewers of all networks that were going to be taking our cameras, what would they want to see. So we talked about the personalities. We talked about the sights that aren't typical to see in the House chamber when you're watching that very guarded Capitol Hill, government-operated feed.",

What was unique about how things were unfolding here? O'CONNELL:  Sure. So we had three cameras in the chamber. We had one that was looking at the dais to get the House clerk, and any action on the floor that it might be able to see. And then we had two on either side up front looking back at the lawmakers, which is where we got most of the footage of people milling in the aisles and the like. And the nomination speeches, et cetera. Now, in terms of how things unfolded, I had mentioned that I work with a -- if I didn't mention this, I should have -- a really talented group of field technicians. These people are on Capitol Hill every day when Congress is in session. They're in the hearing rooms, they're in the briefing rooms, they're in the hallways. They know these people, and they know the stories. So they were the ones who were making the decisions as to where are we going to go next, who's important right now.

As many as 41 more protesters have been sentenced to death in Iran, according to statements from both Iranian officials and Iranian media. A European-based human rights group today warned there could be many more executions in the coming days.CNN's Nada Bashir joining us live right now. Nada, what do we know about these two men? NADA BASHIR, CNN PRODUCER:  Look, Fredricka, this is yet another tragic example of the regime's brutal crackdown, bringing the total number of executions of prisoners who have participated in this protest movement to four. These two individuals, Mohammad Mahdi Karami, a 21-year-old Kurdish Iranian karate champion, and Seyyed Mohammad Hosseini, a 20-year-old volunteer working with children, both were executed by hanging earlier this morning. They were convicted in December for allegedly killing a member of the Basij amid protests, that is, a member of Iran's paramilitary forces. But as we've heard from rights groups, from legal representatives, it is believed that the two individual faced torture while in detention, as we have heard with multiple other cases of detained protesters, and also, that forced confessions were used against them as evidence in court. So there have been huge concerns over the validity of these trials. We've heard from Amnesty International saying that this mass trial, this group trial bears no resemblance to a meaningful judicial procedure. So there's real concern there around the treatment that these two men faced prior to their execution. We heard from one lawyer advocating from Mahdi Karami speaking on Twitter. He said that Karami had been on a hunger strike a dry food hunger strike as of Wednesday, and that he had been denied the right to speak to his family before he was executed. Fredricka, the concern now is we could see more executions taking place. Rights groups have warned that there are dozens of people facing potential execution for their participation in the ongoing protests. Even as you laid out, we've heard today from Iran Human Rights based in Norway, they say we could see a significant amount of people facing execution just in the coming days if there isn't an appropriate response from the international community.",

And it is a movement calling for regime change. [14:25:00] But what women are demanding here is the freedom, the right to make a decision on how they wish to dress and their own religious expression without facing the threats of Iran's morality police.

An affidavit shows police found DNA on a knife sheath at the crime scene that matched DNA found in trash at Kohberger's family home. In addition, a roommate told officers she saw a masked figure with bushy eyebrows on the night of the attack. And phone record showed the suspect was near the victims' home at least a dozen times.

And I'll get to some of those questions in a minute, but I want to go over some of the things that we learned from these court documents. There's a surviving roommate that was at the house at the time of the murders, and she says that she heard crying at the house.She also heard someone say something along the lines of \"It's OK, I'm going to help you.\" But then she says she saw this man at her house wearing all black, he had a mask covering his nose and his mouth. And she says that he was athletically built, not necessarily muscular but described him, as you mentioned, with bushy eyebrows. And she said that she stood there frozen in shock. So it's unclear why she didn't call police that night. What the affidavit said was that she went into her room and locked herself in. I don't think we're going to know the answer to why she didn't call police that night until maybe possibly at trial. But as you mentioned, there's a number of other things that are linking him to this crime, according to police. One of the things that you mentioned was the fact that they put the car in the area of this house 12 times leading up to this crime. So cell phone towers pinging him there. He was also back at the crime scene the morning of the murders according to police before they were called. He was near that house again. Authorities also saying that they have linked that white Hyundai Elantra. Of course, they'd been looking for this car for so long. But we also learned after all of this that he got a new license plate for his car just five days after the killings. You mentioned the cleaning of the car. According to sources he was cleaning inside and outside of that car. You mentioned the trash bags. Those are being now processed in a lab, anything that authorities collected from there, because they say, according to sources, that he put the trash bags in the neighbor's trash bins. This was at around 4:00 in the morning. So a lot of things that are suspicious, that raise a lot of questions, but more is needed for a successful prosecution. And I think that's what police are working on at the moment. But of course, we're left with the question of motive, of what was going on, what was the connection between Bryan Kohberger and these four victims, if there is any. So again, just a lot of questions, and we'll have to wait for this court process to play out. His next court appearance, Fred, is on Thursday.",
