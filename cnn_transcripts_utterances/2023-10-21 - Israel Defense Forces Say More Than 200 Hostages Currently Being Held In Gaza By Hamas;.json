We're continuing with our special coverage of the events unfolding today on the ground in Israel and Gaza.After days of waiting, the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt was open, briefly, this morning. Twenty trucks carrying humanitarian aid were permitted to cross into Gaza. Water, fuel, and food are all running desperately low there, and the United Nations is warning that Gaza's hospitals are on the brink of collapse. Israel continues its air strikes over Gaza. The death toll there now standing at more than 4,300 people, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Meantime, tens of thousands of Israeli troops continue to amass along the Gaza border, and now the Israeli Defense Forces updated the number of hostages held in Gaza to 210 people. Two American hostages, a mother and her teenage daughter, are free following their surprise release yesterday. They were visiting family at a kibbutz close to Gaza when they were taken hostage by Hamas. Wolf?",

I would say altogether we saw several hundred tanks, armored personnel carriers, and these armored vehicles, as well as infantry troops staging in the area, artillery nearby as well. So all of this very much appears to be the preparations for this ground invasion that we have been waiting for. And it goes along with the comments that we are hearing from top Israeli generals that tonight Israel's military chief of staff, General Halevi, saying, quote, \"We will enter the Gaza Strip,\" telling troops that they will embark on an operational task of destroying Hamas, and making very clear that while he understands that Hamas has prepared for the possibility of an Israeli invasion, that they will have booby traps, that they will have tunnels, that they will have reinforced positions waiting for those Israeli troops entering the Gaza Strip, he also said that we are also preparing for them. And so all of this, we still don't know exactly when, Wolf, this invasion will take place. But certainly, based on the massing of the troops and the comments that we are hearing from Israeli generals, it does appear that we are very close.",

And they just came inside and started to automatically shoot everybody over there, stealing stuff from their bodies, kidnapping. After they're done over there, they went to the nearest cities and kibbutzim and just broke into houses, killed families, babies, kidnapped 200 people, killing thousands of people. And while she was missing, I tried to find some information. I watched the videos in Telegram. Apparently, the Hamas videoed themselves killing people then uploaded it to Telegram and TikTok. So sadly, I watched all the horrible things that they did. And we managed to locate her phone the first day. We saw it in Gaza, so we thought they kidnapped her. But apparently, she was murdered, they shoot her in the back around 8:00 a.m. I talked to a lot of her friends that were at the party while I was looking for her, and the stories were the same. They said that once the shooting was starting, it was complete chaos. They hide in the forest for hours. They described it like running away from the Nazis. They tried to call for help from the army and the police, but nobody came because there were hundreds of terrorists just shooting cars, so nobody can get over there to help them. And apparently there were so many dead bodies over there that it took them -- they couldn't get the bodies to the hospital anymore because all of the hospitals were full. So they collected the bodies and brought them to the near amadaze (ph). This is why it took them six days to recognize her and bring her to bury her.

I don't know the last time that they kidnapped a soldier, it took five years to find his location. But I had hoped that at least we can free those 200 kids and elderly and babies, because those people don't deserve this. They're probably in a very bad situation psychologically and health, very bad health situation. I know that most of them have been held after they already got shot. So they're dying. I saw some videos of the Hamas making, while I was looking for her, I watched hundreds of videos on Telegram, and I've seen the people that they took. Some of them were babies, infants, some were very old people, and most of them were injured, like very badly injured, like with wounds on their legs and in their stomachs.

And then they could still have a stranglehold on Gaza City, conducting precision strikes on Gaza City, using special forces, using drones and air assets and whatnot, and then they could target the Hamas leadership that way and they could slowly close the noose on them. The other thing that time would afford them, and if they were to execute this strategy of cutting the country in half, the other thing is they need to start working on a political solution, because we all know the old Pottery Barn rule, you break it, you own it, you bought it.

But also focused on getting mental health resources to Israel, and also trying to fight misinformation. There are a lot of Israeli Americans who were shocked, who were heartbroken, and who in a way felt helpless when they started seeing what was going on in their countries. And so what they decided to do was work here in the U.S. to do anything they could to send relief or to send aid. They said initially when it came to those supplies, they were trying to find bulletproof vests, any tactical gear. But right now what they're saying they're focused on is medical supplies, any kind of medical supplies. Just the basics. That's what you're seeing there in those images. They're trying to gather as much as possible and ship it in any way possible. They've done it from L.A., from New York, from Miami, and they will continue to do so over the coming days.I want you to listen to the CEO of Bulletproof Israel and what he told us.

That includes $61 billion to support Ukraine in its war against Russia, and another $14 billion for Israel as it seeks to dismantle Hamas in Gaza. The president urging Americans to live up to their ideals and principles as defenders of democracy around the globe.But President Biden's plea comes as some public support for Ukraine funding has lagged with the war dragging on. Joining us now, CNN presidential historian, Tim Naftali. Tim, President Biden says America is still a beacon in the world and the indispensable nation, his words. How important was this, not just for the U.S., but for Ukraine and Israel as well?",

It is extremely important to both Kyiv and Jerusalem that at this moment of peril for both of these nations, that we live up to our commitment to support international security and especially the security of their regions.The president faces, as you mentioned, Wolf, an enormous challenge in Congress. We only have one house of Congress that is functioning. This is the first time in our history, during the Civil War, during World War I, during World War II, we had two functioning houses of Congress. We don't now. So there is no way for us, in fact, to pass legislation for the president to sign to provide to put money where our mouth is. So this week the House decides who the speaker should be, it will be very important to watch whether the pro-Putin MAGA wing of the Republican Party forces the two appropriation issues to be split. In other words, for there to be a vote on Israel separately from a vote on Ukraine. If the two appropriation issues can be together, I suspect that money will pass. If the pro-Putin wing succeeds, we may find that we support Israel financially, and we won't be supporting Ukraine financially. Of course, both need to be supported financially for international security and for American national security to be defended.",

Take a look at this. A CNBC poll this week put it at only 37 percent with 58 percent disapproval. How does all this complicate things for the president asking for billions of dollars when his approval numbers are this low?",

So presidents do not have to be popular for the United States to do the right thing in the international community. It just makes it easier.President Biden's approval ratings do not seem to make sense given the amount -- the numbers of achievements this administration has had. But keep in mind, for many Americans, inflation is still biting, and interest rates are very high. So it is understandable why Americans, on one hand, are feeling the pinch at home, and therefore, on the other hand, are not supporting the president despite the president's commitment to traditional American values abroad. It's going to be a tough sell for the president. What he really needs are allies in Congress. And we know that in the Senate, Senate Republicans want to pass this package. The issue is the House. That's the key. And that's what we'll see next week.",
