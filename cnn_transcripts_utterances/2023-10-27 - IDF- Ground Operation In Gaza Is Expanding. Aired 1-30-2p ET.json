We're not exactly sure what that means but we have seen intensification of airstrikes in Gaza.Let's go back to Nic Robertson, who is in Sderot, which is closer to Gaza than we are right now. Nic, right now, we're trying to ascertain, based on what the IDF is saying, how big this expansion is, whether this is the beginning of phase two in terms of a sizable ground operation, a sizable incursion into Gaza, or if this is a somewhat larger infiltration of Israeli troops into Gaza as we've seen over the last few nights?",

Of course, that is a big concern for those who have loved ones who were taken hostage, who were kidnapped by Hamas roughly three weeks ago on October 7th. Alex Marquardt and Jeremy Diamond both have new reporting on the hostage negotiations. I believe, Jeremy Diamond and Alex Marquardt, the number is 224. Alex, what can you tell us about the state of negotiations, especially given the fact that airstrikes by the IDF are intensifying in Gaza and the ground operations are expanding, according to the IDF.",

      "sentences": "Well, Jake and Anderson, it's hard to imagine that what we're seeing now doesn't hugely complicate the prospect of getting at least some of those 200 hostages out.That was what was being aimed for by the negotiators that were led by Qatar, that at least in the next hostage release, which we had thought might come in the coming hours or days, could have dozens or as many perhaps as 100. But seeing what we are now, obviously, that throws everything into flux. We have been cautioned by U.S. officials repeatedly throughout the day that things are extremely fluid. It's very touch and go. You did hear in the press conference given by Admiral Hagari, he was asked about the reported deal in the works and he spoke about it rather dismissively. He said, \"I advise you not to listen to rumors.\" And then he went on to talk about how Hamas is a terrorist organization and people should not give into the psychological terror of Hamas. But I can tell you, in speaking with a number of U.S. officials in the past few moments, they do not believe that talks have collapsed. They believe the talks are ongoing. How close they are to any success, that remains unclear. One U.S. official told me there's no scenario until these hostages are freed that we would stop pursuing talks. Another official calling this a tug and pull. And so, you know, there was a difference of opinion between the U.S. and Israel about what was more effective to get these hostages out. The Israelis were saying it was the military pressure that had succeeded in pressuring Hamas to get the four hostages we've seen out so far. Whereas, the U.S. had been pushing for a pause -- sorry, pushing for a delay, as well as for a humanitarian pause so that there could be more time to get the hostages out. Obviously, this is really going to complicate things, I think -- Jake Anderson?",

We'll check in with Jeremy Diamond as soon as he's back on camera as well. Alex, in terms of the hostages, Israel had actually dropped leaflets several days ago asking residents in Gaza for any information, that if they had witnessed anything with hostages, that there could be rewards for them if they contacted Israeli authorities. Which gives just a sense of the scope, the importance Israel is putting on trying to get the hostages back. But if they are being kept in these underground tunnels, as one of the hostages who has come out said that she did -- at some point, was in a tunnel, that complicates Israel's ability to really destroy these tunnels.",

      "sentences": "It certainly does. And it would essentially hold them back from pummeling that Hamas infrastructure as hard as they would like.No doubt, the efforts to get these hostages back has been hugely complicated by the fact that they are not all in one place. As we've said, they are in bunkers in tunnels, they're being held by different groups. And so I think that's part of the reason you're seeing that call to Gazans by the IDF to give them as much information as possible. There was a huge concern by the U.S., by the administration, that, if and when this ground incursion were launched, that essentially it would torpedo any efforts to get these hostages out. That's why there has been a concentrated effort, very politely in public, to pressure the Israeli government. The administration saying repeatedly, you know, it's up to the Israelis to decide when they go in and when they launch this incursion. But we heard, you know, pretty clearly from Secretary of State Antony Blinken that what would be needed right now are humanitarian pauses. We never heard any American officials calling for a ceasefire because that's something that Israelis have completely ruled out. But you have heard the Americans and Europeans calling for a pause in order to help get those hostages out and in order to help get aid in. So as we were discussing what a deal could look like for the release of what we had thought might be a bigger group of hostages, in terms of what Hamas might have gotten. What we believed was being discussed was aid going into Gaza, fuel going into Gaza, a temporary ceasefire that would allow the movement of these hostages to get out of the Gaza Strip, perhaps the injured moving to -- out of Gaza into Egypt to get treatment. But, of course, we have not seen that deal come to fruition. It looked like it was on a pretty good trajectory. There was a lot of cautioning going on but there was a lot of positivity. One official, who was involved in the conversations, even going so far to say there was a breakthrough. I don't think there's any official right now, to say the least, who thinks that this -- that a hostage release would be imminent, as we see what's happening in the Gaza Strip tonight -- guys?",

You have seen the Egyptians, who sources tell us, haven't necessarily done enough to help get those hundreds of foreign citizens out of Gaza. There's not one reason, in particular, they can't leave, but rather, the State Department is telling us, and multiple sources are telling us, that this is an extraordinarily complicated puzzle. The administration is expressing some hope that Americans can get out in the coming days. But it has been more than two weeks with no answers for those hundreds of American citizens.",
