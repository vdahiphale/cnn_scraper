That means they are, quote, \"fair game\", and will essentially fight and perhaps die like Russian troops as they fight against Ukraine. Here's the U.S. being very clear here. Sara, one of the key questions that is still out there is what does North Korea get in exchange for not only the weapons they're providing, but now the troops they are providing to Russia? And could that be something like nuclear or satellite technology? And that would be very problematic.",

Let's get things done. And let's not be afraid of having a little joy to the point of, you know, what gives you, what makes you feel good about your work.

What do you think it is, why she's making this turn from talking about joy and weird to calling her opponent a fascist? KATE BEDINGFIELD, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATORSo I think it's important not to lose sight of that. This is not Kamala Harris calling names. This is her lifting up the fact that somebody who served very, very closely with Donald Trump and was a supporter of Donald Trump is calling him a fascist. And I think, look, the practical reality, the political reality, we are coming into the final stretch of this campaign. One of the things the Harris campaign has to do is jolt people up off the couch who have been apathetic about the process, who feel burned out by politics over the last now decade in this country. And so what she's trying to do is remind people what the stakes are. And so using blunt, direct language that goes to some of the ways in which Donald Trump is a threat to the American way of life is reminding people that this is not just your average election and the stakes are very, very high.",

And if you really believe he is a fascist and you really believe he's going to, quote, terminate the Constitution, I think somebody ought to ask a Democrat today, how can you hand over power and Donald Trump if you actually believe that?

And this is an argument they don't like that about Trump. They don't like the danger. They don't like the existential threat to democracy. They don't want to see people storming the Capitol again. And so that's why they're pushing this language in the final days.And you're right, it was Bidens messaging. At the time everyone thought it was out of touch when most people cared about the economy, immigration. But now, if you're a Democrat, you're with Kamala Harris. If you're still on the fence, then you need to be pushed a little bit further.

Obviously, I would argue including Donald Trump, but including social media. There are all sorts of reasons for that.But it underscores a core fact of this election, of course, fundamental, this elections, that there are a lot of people who are tired of the process. And this is where I think Harris was very smart early on in her campaign after she went to the top of the ticket. She was very smart in trying to set the frame and set the framework for turning the page from -- turning the page from Donald Trump, as opposed to turning the page from Biden. She's trying to make an argument that she's a new way forward and the kind of benchmark that she set around that at the beginning of the campaign was less about separating herself from Biden economically, although I think she had has done a better job of kind of articulating that over the last few weeks of this campaign than she did a couple of months ago. But she really tried to make this about representing a new kind of politics and turning the page from Donald Trump. And I do think that that is where a large section of voters who are ultimately probably going to be determinative in this election are. And you hear it there in the comments from that person. They're tired of the name-calling. They're tired of the vitriol. Donald Trump is the standard bearer for that kind of politics. And she was smart to push off of that and present herself as a new direction and a new way forward on that.",

She had celebrities around her endorsing her. She had this DNC, DNC rollout.And now there are a lot of attack ads running, and they're based on her own words. And, for example, the interview she did with \"The View\" when she was asked, how would you separate yourself from Biden? And she said she wouldn't change a thing. And so those ads are running. There's the transgender ads that are running that Trump has pushing out. So we're in the final weeks and people are going to -- they're going to get a little dirty from these ads on both sides. I wouldn't be surprised at Trumps unfavs are dropping, although I've heard that his favorables are actually going up some. And it reflects the closest of the race.

He's from Ahwatukee, Arizona and was arrested in connection with these three incidents of shooting at the Democratic National Committee office in suburban Phoenix. They took -- it was over the span of 20 days starting on September 16, when investigators believe that more than ten rounds of BB rounds of BB gun were shot at this building outside of Phoenix, Arizona. The second incident took place just a week later, but this time, he brought a real gun with real bullets. This was on September 23rd around just after midnight that took place, and then two weeks later, another incident with a real gun. This time, authorities came to the scene about five minutes later, this was shortly after midnight, again, on those two last two occasions, they had surveillance video of a silver SUV leaving the scene and they say that that was key to finding Kelly. They were able to find him through a tip from the community and once they started following him, they saw him putting up signs with razor blades attached to them, criticizing the Democratic Party and VP Kamala Harris, he was putting that around the area of Ahwatukee where he's from. And Kate, he also attached, and this is a bit of a disturbing part of this story, this white powder to these signs that said biohazard on it. At this time, he's charged with two counts of unlawful discharge, two counts of shooting at a non-residential structure, three counts under the Terrorism Act, and three counts of criminal damage, but additional charges might still be filed, police say, in relation to that white powder that we're not sure yet what contents.

Officials telling us that they thwarted an attempt to take the absentee ballot website offline -- it is that website that is used to request absentee ballots and this is consistent with what we've heard about other cyber incidents and other states as well.
