Because in previous rounds where we've seen rockets fired from Israel, I don't want to say that people were expecting it, but there was a clear trigger.There were clashes at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound. There was maybe a major Israeli military incursion or raid into the West Bank that perhaps captured or killed some high ranking militant. But this was not -- I don't want to say it was a normal level of tension, but the last few weeks, we've seen rising levels of tension. There has been some, you know, some concern over what's happening in Jerusalem. There were some protests along the separation fence between Gaza and Israel, but nothing that raised to the level of what we had seen in the past, and that's why this is so surprising. I do think that we need to keep in mind. Not just what's been happening specifically here within Israel and the Palestinian territories, but also what's happening broader on the regional level. And this is, of course, the normalization talks between Israel and Saudi Arabia. And so I have to wonder whether this is somewhat connected to those talks that are increasing and talks about what the Palestinians could potentially get in exchange for normalization with Saudi Arabia. Perhaps this is some sort of message being sent to the broader Arab world. Of course, that is all just speculation right now. All we know right now is that Israel has declared essentially a state of war alert. This is a major, major escalation, the types of which we have not seen in years. Many, many rockets being fired across all of Israel, including here in Jerusalem. That's why we're standing here in the stairwell right now, as well as something which is new, which is these infiltrations. We still don't have a clear picture on how many infiltration reports there have been in southern Israel and whether those will be expanding to other parts of Israel as well.",

So it is a significant day in terms of it being a holiday. This whole week has been the holiday of Sukkot.And the holidays do tend to bring an extra level of tension, and that's because often you'll have some Jews who want to go to the Temple Mount, which is also known as the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound. And like I said, so many sensitivities about non-Muslims going there, specifically Jews, specifically Jewish extremists and settlers. So that is a concern, and also I do think it is significant that it is also happening on the anniversary, or very close to the anniversary, of the Yom Kippur War. And this was another time when Israel was caught off guard and completely surprised by an attack. Now, obviously, that war had very significant impacts on Israeli history and the continuation of it.

But given the location, given the fact that the cafe was struck, the indications are that it was a Russian missile, but must underscore, as we've said previously, that this needs to be looked at further.

And then, of course, we saw this latest strike on Kharkiv which targeted residential buildings. Does seeing, you know, the horrifying consequences of assaults like that galvanize support for Ukraine? Does it make any difference? JOHN DENI, RESEARCH PROFESSOR, U.S. ARMY WAR COLLEGE: Well, Laila, let me begin by noting the views I express are mine and don't necessarily reflect those of the U.S. government. I think they do make some difference. I mean, as a father myself, when I read about or see this news of children as young as six years old dying in tragedies like this, it reminds us of, frankly, the moral depravity of the criminal and leadership that leadership can't be trusted. The military directs lacks a moral compass and really they need to be held accountable for what are frankly war crimes. They've got a history of doing this of targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure. Now, whether it moves the needle on public opinion, I think it may be limited, frankly, because many of us have been -- become somewhat used to this, to seeing Russian attacks on civilians.

That is really over the next month or so before the weather begins to play a significant role.Beyond that. I think we're also concerned with what happens after the winter and into the spring. If the Russians decide to launch a counteroffensive at that time, the Ukrainians are going to need additional injections of equipment and material. Now, in the U.S. I think we've got the ability to sustain that level of effort for the next month or so, given current funding and what the administration has told us.

And even if we just look at the military aid, they've committed to supply more than even the Americans have.Now, that said, when they look across the ocean to see the political situation here, they've got some doubts. At least two-thirds of GOP senators support the same. The House, the GOP is a bit more divided there, so there's some questions.

The U.K. based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the death toll exceeded 120. But CNN can't independently confirm any of these claims. No one has actually claimed responsibility for the attack, but the Syrian government blamed foreign-backed terrorists for the attack, which usually refers to the myriad of armed opposition groups operating in the country's northwest, and that's where regime forces struck back. The White Helmets civil defense group, which operates in rebel controlled areas, claimed more than a dozen people were killed and more than 50 injured as a result of government bombardment. While in the eastern part of the country, Turkish drones and warplanes have been hitting Kurdish targets. Kurdish security forces said at least 11 people were killed in those Turkish strikes. More than half a million Syrians have been killed in the last 12 years of violence. Almost 13 million others have either been internally displaced or fled abroad.

If it happens while we're live on air, we'll take you with us.And we've heard several explosions overhead, including in Jerusalem. That could mean -- I just heard another one just now -- that could mean interceptions. That could mean impacts right now. This is a very unprecedented, intense situation, Laila. This is war. This is something that Israel has not seen in ages. This sort of coordinated surprise attack. It started at 6:30 in the morning with rockets being fired from Gaza towards Israel. And then something really unheard of is infiltrations. The Israeli military has confirmed the Palestinian militants have infiltrated Israel, mostly in southern Israel, the community surrounding the Gaza Strip. We have seen alarming video of militants on the back of pickup trucks firing towards Israeli communities. We know of fatalities. We know of at least one woman who was killed in her 60s. Several other injured -- several others have been injured. There are reports of other fatalities and other injuries, and it's not clear whether those are from rockets, from shrapnel or from the militants firing. And it seems as though the militant infiltration situation is continuing as we speak. We're seeing live images from Israeli media from communities in southern Israel, where you're seeing a large security response to the militants going essentially house by house, car by car, trying to get what they can, trying to extract these militants out of these communities. Israelis in the south have all been advised not only to stay in their bomb shelters, but also to completely lock their doors. Israelis across the country have been advised to stay near their protected spaces because sirens have been going off from Tel Aviv to the south here in Jerusalem as well, including over by the airport. As far as we understand, the airport, Ben Gurion Airport, is still open, but it is a question whether it will stay open depending on how these rockets continue. Now the Israeli military has declared a state of war alert. The defense minister has approved calling up extensive recruitment of reserves, they say. And they are saying that the Hamas organization is completely responsible for this, and it will face the consequences, they say, as well. Now Hamas, for their part, they are calling this the Al-Aqsa storm, and it was clearly, you know, somewhat planned or coordinated to start at 6:30 a.m. this morning, along with these rockets, along with these infiltrations. Now, the Hamas organization claims that they have fired more than 5,000 rockets since this morning. We don't have a specific number from the Israeli military yet, but we know that it has to be quite a bit because of just the number of sirens going off all morning long. I have an app on my phone that tells me when there are air raid sirens going off across the country, and it has just been vibrating my phone nonstop.

Shortly after the war started, meaning around an hour and a half ago, there was a live declaration of the commander in chief or the chief of staff of Hamas armed wing, Mohammed Deif. A man that we don't know how his face looked like, but he did make a declaration in the media outlets saying that he calls it -- he named the operation.And he said that this was a response for the attack, the Israeli attack, so called, on Al-Aqsa Mosque, et cetera, et cetera. And he swore that this operation will continue. So there's no doubt that Hamas took the leadership and is now leading the effort. Islamic Jihad did join and said that they are part of this operation. But everything that we had seen, this is a very planned operation that managed to surprise the Israeli intelligence. Very reminding of 50 years ago exactly, meaning October 6, 1973, when the Egyptian and the Syrian army managed to surprise the Israeli army in what was called the Yom Kippur War. So that was 50 years ago. The same now Hamas in a holiday vacation. Everyone here are on vacation in Israel. And in the first hours of Shabbat morning, when everyone are going to the synagogues or resting in their houses, this is when they pull this operation.",

We're going to see a war on Gaza, inside Gaza, and again, with many, many casualties on both sides.",
