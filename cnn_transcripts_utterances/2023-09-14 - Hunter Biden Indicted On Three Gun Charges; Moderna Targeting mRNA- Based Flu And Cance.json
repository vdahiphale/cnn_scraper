At the moment, we're up 370 on the Dow as you can see, a strong performance. The markets and the main events. Perhaps it's the IPO sizzle that's driving Arm shares surge on the first day of trade. The chief executive of Arm is with me in this program. Hunter Biden has been indicted on federal gun charges. The European Central Bank has raised rates to record levels, but says it might be finished after lifting them so high. We are live in New York. It is Thursday, September 14th. I'm Richard Quest and I mean business. Good evening. Tonight,the biggest IPO of the year, has made a strong debut on NASDAQ. Shares in the chip designer Arm are up dramatically in their first hour of trading. They were initially priced at $51.00, putting their company's value at around $54 billion. The company's chips are found in nearly every smartphone around the world. The response of investors is good news for Softbank, which bought the company for $32 billion and will retain 90 percent of the shares. Wall Street is hoping today's reaction will help revive the IPO market that's dried up, if you look at those numbers, IPOs have been extremely thin on the ground in the last few years. There have just been over 70 new listings this year, together, raising $15 billion. Now compare that to '21, there were nearly 400 listings and they raised 140 billion. Anna Stewart is in London. Why is the Arm one so insignificant?",

More often than not they value is at aplace where it is going to pop and I think it's interesting to see where it currently stands, up around 15 percent, so around $58.00 a share versus $51.00 that it was priced at this morning. Is that money on the table or is that just a nice pop? It's somewhere on the edge. I look forward to asking -- you asking the CEO about that. It is interesting if you consider that actually, Softbank poured a 25 percent stake that it didn't own in Arm very recently. The implied value of Arm then, Richard, was $64 billion. So actually it's valued at about where Softbank thought it was just a few weeks ago.",

Currently, it's very much focused on CPUs and smartphones, and it does extremely well with that, and royalties from it. Lots of money in that. Where it wants to go and where it was really selling itself in its prospectus is artificial intelligence. The big growth story of the moment, yes, it does currently support AI devices, but it's not necessarily making the same sorts of chips as NVIDIA or designing the ones that are the GPs, the really high tech ones in the AI market. So the issue for Arm right now is it wants to get into that market, but it's almost looking from the outside in at this stage and the smartphone market, it is drying up a little bit.

If you're joining me at 3:30 in New York, that's in 25 minutes; 8:30, London; 9:30 where you are perhaps. For the first time in US history, the Justice Department has indicted a son of a sitting president. A special counsel charged Hunter Biden with three counts related to a gun he bought in 2018. Biden is accused of lying on a federal firearms form and owning a gun while addicted to drugs. The president's son had previously struck a plea deal to avoid facing a jury during a court hearing in July, that's when the agreement fell apart. The indictment could set up a trial during the President Biden's re-election campaign. Our CNN White House reporter, Priscilla Alvarez is with me. So what charges is he now going to face?

So this has been an ongoing saga, and one that the White House has faced multiple questions on because of his relationship with the president. He is the son of President Biden. Now, when we asked the White House about this latest news, the White House spokesperson referred questions the Justice Department and Hunter Biden's personal representatives saying: \"Given this is an independent investigation.\" And that's really been the line from the White House this entire time, is as this has played out, the White House has maintained that this has to do with Hunter Biden and his personal representatives. But still within the White House, this is a sensitive issue; one advisers are well aware of and even so, despite all of this, the president has remained close with Hunter, staying in touch with him. We have seen Hunter and events at the White House as well. So even so, the president is still in close touch with Hunter. It's just that this timing, as one source told me is disappointing. Of course, their focus is on Bidenomics. You see the president soon is going to speak on this in a speech where he's going to focus on the economy. So that is where the White House wanted to spend their focus today, it was creating a difference, a contrast with Republicans in what they now call Bidenomics versus Maganomics. But instead, all of this is happening just minutes before President Biden is expected to speak. It's his first public appearance, of course, since this news broke.

Recall that just this week, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said he would open an impeachment inquiry into another matter involving the president and his son, Hunter Biden. But for now, at least, what the focus is going to be on is what we're going to see this afternoon, the economy and what they think they can tell Americans to gain traction and win in the re-election.

So I think that they're going to err more on the hawkish side. You know, it'll be interesting to see what that does to labor markets. Again, in the US, there's now this sort of interesting debate about how the relationship between inflation rate hikes and the employment market just doesn't seem to be holding.

They're looking at a sort of five to 10-year horizon for this level of production, Richard. They want longer contracts from governments to be able to sustain it and they want a closer partnership with governments moving forward, more on the sort of US model where the governments are sort of working in tandem with the Defense industry because of course, this isn't just about Ukraine, we are seeing a fundamentally different security picture in Europe.

MANN (voice-over): When we're putting the basalt down on agricultural land, we typically apply it at about 20 tons per hectare. And that's across the whole farm so thousands and thousands of hectares now. And we're spreading about 30,000 tons of silicate rock every month now. So that 30,000 tons will be in the somewhere region of 7,000-8,000 tons of CO2. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over): We have developed a detailed geochemical model to enable us to predict multiple decades into the future how much rock has been weathered. So from current finding, there is huge potential for enhanced rock weathering. We could contribute to 5-10 gigatons annually of carbon dioxide removal in the future. (MUSIC PLAYING) WEIR (voice-over): If UNDO is able to achieve those numbers, they would indeed undo a lot of the damage done by global carbon emissions. But there's a notable benefit for farmers, too. Trials have shown that fields with the basalt spread have produced a 10 percent to 20 percent increase in crop yield. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over): The farm is critical and having something that really benefits the farmer just makes our job so much easier. First and foremost, we're a climate company but we need to give value to the farmers. And doing that is great and it's so nice to see farmers who maybe put one field with us come back to us and then say we want the whole farm done, please, as soon as you possibly can. WEIR (voice-over): UNDO is already operating in the U.K., North America and Australia.
