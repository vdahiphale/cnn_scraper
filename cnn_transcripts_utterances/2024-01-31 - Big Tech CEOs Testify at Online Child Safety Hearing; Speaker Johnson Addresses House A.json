And there is this power that Congress has, which when it's bipartisan, when you have a hearing that is this captivating, there are times where a Congressional hearing can sort of break through the public discourse and change public perceptions of the dangers of something, with cigarettes, or in this case, with social media.In terms of where it goes from here, Facebook, just as an example, has for years, literally years, been saying \"Regulate us, please regulate us, we'd love to be regulated.\" And yet, nothing has happened, in part because they have effectively lobbied to kill anything that could potentially affect them.",

BASH: And so the question is, what's known as Section 230, which is now an antiquated law, the only one on the books that really addresses them, whether it actually is going to be updated. And whether it's because these members of Congress don't really understand the sort of ins and outs, which I get that it's hard to understand, the ins and outs of social media, or because it is so complicated or something in between, they haven't done anything yet. And the big question right now is, whether there will be consequences like in tobacco, where the laws did change. And that was not easy.

It is a major problem. And these entities, these companies have proven that they are not willing to actually police themselves. And that is why we should have sensible regulation.

Speaker Johnson came into this seat and he said the border has to be a part of Ukraine and Israel and national security funding. So we said, OK, let's start those discussions. And all of the Republicans in Congress said, We have got to address the border. It is essential. And Congress needs to take action to address the border.You fast forward to today, Donald Trump said, hey, back off of the border, don't make a deal. Because he wants to politicize this and he wants to use this as a hit against President Biden in the election. And they all now are saying, well, Congress does not need to act. We do not need to make a deal. We should back off of it. So they have completely changed their tune and they've done a 180 because Donald Trump has told them to do it. So they own this now.
