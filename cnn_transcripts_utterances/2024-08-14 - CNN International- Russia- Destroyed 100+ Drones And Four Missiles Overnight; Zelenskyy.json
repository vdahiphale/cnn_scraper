I'm Rahel Solomon live in New York.Ahead on CNN Newsroom, Russia's Belgorod region declaring a state of emergency, as Ukraine's incursion into Russia advances. We will look at the long-term goals on the battlefield for both Russia and Ukraine. Plus, high-stakes talks in the Middle East are set for tomorrow, but now one key player will not be attending. We are live in Israel and Lebanon with the very latest here. And all eyes on the markets, as the new U.S. CPI numbers show a slowdown in inflation. So, could this mean that the Fed is on track for a rate cut? I will discuss with my guest. The Kremlin facing a major embarrassment this week as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says that his forces have advanced even further into Russia's Kursk region. Today alone, Ukraine claims to have gained one to two more kilometers. That's on top of what they say is control over 1,000 square kilometers of Russian territory. This is after that surprise assault one week ago. This incursion has prompted Russia to take peace negotiations off the table, at least for now, saying that they are on a quote, \"long pause.\" And Russia's National Guard says that it has tightened security around the Kursk nuclear plant. The governor of Russia's Belgorod area, seen here, has declared a regional emergency. Meanwhile, the Lithuanian Defense Minister claims that Russia is moving its troops from Kaliningrad on the Baltic coast to Kursk. In the air, Russia says it has destroyed more than 100 Ukrainian drones overnight, adding that 37 of them and four missiles were destroyed over the Kursk region. Let's get to CNN's Fred Pleitgen, who is tracking this ongoing incursion. He joins us live now from Berlin. Fred, give us a sense of what we know about what appears to be the strategy for Ukraine right now.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. The strategy for Ukraine certainly seemingly an ever increasing problem for the Russians. One of the things, I think, that completely caught the Kremlin off guard was not just the incursion itself, but also that on day eight of this incursion, the Ukrainians are still managing to move forward, and it seems very difficult for the Russians to try and hold the Ukrainians up. We've been seeing some videos that have been released by the Russian Defense Ministry of their air force bombing Ukrainian positions using some pretty heavy what are called glide bombs to try and hit those Ukrainian positions.But still, the Ukrainians are saying that they are managing to move forward. The Ukrainians have now outlined what they say that their strategy is. They say, in that part of Russia, they want to create something like a buffer zone to try and make sure that the Russian military cannot attack Ukraine from that part of southwestern Russia. I want to listen into some of a phone conversation or a video conversation that took place between the President of Ukraine and his top general earlier today. Let's have a look at that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OLEKSANDR SYRSKYI, UKRAINIAN MILITARY CHIEF (Interpreted): The defense forces continue to conduct an offensive operation in the Kursk region. Since the beginning of the day, the troops have advanced one to two kilometers in some areas. The search for and destruction of the enemy in Sudzha been completed. Since the beginning of the day, more than 100 enemy soldiers have been captured. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

CNN has now actually also managed to speak to a Ukrainian commander who is fighting on the frontlines and who just returned from the frontlines, and he says that the Russians are trying to stop the Ukrainians and are trying to organize some sort of defense. Let's listen into some of that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DMYTRO KHOLOD, COMMANDER OF THE \"NIGHTINGALE\" BATTALION (Interpreted): The Russians are now trying to stop our advance. They have pulled in reserves, which has benefited our defense forces in other areas, because it's become easier to work there. We have information that reserves were pulled from the Zaporizhzhia, Crimea and Kharkiv regions to stop our advance. Of course, it will be harder for us to advance further, but we will still advance.

I was actually speaking to some sources inside Russia today, and one of the things that you keep hearing, for instance, on Kremlin-controlled TV, on Russian state TV, is that they are saying, look, right now, the Ukrainians are smiling, but the Russian army is fighting. The Russian army will be back. The Russians are going to deal with this, and they are going to kick the Ukrainians out.What we've heard from the Russians so far is that the Russian government has said that right now, peace talks with Ukraine are something that is impossible at this point in time with this incursion. They call it a crime against Russia. However, of course, we know that there weren't really any peace talks on the agenda beforehand, to begin with. And certainly, you do notice also in some of the reports that are coming on Russian state TV, from Russian reporters who are on the other side, of course, on the frontline, that they do acknowledge how difficult the situation is for the Russian military, and that this does not appear to be something that Russia is going to be able to deal with in a very quick manner, especially if those Ukrainian forces are able to dig in. And we've already seen some signs that trenches, apparently, are already being dug. If they're able to establish defensive positions in that area, that, of course, will make that task even more difficult for the Russian military, Rahel.",

Potentially in a worst-case scenario, it would be stability in the region, a conflict that could erupt and draw in many more countries, besides Israel and Iran and Iran's proxies in in the region. It just could get bigger and inflame already existing tensions. However, the hope was always that these talks would move the dial on the Gaza ceasefire, and this is something that Amos Hochstein spoke about earlier on today, when he was in Beirut, that if we can get a ceasefire on Gaza, move the talks there, then that will tank down tensions with Hezbollah and Israel. And the same sentiment is true for Iran.But, both Hezbollah and Iran have indicated, despite all the mitigating factors, why it would be bad for them to escalate tensions and perhaps get into an escalated conflict with Israel. They have already said that they would strike back. And I think the anticipation is what happens in these talks will not deter at least Iran from striking back at Israel, but may set the scale at which it makes that attack. If the talks are completely unsuccessful, it could be quite large. If there is some success to be seen there, there may be lesser. But, absolutely at a maximum position, the whole stability of the region is at stake. Of course, everyone hopes diplomacy is going to win.",

They haven't said no. I spoke to this one source who is very close to a senior Hamas official, who is privy to the details of the negotiations that going back months, and he said that short of ending of the Israeli aggression, as he called it, a complete withdrawal from Gaza, the return of the displaced people to their homes, what's left of their homes inside Gaza, and a lifting of the siege. He said that he doesn't -- Hamas doesn't want to participate in these meetings just for the sake of meetings. Clearly, they're very frustrated that they thought they'd agreed to something everyone else had agreed back in July.But, as has been reported in many outlets, CNN, Israeli media, Prime Minister Netanyahu appears to have been imposing new conditions that have complicated negotiating process that at some point in the recent months did look like it was reaching some sort of fruition. And there is also frustration that the United States is sending these mixed signals. On the one hand, they're pushing diplomatically for some sort of agreement for a ceasefire and the release of hostages. They're expressing concern over the mounting death toll in Gaza, which is now just shy of 40,000, but at the same time, the country that expresses concern over the death toll announced last night that they are providing 20 -- they will allow $20 billion in sales of weapons to Israel, that, of course, won't be delivered for the next few years. But, the optics coming out of Washington are confusing, and for those who are hoping for an end to this war, very troubling. Rahel.",

SOLOMON; Wow. OK. Julia Chatterley, CNN, anchor, thank you. For more perspective on this, I am joined now by Mohamed El-Erian. He is the President of Queens' College at Cambridge University, and an advisor to Allianz and Gramercy. Mohamed, always good to see you, especially on CPI days. It was report, as Julia said, that was largely in line with expectations. Walk me through some of your takeaways from this report. MOHAMED EL-ERIAN, PRESIDENT OF QUEENS' COLLEGE AT CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY, &amp; ADVISOR TO ALLIANZ AND GRAMERCY: So, as Julia said, it was in line with expectations. When you look at the composition, there is good news, there is bad news. But, overall, and given that yesterday we also got a soft print on the Purchasing Power Index, the PPI, if you put it all together, this opens the door wide open for the Fed to start a cutting cycle in September. Like Julia, I think it's going to be 25 basis points, a quarter of a percentage point. The market believes that this will be part of a much larger journey, which will include two full percentage points in cut. So, we are go -- we are looking at the initiation of the cutting cycle by the Fed.",

      "sentences": "Well, so that's interesting. So, two full percentage points. So, is it also your expectation that the Fed will ultimately hover around three percent for their federal funds rate? And the reason why I ask is because obviously where rates are now is perhaps unsustainable, but we know they're not going back to zero percent either. So, is three percent about where you expect them to remain ultimately?EL-ERIAN: So, that's where the market expects them. I think they'll end up half a percentage point higher than where the market expects them, and that is assuming that the recession risk stays at about 35 percent. As you said in your conversation with Julia, there is a shift in emphasis now. This was an inflation Fed (ph), and now the emphasis is going more to the employment side of that mandate. And as we look forward, the employment side, and particularly higher unemployment, is going to be much more of a focus for the Fed. Put that with what I think is the vesting level for the inflation rate, which is 2.5 percent, and I see them cutting by one and a half percentage points over the next 12 months.",

The reason why I ask is because, with the last payroll report, there were analysts who said, look, I mean, part of this is a supply issue, and that more people are actually joining the workforce. But, would you say that -- no, you are seeing alarm bells in the labor market. And now the Fed does need to act quickly.EL-ERIAN: Yeah. I see flashing yellow lights, not flashing red lights, flashing yellow lights. I see hiring. The pace of hiring has come down. The unemployment rate is going up. And while it is absolutely true that the U.S. has benefited from more people entering the labor force, that's absolutely true, people worry about the unemployment rate, and this is really important, because the lower income households have used up all their pandemic savings. They've maxed out their credit cards. So, the only thing keeping their consumption going is the certainty of labor income, and if that comes under doubt, under a cloud, then they will become more cautious, and the economy will slow down much faster. So, think of it as flashing yellow, not yet flashing red, but flashing yellow, and we need to avoid it getting to flashing red.",

But, do you think they made a mistake by not beginning sooner? I mean, you were one of the loudest sort of voices to sort of bring the alarm about transitory, maybe not being so transitory. Do you think they waited too long to start cuts?EL-ERIAN: So, I think they waited too long in 2021 to hike rates in response to high inflation. I think this time around, they waited too long. I would have had them cut in July. I was among those who were sort of pressing them to cut in July. At the end of the day, July versus September is not the end of the world. But, it's important that, in addition to cutting in September, that in nine days' time, when chair Powell goes to Jackson Hole, which is the conference that brings central bankers together, he gives us clarity both on the journey and the destination. And that's really important, because he will be guiding markets as to how this cutting path is going to proceed.",

I hear that inflation is moderating, but it doesn't really feel like that at home, who are trying to make sense of sort of what the state of the U.S. economy is right now for their own sense of job security. I mean, what would you say to folks in terms of how you view the U.S. economy right now, in a word, if you might?EL-ERIAN: So, first I will tell, I totally understand, because inflation moderating doesn't mean prices coming down. Prices are still going up by 2.9 percent, so does the price level shock. So, I understand that. Having said that, we are winning the war over inflation, and just make sure that the labor side, the employment side, doesn't get away from us, because the last thing we need is to win the battle over inflation but lose the battle against unemployment.",

And if you look at some data, snacking is on the rise. 46 percent of Americans are having at least three snacks a day, sometimes more. I know I can speak from personal experience. I am constantly snacking in between meals, and that is -- that's good business for these companies. So, snacks are very popular, more salty snacks, rather than sweets. And so, Mars, which has Snickers and all of these candies, they're really trying to stock up on the snacks.And we've seen other candy makers buy more snack companies recently. You think of Hershey. They bought SkinnyPop popcorn, also even Campbell Soup. They've really invested in their snack brands. So snacks, Rahel, that is the place that the food players want to be.",
