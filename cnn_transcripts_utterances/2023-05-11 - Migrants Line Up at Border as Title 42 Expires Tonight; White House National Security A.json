It is a moment that border towns and the Biden administration have been anticipating for weeks now. Agents in three regions along the border have been apprehending more than 2,000 migrants each and every day. A spokesperson for the border town of Brownsville, Texas, tells us, migrants are looking to travel to these destinations, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, New York, Denver and Miami.CNN's Nick Valencia is in Brownsville, Texas, for us this morning.

And I'm so glad that we were able to hear that story.Now, the numbers crossing the border have been growing since the pandemic. In 2020, U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported 450,000 land encounters at the southwest borders. Now, these are encounters. And that word means non-U.S. citizens who engage for the border law enforcement agent, that includes migrants apprehended or not let into the United States under Title 8 and those expelled under Title 42. And many of the same migrants are part of multiple encounters. They get turned away and they keep coming back. So, by 2021, the number of encounters more than tripled to more than 1.7 million. By the end of 2022, 2.3 million encounters occurred, this just last year alone. As for 2023, it is only May, and it is already nearly 2021's total encounters. Border officials say they encountered 1.2 million migrants so far this year. The time between February and March saw a 22.9 percent spike. Now, more than 10,000 encounters each day are taking place. These asylum seekers who cross or categorize this way, family units, single adults and unaccompanied children, so far this year, more than 70,000 children without a parent or caretaker have been encountered. So, as the Biden administration sends of thousands in additional manpower to the border, they are also ruling out new measures to track migrants, those who are released into the United States. One part of it does require some to wear GPS ankle monitors. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is at the White House for us. Again, Priscilla, we are counting down to midnight tonight when things, frankly, will change, and the White House has been counting down for years, including implementing some of these new policies. What is going to happen?",

      "sentences": "And, John, when we say that things will change, we mean they are going to go back to what they were for decades. Remember, Title 42 was the unique circumstance here because of the pandemic. But as you mentioned, White House officials have known that this was going to come to an end at some point now, especially with the COVID-19 public health emergency ending. And so they're ruling out new measures to try to manage the flow of migrants who are crossing. That includes also migrant families. They are a vulnerable population and one that the administration has been keenly aware of for some time now.And so what they are rolling out for at least some of them is that if they are released from custody, that they will be tracked by an ankle monitor, that would be the head of household, and they would also be put under a home curfew. Now, there was a pilot run last year to this effect where the curfew was from dusk until dawn. Now, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency has not provided details as to what they curfew would look like in this instance, but it is another way for them to track families and to hold the accountable to their releasing conditions after, of course, they have been vetted and screened. But this is part of a concerted effort by the administration to try to process those migrants who will come into the United States as they make their asylum claim or be put in the deportation process. It's also part of the measures that, in conjunction with this, will make it even harder for migrants to cross the U.S./Mexico border. So, all of this together, John, just one way to try to manage this challenge that even President Biden has acknowledged may be chaotic.",

KENNEDYNow, we have countered that here with Border Patrol and the city and everybody handing out information saying, okay, you have to register, you need to register so that you are not then expelled from the country, where then there is going to be a five-year wait before you can try to come back in legally. So, we are trying to clear it up. And I think -- in my personal opinion, I think some of these is people that are just trying to make money off of the horrible conditions in South America, Central America, and they figured, well, if I just tell them this, they will pay me all their life savings to get up to the border, and I think that is something we need to do a really better job on trying to inform people of what the real story is, because information is powerful.",

So, just the sheer time it takes to process people will change.We have started processing people now to be prepared for it that they're in the system and ready, and I think that we'll just have to see what the surge is when we hit tonight. But I think that as prepared as we -- and I think if people see that there is processing going down, we have a whole lot less problems. And what has happened in Downtown El Paso is a lot of the streets have cleared because we're already processing people. And to go back with information, they realize, oh, they are processing people.

Donald Trump did not say that.Take a look at what he said. He said, I don't think in terms of winning and losing, I think in terms of getting this settled so we stop killing people. So, you may agree, of course, stopping to kill people, of course, is the ultimate goal here, but did not once again take an opportunity to put distance between himself and Vladimir Putin. In fact, he really expressed his affinity once again for the Russian president. So, this is why this is important. Of course, there is a big, robust foreign policy debate that is happening right now on the future of Ukraine on funding, et cetera. And the former president right there essentially sending a message that he does not see the difference and does not even say who he believes should win that war. So, Kate, of all of the things said last night, if you listen a little harder, go beyond the election lies, et cetera, there were many new things in the town hall, and that is certainly one of them that will continue to be a central part of the foreign policy discussion here in Washington.

Trump has his 27 to 30 percent. If there are 15 other candidates like in 2016, perhaps he emerges again.
