It's -- we're six days short of the anniversary of October 7th. A year ago right now, Joe Biden and people in his administration in thought we were headed toward a possible multilateral peace deal with Saudi Arabia and towards a two-state solution. This is a war that has gone on longer than any war Israel has ever been involved in. It has torn the Democratic Party apart.
