I'm Laila Harrak.Hospitals in Gaza facing a dire situation, one, Al-Shifa Hospital, is almost out of essential supplies as heavy fighting goes on around it. And tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators march in London, demanding a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war. And the end to an historic career, Megan Rapinoe bows out of professional soccer, what she calls the worst possible outcome. The Israeli military has offered to evacuate infants and other patients from Gaza's largest hospital sometime today. While the Hamas- controlled health ministry in Gaza said three new born babies have died since Friday night at Al-Shifa Hospital after nearby shelling knocked out a generator supplying oxygen to the neonatal unit. A Gaza health official tells CNN the other infants were hand-carried to the operating rooms, which still had oxygen, unlike other hospitals across Gaza. Al-Shifa is nearly out of food, water, medicine and fuel. IDF says it's been engaged in heavy fighting with Hamas nearby but denies the hospital is under siege. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. JONATHAN CONRICUS, SPOKESPERSON, IDF:  We are also trying to coordinate the safe removal and transport of the remaining patients that are still inside the hospital. I want to emphasize, we haven't struck the hospital and we are not surrounding it or applying any pressure on it. We have troops in the vicinity, but we have not been engaging with the hospital or any parts of it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Jordan worked with the United Arab Emirates and Qatar to make the drop, saying in a statement they hope to help medical personnel provide treatment and critical services to people in Gaza. Dr. Paul Spiegel is director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Humanitarian Health. He's worked extensively with groups, like MSF to coordinate emergency responses for humanitarian crises. He joins me now from Baltimore, Maryland. Sir, a good day. The situation in Gaza, in general, and at health care facilities in particular is desperately urgent. As a doctor, you have responded to humanitarian emergencies around the globe. How are you thinking about this moment? DR. PAUL SPIEGEL, DIRECTOR, JOHNS HOPKINS CENTER FOR HUMANITARIAN HEALTH:  Yes. Well, indeed, it is critically urgent. I've been in many other situations that are not similar but also urgent. I think the difference here is the intense bombardment and the lack of a release valve, meaning people are not able to leave the country or the territory, as in most other situations where they are able to do so.",

The FBI has not released any comment regarding this particular and very significant development.

So, that spokesperson declining to say exactly who that person was, as Adams maintains he has nothing to hide.

Just since September 1st, again, Lake Charles, Louisiana, looking at over half a foot below where they should be right now, Jackson, Mississippi, similar numbers, Chattanooga looking at over eight inches of a deficit just since September 1st. But relief is on the way. We have a stationary front. It's positioned right along the gulf coast. And that's going to be feeding a lot of moisture back into all of the gulf coast states as we go through the next several days. Now, widespread totals along the gulf coast expected to be three to five inches. But there will be some spots that could pick up six, seven, even as much as eight inches of rain just as we go through Wednesday of the upcoming week. And that's because it's going to be multiple days of rain. Take New Orleans, for example. You've got rain in the forecast all the way through Wednesday. That's going to keep those temperatures on the cool side but it's a lot of moisture that's going to keep getting pumped back into a lot of the same places. This, however, unfortunately, will also increase the risk for flooding, at the same time helping with a lot of drought conditions in this area.",
