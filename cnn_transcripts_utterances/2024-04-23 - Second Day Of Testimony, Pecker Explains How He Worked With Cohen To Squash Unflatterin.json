Welcome to CNN's special primetime coverage of the Trump hush money trial, the first ever criminal trial of a former president.There's a lot to bring you from a truncated but busy day six that saw the judge warn a defense attorney he's losing credibility. Also, testimony from David Pecker, the former tabloid publisher who became the Trump campaign's eyes and ears. And tonight, new reporting and discussions underway about what to do if the former president is actually jailed for contempt. Quite a day. A lot to get to. Judge Merchan's warning came as Trump attorney Todd Blanche tried to answer prosecution evidence during a contempt hearing with the jury not present. The judge saying, \"You're losing all credibility with the court,\" but making no decision on the matter. Then testimony continued from David Pecker, who took jurors deeper into the world of catch and kill, detailing how his National Enquirer sought out stories that might damage the Trump campaign in order to catch them and then bury them. Afterwards, the cameras rolling, viewers watching, the former president spoke out about not being allowed, he believes, to speak out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Because the day before, he was kind of setting the table to explain to the jury what the National Enquirer was and what they did, and today, it was really bringing them into this alleged conspiracy, this August 2015 meeting where Donald Trump, David Pecker, Michael Cohen all hatched this catch-and-kill scheme and made the decision that they were going to bury some stories, promote negative stories, made-up stories about some rivals, all to help Donald Trump's campaign and David Pecker really underscored that today.And then, of course, getting into some of these two of the three catch-and-kill deals, both the one involving the doorman, one involving Karen McDougal. And all throughout the time, David Pecker was very composed, I think a credible witness. He was being specific in his testimony and he was addressing the jury for most of the time. At the time, Donald Trump was variously, intently watching David Pecker and then otherwise looking, appearing to either be staring off or looking at this monitor in front of him, which actually gives a feedback. It's the video feedback that plays in the overflow courtroom, and so he's kind of watching himself watch the trial, so to speak.",

Donald Trump, Pecker and Cohen. Now, there is no conspiracy charge.They could have easily charge some form of a conspiracy if they could have figured that out. But one of the reasons why I don't think they try to even charge a conspiracy is you have three people in a conspiracy, two of them are going to be witnesses and one's a defendant, why? Usually, it's one cooperator and two defendants, not the other way around. Additionally, Anderson, he got immunity. Not a cooperation agreement, immunity. Which goes to Jeffrey's point, I think, like, there is really no - we haven't spoken about a crime yet. There is no crime at this point. Everything he's talking about, there's nothing in the penal that say this catch-and-kill theory is criminal. So, that's - obviously, in summation, the defense is going to focus on who this guy is and what he's all about. But here's what they have to get out in cross-examination. Isn't it true, Mr. Pecker, that at one point, Mr. Trump said - in addition to the campaign, Melania doesn't need to hear about this, that's all they need. And he was like, yes, he was concerned about Melania. He was concerned about Barron.

He explained what the relationships are that Michael Cohen is sort of Donald Trump's lieutenant and Dylan Howard was his lieutenant. He explained the chains of communication. So you're not going to win it all with one shot right off the bat, but I think it's a good start. And by the way, prosecutors should not be high-fiving in the beginning, middle or end of direct.

And so this goes to what we were just talking about. They paid this money to Stormy Daniels to hush her for the election. And the allegations, they falsified the payments. They tried to make it look like an attorney's legal fees, a retainer. And the argument is there's the falsification. And you have to tie that to Donald Trump, which is not going to be easy.

And the part where they talk about Karen McDougal was at the very end of today's hearing. The prosecution saved the Karen McDougal part.And in here, David Pecker recounts being pulled out of a meeting from a phone call by Donald Trump to ask about the various whispers that have been going on about Karen McDougal. We don't have graphics of this, but let me read this to you. Pecker says in the testimony, \"He mentioned to me, he said, 'I spoke to Michael,'\" Michael Cohen. \"He said, 'he told me about, uh, uh, that time.' He told me about that. He said, 'He told me about Karen.' He said to me, 'What do you think?\" This is Pecker saying that Trump asked him, what do you think about Karen McDougal. Pecker goes on to say, I believe you should buy it. I believe you, Trump, should buy the Karen McDougal story. Trump said to me, \"Look, everything he says, I don't buy stories.\" And he said that anytime you do anything like this, it always gets out. Pecker says, \"I still believe we should take the story off the market.\" Trump says, \"Let me think about it and I'll have Michael Cohen call you in a few days.\" And this we do have a graphic of. Later in the testimony, Pecker talks about how he was speaking to Michael Cohen. This is Josh Steinglass, the prosecutor, \"How would you describe Michael Cohen's tone during those calls about Karen McDougal?\" Pecker says, \"Michael was very agitated. It looked like he was getting a lot of pressure to get the answer, like, right away.\" Steinglass asks, \"What makes you say that?\" Pecker says, \"He kept on calling; and each time he called, he seemed more anxious.\" \"Steinglass says, \"Did you understand - did you understand as to where that pressure to find out more was coming from?\" Pecker says, \"Well, you know, I assumed he had a conversation with Mr. Trump.",

The other thing is it establishes a really important chain of communication, because this is one of the rare instances - there's a few - where David Pecker has direct contact with Donald Trump.

And so here, the allegation is that by capturing these stories for Donald Trump, preventing them from being disclosed, paying off these individuals, all of this is basically favorable treatment for Donald Trump. In addition to the fact that David Pecker also testified today that he was planting favorable stories and also running disfavorable stories, unfavorable stories for Donald Trump's opponents. So that's a big contribution and that's the way the prosecution is framing this. This was a big up for Donald Trump's campaign and it essentially constituted election fraud. COOPER: And so, in your opinion, when Donald Trump comes out and says, well look, you know, I was paying a lawyer and we said legal fees, what's wrong with that? What's the answer to that?",

They're paying these payments to Stormy Daniels. There's the work that David Pecker is doing and bringing and coordinating all of this together and that's sort of the misdemeanor part.There's also the tax fraud issue that is also been pointed to. Hasn't been brought up in David Pecker's testimony. I think it will come out later on Thursday. But the idea that Donald Trump had to gross up Michael Cohen in order to make him whole for the payments, because he's actually reimbursing him for what was being classified as payments for legal services, even though there had been no legal services rendered. So that's the difficulty here. And I think what the prosecution is trying to show, and there's a lot of discussion of Donald Trump's hands and all of this, is that he's very much a micromanager. He is taking really close looks at what the money is, where the money is going, to whom it is going. And this is just David Pecker and Michael Cohen doing his bidding, but he is the mastermind, essentially the puppet master, and they are simply the puppets.",

That's very important, especially when we get into the money stuff where Wiesenfeld will not be a witness probably. It looks like he's not going to testify, but his documents and his handwriting will be introduced. And because there's a conspiracy, that will be admissible against Donald Trump.",

It may be the case that a newspaper or a media outlet will endorse a particular candidate. But I don't think we've ever seen a situation where a particular candidate goes to the outlet and negotiates with them for favorable treatment of his campaign and unfavorable treatment of his opponent. So that's unusual. And the way the prosecution has framed it, this is essentially a stop to the Trump campaign as though it were a contribution in kind. And I think that's a theory of the case, whether or not the jurors by this as a contribution, I think is a different story. But that seems to be where the prosecution is taking that.

This isn't a one off. He is in Donald Trump's pocket.
