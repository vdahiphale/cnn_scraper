I'm Becky Anderson in London tonight hundreds of French andother European nationals gather at the airport in Niger's Capital Niamey to prepare for evacuation. Now this comes as neighboring countries warn against any foreign military intervention in the West African country to restore the ousted President. Russia's war in Ukraine increasingly blowing up in Moscow, the Russian Capital hit by drones for the second time in just three days pointing the blame squarely at Ukraine. Well, the heaviest screen and a decade kills 11 in Beijing is raging torrents wash away roads and cars and even people. This elderly woman was trapped in the floodwaters for some time she did though eventually get rescued. Right now a host of EU countries are urgently preparing to evacuate their citizens from Niger. Hundreds of EU nationals have gathered at the airport in Niamey hoping to get out as the U.S. orders its troops to stay on their base in Niger both reflections of deep international concerns about the instability there. Meanwhile, two of Niger's neighbors Burkina Faso and Mali have joined Guinea in warning that they will retaliate if any other country tries to intervene in the ongoing coup breaking with a host of other nations in the region.

Well, this comes after the West African economic bloc threatened on Sunday to use force if Niger's military junta did not release and reinstate Mr. Bazoum by this weekend coming and they also impose financial and travel penalties against the coup plotters. My next guest is a former U.S. Special Envoy to the Sahel region, which of course includes Niger. He writes in a recent op-ed \"While serving as U.S. special envoy for the Sahel, I repeatedly emphasized the heart of the crisis in the Sahel is one of state legitimacy, a perception by citizens that their government is valid, equitable and able and willing to meet their needs. Absent States commitments to meeting their citizen's needs no degree of international engagement is likely to succeed\". Well, Dr. J. Peter Pham joins us now it's good to have you, sir. Your experience and your insight are extremely important as we frankly watch an escalation having heard from Mali and Burkina Faso, just today. We know ECOWAS is threatened retaliation if the president is not reinstated. Just elaborate a little further, if you will, on the conceit of your argument in that recent op-ed? J. PETER PHAM, FORMER U.S. SPECIAL ENVOY FOR THE SAHEL: Well, thank you for having me, Becky. The problem in the Sahel, the crisis is ultimately one of, as I said, of state legitimacy of governance of the ability to provide basic goods and services to citizens. And this is what makes the unfolding coup in Niger, particularly tragic. Because this is the one country that actually in the region had up to now been doing what it should have been doing and with help from international partners, largely succeeding.

Burkina Faso and Mali beating their chests and saying they will support Niger is somewhat reasonable, because these are two countries that have difficulty, the governments, the juntas in control, have difficulty and are losing ground to the extremists. So they're not going to be of much help to anyone. So there's a lot of escalating. We need to de-escalate. On the other hand, we also have to tell the truth or truth needs to be told. The fact is, in Niger, you had a democratically elected president, who was overthrown before his even his first term had gotten halfway through. This is a government that, unlike the others in the region, had actually been making considerable progress by a mix of both development dialogue, and were necessary military action supported by units trained by the United States and France.",

In fact, the last six months of this year, the level of violence in Niger is at its lowest level in five years. The United States has trained and still provides intelligence and other services to the Nigerian Special Forces units, which has helped stand up. French forces operate more directly in the counterterrorism sphere. American forces no longer accompany these patrols, since the unfortunate loss of several Special Forces members several years ago and attack in Niger; we offer a call in the Tilbury region. So this is center. And this is also very importantly, the node where migration flows northward to Europe, a lot of human trafficking. We also have drug trafficking flowing through this region.

Beijing, airport closed all the things that are happening there. The heat throughout the rest of Europe, what's happened in the United States, how they dare to say that this is the most urgent thing that faces us, we have to get on with it.

There's a bit of political nonsense is going on about some of the things which are done in crack handed way. You have to accept that we need to just transition, you need to be helping those who are in most need. You need the rich to pay the biggest bill. I don't understand why we don't have a really heavy tax on private aero planes. We've got the largest number of takeoffs from private airplanes in Britain of any country in Europe.
