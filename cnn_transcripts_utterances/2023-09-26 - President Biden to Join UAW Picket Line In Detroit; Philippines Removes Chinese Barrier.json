Plus, Republican frontrunner Donald Trump seen gun shopping in South Carolina but the campaign forced to backtrack about whether he actually bought one. And as deadline day fast approaches for a government shutdown, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy faces more questions about spending talks and questions about whether he can keep his job. Good morning to our viewers in the United States, good day to all of you around the world. I am Kasie Hunt. It is Tuesday, September 26, 5:00 a.m. here in Washington, 2:00 a.m. out on the West Coast. It is also 5:00 a.m. in Detroit where just hours from now, President Biden will do something no more than president has ever done. He plans to walk the picket line with striking workers. It is day 11 of the simultaneous strikes against General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, that also a historic first. The White House was grilled Monday about Biden potentially being seen as taking sides against the automakers. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  He is standing with the workers. We are not involved in negotiations. That is something for them to decide. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The path to the White House, of course, runs straight through that blue wall, including states like Michigan.

Tyler, thanks so much for being with us this morning. It's always great to see you. You cover this administration day in and day out. You pay attention to how the administration is trying to campaign. Biden of course always painted himself as the most pro union president. This obviously is a move to try to solidify that image. What's going on in the White House behind the scenes?",

      "sentences": "Absolutely, as in conversations with White House officials I've had the past week, it has been clear they wanted an opportunity to send the president out to Michigan or one of the other states where the workers are striking and a obviously, Trump did play a factor whether or not the White House will publically admit that. This is the likely general election match-up as you said, the election runs through these states.And Biden wants to make very clear to the people in Michigan and to the larger Midwest and some of these autoworkers but more broadly the labor movement that he is their strongest ally, that, you know, working class voters are key to turnout in these states. This is something that -- an area of the country that Trump over-performed in 2016. Biden won them back by narrow margins in 2020. So, it's clear that they are going to show up and do something as you said that is unprecedented, becoming the first president according to historians to march on the picket line. The scene should be remarkable to see what Biden says about workers but also about companies. Obviously this has major economic implications if the strike continues. And Biden's presence, how that's going to affect negotiations remains to be seen.",

      "sentences": "Now, it's a very good point. And, look, a lot of this has to do with the UAW leader Shawn Fain and part of why this invitation unfolded the way it did, was, you know, the White House had planned to send a couple economic folks to potentially participate in negotiations or at least be on the ground there to be available.[05:05:06] And Shawn Fain basically told them to pound sand, you know, send the president instead to stand with us if you really want to do something for us. And they actually went along with it. And, of course, Fain is withholding the UAW endorsement right now from Biden. That historically has really been important for Democratic candidates. I mean, how much is that weighing on the White House's thinking right now, wanting to get their backing in a general election?",

And that backfired.And so, now, we're at the place where the president is going out there themselves. I think the union endorsement is something that the president wants. Historically large labor unions have backed Democrats. The president has already wracked up a number of key endorsements from labor unions. But I think it goes beyond just the union brass endorsing the president. Obviously, the teachers unions and the like have stood up behind Joe Biden. But it is more about those rank and file union members. You know, it is one thing to get the endorsement and say that you are backed by this group, but they have thousands of members and Joe Biden wants to lock in the support from those people and ensure that they show up to the polls. So this is also part of that effort, not just getting the top line endorsement but making inroads with those voters who ultimately are the ones who show up to the polls so that he can win Michigan, Wisconsin and states like that. And whether he is successful in doing that will go a long way. Tomorrow, we've seen sometimes contentious exchanges with rank and file labor members over the years, particularly as president as he visited factory floors in the past. How is he able to connect with the union workers today I think will be key in sort of signaling whether or not he is able to keep the support he's had from labor unions and what Donald Trump does when he heads there tomorrow.",

That, of course, at the time Donald Trump who has tried to personally identify with these people. Although Democrats will be quick to point out that many of his policies undermines strength of unions.Tyler Pager, thank you so much for being with us. I really hope you'll come back soon.",

That's 1.3 million square miles we are talking about. Now, that's something rejected by an international tribunal, not recognized by the U.S. government.But that's also why Beijing just responded to the latest move by the Philippines by warning Manila not to create troubles or provoke incidents. Now, what Beijing has been able to do the past few years and none of the other claimants have been able to, of course, through massive land reclamation and construction turning previously uninhabited reefs and islands into manmade islands, equipped with sophisticated radars, airstrips. That is why they're able to increasingly project military power in this region. Just in the past few week and months, we have seen an uptick of publicized incidents between China and Philippines with the Chinese coast guard, for example, using water cannons and what Philippines describe as dangerous maneuvers to chase and drive away Philippine boats. But, of course, from Beijing's perspective, only thing that has changed recently is the government in Manila. Now they have a new president, President Marcos, who according to Beijing is doing the U.S. bidding to instigate tensions in the region. So underlying concern here, Kasie, out of all this is the Chinese military is not going to abandon their manmade island. So how does anyone including the U.S. stop and change Chinese behavior short of a war -- Kasie.",

It is just a floating border, but so incredibly significant. And they turn around and in the leadership in the Philippines, hugelysignificant, because Duterte was leaning towards China. Didn't actually play -- particularly well domestically. And now we're seeing Marcos doing much better cozying up to the United States. And not just in a small way either. The United States is setting up bases there. There is an international base for U.S. forces there. So when we see the images of the Philippines pushing back against China, that would have been in alliance with the United States. So we can read into this U.S./China tensions as well, and how important the Philippines is playing into that as well as the other alliances that you were talking about there in the region.",
