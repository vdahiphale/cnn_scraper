The Israeli defense ministersuggested earlier this week that this was just the beginning of a shift in focus on Lebanon to facilitate their citizens being able to return to their homes in the north. This attack in Beirut that I was just describing just the latest this week. COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Yes, that's right, Julia. And it seems that this shift in focus is really meaning that the Israeli forces are going to move their center of gravity as the defense minister called it from the Gaza area all the way to the north. And this means that they are certainly getting ready for something against Hezbollah, whether or not it's going to actually mean that they are going into a full-on ground type invasion. That's a completely different story. I don't think that the preparations are completely finished for a standard ground invasion, but they have certainly proved that they can do the aerial attacks plus the unconventional attacks, as we saw with the pagers and the walkie-talkies, and that is clearly, I think, phase one or so of this new operation that the defense minister announced.",

To your point about this perhaps being stage one of what we see, it's a very different prospect to see some kind of ground invasion in Lebanon. But how do you foresee this in some way playing out?

Theyclearly want to make a condition secure for their citizens in the northern towns to go back to those northern towns. There are at least 60,000 or so Israelis that are affected by the evacuations that they conducted in, you know, the past year. So, the Israelis will probably move forward. They will continue to use various means, especially air power to go after Hezbollah. And if they feel ready, they may very well go in to a part of Lebanon, to the southern part of Lebanon, and seek to really exchange -- extend their territorial control all the way up to the Litani River, just like they did a few decades ago, back in the early 2000s, and that could very well proved to be the beginning of a major conflict between them and Hezbollah.",

All right. We're also following a very disturbing story from the occupied West Bank, and we warn you, the next video is hard to watch. The Israeli military says it's investigating soldiers for throwing men off a rooftop during an incursion near Jenin. CNN can't confirm whether they were already dead, but they are motionless and do appear lifeless. Israel calls it a \"serious incident,\" quote, that does not coincide with IDF values. It did not identify the individuals, but says it killed seven militants during clashes in the area. Palestinian politician Mustafa Barghouti calls it a \"barbaric act,\" quote, that shows the degradation and brutality of the Israeli army.

Mark Robinson is running for governor of North Carolina, a potential swing state in the U.S. presidential election.

North Carolina is an extremely important state in the presidential elections, and I think both sides wondering just what impact, at least at the presidential level, this scandal will have.

DIANNE GALLAGHER, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  You know, I've covered politics in the State of North Carolina for years, and the experience that I had yesterday, before the CNN KFile story was even published, is unlike anything I've ever had here. I had Republicans calling me all morning asking what was going to be in this, and expressing their stress and their fear about what yet another story about Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson may do not just to all of the statewide and down ballot races, but Former President Trump's chances at winning North Carolina and thus, winning the White House.

We actually didn't think it was going to happen on Thursday night in Florida against the Marlins. He needed two home runs and a stolen base, but Ohtani went out there and had arguably the greatest game in baseball history. The Japanese icon leading off the game with the Marlins with a double and then would steal third moments later for steal number 50. Ohtani then singled in the second inning and stole base number 51. So, the stage was set and the crowd expecting we needed two home runs to see history. Well, in the sixth inning, Ohtani at the plate launching home run number 49.

A little bit of breeze comes through, probably around 30 to 40 kilometers per hour, but that is all she wrote. And then by the Saturday and Sunday, all that rain and all that wind is gone. We're still seeing rain, though, for Vietnam into Laos and even farther to the west than that. Look at the thing of Vietnam, 135 millimeters just in about 24 to 36 hours. And notice the spin. This is what a low-pressure system looks like just kind of on a radar. This is a fake radar. It's what the computer model thinks the radar is going to look like, but that's kind of the low pressure that we're going to have over the next couple of days. And it just piles up rainfall, even for the province here of Hainan. You're going to see temperatures probably only in the lower 60s and 70s in the afternoon because the rain is going to be there just all day long. Now, for closer to North America. We also have something tropical brewing possibly. Somewhere over here in the Bay of Campeche, this is the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, right there, there is a 50-50 shot, and the computers are saying a higher shot than that, but 50-50 over the next week, that something develops, something very sinister could be developing here for the Gulf of Mexico, too. We'll have to keep watching this. I cannot put a nine-day forecast out for a hurricane, but the longer-term models are hinting at such. So, we'll certainly Keep an eye on that.",

A South Korean intelligence agency says the ruler is looking for someone to blame and lower-level officials are paying the price. As many as 30 people may have been executed. It's the latest sign the Kim regime is turning deadly for North Korea's elite. Will Ripley reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  North Korea is facing its worst flooding crisis in decades, overwhelming destruction, an unknown number of dead, a catastrophe caused by heavy rains and human failure. Lack of planning and preparation, plenty of blame to go around. Kim Jong Un's absolute power means he can't be criticized. He's going on a rampage, punishing local officials, removing some from their posts, perhaps going even further. South Korea's spy agency says it's closely monitoring signs. North Korea may have executed multiple officials over the flooding. One report put the number as high as 30, citing an unnamed South Korean official. Any numbers are nearly impossible to verify, given North Korea's extreme isolation and rejection of all-outside aid.",

RIPLEY (voice-over):  That traumatic experience, one reason, Choong-Kwon Park says he ran away from North Korea 15 years ago, despite his elite upbringing. Today, he's a South Korean lawmaker. PARK (through translator):  It doesn't make sense why these public executions are still happening in North Korea. But you know, Kim Jong Un killed his own uncle. RIPLEY (voice-over):  That execution sent chills through the North Korean elite, made up of top party officials, diplomats, and senior officers. Kim's uncle, Jang Song-thaek, was the second most powerful man in North Korea. South Korea's unification ministry says only around 50 elite North Koreans fled under Kim's father. That number has almost tripled under Kim Jong Un, coinciding with his crackdown on corrupt officials. PARK (through translator):  The reason for the elite defections is that in North Korea, there's fewer benefits for the elite now. Secondly, it's no secret that North Korea has a lot of problems. And thirdly, there's no hope among the young people. RIPLEY (voice-over):  Late last year, a high-ranking North Korean diplomat defected from Cuba. South Korea's foreign ministry says North Korea has been closing consulates, embassies, and offices around the world. The number of elite defections is rising, even as overall defections are down dramatically since the pandemic. The result of massively increased North Korean border security, not just to keep people out, but to keep them in. WILL RIPLEY, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So, many restauranteurs respond manually to the online reviews that they receive every night about their restaurant. Some restauranteurs spend hours a day doing this. So, instead of having them manually do it, we created a chat bot that responds to the reviews in the tone of the restaurant, on behalf of the restaurant, saving restaurateurs a lot of time.

Even stranger than that was the message that came with it, which said, we received a Tesla Cybertruck from the respected Elon Musk. Kadyrov also said he was sending the Cybertruck to the front line of Russia's war in Ukraine. Musk then responded in very Musk language to deny the gift, saying it was ridiculous to think he would donate a Cybertruck to a Russian general. That, you might think, would be the end of it. But it's not. Kadyrov has now posted to Telegram accusing Elon Musk of remotely deactivating his truck in a long post, which ends, it's not manly. The iron horse had to be towed. How come, Elon? Is this how it is done? No response yet from Tesla or Musk. In the meantime, Kadyrov doesn't appear to be put off.
