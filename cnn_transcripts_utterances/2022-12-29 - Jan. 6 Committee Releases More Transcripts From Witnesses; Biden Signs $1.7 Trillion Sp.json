So, what will the Department of Justice do with it all?Let's talk about what we've learned with former Congressman Charlie Dent, also CNN Senior Political Analyst Ron Brownstein, we also Vanity Fair Special Correspondent Molly Jong-Fast and former Federal Prosecutor Shan Wu. Great to see all of you guys. Let's just look at a couple of the things that had been revealed today by the committee, and one, I think, particularly interesting one is Don Jr. and the texts that Don Jr. was sending to Mark Meadows. And I want to juxtapose what he sent the day after the election, the day after his father lost the election, and then what he sent on January 6th, because I think there is an arc between the two. The first one that he sends that he claims is not his writing, and it doesn't sound like his voice, frankly, and he also claims he doesn't remember who sent it to him, it says, we have operational control, total leverage, moral high ground. POTUS must start second term now. State assemblies can step in and vote to put forward the electoral state. Republicans control 28 states, Democrats 22 states. Once again, Trump wins. That is the roadmap the day after the election, Ron, for how to keep Donald Trump unconstitutionally in office, okay? Now, fast forward to January 6th when they've tried some of these things and suddenly Donald Trump Jr. is texting a different tune. Here it is. We need an oval address. He has to lead now. It's gone too far. It's gotten out of hand. I mean, what did they think their shenanigans was going to lead to? It led to chaos and violence.",

Because, as you know, Donald Trump Jr. is really the first one to suggest, and this is in the full report, to suggest the strategy of trying to get state legislators to overturn the result in their state and simply substitute Donald Trump electors for Joe Biden electors based on the actual verified results in their state.In this deposition, he is asked about that, because, as you point out, this is very specific and in language that doesn't seem to flow naturally from Donald Trump Jr. And he says, Alisyn, in the deposition that it is, quote, a cut and paste job. He acknowledges that, that it came from somewhere else. But then he insists that he can't remember where it came from. In fact, if you take out the words, I don't remember, I don't recall, I can't recall, this 105-page transcript might be down to five pages from Donald Trump Jr. But the fact is that I can't imagine the special counsel is going to allow this to simply drift away, this idea that he can't remember where the idea came from that ultimately led to the fake elector scheme that they are investigating because he is very clearly suggesting it came from somewhere else. He is just not saying where.",

I mean, it is a little heady for Don Jr. to know how many states there are. But I do think that there are a number of people who were advising him and he was talking to congressmen. He was talking to -- you know, he has a bunch of lawyers and, you know, there are many, many members of Trump world, some of whom have received pardons, who were advising this.

I mean, to Ron's point, absolutely, the special counsel will be very interested in that, but there are tools to compel further disclosures are limited. And actually it is really interesting, Alisyn, because you're actually seeing some of the advantages of the Congressional investigation where they have these sort of freewheeling depositions with the witnesses' lawyer being present.It is not as intense or curated of an experience as is a grand jury. If it was a grand jury to begin with, most likely, he would have said nothing, just constantly taking the Fifth. But here, they were able to tease some of this type of information out of him. He calls it a cut and paste jobs, suggesting where did you get it from, but then he says he can't remember. So, he is giving people some leads to look at probably inadvertently there. But that is one of the big differences between the Congressional investigation and a grand jury one. And, of course, double-edged sword for DOJ, they have all of this testimony now and they have to reconcile it, look for inconsistencies, possibly some things are exculpatory and some things are just a little bit ambiguous for them. So, it is a really big job ahead but certainly I'd say the theme in all of these transcripts coming out is that all roads flow toward Mark Meadows. I think he is number one on the hit list.",

He is going to take the Fifth. If they have a conversation with his lawyers and say, look, we think we have enough to indict your client, do you want to cut a deal and cooperate, that is very different than any posturing you might make before a congressional committee.So, I think that's what it looks like is what kind of charges they may bring and what -- most importantly, practically as a prosecutor and defense attorney, what kind of conversation are they going to have with his lawyers?",

Give me, you know, an example of illegals voting. Just give me a very small snapshot I can take and champion.

So, I think that is why they have the wind at their back.There are plenty of challenges ahead, God knows. Just to name a few, first, Biden has got to try to avoid a recession, he's got to try to tame inflation, he has to implement all of that legislation because it doesn't mean anything until the rubber meets the road. He's got to keep NATO unified against Vladimir Putin, no easy task. And he also has to continue to be aware of the threat to democracy in the form of Trumpism. It hasn't gone away. And one real challenge will be trying to unify the country in the event that Trump is prosecuted in state or federal court, which I think is almost inevitable. That is going to be a high wire act for this president. And, finally, if I could add one more thing, there is a really big personnel challenge coming up. Biden's White House chief of staff, Ron Klain, who has had a lot to do with the president's success, may well be approaching a point where he wants to move on. There's a reason why White House chiefs of staff last an average of 18 months. Klain has been there two years. And if he leaves, those are going to be awfully big shoes to fill.",

And if something is too woke.In this one that got the New York Times attention, it was whether school is too hard. And at NYU there was a crop of kids, Molly, that did think that they are professor. So, this was a professor in an organic chemistry class, and they thought he was impossibly hard. They signed a petition. We urge you to realize that a class with such a high percentage of withdrawals and low grades has failed to make students learning and wellbeing a priority and reflects poorly on the chemistry department as well as the institution as a whole. I believe they got him fired and then his quote, the professor's quote was, \"they weren't coming to class, that's for sure because I can count the house, Dr. Jones said in an interview. They weren't watching the videos and they weren't able to answer the questions. So, this is the, you know, debate about whether or not kids are being too molly coddled. And they're not tough enough. Your thoughts? JONG-FAST:  I think that, you know, look, we have a problem, which is that a lot of this higher ed has become like a business, right? It's very expensive. And the students and the parents are sort of like customers. And so, you ultimately find yourself in a -- in a situation where the goal here is learning, but these people are paying thousands of dollars with sometimes very mixed results. I mean, it's not like a college degree, you know, guarantees you'll have a great career. And so, I do think you find yourself in a situation where you have these consumers who are not happy with the product and because they've paid so much money, you're in an impossible situation. I still feel like I don't quite know enough about this general situation to know exactly what happened. And there was some other reporting around this that said maybe there was other stuff. But yes, I mean, it's never good when students get teachers fired, you know? Almost never good.

And he corrected me.He, you know, given who watches HBO, the \"White Lotus\" is really inviting the rest of the top 10 percent to scorn the 1 percent, which in some ways is revealing of where we are as a society. I, you know, I think Zuckerberg and the whole drama around Facebook in '16 and '20 followed by Muth (Ph) has been in kind of a cultural turning point. I mean, you go back to the 90, we thought the tech Baron's work in particular, which is of course more the knives out sequel, we thought the tech barons were going to save us. I mean, Steve Jobs was the future. Now I think they look much more like a threat to our future than the salvation.

So, I do think there is a literary tradition and a television tradition there. But I do think what Ron said is really important, that there was a sort of moment when we thought all of these tech oligarchs would be, you know, doing, giving all their money away and solving the world's problems and instead they've largely caused many problems.

You have a lot of very understated people who've accumulated a lot ofwealth and you never knew it until they died. That's kind of what I'm used to. People like that who were very modest, at least they appeared to be quite modest but scrolled away their money and they didn't talk about it. This wasn't something they would do and they would never flaunt it. And it's some -- sometimes with these shows too, you know, you always would hear about the ugly American, the American who goes abroad and behaves like a jerk because they have money and offends everybody.
