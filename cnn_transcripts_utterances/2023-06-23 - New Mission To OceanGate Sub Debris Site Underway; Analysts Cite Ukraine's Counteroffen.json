      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome to the show everyone, I'm Christina Macfarlane in for Isa Soares. Tonight, questions over the safetystandards of the sub that officials say imploded, as the ROV company confirms to CNN, a new mission is underway to the debris site. And a close look at the Ukrainian counteroffensive, where we stand, and why some say it's slow-going. Plus, Starbucks scrutinized. Employees accusing the mega brand of hypocrisy for restricting Pride decorations in some locations. How companies can manage messaging in these highly polarized times. How authorities are now piecing together the Titan's final moments to understand what happened. U.S. Coast Guard says the tour sub likely suffered a catastrophic implosion en route to the Titanic almost 4 kilometers below sea level in the North Atlantic. In other words, the tremendous amount of pressure near the shipwreck likely caused a sudden inward collapse of the vessel. Investigators are now searching for answers on the ocean floor. At least, five major pieces of debris have been found. But experts say it is unlikely the bodies of the five men on board will ever be recovered. The U.S. Navy now revealing that it detected a sound underwater consistent with an implosion on Sunday. That's the day the sub went missing, but at the time, it was not definitive. Well, Paula Newton is standing by in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on Canada's Atlantic Coast. So, as I was saying there, Paula, we know that the ROV has located five major pieces of debris. Any indication how much longer this search is going to go on? And what hope there is that more parts may be recovered?",

      "sentences": "Yes, this is highly significant. They're saying that they will likely be on the scene for about another week, andthat is consistent with the difficult task ahead. Now, they want to obviously be able to get that debris and lift it to the surface. But what they are doing first is they are sending those remote-operated vehicles to the sea bed and mapping exactly what they believe exists in terms of debris from the Titan. Then, at that point, they will figure out how to move it to the surface. The company operating this says they just do not have the lift capacity on those robots to be able to lift those pieces of debris to the surface. And that would involve yet another salvage operation. What's interesting here is that they're already saying they've been told to stay on the scene for a week. At issue, though, and I have to tell you, I've reached out to Canadian officials, they've been completely unresponsive, both the transport ministry here and the Transportation Safety Board which runs independently of the government, have not responded to requests about whether or not they have launched an investigation, and if they are the ones for this. And it -- probably, Christina, reflects a bit of sensitivity about who would carry out this investigation, importantly, who would pay for it, and exactly what is really an issue is the parameters of the investigation. Again, this was an unregulated submersible that happened to launch off the coast of Canada, but also came from the United States. Several different countries involved in now that it has moved from a search and rescue operation to a recovery and investigation. That is where jurisdiction and of course, who is paying for all this will become an issue. Christina?",

Now, as he closes out his state visit to the U.S., Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Biden have been meeting with top business executives. Modi is seeking to position India as a manufacturing and diplomatic power house. And the two countries have announced new defense and technology deals. Now, this is only the third state visit hosted by Mr. Biden as president. Both leaders are looking to counter China's growing influence. Let's bring in Kevin Liptak who is standing by for us in Washington D.C. And Kevin, yesterday, I think the big headline we heard from President Biden was him touting this as the defining relationship of the 21st century, while at the same time taking criticism over hosting Modi at the White House due to his human rights record. So talk us through what substance has come out of this meeting, and how it's been received in Washington.",

The U.S. says it's going to help bolster India's semiconductor industry. There were some major defense sales agreements, including on drones to India. But I think sort of taken as a whole, the takeaway from this visit is that President Biden really does want to cultivate India as a partner. And certainly, Modi wants to become closer to the United States. And as you mentioned, this hasn't been an uncontroversial visit. Certainly plenty of members of President Biden's own Democratic Party were very critical that he was rolling out the red carpet for a leader who has demonstrated some autocratic tendencies and what has become backsliding of democracy in India. There were certainly plenty of Democrats who boycotted Prime Minister Modi's speech to Congress yesterday. But I think in President Biden's mind, there really is no major challenge confronting the world, whether it's China, whether it's A.I. which he was discussing today, or whether it's Russia, that he cannot solve without India's buying. Of course, it's the world's largest country. It is the most populous democracy. And in the end, President Biden's sort of autocracy versus democracy structure can't necessarily always be applied. You know, he is realizing he will have to cultivate some of these countries that don't necessarily share every single value with the United States. And particularly, when it comes to China and when it comes to Russia, India has sort of positioned itself in the middle. It's sort of been aligned when it comes to conflicts with those countries. And what President Biden, I think is doing is trying to pull India into the fold with the recognition that he won't be able to achieve all of his objectives on the foreign stage, only working with countries who share all of his democratic values. And so, I think as Prime Minister Modi departs Washington later today, you do see this very historic state visit concluding, and you see this partnership between the two men really on full display. And it was so striking. I don't remember a previous state visit that has had, you know, three full days of engagements between the leaders. So certainly, President Biden really looking to underscore the importance of this partnership going forward. Christina.",

A lot of times you'll see on TV all of the high today, the record for today. This is any day of June for any year that they've been keeping track. And 50 other stations did the same thing. Some broke all-time records even for July and August as well. So this is what we're expecting, 5 to 10 degrees above average for the next week or so. Yes, up and down a little, but it's still going to be very hot. And when we start to get this front in here, that's when we're going to start to cool down. The warm moist air gets all the way to the north and sets up here, we start to see some clouds. The clouds will stop some of the sun, but that's not going to happen until July. I mean, it's almost like a Monsoon for India, right? It's the same kind of idea. But the cold air kind of gets trapped up there, and then it starts baking through the Summer time. And then finally, this rain that's going to be down here right now where it's supposed to be, won't get up towards Beijing for a long time. Shanghai, very heavy rainfall coming, probably 250 millimeters of rainfall. Look at this, this is some state here in India. This is what they're dealing with too. The Monsoon did make it here, and that's quite obvious. Monsoon predictions right through here, and that's where the green line is, that's where the Monsoon right now, the wind is. It should be much farther inland, that's going to keep New Delhi very hot, because we're not going to see the showers that we expect. Ninety percent of the annual rain comes from Monsoon. So they expect this. They do expect flooding as well. And a lot of the agriculture is all Monsoon related. But you don't want to flood the fields because then all of a sudden, you don't have crops. You don't have anything to grow or to feed your livestock. And it has been a very wet couple of days there. Finally, cooling down, finally slowing down some of the rainfall, but it is going to be still a very warm day. On average, we're 1.2 degrees sea above normal, that's 7 percent more humidity, relative humidity in the air. And that 41 probably felt warmer than that with the humidity there in Beijing.

KARADSHEH (voice-over): The Greek Coast Guard have declined our request for an interview, but in previous comments, they've denied towing the troller saying, \"When the boat capsized, we were not even next to it. How could we be towing it?\" Instead, they blamed a \"shift in weight, probably caused by panic.\" For years, Greek authorities have been accused of systematically and violently pushing back migrants and refugees. A video like this one released by the Turkish Government captured the now well-documented practice Greece denies. This deadly incident is not just about what they may have done, it's also about what they didn't do.",

So, the authorities have the responsibility to intervene to save life. KARADSHEH (voice-over): As Fortress Europe hardens its immigration policies to deter some of the world's most vulnerable, this disaster will almost certainly not be the last. (END VIDEOTAPE) KARADSHEH (on camera): And Christina over the past few years, we have been reporting on these pushbacks that are taking place by European countries, more and more countries becoming less welcoming of refugees and migrants. But these tactics, these pushbacks have done very little to deter these people who are so desperate to begin a new life in Europe. And what is really worrying right now, according to a top U.N. official and NGOs that we've spoken to is this -- these new patterns that are emerging. Smugglers and traffickers are trying to get around these pushback tactics, trying to get around these restrictions and policies that have been put in place by European countries. So you've got new routes. Deadlier, more dangerous, longer journeys going -- leaving from eastern Libya. A 600 percent increase in boats leaving eastern Libya so far this year. And you've also got accusations against Greece and other coastal countries that not only are they pushing these boats back towards Libya and into international waters, that they are also facilitating the movement of these boats towards Italy, providing them with food, water and fuel and putting that burden on Italy alone. And the concern right now, of course, is that we are going to be seeing more and more of these tragic and catastrophic incidents.",

Well, former U.S. President Barack Obama noted that more attention is being paid to the Titanic submersible than the migrant boat tragedy. He spoke exclusively with CNN's Christiane Amanpour while in Greece. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: But right now, we have 24-hour coverage. And I understand it of this submarine, the submersible that tragically is, right now, lost at the bottom of the sea. At the same time, right here in -- just off the coast of Greece, we had 700 people dead, 700 migrants who were apparently being smuggled into here, and, yes, we -- it's made news, but it's not dominating in the same way. And in some ways, it's indicative of the degree to which people's life chances have grown so disparately. It's very hard to sustain a democracy when you have such massive concentrations of wealth.

They are angry becausethey say the company is allowing some stores to restrict declarations that celebrate the LGBTQ community during Pride Month. The strikes come from about 150 Starbucks stores that are unionized. But Starbucks says it doesn't know of any stores that have taken down Pride decorations and points out that it has always been a strong supporter of LGBTQ rights. Starbucks says it leaves decorating decisions up to local managers. Well, the Starbucks strike is the latest development in a difficult tap dance many U.S. companies are facing. On the one hand, they want to support the LGBTQ community. But on the other, they face a backlash from some conservatives who say Pride displays are offensive. Well, let's bring in CNN's Richard Quest to talk a little bit more about this because Richard, it does feel that companies can't win here. Are we reaching the point where some American companies are going to cater to liberals and other are for conservatives only? RICHARD QUEST, BUSINESS EDITOR-AT-LARGE: It's a really good point and you put it elegantly. What does one do? You want to remain true to your values and that is what the experts will tell you you need to do. But at the same time, you risk offending. The problem is it's become polarized. So whilst in -- for example in the Bud Light example, where Bud Light was with -- sponsored a transgender person to do various Instagram posts, and then there was the most massive backlash from conservatives in America that really cost Bud Light quite dear in the market. And then you've got the Disney Don't -- opposition to the Don't Say Gay law in Florida. Now, what do you do? In the old days, of course, it was all a bit of tolerance, and everybody sort of met in the middle. However, that's now gone out the window. With such extremism, arguably on both sides, you're now getting to the point that if you are not with me, you are against me, and if you are against me, therefore every battle, commercial, every bit of blockade, the boycott you can use is valid.",
