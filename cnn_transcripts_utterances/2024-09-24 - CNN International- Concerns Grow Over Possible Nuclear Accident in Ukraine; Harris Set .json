On the right, destruction of a residential building in the suburbs of Beirut in Lebanon after an Israeli air strike earlier today. It's 09:00 a.m. in New York, it is 04:00 p.m. in Beirut, and it's 05:00 p.m. here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Becky Anderson. You're watching \"Connect the World\". Mr. Biden due to speak shortly. This is his final appearance on that stage as U.S. President, coming against the backdrop of a world at war, and not just in the Middle East, where Israel carried out a second wave of strikes against Hezbollah today and the wider conflict Mr. Biden was hoping to prevent appears to be coming to fruition. But also, in Ukraine and Sudan, a year after some of the same leaders met in the very same room in New York, in the world's hot spots, fighting is relentless. Civilians are dying, and the prospect of peace, or at least a ceasefire, across any one of these files, it seems, is still elusive. We will be following this for you as we wait Mr. Biden's remarks. First CNN's Ben Wedeman is in Beirut, where another Israeli strike targeted the southern suburbs Ben, as we get ready to hear from Joe Biden set the stage, if you will, on how things are quickly deteriorating in Lebanon. What's the latest?",

The top two stories seem to have been completely demolished. At this point there's a lot of speculation who about who the target might have been. So, we don't really know at this point, but we do know there are fatalities and there are injuries. On social media, we're seeing a picture of a car in front of that building with the limbs of a dismembered body draped on that car. That's the second strike on the southern suburbs in the last 24 hours. Yesterday, the Israelis struck a building claiming to have been targeting Ali Karaki, who is the Commander of the Southern Forces of Hezbollah. But Hezbollah came out with a statement shortly afterwards, saying that he was alive and well. The broader picture continued. Israeli air strikes on the south and the Beka Valley, not quite as intense as yesterday. Yesterday, since the strikes began according to the Ministry of Health here, the death toll is 558 among them, 50 children and 94 women, with more than 1800 injured. Now, we just got a statement from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, saying that among the dead are two employees of UNHCR. Now, one Lebanese nongovernmental organization is saying that as many as 100,000 people have fled to the south. This afternoon, we were at a center for -- to take in some of those who have come from the south. They were telling us that it took as many as 14 hours to get to Beirut on those jam- packed high, jam-packed highway to the Lebanese capital. They told us what they witnessed was intense bombing, many buildings destroyed, they said, along the way. They say, saw many dead and injured. The situation clearly is going from bad to worse, and the feeling is that the government, until now, is able to cope. We were at one hospital where we saw one injured coming in from the south. They too had spent hours and hours on the road trying to get out of that area to the relative safety of Beirut, Becky.",

But let's look at what's going on the ground, Hezbollah still continues to fire back at Israel. Some of the rockets reached inside the country. They still have the ability to do that. Obviously, Israel, with its superior U.S. supplied weaponry and aircraft, have an upper hand, but Hezbollah is showing no signs of giving up, no hints that some-how it's going to change its course. And what's important to note is that when it puts out its notices about their individual attacks on Israel, it used to be that they the preamble was that it was in solidarity with the people in Gaza, in support of Hamas. Now the phrase is that in defense of the people of Lebanon and -- of the country of Lebanon. So, they continue, basically to carry on as they did before. It appears that their focus is trying to strike deeper into Israel, as opposed to what we've seen by and large in the 11 months since October 7 -- October 8th, when Hezbollah started firing, they were focusing basically on military positions on the border with Israel. Now they're going deeper in trying, obviously, to inflict more pain and restore the deterrence that existed by more or less for the last 11 months Becky.",

On Israel remember, right before October 7th, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan had just published an essay in foreign affairs where in print, and I've saved it in print he calls the Middle East quiet. So, it is obvious that the Biden Administration had taken its eye off of what was happening in the Middle East, or didn't understand the undercurrents of frustration among the Palestinian people that helped fuel Hamas' terror plot for October 7th. So, I guess they tried really hard, but they've had shuttle diplomacy with the Head of the CIA and the State Department going to the Middle East and trying to come up with ceasefire solutions. But here we are approaching another October 7th with all but an Israeli ground incursion into Lebanon underway. And Gaza much of it flattened with civilians displaced, starvation in many quarters, a little clean water. It's not a great picture, no matter how President Biden tries to cast it.",

So, this talk took me to Kursk, because we always need to see and judge with our own eyes. And, of course, like you were quoting me, this is a nuclear power plant which has certain technical characteristics that make them -- I mean, you can walk over the core of the reactor, as I was doing myself. So, and you have a normal roof. So, if there is an impact, even with a small drone with some with a kilogram or two of conventional explosives, you could have a very serious situation. I have been discussing this with the Russians. I went to Kyiv. You may remember just a few days ago. I discussed this with President Zelenskyy as well. So, fact that we have not deployed a permanent group of people there is because the situation is completely different for Zaporizhzhia. Here you have a normally operating Russian power plant in the control of the Russian Federation, which is not far from a combat zone. So, the political territorial integrity situation is different. But -- what I have discussed with my Russian counterparts, is that, of course, in case something happened, we will be deploying people immediately.

And I think tank fire across the border is important to note because it means its relatively short range, and that's a mobile piece of equipment there that potentially, and the IDF is not saying this, but it would certainly be part of the equipment you would expect the IDF to use if they were to put troops across the border, because they say their aim is to get Hezbollah to push back from Israel's northern border, and that's where things stand. And as far as the targeted assassinations, this definitely appears to be a track that Israel is committed to. They failed in a targeted assassination to hit the apparent intended target yesterday. Today, we don't know who the target is. Undoubtedly, we'll find out more, but as you reported that six people dead there in that building and 15 wounded, and one would expect that the target was either an individual or only a couple of individuals, Becky.",

Alex, Israel hasdescribed this as a strategy of escalation to de-escalate. Our teams have heard from the State Department on that strategy, escalation to de-escalate, with one senior official telling CNN quote, I can't recall, at least in recent memory, a period in which an escalation or intensification led to a fundamental de-escalation and led to profound stabilization of the situation. What's the level of concern from this current U.S. Administration as Joe Biden gets set to make his speech there in New York, is his closing speech, as it were with six weeks ago for this election.

You might have heard Vice President Kamala Harris in her debate with Former President Trump, extolling that there are no U.S. troops at war right now. She said it in a way that has been lambasted in military circles. But what she meant is the U.S. isn't in a declared war right now. And also, they'll be talking to some extent about the shuttle diplomacy that they are taking part in right now to try to keep total war from breaking out in the Middle East, and talking about the success they did have in working together with Egypt and Qatar to broker that first ceasefire, which allowed many hostages to go home.",
