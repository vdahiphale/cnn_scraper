      "sentences": "Welcome to \"The Whole Story.\" I'm Anderson Cooper in Tel Aviv. The October 7th attack by Hamas which the U.S. labels a terrorist organization left at least 1,400 people dead. More than 200 people are being held hostage according to Israeli officials, and many more people are still unaccounted for.In response, Israel began a bombing campaign in Gaza. According to the Hamas controlled health ministry, more than 4,000 people have died there so far. The story of Hamas is complex. Its roots date back to the formation of Israel in 1948. It has many factions, including the so-called military wing which perpetrated the terror attack. Over the next hour, CNN's Sara Sidner brings us the whole story on Hamas from how they were formed, what their ideology is, and how they have evolved over the decades. We want to warn you some of the images you'll see in this hour may be disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Out of all the different Palestinian factions that exist, Hamas is the only party that has an organized military and a very well-resourced military force. So, what that means is that for many Palestinians, Hamas is the only party that can actually defend Palestinian civilians against Israeli aggression. LAILA EL-HADDAD, PALESTINIAN JOURNALIST AND SOCIAL ACTIVIST: That's the reality. That is how many Palestinians view and consider them, a line of defense. SIDNER (voiceover): Since 2007, Hamas has governed the Gaza Strip, a 25-mile-long, seven-mile-wide stretch of land with more than 2 million people largely cut off from the world by an Israeli blockade. An area humanitarian rights groups have called an open-air prison. But the rise of Hamas and what led up to its massacre of more than a thousand men, women, and child in Israel is a story that begins long before Hamas ever existed.",
