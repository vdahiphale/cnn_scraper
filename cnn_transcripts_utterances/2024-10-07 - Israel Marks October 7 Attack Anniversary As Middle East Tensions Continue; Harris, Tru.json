Let's have a look at live pictures now of the Nova music festival site that's coming to us live. You see the people there marking the occasion. Survivors and families of the victims all gathered there.One year ago today, Hamas militants killed 347 people at that spot. Earlier, the final music track of the festival was replayed before a minute of silence. And in the hours ahead, other commemorations will be held across Israel for the attack victims ahead of the one year anniversary, images of the hostages taken by Hamas were projected onto the walls of Jerusalem's old city. As of today, the Israeli prime minister's officer says that there are 101 hostages in Gaza. That includes 35 believed to have died there. CNN's Nic Robertson is following developments, joins me now from the Nova festival site in southern Israel. Nic, paint us a picture of how this anniversary is being marked there in terms of events, but also so in terms of the sheer emotion that you're no doubt seeing.",

You probably hear some of the artillery being fired in the background there. There are Apache gunships overhead.The government's done a lot to make the site safe.

Will it bring the hostages being brought home to get a sense of closure for all the families who lost loved ones as well? Because I think they share that grief, the grief that hostage families experience. It is shared by those who lost loved ones.And, you know, they can come back here and visit after a year. But it, and although several people have said to me they've come back because they hoped it would bring closure, when you ask, is it bringing closure? The answer is that it isn't one young man I spoke to, 26 years old, told me he'd been here at the festival that night, had managed to survive, had been back a number of times here. But even for him, it doesn't really change his ability to cope with it. He was literally trembling when we spoke about it. You could see his lips were trembling, his arms were trembling. Just bringing those moments a year ago going from darkness because that's what really brought home to me, being here at that same time, 6:29 in the morning, it was dark. And that's when the confusion happened. That's when the sirens went off. That's when the missiles came in. And for people here to have a sense of what was going on in what would have been darkness, like the verge of sunrise. You can begin to understand how bad the confusion and the terror and the horror must have been, particularly when people realized these were guys on trucks with automatic weapons who were driving in among them and shooting them. I talked to one lady. I came back here with her a month after October 7, and she showed me the hedge line that she hid in the trees that she hid in. And she said, I lay there and I could see, you know, my friends begging for their lives while they were shot. They begged for mercy, and they didn't get mercy. They were killed. So, anyone who has a connection with this side, who comes here, I think, gets wrapped up in those emotions. And that's what we're seeing here today.",

But it's also been that the most deadly and devastating impact in Gaza, as you say, well over 40,000 killed, 41,800 according to the Ministry of Health figures. And they say that around almost 17,000 of those, our children, many women as well.So it really has been a devastating year for the civilians of Gaza. They have been evacuated from different areas as the Israeli military has been operating in different areas. They say to eliminate Hamas, also accusing Hamas of hiding among the civilian population, which Hamas denies. But for civilians on the ground, they have been moved countless times. Food, shelter, water is in very scant supply. Humanitarian aid groups talk about the devastation in Gaza and just how difficult it is to be able to get enough supplies into the enclave to try and make a difference on the ground. And you did mention there, Michael, it's interesting that the IDF says it is now about to carry out a ground operation in Jabalya. Now, this is an area in northern Gaza which was really one of the first areas that the Israeli military was operating in just after October 7, home to the biggest refugee camp in Gaza. And it's an area where the Israeli military has operated a number of times. And they have said that they have cleared Hamas from that area, but they now say that they believe that Hamas is regrouping. It is rebuilding within Jabalya itself. And this is something we have seen across the Gaza Strip as the Israeli military says it has cleared an area and moves onto another area. Then they say that Hamas is able to regroup. So Israel's declaration, the Israeli prime minister's declaration that he would destroy Hamas is clearly not happening at this point. We heard from the United States and President Biden saying he doesn't believe that Hamas would be able to carry out anything like an October 7 attack. It has been degraded militarily and politically up until this point. But a year on, we're still seeing the Israeli military going into areas that they said they had cleared months ago.

And villages in southern Lebanon telling civilians to move away from those areas as Hezbollah, they say, is operating in those areas. There's some more than 120 villages at this point which have the evacuation orders. So we're seeing great displacement within Lebanon itself. We have also seen that Hezbollah is still firing rockets. The IDF saying that there were more than 100 rockets that had been fired on Sunday. And it appears for the first time they actually hit the city of Haifa. The Hezbollah saying that they were trying to target the Carmel military base. And we understand that at least five people were injured in that particular rocket attack. Now this is an area, Haifa, that was targeted frequently back in 2006 during that war with Israel.

They say, as of this point, over 10,000 incidents that they've recorded since October 7. Let's take a look at the numbers. They say at least 8,015 incidents involve verbal or written harassment. There were at least 1,840 incidents of vandalism and at least 150 incidents of physical assault. Now the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League was on CNN Sunday with our colleague Dana Bash. He spoke about this very dire milestone. JONATHAN GREENBLATT, CEO, ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE: ADL has been around for over 110 years and we've never seen data like this before. Think about it. Like we are honoring, commemorating the solemn anniversary of the murder of 1,200 people, simply because they were Jewish. Like they were slaughtered, they were tortured, they were killed, they were kidnapped. And yet here in the United States, that triggered a tsunami of anti- Jewish hate.",
