Almost all of the continental U.S. could see temperatures above 90 degrees Fahrenheit or 32 degrees Celsius over the next few days.More than 100 million people are under excessive heat watches, warnings and advisories just in the U.S., with the worst heat this weekend expected in the mid-Atlantic states. Washington, D.C., could reach triple-digits for the first time since 2016. In southeastern Europe, temperatures are at least five degrees above average. In Spain, residents and tourists sought shady areas to get out of the midday sun. The heat wave there is expected to continue through the weekend. In Saudi Arabia, temperatures are forecast to be in the mid 40s Celsius. That's over 110 degrees Fahrenheit. And although parts of the country have cooled a bit, in Mecca, more than 1,000 people taking part in the Hajj pilgrimage are feared dead, killed by the heat. Large numbers of unregistered pilgrims are still unaccounted for in Saudi Arabia and Egypt, where many of the dead are believed to have come from. They've yet to release official figures. More now from CNN's Scott McLean. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The stoning of the devil, one of the key rituals of the Hajj pilgrimage. It's a symbolic rejection of evil. But with temperatures unusually high, even for this time of year, the temptation here, a much simpler one. Water only goes so far when it's 120 degrees Fahrenheit. Azza Hamid Brahim found out the hard way. Like many, she gave up on the way there. AZZA HAMID BRAHIM, EGYPTIAN PILGRIM (through translator): We thought we were about to die. We didn't even have the strength to reach the steels due to the extreme heat. MCLEAN (voice-over): The soaring temperatures making this year's pilgrimage exceptionally deadly. Videos shared on social media showed bodies on the sides of roads, their faces covered. In some cases, they looked simply abandoned.",

So obviously we're seeing temperatures rise but is the issue here that our cities like Madrid, New York, Mecca are just not built to cope with temperatures this high? DR. STEFFEN LEHMANN, ARCHITECTURE AND URBANISM, UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA: Yes, very good. We can talk about it's important topic. Most cities are inadequately prepared or not prepared at all. And I'm talking to you here from Las Vegas, one of the fastest warming cities in the U.S. And we can feel it at the moment today. We had 108 Fahrenheit; what's that, 42 Celsius. And we expect this heat, as your colleague said, to hang on with the pressure though. And so the American Southwest right now is a baking oven. And we are now regretting having built our cities maybe not the way we should have, focusing on reintegrating greenery, bringing nature back, planting trees. And also think of urban vegetation in all the different forms, which is by far the most cost effective. If we put more and more air conditioning into the buildings, it's creating, of course, other challenges. It's increasing CO2 emissions, it creates peak electricity needs, all kinds of challenges as a result. So we have to start building cities in the way that they do not become baking ovens, what's called the urban heat island effect, very dangerous. And we see mortality rate going up four times, where it's usually. And people simply very simply dehydrate. We see this also here in Las Vegas on the Strip, Nick, where we have tourists collapsing, that come completely unprepared. They do not understand that this heat is dangerous. They are dressed maybe in black with a tiny bottle of water and they go off from casino to casino and at some just collapse. So -- also what's very important is to understand the link with air pollution. It's not just the heat; it's also more and more people having asthma, breathing problems. It is that hot, stagnant air, the silent, invisible killer, where we have a high concentration of pollutants in the air, ultrafine particles. And they make it very difficult for people to breathe. So it's an issue -- yes.",

      "sentences": "A massive Supreme Court ruling on the Second Amendment 8-1, the justices finding that the Second Amendment, like many other rights, does have limits.Chief justice John Roberts, who authored the majority opinion, said they, quote, \"had no trouble\" coming to this conclusion. And he really focused a lot on tradition and the history of the United States, saying, quote, \"Our tradition of firearm regulation allows the government to disarm individuals who present a credible threat to the physical safety of others.\" And a good portion of his opinion is spent analyzing the historical context of firearm regulation. And that is significant because, two years ago, the Supreme Court really expanded the definition of the Second Amendment and left the door open for a lot of additional challenges like this. And here, the chief justice, he acknowledged that that has caused some confusion among the lower courts about exactly what they meant. He writes, \"Some courts have misunderstood the methodology of our recent Second Amendment cases.\" Now he says, they-- \"The reach of the Second Amendment is not limited only to those arms that were in existence at the founding,\" and then goes on to say that, of course, that any regulations or restrictions on gun ownership, you don't necessarily need to find a twin regulation from the beginning or the founding of this country. But it has to be something that is relevant and similar. This is significant because, during oral arguments in this case, at least one justice noted that domestic violence, which is what is at the core of this case, has not been treated the same way it is now throughout the history of the United States. Now there was of course one dissent here, Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for his dissent, \"Yet in the interest of ensuring that government can regulate one subset of society, today's decision puts at risk the Second Amendment rights of many more. \"I respectfully dissent.\" Now looking forward, it is expected at the Supreme Court will see other challenges related to the Second Amendment, because many justices, even though they all joined the majority, wrote their own concurrences, putting their own spin on exactly what it is that the majority opinion means. And that, of course, will open the door for other challenges, looking to really clarify exactly how far the Second Amendment extends. They can look through this opinion, try to find a concurrence that matches their argument and try to bring their case back before the high court -- Paula Reid, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And it allows kids to get stuff that is specifically like responsive to their interests. And so for the kids with like body image problems, then it will stop it perhaps from curating body image -- images that might exacerbate that condition.

We do all of these things to teach kids to be safe in the physical world. We've spent a lot of time over the last quarter century now, almost, teaching kids, watch out for the people online. You think it's another teenager but it could be a predator. So we teach kids that we talk to them a lot about it.
