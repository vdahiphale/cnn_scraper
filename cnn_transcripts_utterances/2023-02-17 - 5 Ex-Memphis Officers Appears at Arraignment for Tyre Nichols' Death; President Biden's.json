But as we move forward here, what's remarkable, and Shimon brought this up again, the D.A. of course talking to CNN about it.

It's important to uncover that truth.From a prosecutorial strategy standpoint, of course, the more allegations they find that could be charged, the more leverage they have on getting these officers one or more to plead guilty.

I don't want to give the impression that this happens in every police encounter. There are hundreds of them every day that end peacefully. But there clearly is still an issue here. And I wonder, are departments training -- are they changing their training? Are they changing their approach to make these kinds of deadly encounters less likely? ED DAVIS, FORMER BOSTON POLICE COMMISSIONER: Well, it's a great question, Jim. And after talking to my colleagues across the country, I know that this is the single most important thing that they are struggling with right now. Training is a big part of it. A bigger part of it is the culture of the organization. So everybody is reflecting on what they are doing, and how they are doing it. But, you know, the advent of cameras has brought a lot more accountability. We have to be happy with the fact that these officers were charged so quickly and are being held accountable.

And that's central to proving the intent, what they were doing wrong, and that's critical for the jury to understand. It's not just an isolated incident, and that's what the prosecution's point is going to be. So there'll be quite a clash here.",

She sat there. She said it was important for her to be there because she wanted them to see her face. You saw the officers walk in. They said absolutely nothing, some of them wearing face masks, and then when they walked out, we tried to ask them questions, and obviously they didn't say anything. But, yes, everything that was expected. And now this is going to be a long drawn-out process as the attorneys fight over discovery and documents, and then also the big question I think that everyone needs to keep in mind is whether or not these attorneys are going to ask to have these cases severed so that some of these officers get charged separately because of, you know, how much involvement certain officers have versus other, and you can see that sort of start to play out here over the coming months.",
