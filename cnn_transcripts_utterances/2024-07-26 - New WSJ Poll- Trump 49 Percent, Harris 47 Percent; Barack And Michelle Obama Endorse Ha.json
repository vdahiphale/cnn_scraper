Also, our Gary Tuchman with voters in a Michigan county, the Democrats and Republicans have split 50-50 over the last 20 presidential elections. But the vice president's rise to the top of the ticket changes for them and how they plan to vote. Plus, breaking news in the key question was Donald Trump hit by a bullet or not during the attempt on his life? The FBI has just weighed in. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. For Vice President Harris, it has been the kind of week that every new candidate wishes for, but few ever get. Tonight, there's new polling that reflects it. One is from \"The Wall Street Journal.\" The vice president is trailing Donald Trump by two points nationally within the margin of error, not in the lead, but six points better than President Biden did in the last \"Journal\" poll. Last night, a \"The \"New York Times\" poll showed similar gains. Also, tonight from Fox, the first new polling in key battleground states since the Harris-Biden changeup, it shows no clear leader in head-to-head matchups in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, and the vice president is up by six in Minnesota. In Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin where comparable polling is available, her numbers are roughly the same as President Biden's were. The vice president's day began with the final crucial piece of Democratic Party support falling into place. Former President Michelle Obama's endorsement delivered by phone captured in a video released by the campaign. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They also tried to paint her as the mastermind behind all of Biden's policies, particularly the policies that are less popular, like policies on immigration, like policies on inflation and crime.

Kamala Harris is energetic. She's passionate. She has that edge. You know, this sense that she is a prosecutor, somebody who is skilled at calling out people who manipulate the truth.

I think she can be very, very clear that she has spent her life in taking -- being tough on crime, but also the she's now had four years in the Biden White House where she supported Biden budgets that increased funding for police. So, there is absolutely runway for her to establish herself where she wants to be on these issues, but they do need to make decisions.

And the whole childless cat lady thing, and I'm sorry, Brian, but this has nothing to do with substance and nothing to do with good ideas. It has everything to do with JD Vance looking down on families that in his eyes aren't traditional. He is looking down on families that are blended. He is looking down on families that include stepchildren. He is looking down on Americans who choose to or cannot have children. He is alienating millions and millions of Americans and at the heart of this, Anderson, let's be very clear about why he's saying this. He is saying this because he is absolutely against reproductive freedom. This has everything to do with his hatred of women having the ability and the right to make decisions about their own bodies. And guess what? Some of those decisions might be that they don't want to have children. Some of those decisions might be that it's not the right time to have children if they get pregnant.

Her vision of being tough on crime was prosecuting low offense drug offenders people of color. But when she had a chance to prosecute a cop killer and give him the death penalty, she chose against it. When she had a chance to prosecute a murderer, an illegal alien, MS-13 person, who murdered three people in the streets of San Francisco, she refused to do the death penalty against the wishes of the family.

They're not actually families if they're not defined exactly the way we define them.I mean, what Vance and Trump are doing is reaching into people's day- to-day lives and offering a vision that's about controlling the way they live. So, I think if the Republicans think that moving this race to a contest, a question, a framework of who is more extreme, I think that is a fight that Republicans are going to lose. On this specific issue of crime, we sort of talked about this a little bit a few minutes ago, but I think Vice President Harris has a record to run on, as you noted, Anderson in 2019 in the primary. She was actually attacked from the left for being a cop. So you know, she has a record of being tough on crime that she can run on. She has her record in the Biden administration of supporting more funding for police, of rejecting out of hand the notion that we need to defund the police.

How do you actually keep communities safer?And in fact, during that whole debate, you had a lot of law enforcement officers themselves saying that they did not want to show up at calls and feel like they had to play the role of the social services. And so, what she ended up doing with at the side of Joe Biden during the Biden-Harris administration, is they did both. They increased budgets for law enforcement and they also increased budgets for social services to be able to make it all about how do you actually keep communities safe? And I do think it is hugely hypocritical for Republicans to then go after her for being anti-law enforcement when you had Donald Trump himself siding with the insurrectionists, who actually caused the loss of life of law enforcement officers and Republicans don't seem to care about that.",

But you don't, you haven't, Donald Trump has been at the forefront of ensuring that this is simply a political game for Republicans.We know that voters don't like that. They don't like to feel like their elected officials are not working in good faith to try to solve problems. And I think, by pulling that bill down, Trump really put on display the fact that he views this as nothing more than political gamesmanship. And that is really a turnoff particularly to moderate voters, to Independent voters. people who are not hyper-partisan on either side and really dug in or invested. But the people who are ultimately going to help decide the outcome of this election, they find that kind of political gamesmanship really off-putting. So, I think that is actually really powerful argument for the Democrats. I think for her, on this question of being in charge of the border, first of all, I think it's important to note that wasn't the role she was given. She was given actually the same portfolio that Vice President Biden had when he was vice president, which was dealing with the root causes of immigration in the Northern Triangle as a foreign policy-oriented portfolio that she was given, important work, but not her responsibility to oversee the entire border. So, I think that is an important clarification here. But writ large, I think the argument for Democrats is about putting this back on the Republicans, while also noting, by the way, that illegal border crossings have dropped over the course of this last year. So they have facts, Democrats have facts on their side here too, as they're making this argument.",
