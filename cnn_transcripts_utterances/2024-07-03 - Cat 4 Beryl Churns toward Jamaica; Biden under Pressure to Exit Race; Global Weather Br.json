So currently we have 780 operational shelters ready for citizens to deal with the critical issues. But we have spent significant time ensuring that we build our infrastructure. Jamaica, as a part of its climate change management, was the first nation to launch what we call a systemic risk assessment, which was designed by the University of Oxford. What that did is we took thousands of points of infrastructure and an AI system, where we're able to calculate climate for our infrastructure. So our investment program has been in line with climate risk. So the rules that we're doing moving further inlands, expansion endurance. We are in the middle of about $800 million usd of expansion of our water systems over the next three years. We've done aboat $500 million over the last six or seven years or so. So we're working on our water systems, we're working on our interests, our hard infrastructure. We obviously embrace nature-based solutions.

To be frank, Becky, the pledges made don't equal the issues that the developing world face. They simply don't equal the issues that Jamaica faces. I mean, ultimately, our adaptation for water alone will be some $5 billion (ph) usd. Those sorts of pledges and access to that scale of finance from a climate change perspective is simply not there. So ultimately we know we have a challenging time ahead. It's why we continue to, under leadership of the prime minister, under bonus (ph) to ensure that we focus on managing our fiscal affairs in a particular way so that we are able to extract the sort of foreign direct investment that comes in in the form of PPPs.

What I think beyond that, a storm of this size and scale coming at this time of the year, it is driving it home to Jamaicans both here and abroad -- we have a large diaspora -- that this issue is not going away, that it's going to continue to leave us in a precarious position and that we have a lot of work to do. So I don't believe that there's anyone in Jamaica who denies the impacts of climate change. The question for us, as Jamaicans, as citizens of a small island, developing state just like our brothers and sisters in the eastern Caribbean, is, really, how are we going to get the developed world to meet their mitigation targets? How are we going to get them to meet their financing targets and commitments for adaptation? Because ultimately it's not a problem of our own making. This is a problem that the developed world would have created but we are the ones on the front line of the crisis with the least ability to adapt and the least ability to ensure that we maintain our way of life and we maintain our country and give our citizens the chance to enjoy developed status as well. Because ultimately the fragility brought about by climate change is real. It's why Jamaica has taken steps to ensure that it will start its own climate attributions so that we can state clearly and scientifically what the negative economic impact has been for our problem, not of our making. We honor our mitigation obligations, even though we're energy -- a low energy user. But we are calling on the developed world to honor their promises because, when you look at what's before us, Hurricane Beryl a few degrees to the north, is a vast disaster, a vastly different disaster than we're currently facing.",

He's not afraid to speak what he sees as the truth of the party. And he's really voicing what we've been hearing for days and, in fact, longer than that. Well before the debate, that what is wrong with this campaign inside the Democratic Party, why is President Biden sort of losing a bit to former president Donald Trump, at least in the polls? So Congressman Doggett, there, he represents LBJ's old district, Lyndon Baines Johnson, of course, Austin, Texas. And LBJ stepped aside. So that is sort of the historic sweep of this. But today, the bottom line is, patience is wearing thin among many Democratic leaders there. You heard former speaker, Nancy Pelosi, asking bluntly, \"Is this an episode or a condition?\" And these are people who want the best for the party and for President Biden. So never mind the critics who don't much like the Democratic administration. These are people trying to show President Biden the way. The question is, will he sort of follow their lead? If there is enough evidence that he's caused enough damage to the Democratic ticket overall, that they could lose the House and lose the Senate, that, his allies believe, is something that will be pretty tough medicine that he could accept. But again, the ball is in his court. He has not made that decision yet. But a couple of interesting things we're watching today. He's having lunch with Vice President Kamala Harris in just a couple hours' time at the White House. And then this evening, most Democratic governors are flying to Washington to also have a meeting with him. So, Becky, it seems like it's heading in a direction.

It soaks up all that energy, as there's underwater heat waves that are happening, as well, as those that we experience on land. But turning that energy into just bigger, wetter, more intense storms.

And the Conservatives have been slipping and slipping in the polls. But you sort of -- there's an inevitability about what you see in the polls. But the newspapers do speak for themselves. And this clearly is eff you (ph). And there are other papers; I think the -- some of the tabloids now are coming out. \"The Mirror\" is already out in support for -- of Keir Starmer and the Labour Party. So you're beginning to see more and more of this. And this is what the newspapers do in the U.K. and other countries around the world ahead of elections. They come out and side for one or another. But it's very clear when, when people wake up tomorrow morning, Thursday morning here, and they had the opportunity to go to the polls, they'll be reminded in whatever paper they're reading, if they're reading a paper, which way the paper thinks that they should vote. And that has an impact. Remember, the politicians -- and we just heard it from Keir Starmer there -- are out after the last few hundred votes, even if he has a massive margin in the polls and even if that predicts a landslide scale victory. It's not there until it's there. He has not taken it for granted. So of course, the papers support, that's big, that's good. That's good for him.",
