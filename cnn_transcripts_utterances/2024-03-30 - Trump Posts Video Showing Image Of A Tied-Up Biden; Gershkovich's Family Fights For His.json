It says quote, \"This image from Donald Trump is the type of crap you post when you're calling for a quote, 'bloodbath', or when you tell the Proud Boys to quote 'stand back and standby'. Trump is regularly inciting political violence, and it's time people take him seriously. Just ask the Capitol police officers who were attacked protecting our democracy on January 6.\" We also asked the U.S. Secret Service about this and they said they do not confirm or comment on matters of quote, \"protective intelligence\". Now, of course, this comes against the backdrop of the Biden campaign also trying to shore up support among Nikki Haley voters. Those voters who may be turned off by this type of rhetoric or actions by the former president. Now, they did -- the Biden campaign released a 30-second ad in battleground states specifically appealing to those supporters of Nikki Haley, including clips of the former president saying that the Republican candidate or the former Republican candidate was a very angry person and the one, and the moments that Trump said that he didn't need Haley voters.

Joining me, we have CNN contributor, podcast host and journalist for \"The New York Times\" Lulu Garcia Navarro and CNN political commentator and Republican strategist Shermichael Singleton. Great to see both of you. Ok. I just want to start Lulu with you because obviously it's no longer an academic exercise, maybe at one time it was where we could say, oh I wonder if violent imagery and violent rhetoric leads to real-world violence. It does. We have seen a straight line. I mean, look no further than the 2019 hideous Walmart mass shooting where the shooter had a manifesto echoing then-President Trump's words. Look no further than January 6, where his supporters showed up in combat gear and, you know, battle fatigues saying they were ready for battle. And so what now? I mean what -- now that we know that, where are we with this what happens now that we see yet another one of these violent images? LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: I think we are at a place where the degradation of political discourse in this country is clearly a bright straight line to political violence. And we have seen political violence as you rightly note in these elections. And even though the Trump's (INAUDIBLE) team tries to disavow that connection, they always try to do this dance by saying, oh, he was just showing a picture of what was on the highway. He didn't mean it. It was about cars, it was about the auto industry. I think it is very fair to show that this actually isn't just rhetoric. This rhetoric actually has real life consequences. And I think, you know, there is a real concern as we go into what is going to be a very contentious election season. That we're going to see more and more evidence that this can lead to actual action.",

I just don't think that they're willing to say anything about it, particularly in a heightened political climate, where many of them are more focused on the prize. The prize being electoral success, the prize being trying to keep the house, for example, trying to win back control of the senate and ultimately trying to win the White House.Now, morally and ethically does that make it ok? I think the three of us would say absolutely not. And I think the vast majority of the American people would say absolutely not. Politics is a very contentious process if you will. We're used to people going back and forth with each other trying to contest various ideas. Iron sharpens iron, but we've always believed Alisyn in the past that that just stopped short of becoming physically violent with one another. And so I would certainly encourage the former president and encourage many of my Republican friends, to let's debate ideas but stop short of causing potential violence.",

They, they weren't saying -- his campaign wasn't saying, oh, it's just on the back of a truck. It was different what they were saying. Basically they said, oh, well, the Democrats have wished horrible things on the Trump family. They didn't give any examples, so it's very hard to know what they're referring to or compare, but that tells you that they don't like it. In other words, they were saying its awful, right. And then they're doing it. So I just found their logic to be a little circular. GARCIA-NAVARRO: I don't think that there is logic in this. I don't think that this is really -- I mean the real question here, Alisyn, is who are they speaking to when they put this out, right? Who are they trying to draw in by this? What are they trying to say? Who are they trying to activate? I mean those are the questions that I have when I see this imagery go out because clearly they are not speaking to people who they're trying to bring into the campaign. This is, as you again rightly point out, going to be a very close election. They're going to have to bring in other voters that might not be the sort of meat and potatoes of the Trump MAGA base. And so who are they trying to (AUDIO GAP). We're already hearing from some of the people surrounding Trump. Oh, this election might be stolen if Trump doesn't do well. A lot of the rhetoric that we saw in 2020 (INAUDIBLE). [17:09:49] GARCIA-NAVARRO: And this is what concerns me when you see this kind of imagery. Who are they speaking to you?

I think many of the individuals who you may attempt to appease or appeal to what that rhetoric are already solidly in the former president's corner. Alisyn, they're not going to move. They're enthusiastic about voting for Donald Trump and they're enthusiastic about being a part of the process to help him get elected. To Lulu's point. The question becomes, when you look at some of those battleground states that were very, very close in 2020 that really made the difference where the former president lost by slim margins, if I'm in that war room, I'm trying to figure out looking at those different precincts, looking at those counties -- who are the voters that I can turn out, who are the voters who I can shift back over to my principal's side.

And I'm asked that question oftentimes and even when I speak with folks who are close to the former president or who still work for him, my strategic advice always is guys, you have those voters. You have to reach out to some of those moderate Republican. You have to reach out to some of those folks in the middle who are principally concerned with the economy, immigration, foreign affairs. And some of them will look at what Trump was saying, you know, he's somewhat strong on some of these issues, but I don't like the host of other things that come with him. You've got to suppress those things and speak to the things that really matter to most people. (CROSSTALK) CAMEROTA: Yes. Lulu, he's also using threatening language against the judge -- quick, go ahead. Sorry. There's a delay which makes it hard, but I want to hear your reaction to that Lulu. Go ahead GARCIA-NAVARRO: No, I just want to say that we've heard so many times about, you know, Trump eventually going to pivot to the middle and try to reach out to those voters, maybe the disaffected Nikki Haley voters or other people who might be conflicted and might want to vote for him if he would only just use different language or appeal to them in different ways. And I think we know who we're dealing with at this point. And I think actually that is what concerns many people because we know who we're dealing with at this point seen the results of this rhetoric. And so if, if Donald Trump can't contain himself and is still doing this, then again, I ask the question, why? What is he actually trying to achieve? Because we again, have seen the results of it.",

It's not wise in my opinion to try to litigate this in the public circle. Again, to Lulu's point, when you beg that question, who are you appealing with this rhetoric? Whose minds are you changing?If you really are to win this election in November those voters that you're going to need. In Georgia, a state he lost by less than 12,000 votes or in Arizona or in Nevada or Wisconsin or Pennsylvania Alisyn. Those voters are not compelled to vote for the former president when they hear that type of very ugly and divisive languages. So again, as a strategist, my thought process is you're going about this wrong. And if you want to win, this is not going to help. In fact, I would argue it's going to more than likely lead to you not winning. The poll numbers showcase that he's leading, but I guarantee you Alisyn, if you continue on this path, you're going to see those numbers shift pretty quickly as we get closer to November.",
