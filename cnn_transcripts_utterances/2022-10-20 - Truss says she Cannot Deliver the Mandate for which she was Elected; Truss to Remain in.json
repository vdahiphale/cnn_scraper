After just six weeks in office, she gave this short statement outside Downing Street. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LIZ TRUSS, U.K. PRIME MINISTER: I recognize though, given this situation, I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party. I have therefore spoken to His Majesty the King to notify him that I am resigning as Leader of the Conservative Party. This morning, I met the Chairman of the 1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady. We've agreed that there will be a Leadership election to be completed within the next week. This will ensure that we remain on a path to deliver our fiscal plans and maintain our country's economic stability and national security. I will remain as Prime Minister until a successor has been chosen. Thank you. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Or try to come to grips with the Leader that they had and move forward. But increasingly became apparent that was not going to be possible. And it seems like Liz Truss in her announcement today made very clear that her Leadership she realized was no longer tenable. Yesterday all seem to come to a head with the resignation of the Home Secretary Suella Braverman, who suggested in a not so subtle way that Liz Truss ought to follow her out the door. And it seems like over the last few weeks, Julia, Liz Truss has tried to do everything to try to salvage her Leadership. First, she tried to roll back just a small part of her economic plan. Then she fired her Chancellor, and then she rolled back a much larger part almost all of her economic plan. But even that wasn't enough, despite the fact that she brought in a chancellor from the other wing of the more moderate wing of her party. She now has a new Home Secretary from the more moderate wing of her party. None of that seem to matter. There were plenty of Conservative MPs who were willing to or who were not willing to go along with Liz Truss anymore. And so the party is going in another direction. But Julia, there are still a lot, a lot of open questions about what comes next, who will put themselves forward for Leadership and how exactly that contest will work.",

But they're going to have to come up with something pretty quickly understand. There's a 1922 backbench, Conservative Member of Parliament Committee meeting this afternoon and it's going to be really heated. I mean, the scenes last night have to say, in parliament were totally unedifying. All discipline had broken down; people screaming and shouting each other and backbench MPs were going on the BBC virtually in tears.

And it comes back to the point that you've made, which is critically important over the coming days and the sheer divisions now in this party. And whether or not the decision ultimately has to be, we actually deserve a period now in opposition. And deserve to go to an election and lose it.

And then last Minister stood at the dispatch box saying it wasn't a confidence vote, which is what caused all the chaos. And then the whips and everyone else couldn't figure out whether or not it was or not. Which is why you had people being pushed around and pushed in a direction they didn't necessarily want to go in? Because they didn't know what the rule was. And then we heard that Liz Truss sustained. So that's the chaos from last night. I just had an email actually Julia from Ladbrokes, which is a betting company. And we're in the realms of speculation here. So I thought I'd give you the runners and riders that they have lined up for who might take over from Liz Truss. They've got Rishi Sunak at the top of the list, then Penny Mordaunt and then Ben Wallace, who's the Defense Secretary. Boris Johnson, the Chemi Biden arc and then Michael Gove. And Michael Gove is an interesting one. He's always there isn't he? He's the one that really started stirring the trouble up for Liz Truss at the Conservative Party Conference, undermining some of her policies. I don't think he's going to be the Unity candidate that everyone's looking for. But he's always there in the list. So it does look as though Rishi Sunak may have a chance here, if you can convince that Boris Johnson side of the party. Simply because he warned that all of this was going to happen during the campaign for the Leadership, saying that Liz Truss's policies would have a knock on effect for mortgage rates, for example. So he's got that credibility, economic credibility out of all of this that may help. But I don't know how he then brings in Boris Johnson or gets Boris Johnson perhaps that's what Boris Johnson needs to do and step up and show his support for Rishi Sunak. But it's very hard to imagine, isn't it?",

Who knows, the Labour Party obviously stepping up and have continually said a general election is required and the party said the same thing. I believe on Twitter and just the last few moments. Much to discuss gentlemen, thank you so much, Max, Scott. We'll leave it there for now. OK, let's get some more contexts on this. Joining us now Mo Hussein, Former Press Officer for 10 Downing Street, Moe, great to have you with us your observations? MO HUSSEIN, FORMER 10 DOWNING STREET PRESS OFFICER: Well, what a tumultuous and messy few days we've seen in the U.K. with a third Prime Minister in the space of a year, not something you'd expect to happen. In the U.K. at all, I worked in the U.K. Government for 10 years or so in. I can't remember a single day like this. And I think this now raises really big questions going forward. Because we have a very protracted Leadership contest of a week, which again, has never happened before. There'll be various runners and riders. And in a week's time, we'll have a new Prime Minister. But how long can this last without calls for a general election increasing, which they already are? So I don't think that the turmoil and the lack of certainty is over yet.",

When he was criticizing her plans, the things you said would happen as a result of the plans is pretty much happening. So he did get that right. And I think, you know, he has got the financial experience in the Treasury to help drive the economy forward. That is the biggest challenge facing the country. But he's also a divisive figure; he is not liked by the people who support Boris Johnson. There are quite a few of them still in Parliament; he did not win the members. And there's a question for the Conservative Party around. What does this Leadership election actually look like? Is it just MPs?

So they also similar story on Monday, we saw them lower. So the 10 year had touched 4.5 percent in recent weeks, the - 5 percent, both now below 4 percent. But really, the big reaction was on Monday, I question how much confidence any investor could have in the UK government right now, given the revolving door of Chancellor's and Prime Ministers? And I'm not sure who's going to believe what at this stage. I think it'll be interesting to see when we get a fuller picture on the fiscal statement, the never ending fiscal statement, the date still set for the end of October Halloween, when we get to decide or get to see whether or not these books will be balanced?",

I have therefore spoken to His Majesty the King to notify him that I am resigning as Leader of the Conservative Party. This morning, I met the Chairman of the 1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady. We've agreed that there will be a leadership election to be completed within the next week. This will ensure that we remain on a path to deliver our fiscal plans and maintain our country's economic stability and national security.

We haven't seen the kind of growth in Britain, as we've seen in other G7 and European nations that has not been actualized. As she said, the promise of more freedoms from Brexit, it just hasn't happened in an economically, you know, an economically positive way for the UK. It has not struck out any of those free trade deals, notably with the United States, and not even with India, which was a very central plank, not with Europe, even. So those things are big issues. And what we had was this sort of very closed, almost two person mini budget, that did not pass the stress test of the, you know, of all the sort of various organizations that are mentors crunched the data before it gets put into the public. And that's where this whole crisis essentially exploded, because the very minute that Kwasi Kwarteng, her first Chancellor, put this out, it started a whole sort of, you know, catastrophe that has ended up where we are right now. Now, for instance, you know that there is reaction coming in, certainly from fellow G7 leaders, the President of France, Emmanuel Macron, has said that he hopes that for the good of the world and for good of Europe, that their stability in Britain are very, very soon. He said, on a personal level as a colleague, I hate to see one leave. President Biden, we know the U.S. Administration is watching this very, very closely, very unusually, President Biden, actually last weekend on a campaign stop in an ice cream store, where he was paying for ice cream using that imagery to essentially cast severe doubt on the you know, Liz Truss's economic policies. Before that he said that the idea of trickle down doesn't work. And I spoke to the Head of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva, at the UNGA, in September. Three days, two or three days before the mini budget was proposed. And even then, she said, the most diplomatic way she could, that this was simply a measure that would increase inequality, and could even lead to instability and unrest on the streets. You know, that's a big, big comment, even before this budget was made public and then afterwards, you know that the IMF intervened even further. So we're in a very, very tricky situation with no actual knowledge of how this so called leadership election is going to proceed within a week, given that the one that brought Liz Tuss to power took about two months.",

Would they have to make choices between how they have their families survive? I mean, we're talking about a G7 country in the midst of have a deep, deep problem in terms of austerity, which may come back and a real impact on people. And on top of that, the budget actually penalized ordinary people, and actually, with the taxes that they didn't, then did a U-turn on, actually took, you know, took the side of the ridge.

So the number one issue is howare the Tories going to elect a new leader who will de facto then become the new Prime Minister? How are they going to do it in a week when the Tory rules require complex procedures of MPs and then the membership? And the one thing they want to avoid, of course, is the membership having to have a vote in this because the membership are the ones who made this mess in the first place, in their view by electing Liz Truss. So they've got to square this circle before they do anything else Julia. It's how do you physically elect a new leader when the existing rules don't accommodate it? They'll jump - they'll be able to do that by fudging changing amending and just basically ignoring so they will get that done. And then you've got who's it going to be? Safe pair of hands or most certainly, it will be a big name, safe pair of hands, somebody who will probably Rishi Sunak who will stabilize the ship. There is no look, one is tempted Julia to think oh, my goodness, you know, poor woman Liz Truss who's had all this dumped. But she and the Chancellor brought this upon themselves. Three weeks ago, they introduced this mini budget, as if it was a bit of light housekeeping, a bit of accounting, don't look here, nothing to see it was a major shift in UK fiscal policy. And they did it without discussing it with the cabinet without proper discussion in in Treasury without the Bank of England and without the OPR.

I don't see the outgoing Home Secretary as a major runner, but believe me, don't - you're looking for a unity candidate, as you said, Julia, but unity now means something different. It means somebody who is acceptable to everybody who can save seats, give stability and save seats at the next election. And that's what you're really about. No, this is Titanic time. The Conservative Party is going down in the polls. And now what you're really doing is trying to move the deck chairs round and potentially get as many of their MPs into lifeboats for when there is a future general election. As for your general election question, since the repeal of the Fixed Term Parliament Act, the there is really only two ways that an election can now be called. One the new Prime Minister goes to the King and says, I think there should be an election or two; they lose a vote of confidence in the House. There is no way they can lose a vote of confidence in a sense, because with a new leader, existing MPs, Tory MPs, most certainly won't be turkeys voting for Christmas.

And the selection of candidates looking at theConservative Party it's actually quite small, I'd say. I think we'll see familiar faces being thrown into the ring as we had last time I think Rishi Sunak is probably a major contender. He was, in many ways the exact opposite of Liz Truss. And perhaps that is what people want to see now. There's also of course, Jeremy Hunt. Now he's gained a lot of confidence, particularly with the public by taking over as Chancellor and just frankly, ripping up the mini budget that caused so much trouble. Of course, at this stage, it does sound like Jeremy Hunt has ruled himself out of the job. I would suggest that major reason would be that surely he has to stay as Chancellor, we can't have another Chancellor within the next couple of weeks and the ever of revolving door of Chancellors that we've had. In terms of the markets and investment, I think we really do need to see one Chancellor stick to the job. And we have that fiscal statement coming up on the 31st. That maybe leaves us with Penny Mordant as well, Leader of the Commons at the moment. She ran for leadership against Truss and Sunak before she has been what she did eventually throw her hat in with Liz Truss when she gets to down for the leadership contest. So it's possible we see her that in there as well. What will be really hard though is uniting the party and instilling any confidence at this stage because you can see the Conservative Party in some ways is a little bit tribalistic at this stage. I was speaking to a Conservative MP who wanted Rishi Sunak to be the Prime Minister in recent weeks. And he criticized Liz Truss for selecting a cabinet when she became Prime Minister that was very much in her camp. And ideally, we'd see a cabinet that has representatives from all sort of across the spectrum of the Conservative Party. That's possibly the only way that the next government will actually see it through to the next general election. Which brings me to plenty of people in the UK would like to see a general election at this stage. The UK economy is of course, like many economies around the world facing major challenges. And at the moment, the decisions are being made by Prime Ministers that the public has not voted for. And I think in any situation, you would see huge pressure on a government when people are facing a cost of living crisis that is just deepening week by week. At this stage I think the only support they would get is from a general election.",
