So, it's clear that the Americans are in a hurry. The Israelis, I think, are under a little bit of pressure, more pressure perhaps than any time since mid- November during the last exchange. The question is, I think whether (INAUDIBLE) only decision maker on the Palestinian side who's ensconced in a tunnel somewhere. Khan Younis, Rafah Rafel, or maybe even Sinai in a tunnel, whether or not he believes that this deal serves his interests. And that's, I think, very few people, even those intimately associated with the negotiations, can read what (INAUDIBLE) wants. That's what is going to depend on. And I just don't know what their -- what his calculations are. Trading hostages means giving away cards. You'll still have 50, even if this deal goes through.

This is rare body camera footage from Russians, confident in their advances in the east, slow but sure. Adding to a list of nowhere villages, falling to Moscow day by day, claiming Monday to have taken here, Novomykhailivka. As Ukraine almost always stops short of saying how bad it's got. No more true of that is the fate of Ocheretyne, another tiny village in Donetsk, also of southern unwanted fame. Despite the brutal pounding and evacuation, you can see here, a military spokesman claims Sunday the Russians only had a partial foothold. Currently, they're part where the enemies located under our fire control, and all measures are being taken to knock the enemy out of there, he said. This after days of Russian soldiers posting videos of them raising flags inside the town. Ukraine's official statements as Russian footage showed a continued advance, showing a distance from reality, common when you're trying to win a war, but uncommonly now angering, normally loyal, Ukrainian bloggers. So, Ukraine's top military commander was forced to set a bleak record straight, saying the front lines had escalated as Moscow has concentrated its efforts in several directions, creating a significant advantage in forces and in means. He said the changing situation had led to an ambiguous understanding. Here is another case in point, Berdychiv, from which Ukraine was posting bullish videos of Russians being hit, just before their commander said they withdrawn Sunday. Across the Eastern Front, the news is bleak, the change since the fall of Avdiivka 10 weeks ago stark on this Ukrainian blogger's map, Russia making its most concerted, widespread and consistent advances, perhaps since the invasion. This is Zelensky's problem to keep now as he bolsters morale in towns and the Russian crosshairs. He has the money and so soon the weapons and the less blame he can shift for failure. We are cooperating with our partners at all levels, he said to achieve the level of efficiency and assistance that is needed, not only to maintain our positions, but also to disrupt Russia's war plans. We're still waiting for the suppliers that have been promised to Ukraine. But more is likely coming, where you just saw Zelenskyy visit, this is what is left of Chasiv Yar. Yet another town, Russia has turned into this smoldering ruin here within (INAUDIBLE) munitions in the name of liberating and demilitarizing Ukraine. Nick Payton Walsh, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

But in the most optimistic scenario for the Ukrainians, they might be able to roll back the Russian gains of recent months.Those Russian gains are fairly limited, actually, but it's going to be a lot more difficult for the Ukrainians to take control of the areas that the Russians have occupied for a long time, especially those areas in the Donbas that the Russians have occupied since 2014.

I think that the Ukrainians can certainly fight this war to a fairly advantageous position, but they have to be careful, and they have to incorporate the right kind of tactics and the right kind of weapons systems to match what their goals are. Obviously, President Zelenskyy, at least will publicly say that he wants to basically rid Ukraine of Russian soldiers and that is a laudable goal, that's something that could perhaps eventually be achieved.But it may not be achieved on the battlefield. I think the idea that the Ukrainians can't win this war is wrong, but they may not win it in the traditional sense of that, where there is an actual retaking of territory or a movement like we saw in 2022 with the Ukrainian counter-offensive, where the -- where the Ukrainians come in and take past areas of territory or retake last areas of territory from the Russians. That might be unrealistic, given the way in which the Russians have been able to strengthen their defensive lines, but the Ukrainians certainly have the capacity with new tactics and with some new weapons systems to actually make some gains or to very least stabilize the front line.",
