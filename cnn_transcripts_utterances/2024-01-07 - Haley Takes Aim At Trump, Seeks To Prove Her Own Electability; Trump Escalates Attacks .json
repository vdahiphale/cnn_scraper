I think the -- I think, you know, I'm a better dad and husband, I'm a better governor, I'm a better candidate, and I'd be a better president as a result of going through this. So the choice on January 15th I think is very simple. Donald Trump is running for his issues. Nikki Haley's running for her donor's issues. I'm running for your issues.

You have to go in demanding everything that you can because they already know it's going to be watered down by the Senate and with the White House.So their view is that, you know, they have to do something. And I think also using border security and immigration as a top campaign issue that's harmful for Democrats right now and the Biden administration is also a political play on their end as well. WALKER: And just for those who are not familiar with H.R. 2, it's a bill that was passed solely on party lines by the Republicans of the House last May with no Democratic support. And it was a bill that would drastically restrict the asylum process and just impose much stricter border security measures.

It doesn't go as far as some of the hard line measures that are in H.R. 2 given the fact that H.R. 2 has a lot of toxic elements for Democrats, including resurrecting and continuing the reconstruction of Trump's border wall. That's going to be a no go for Democrats.But there's a lot of issues there too, in terms of how far to go on some of these measures when even Senate Democrats and a lot of House Democrats are saying, yes, the border is an issue, but we're seeing a lot of pushback from progressives as well, as well as key Hispanic leaders in Congress. So this is a huge issue. It's very complicated issue. It's very hard to get any kind of bipartisan agreement on immigration and the border as it becomes a more massive issue for the country. So there's a lot of things to be negotiated and worked out in terms of, you know, where is the compromise and consensus here on this problem.",

So I think that's going to, you know, really elevate the impeachment inquiry and take the next step here. And hopefully, I think, they want to see some more evidence come out in terms of, you know, what's going on with these alleged foreign business dealings.

More than 1,200 people have been criminally charged for their alleged actions during the riot, and nearly 900 have been found guilty.Former President Trump's bid to shut down the federal election interference case against him will reach a critical moment on Tuesday. That's when a D.C. appeals court will hear arguments related to Trump's claims he has presidential immunity from prosecution while a trial has been scheduled for March 4th. The case has been paused while the appeals process plays out. With me now is Shan Wu, former federal prosecutor. Shan, good morning to you. This is -- I mean, we've been saying this for how many years unprecedented that we now have a president, former president who has been charged. And now the question of immunity must be tested.

And as Jack Smith pointed out in his filings, not only is there's no, you know, jurisprudence precedent for that, but from a common sense standpoint, that really creates a very dangerous situation. I mean, anytime you grant immunity in any sense to people, even when prosecutors give immunity, it's a gamble because what you're doing is you're creating an incentive for people to engage in bad behavior because you're giving them a pass on the behavior.

But when you look at the images coming from passengers on the plane, you can see hair is blowing around. You can also see that oxygen masks had been deployed. In fact, one passenger, Emma Vu (ph), said that she did not know what was going on because she had fallen asleep before they even took off. But knew something was wrong when she got a jolt awake and saw those oxygen masks. This all happening behind her, however. Another passenger said that he could see someone sitting in front of him and talked about this scary incident with one boy very close to that hole in the fuselage. Take a listen to him.

So far, according to the National Service, received a little bit over half a foot of snow here in Connecticut's capital city.Look, snow in New England in January typically wouldn't be a headline here. But given the lack of snow for much of the region, not just this past year, but in recent years -- at least measurable snow, I should say, or plowable snow, according to local officials. That's one of the reasons why officials and residents were certainly paying close attention to this particular storm that is still having an impact. A few flurries here in the area as that storm continues to make its way towards the northeast. Roadways, as we mentioned off the top, Victor, are relatively clear. So, people on this Sunday morning are able to make it to their destinations. But you can also see the plows working constantly. Transportation officials told me yesterday that over 600 dedicated pieces of snow removal equipment have been strategically placed throughout the state in order to respond. They were also monitoring these roadways real-time with dozens of weather stations throughout the state, permanent locations that not only give them air temperature, but also rate of snowfall and even the temperature of the pavement. So, they're able to deploy some of their resources accordingly. We have not heard of any major incidents so -- thus far. What's important to point out here is the timing of this storm. According to Connecticut transportation officials who say that's basically providing them with an upper hand. The fact that this happened not just on the weekend, but overnight on the weekend, that means that there will be fewer people on the road, allowing these plows to basically clear out some of this snow. But again, this really given an opportunity to dust off their equipment that, in some cases, hadn't been used in some time. So, folks here now, as we get ready to hopefully clear out of this system, now going to look ahead into the coming days for what might be on the horizon, guys.",
