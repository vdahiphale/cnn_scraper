The only hospital still working in service is the Kamal Adwan Hospital where staff say that they are coming under fire from Israeli forces. In the south, we see the hospitals are overwhelmed, you talked about 350 people being killed in the last 24 hours, many more of course, are being injured. And we're seeing in videos coming out of the hospitals in the south, for instance in Khan Yunis and Rafah, they are overwhelmed. The wounded are on the floor, the ambulances are coming up every moment. Also donkey carts are being used to transport the wounded, and we've heard from the World Health Organization's Gaza envoy that the health system is collapsing. Not only the health system, basic things like getting food for people. Apparently, according to the World Food Program, 97 percent of the people in northern Gaza have inadequate food, and nine out of ten people in northern Gaza have gone at least a day and a night without food as well. We see that the situation is slightly better in the southern part of Gaza where many of the people, the displaced, have fled to. But many of them of course, are sleeping essentially out in the open, in makeshift tents and shelters, where they're just covered by thin plastic sheeting. And of course, what we're hearing as we say, day-after-day, diseases are spreading because there's no sanitation, there's very little in the way of clean water, medical care of course, as a result of the collapsing medical system is also inadequate.

CNN cannot verify that claim, and has reached out to the Israeli military for comment. But video obtained by CNN, see it there, from the scene, shows columns of white smoke floating above that village. White phosphorus is classed as an incendiary weapon, and under international law, it cannot be fired at or near civilian areas. Earlier, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant traveled to northern Israel, closed to the border. The pair met with soldiers and Netanyahu had a stark warning for the Hezbollah militant group. That if it initiate an all-out-war, Lebanon will see the same destruction as Gaza. Of course, forces in southern Lebanon have been shelling and firing rockets at northern Israel for weeks now. CNN's Ivan Watson has been following those developments from Beirut. It has been -- I think you can call it a slow burn at the northern Israeli border since October 7th? It has not broken out to all-out-war.

So, an admission of this kind of strategy of wholesale destruction, and huge loss of life that's taken place in Gaza. Those words have a chilling effect in places like Beirut where the population is very much polarized between those who support Hezbollah and its efforts to kind of punish Israel for the ongoing offensive in Gaza, and those who do not support Hezbollah, which is not operating -- not conducting defense policy and foreign policy in conjunction with the very weak Lebanese state. When it comes to what's going on, on the border, the Israeli authorities have said that a 60-year-old Israeli man was killed by an anti-tank missile that came across the border in one of the border communities in northern Israel, as he was farming. Hezbollah, for its part, has said that it announced today that three Hezbollah fighters were killed. We don't know what the circumstances of that were. As you mentioned, there were allegations of these phosphorus rounds allegedly fired by Israel into a border community not far across the border from where that Israeli civilian died. And in a separate incident, there were apparent Israeli airstrikes on a Lebanese town not far from the Lebanese border town of Bent Jbail, some huge explosions there, and reports that Lebanese civilian students at an institute were injured there. All of this announced to, again, this fairly restrained to some degree border conflict, which has killed at least 94 people here on the Lebanese side of the border, the vast majority of them, Hezbollah fighters.

But you know, the Ukrainians, they will tell you if you talk to them in person, that we will fight this alone if need be, because there are arguments, and it's a very legitimate argument, I think is that, if Mr. Putin is not held back, he will come for more. And that could be the Baltics, it could be neighboring NATO country, but it needs to be pushed back.

And it goes sequentially and the whole name of the game for a candidate not named Trump, like Nikki Haley, is make a strong showing in those states so that more money comes in and more support. That's the whole concept here. Did she advance her cause? You saw Gary Tuchman talking to those Iowa voters, they were very pleased with her debate performance.

What you're saying is the nastiness, and this is what Chris Christie called him out for, it seems to me that's a pure play for attention. So that he is dominating on social media space, so he is in the conversation. He clearly is of the mind and he has been throughout all these debates, that if you're in the conversation, it doesn't -- there's no bad headline, as long as you're in the headline.

A defense accounting expert is testifying. Trump not required to attend. He is though taking the opportunity to speak to the media. And he lashed out once again at the New York attorney general, Letitia James, using strong language we've become accustomed to. He called her a lunatic and said he's done nothing wrong. For her part, James wrote this on X, formerly known as Twitter, saying her team has already proven its case. CNN's Brynn Gingras joins me now from outside the courthouse in New York.

And this witness actually lashed out and said, shame on yourself, talking to me like that. You make up allegations;; I'm here to tell the truth. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Prior to that testimony, he did testify, saying that he looked over all these financial statements of condition and he doesn't see any examples of fraud. Again, this is something, though, that the judge has already said the Trump and the defendants are liable of, is fraud, with those statements. So again, this is a strong witness. This is how the defense is going to wrap up its case, until they get to their final witness, which will be the former president. He's expected to take the stand on Monday. But this testimony is continuing with this witness and it's unclear when we'll get to cross examination, when the state will get to ask their questions.

So this gag order is still in place. He's violated it twice. The attorneys for Trump have tried to appeal that gag order to the highest court in New York, the court of appeals. However, they lost their bid to really expedite that process. So when Trump does take the stand on Monday, he's going to have to be very careful not to talk about the staff of the judge. It's important to note that gag order is extended to his attorneys. However, it's not extended to the point that Trump can't talk about the attorney general, which he continues to do. Can't talk about the judge, which he continues to do. But it will be interesting, he has to be very careful with his words on Monday. And so far we've seen today, Jim, he's been very careful with his words when he goes out in front of the cameras today as well.",
