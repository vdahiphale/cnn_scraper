He said in a statement to CNN: \"These documents were obtained illegally from foreign sources, hostile to the United States, intended to interfere here with the 2024 election and sow chaos throughout our democratic process.\" Now, this Microsoft report, it came out earlier this week and it said that Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, they were trying to break into the e-mail account of a high-ranking campaign official in June.

It is not a problem that we are  unprepared for, but it is good to be a constant reminder that hacking disinformation, this is a big part, especially by foreign entities, this is a big part of why as voters, we need to be really educated diligent, vigilant, all the things because so much information is flying at us from so many different places, especially on social media, it is hard to know what's real, it is hard to know what is faked and now fake and now what these leaks were potentially getting access to things that we are not supposed to see.

So there is a reason why voters in swing states, many of them are uncommitted, undecided, they are waiting for solutions to problems that they have. Trump is not offering that yet. Harris and JD Vance for their part, have not yet laid out their agenda either, so everyone is kind of waiting for the substance of this election to kick in. Trump seems very sort of scattered with Harris now on the Democratic ticket and Harris and Vance are obviously just getting in and just getting started, but they also need to tell voters, we are not just a campaign of vibes, right?

Some of them headed toward the Israeli city of Safed, some fell according to Hezbollah, near the Lake Tiberias.This number, 10, is a fairly large number for sort of the daily tally of Hezbollah strikes on Israeli targets. Israeli planes also carried out a series of strikes along the border within Lebanon itself. Also this afternoon, at about 5:30 local time, Israeli war planes flew over Beirut, breaking the sound barrier. That's a fairly normal thing to happen in the southern part of the country, but three times within the last five days, Israeli warplanes have broken the sound barrier over the Lebanese capital. And of course, that is interpreted as a warning to Hezbollah not to retaliate against the killing last week of a senior Hezbollah commander, but also a warning to Lebanon as a whole that there will be dangerous consequences if Hezbollah launches such a retaliatory attack. Now also, Iran has made it clear that it will also strike, but Iran is in a different sort of situation. It is a long way away from Israel. If you launch a drone from Iran, it takes hours to get to Israel, easily detected either by Israel or American or other forces that might be involved in trying to head off such an attack. Hezbollah on the other hand, its forces are on the border with Israel. It doesn't take very much time for a missile, a drone, or any other sort of projectile to get into Israel. And therefore, Hezbollah in a sense, poses a much greater risk to Israel. And we heard from the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah twice -- two speeches within 10 days -- the last 10 days that Hezbollah will attack Israel. The question is when. Of course, we've heard from US officials going back a week now that that strike would take place within 24 to 48 hours. So I take those predictions from US officials with a grain of salt -- Wolf.",

And we are going into a very dramatic week when we'll see President Biden's top Middle East advisor, Brett McGurk, going to the region in a day or two. Then Secretary of State Blinken might join also and travel to the Middle East.And on Thursday, there's this negotiation summit, maybe the last chance, maybe the now or never hostage deal on Thursday, when CIA Director Bill Burns will lead the U.S. negotiation team. So this is going to be a very dramatic week. And I think what we heard from Vice President Harris just shows you how much the administration wants this week to end with a breakthrough towards the hostage and ceasefire deal in Gaza.",

Yesterday, Secretary Blinken calls the Israeli Minister of Defense, Yoav Gallant, and one of the things that Blinken tells him, he tells him, look, Hezbollah or Iran or both might attack you in the next few days. It's important that you will not retaliate or respond in a way that will further escalate the situation and prevent us from getting to this hostage deal.So the U.S. pressure is not only on Iran and Hezbollah to prevent them from retaliating, it's also on Israel in case that if Iran and Hezbollah do retaliate, that Israel will somehow maintain the most restraint possible in order not to, you know, harm those - this summit on Thursday.",

We can see a scenario and we can definitely see a path that you can get to Thursday and you get the major breakthrough in the hostages ceasefire negotiations, but you can also see a path where Hezbollah or Iran or both do attack Israel in the next 24, 48, 72 hours and then everything is unraveled and you find yourself in a much deeper and wider conflict.And I think this is the - this is why this is such a dramatic week for the U.S. diplomacy, because the Biden administration is trying on the one hand prevent this war from widening.
