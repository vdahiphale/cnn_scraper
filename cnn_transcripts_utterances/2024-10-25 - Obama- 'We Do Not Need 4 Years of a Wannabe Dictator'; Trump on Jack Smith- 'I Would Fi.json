Wade and made life worse for women in this country. So, that's -- you know, today she's going to spend a lot of time trying to remind people that there are actually real consequences. There is kind of a haziness, an amnesia, to use Brad's term, around the four years that Trump was in office. I think that's, in part, due to the fact that the pandemic was so challenging and traumatic for people all over the country. And so, part of the thing she's trying to do now is remind people, you know, hey, a Donald Trump presidency has consequences. We lived through it. And one of the ways in which your life is -- is tangibly worse because Donald Trump was president, is because women's reproductive freedom, women's health care is no longer as easy to access.

They're looking at, from what I can see, registered -- sorry, likely voters in battleground states. And it's a dead heat, 48 to 48 percent, which again underscores that this is an incredibly divided country. There are obviously some things that are different from 2016. Abortion rights is certainly one of them. It is absolutely central for Democrats. But there are also some dynamics that are pretty similar, in that -- and I think Brad sort of touched on this: that Democrats are incumbent, right? And the question has been, can Harris convince voters that she is not the unpopular incumbent, that she is different, and that she is the one who represents change? It seems like here in the final weeks, it may be that Trump -- and maybe it's due to this, you know, depending on who you want to apply the amnesia idea to. The people may have amnesia about what it was like under Trump, and they're trying to convince people to get rid of that. [06:10:03] But he seems to be the candidate. When -- when you directly ask this question, voters say she seems to represent change, but it's not actually how they're acting. ANNIE LINSKEY, REPORTER, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Yes. Yes. No, I think that's one of the really interesting challenges for Harris in her kind of closing arguments here. She -- she has not separated herself from Joe Biden. And she's made very, very subtle policy differences. She'll kind of point to herself and say, you know, I'm a woman, I'm a different race, and I'm a different person than Joe Biden. But she hasn't made a really clear break from him. And that is also related to another, you know, weakness she does have, according to polling in the final weeks, which is there are -- there's a large number of people in a particularly big number of independent voters who say they don't know enough about her. So, you know, she's -- she's said, look, I'm going to -- it's going to be a new page. It's going to be a different administration. But she hasn't really talked a lot about exactly how it would be different. And I think that's where you have some of that confusion and where people are reverting to this idea that, look, it looks -- it wouldn't be a continuation of the Biden-Harris administration. Because look, you know, Harris is part of the Biden-Harris administration. So, you know, I agree that, you know, there's moments here where she could try to make that separation, and she's got time left. But so far, she just hasn't done it.",
