The People of the State of New York versus Donald J. Trump now underway, as Trump's attorney was arguing, and I'm quoting him here, \"There is nothing wrong with trying to influence an election.\" Hmm. There was a hush in the courtroom today, as the first witness took the stand, a longtime confidant, who helped Trump catch and kill negative stories, and could now help make the former President, a convicted felon. And Trump meanwhile, relatively quiet in court, but ranting outside court, attacking Michael Cohen, the widely expected star witness for the prosecution. My source tonight is Michael Cohen's legal adviser, Lanny Davis. Also just in, Trump in a new interview, talking about the jury. Did he just violate a gag order? Maybe again? I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. For the next six weeks or so, prepare to expect the unexpected. Speaking of which. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think it went very well. (END VIDEO CLIP) COLLINS: Trump saying that the first true day of his criminal trial went well, in his view, even after the prosecution accused him of trying to cover up an affair with a porn star, to influence the election. Even after they read his own words from the infamous Access Hollywood tape, about being able to sexually assault women because he's famous. And even after one of his longtime confidants and a tabloid king took the witness stand. There were no outbursts from Trump in court today. But outside of the courthouse was a very different story.

They said it is about quote, \"Falsifying business records with the intent to conceal an illegal conspiracy to undermine the integrity of a presidential election\". 34 counts of it. And Trump is of course, innocent until he is proven guilty. His lawyer told the jury today that he \"Had nothing to do with the 34 pieces of paper, the 34 counts, except he signed onto the checks in the White House while he was running the country.\" Signing the checks seems like kind of a big deal, and while he was running the country at that, especially given that when Trump was asked back then, when I was covering the White House, said that he knew nothing about this payment at all.

Even more strictures on when it was a violation if you talked about court personnel and so on. But the jurors, the judge basically said you may not make public statements that relate to the jurors, period, like full stop. So, I think any talking about the jurors is a violation of the gag order, which I think brings us to 12 violations, for tomorrow's hearing. So, we'll see what Judge Merchan does about that. And it's just wrong. I mean, jury selection took a week. In a six-week case, that's not at all unusual. I'm sure those of you on the table will agree.

And that's what takes a long amount of time. So, once they got rid of those people, both sides only get 10 challenges. You go through those pretty quickly. And they did go through them pretty quickly. And I do agree with Jennifer, I think talking about the jury is verboten. I don't think you're allowed to.

We do. Arthur does. Renato does. We try cases, in this system, murder cases, rape cases. I'm going to say more than 90 percent of New Yorkers don't like murderers and don't like rapists. But those individuals get fair trials, in this county, every day of the week. And you know what, Mr. Defendant? If you don't want to be tried in New York County, don't allegedly commit your crimes in New York County. It's a little bit silly for him to come out and say that. With respect to the issue, on whether or not there's a violation of the gag order. I agree with both of you that this is a violation. I think one of the problems that Judge Merchan is facing is quite frankly, if -- there's not a whole lot of places to go. A $1,000 for each one, is not much for a guy who owes let's say $400 million, I don't even know at this point, or put him in jail for a limited amount of time, which I assume no one really wants to do.

Of course, very different viewpoints on what that testimony is going to mean, and the impact of it. Trump's attorney went with what you might call the Mariah Carey defense, saying that he's obsessed with Trump, that he's a criminal and that he can't be trusted.

And it says making or directing others to make public statements about any prospective jurors or any juror in this criminal proceeding is a violation of this gag order. What do you say? LADORIS HAZZARD CORDELL, RETIRED JUDGE, CALIFORNIA SUPERIOR COURT, AUTHOR, \"HER HONOR\": If you're talking about the comment he made today, I think he's got a problem. Just saying well, they are Democrats, 95 percent, itself doesn't seem like it's violating the order. He's just making a comment about demographics. I don't even though that that's accurate. I think he's made it up. But the point is, he's sending a message to his MAGA base that who are not Democrats that that this is bad, that these folks 95 percent of them are bad. And so, I think he has a big problem. It's not going to come up tomorrow. It's unlikely that it will, because it isn't a part of the motion that's before the judge, tomorrow.

I have talked to Republicans who believe it or not, are relieved, these trials are finally here. You know why? Because the last month, they have had to defend the Republican war on women, and they think that is worse. They think it's easier to just yell witch-hunt, about these very unseemly, seedy, gross, awful trials, than to actually defend their own policies on abortion, IVF, the Arizona ban.
