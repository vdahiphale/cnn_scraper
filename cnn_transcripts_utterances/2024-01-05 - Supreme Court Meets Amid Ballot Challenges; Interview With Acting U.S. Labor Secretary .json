Secretary, thank you so much for taking some time to be with us. What is the most promising thing in the jobs report and is there anything in it that is concerning you? JULIE SU, ACTING U.S. SECRETARY OF LABOR:  Hi, Brianna. It's great to be here. This is, as you said, a strong, it's a very stable jobs report, 216,000 jobs added in December, making the average over all of 2023 225,000 jobs. That is higher than at any point in any single year in the prior administration. And it is a -- it's a sign that that coveted soft landing, we have reached it, right? We had very strong recovery from the pandemic, and now we have had a strong, solid 2023. These things don't happen by accident. They happen because of strong leadership. They happen because of economic policies, and they happen because President Biden has been very clear that we're going to build an economy where we do right by workers. That's how to make things better. That's how to make things stronger. We can keep unemployment rate low while we increase real wages, while we continue to increase jobs. And that's going to be the message for 2024, is to keep on doing that.",

And many people predicted that we could not both control inflation while keeping jobs high. And that is exactly what we have accomplished. And that is what the president wakes up every morning thinking about, is, how do we make life better for the American people? How do we create good jobs in every single community, so people don't have to leave their homes in order to find work that's going to bring them into the middle class? And so this is a yearlong, sustained, and steady record that many people thought was not going to be possible. And we're going to keep that up for the rest of this year.",

And, again, that is very core to the president's message and his economic agenda, that we don't have to sacrifice worker well-being when we strengthen the economy. In fact, those two things actually go hand in hand. And we saw that throughout the year, not just in terms of the jobs numbers we talk about, but also in terms of the record gains that workers made at the bargaining table, the broad-based jobs creation across multiple industries. And, again, we are still just getting started, right? 2024 is going to be a big year for those historic investments to actually hit the ground, to have projects actually beginning, and to have even more jobs across construction, manufacturing, clean energy, and other industries that we're really focused on growing here in America.",

A tight labor market is good for workers. It increases worker power. It's what has helped result in these wage increases and other improvements to working conditions, better retirement security, better health and safety protections, and the like. And so I think the president has called for Congress to address the immigration issue, has also called for more funding so that there can be a strong policy at the border.

The Colorado voters who started all this have asked, can it be decided by February 11, which is the day before ballots are mailed out in Colorado for the end result being the Super Tuesday, March 4, when they have to be submitted? But there are some other 15 states that will be holding primaries that day. So you can see how crunched this is. And they can't just take the bench or meet in conference and decide this.

One of the main things that the U.S. has been trying to do is try to figure out and pressure Israel into going into that next phase from what we have been calling this higher-intensity phase that we have seen over the past few months to a much more targeted, lower-intensity phase that will do less harm to civilians. We will also hear Secretary Blinken talk again about the need for Israel to do more to protect civilians, that civilian death toll going higher and higher really by the hour. I mean, we're talking about more than 22,000 people who've been killed in Gaza so far. And then the humanitarian aid that the U.S. has not enough has gotten -- not enough has gotten in. And a lot of that is because of the continued fighting. And so we will hear things we have heard in the past. And it's clear that the U.S. feels Israel has not made enough progress. And they want to see progress there. At the same time, they don't want to be seen as telling Israel what to do. And then Blinken's going to be all over the rest of the Middle East, talking about the other flare-ups that we have seen. And when you look at those, whether it's the Houthis in Yemen or Hezbollah in Lebanon or the proxy groups in Iraq and Syria, what do they all have in common? They're all backed by Iran. And so Blinken is going to be enlisting other world leaders, other countries to be intermediaries with Iran, essentially telling them to knock it off and not expand this conflict.
