A cautious calm across Israel is Prime Minister Netanyahu presses pause on his judicial reform overhaul, saying a one-month delay will allow real debate on the way forward. Protesters responding with a pause of their own but critics say Netanyahu is merely buying time at the expense of democracy. We'll discuss how the country's widening political divide over these reforms and other social issues has impacted business sentiment in particular, the CEO of Israeli payroll management firm Papaya Global has called on other CEOs to withdraw some cash from banks in protest. She'll join us later to discuss. And no protest polls in France meanwhile, where a 10th day of anti-pension reform demonstrations are just getting underway. President Macron still refusing to budge on the issue further inflaming French anger we're going to be live in Paris in just a few moments time for the latest there. And in Washington the U.S. Senate beginning a first round of hearings into the causes of the two recent Regional bank collapses and what should have been done to prevent them the U.S. brokered and backstops deal to sell SVB assets to the First Citizens Bank announced on Sunday, helping to further improve bank investor sentiment. Along with word that the U.S. may extend its emergency bank lending facility to help stabilize other troubled lenders. Stable is one thing but at what price if banks ultimately lend less. Small businesses could suffer and that could cost jobs. We'll discuss with Allianz and Gramercy Adviser Mohamed El Erian later in the show. He's warning about potential rolling credit contractions that could increase the chance of recession. For now, global investors are banking on banking calm. U.S. futures consolidating after a mostly higher close on Monday as you can see Europe relatively flat after a positive Asian handover, where news from tech giant Ali Baba really stole the show shares set to rally some 9 percent in U.S. trade. And weird words that the behemoth is splitting into six individual parts with five potential IPOs or fund raisers. In focus this news coinciding with Jack Ma's first public appearance in a year. There are no coincidences more on all of that in just a few moments time too. But first, the French government warning of a high risk to public order, as protests by French unions entered their 10th day. They are continuing to reject a reform law which rises the pension age from 62 years old to 64. And Sam Kiley joins us now. And is there Sam, who's out there protesting?

It happened late Monday at a detention center into that what is across the border from El Paso, Texas. The fires swept through the migrant Detention Center according to a statement from Mexico's National Migration Institute. We have heard from Andrea Chavez she is Ciudad Juarez federal deputy, a member of the Mexican Congress who said in a tweet early on today that Mexico's Attorney General had launched an investigation into the blaze. Let me read to do what she said. She says it is with deep sadness and grief that we learned though the fire that occurred inside the INM - we will wait for the official information. And from this moment on we send our condolences to the families of the migrants FGR meaning the attorney's office initiated the investigation as she said. She is - Julia, as you know is located in the Mexican border state of Chihuahua. And now there's word from the State Governor's office. In his statement, it said that the fire happened after more than 70 migrants who were loitering in the streets of what is where detained. Officials also say there are dozens of people who were injured. So that's why this is a border city where many immigrants from different parts of the world arrive, hoping to get across the border to seek asylum in the United States as it has been the case with other border towns. There have been multiple riots and tense situations in the last few years due to the fact that there's not enough shelters that can accommodate all of these migrants. And Julia in a later release from Mexico's National Migration Institute Officials said among the injured there were 68 men from Central American countries that also said an additional 29 people were transported to local hospitals.

And this is all happening at a time when, as you said, China is facing some really strong and difficult economic challenges, including just basically waking up out of the COVID locked out. We're talking about an ageing population. We are talking about a government that has been very strong with regulation. So when we have Chinese Premier, Li Qiang make a very public declaration by saying that it's open for business in front of all of these noticeable business people. It has a lot of weight, and Li Qiang made some very important points. One, he said that China will respect international laws and international trade rules. In addition, he stressed the point that China will create perhaps an equitable platform for all of these businesses, all of this foreign investment to take place. But China's economic difficulties, its challenges aren't just coming from within. China is also facing a lot of challenge from outside its own borders, from places such as India from Vietnam, which have all been courting American companies as well as companies from around the globe. In addition, a recent survey by the American Chamber of Commerce found that American interest in investment in China has declined. It's waning compared to years in the past when it typically was a go to place especially for manufacturing. So Julia, the economic story for China host COVID is still very much to be written.",

But something else I've seen, and it's been widely discussed is what's going on in capital markets so where you go to raise money, whether that's a good quality corporate? For example, what we call investment grade, or if you're a little bit riskier, the high yield market, even IPOs in the United States? It's all dried up, is that a temporary phenomenon in your mind, Mohamed? Or is that something else we should be watching very closely in an indication of a broader concern? EL-ERIAN: So it reflects basic volatility in interest rates. The two-year rate, which is supposed to be anchored by the Federal Reserve, has moved in a way that I don't remember ever imagining, not just seeing, imagining in my career, it's been incredibly volatile. If the two years' volatile, you can imagine what's happening elsewhere in the interest rate complex. So people step back from volatile market. And that's why we have seen a drying up of bond issuance of drying up of IPOs. I think it's temporary, I think calm is going to be restored to the interest rate complex. And with that, we're going to see capital markets functioning again. But we've been reminded how fragile system is.",

      "sentences": "Yes, because you just simply don't know how to price things. When there's this much volatility, you don't know what to charge for thatdebt, or what you're willing to accept it to lend somebody money in reverse. Translate that now to my introduction, and what I was talking about the sort of shot across the bows for all small lenders. That perhaps there's going to be more red tape coming that there's going to be more scrutiny and how likely they are to perhaps hold on to the deposits that they have? Or second guess where they borrow money from in order to lend it out to ordinary businesses or individuals? How big a concern now is that? EL-ERIAN: So they have two issues. Issue number one is on the deposit side. And just think a lot of people are saying, you know what, I trust my bank, my small bank, but isn't it safer to take my deposit to one of the largest banks that are too big to fail? After all, what do I lose in doing this? So what we've seen is a deposit flight from small banks to larger banks. And that makes sense for depositors who are just trying to sleep at night. The problem with that is that it shrinks the balance sheet of the smaller banks, and the smaller banks are not able to lend as much as they have before. And the customers of the smaller banks tend not to be the customers of the big banks. So all the deposits move, the loans do not move. So that's impact number one. Impact number two, the regulators wrongly assumed that these banks were not systemic. They didn't pose a threat to the system as a whole. But it turns out that in the case of Silicon Valley Bank, it did pose a risk to the system as a whole. So supervisors and regulators are going to get much more interested in looking at the balance sheet of the banks and that will make the banks more cautious and will probably increase regulation. So banks are getting hit from both sides.",

The Federal Reserveis going to do in terms of rate changes, let's call it that, because the markets obviously pricing in cuts to interest rates this year. What's right, Mohamed, you're generally on the money when you predict these things? Do you think the Federal Reserve is done? And do you think, despite what investors think we can rule out cuts this year, because that gap is big, between what the Fed saying and what markets are thinking? EL-ERIAN: That gap is huge Julia, I mean, if you look by the end of the year, the difference is a full percentage points. Again, I've never seen this before. It reflects a number of things. One is genuine uncertainty and you can think of certainly I can think of multiple scenarios for growth and inflation and therefore interest rates. But it also reflects a general loss of credibility in of the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve is engaged in what I think is the biggest policy mistake we've seen for 40 years. People don't believe it anymore. So they are saying I don't care about the forward guidance that the Fed is giving me. I have my own views, even though the Fed controls those short term interest rates. So basically, the market is taking on the person who sets those interest rates. It shows you what has happened to credibility of the Fed. And then they're also being tested today on Capitol Hill and elsewhere on the supervision on the lapses in supervision. So we have both genuine uncertainty, but it's compounded and amplified in a massive way, by a loss of confidence in the Federal Reserve.",

I could ask you how we got into aworld where there's an implicit assumption that any bank that gets into trouble is deemed systemic in order to shore up the whole system that the Fed doesn't hike interest rates until the very last moment and creates a lot of the instability. And now we're in a situation to your point where investors simply say to the Fed, we don't believe you, perhaps the better question Mohamed is, how do we get out of this? And what are the implications for investors? EL-ERIAN: So short term, there's no easy way out. And once you make a big policy mistake, you in the world of second and third best, you no longer have a first best, which means that whatever you do is imperfect, whatever you do would have collateral damage and unintended consequences, and that's the world we live in. So I'm afraid that haven't dug a hole for itself, that's so deep, the Fed can't get out of it quickly. So it's going to having enormous difficulty balancing, lowering inflation. Maintaining growth, and maintaining financial stability is the trilemma, not the dilemma, the trilemma. How do we get out of this over the long term so economic growth? Economic growth can solve a lot of things for us, but that's a much longer conversation, Julia.",

And I'm very happy about the decision yesterday to hold the conversation. And eventually to ensure that yes, there are some conversations in place. Honestly, I don't know if this is too little too late. And if we will be able to bridge currently, the huge kind of issues and kind of the huge gaps that we already have in between the parties.

So we are - and definitely as to your point, I think that if this judicial reform will come to re-elections, if we will believe that this is going to a place where they are continuing with their original intent. I strongly think that it will impact Israel economy. We saw it already with the volatility of the shekel versus the U.S. dollars in the last few weeks.
