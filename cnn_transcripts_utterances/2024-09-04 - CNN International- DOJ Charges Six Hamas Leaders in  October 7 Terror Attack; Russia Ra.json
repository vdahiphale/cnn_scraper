This is \"CNN Newsroom.\" Just ahead, Ukraine's foreign minister offers to resign as part of a major government reshuffle as another Russian strike turns deadly. The U.S. files criminal charges against six senior Hamas leaders over the October 7th attacks. And you may be surprised by what the latest CNN poll suggest about the state of the U.S. presidential race.We begin in Ukraine where President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says they need new energy and is directing a major cabinet reshuffle. The country's foreign minister has offered to step down. It is Kyiv's biggest government shakeup since Russia's full-scale invasion began. Ukraine's parliament approved the resignations of several members of the government today, but did not take up Dmytro Kuleba's. In his daily address on Tuesday, the president outlined the reasons for the reshuffle. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  The (inaudible) will be extremely important for Ukraine and our state institutions must be set up, so that Ukraine achieves all the results we need, all of us. To do this, we need to strengthen some areas of the government, and we have prepared personnel decisions. There will also be changes in the office. I'm also counting on a slightly different weight (ph) for certain areas of our foreign and domestic policy. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And I do know that two of these ministers now who I've interviewed over the last two days, have both tended their resignations. One, we understand will be moved into a defense department position and we wait to see what happens with Kuleba. But we understand that the system here demands that whenever there is an impending reshuffle, then all the ministers tendered their resignation. It is sort of a formality. And then the parliament and the president, they did side who they're going to reshuffle, who will resign permanently, and who will be reassigned and -- or who will stay in their positions.So the fact that Dmytro Kuleba, the most well-known and high-profile after the president, basically ambassador for Ukraine's narrative and its needs has resigned, does not mean he is out of a job, at least not yet. So let's see what happens. In terms of the attacks, this week has seen a mark step-up of Russian attacks all across this country and they are three-pronged, it is ballistic missiles, it is cruise missiles. It is very heavy Shahed drones. They are attacking a number of different installations. For instance, in Lviv, we understand, although it fell in downtown Lviv, it was very close to the train station and to the railway station. As you know, the railways are key transportation hubs, not just the people, but for war material as well. In Poltava, yesterday, just as I was talking to the foreign minister, there was this massive ballistic missile attack on a military academy, those young recruits being trained to fight the war. We also know because winter coming, that the Russians are stepping up their attacks on infrastructure including energy infrastructure, because they want to demoralize the population, disable the population, and plunge this nation again into this deep freeze, which is essentially what every winter here is. So that is what is going on. Now, I asked Dmytro Kuleba what message they need to send -- they are sending to the United States? And he said, A, we are sending the message that we need more weapons, everything that has been promised to us, we need them now, and especially sophisticated anti-missile defenses that can take down things as ferocious as ballistic missiles. On the issue of the Ukrainian incursion and central cross-border invasion into the Kursk region of Russia, I asked him what the strategy behind that was. Here's what he told me. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, this was a sharp demonstration according to the Ukrainian government of what they can achieve when they do have the equipment and that is their message right now, especially as a new essentially school year, so to speak, a new autumn of this war is imminent. And this government is sending representatives to the Biden Administration to try to convince them of their needs and also to leave and raise the restrictions on the weapons that they have right now.

Three of the men who are charged are now dead, including Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas political leader who was killed in Tehran.

They're facing multiple charges, as you said, terrorism, conspiracy to murder U.S. nationals, just being two of those charges. Significantly here, what we heard from the Department of Justice yesterday is that these actions are not going to be their last. They are still investigating Hamas' actions, their murders of other U.S. citizens. For example, the U.S. citizen who is included in the murder of the six hostages over the weekend by Hamas.So, this is the beginning of the steps that we expect DOJ to take, but certainly not the last. And as you said, these charges were actually filed back in February. The reason that they were sealed until now is because the Department of Justice wanted to see if they could actually arrest some of these leaders who are listed here. After the death of Ismail Haniyeh earlier this year in Iran, they made the determination after there are a number of events happen following that, that they no longer needed to keep this indictment sealed. And so, it is now been released to the public. The question of actually getting U.S. hands on these leaders of Hamas is a big one, that is certainly not something that will be easy to do. Yahya Sinwar, as you noted, the leader of Hamas who is listed here, the architect of October 7, the person who is still calling the shots when it comes to their operations and also the answers that they give back-and-forth with the negotiators in Israel, trying to reach a ceasefire and hostage release agreement. He is listed here, his exact whereabouts is not even known, somewhere probably in the tunnels under Gaza. So, this is a space we will continue to watch as the Biden Administration is saying that they're going to be doing two things simultaneously, trying to hold Hamas accountable for the deaths particularly of the American citizens, but also trying to clinch that ceasefire and hostage release agreement. That is not something that is simultaneously easy to do, but that is what they're setting out to do here, making it very clear that they're not going to hold back their fire against Hamas even as they are trying to come to an agreement with Hamas to release the rest of the hostages that are in their possession.",

So that is her clearest most direct path. But as you see, the Pennsylvania numbers there, it is a dead heat. So Pennsylvania becomes a critical state. It is also the largest electoral prize, 19 electoral votes of all of these battleground states.For Trump, you see here how competitive Georgia is, 48 percent to 47 percent, no clear leader. That's basically a tie margin of error race there between the two candidates. If he -- if Trump can hold everything he held in 2020 and just flip back Pennsylvania and Georgia, he would be the next president of United States.

But look here, when you break it out between Trump supporters and Harris supporters, overwhelmingly Trump's supporters say economy is the number one issue. For Harris supporters, it is not nearly as salient of an issue. In fact, protecting democracy is the number one issue in all six battleground states among Harris supporters.

New Hampshire is a state that's voted for Democratic nominees going back about 20 years and I think it's a state that when Joe Biden was the Democratic nominee, Democrats were a little bit worried about, polls had shown something of a softening there for Democrats. Now that Kamala Harris is the nominee, things seem to have firmed up somewhat, but I do think it shows you that she isn't taking any of these electoral votes for granted.And so when she heads up there, she is very much looking to regain the initiative on the issue of the economy. That's something, as you were talking about with David, that Donald Trump still holds something of an advantage on and she wants to demonstrate this focus very much on small businesses and entrepreneurship. As you mentioned, she plans to announce a plan that would increase by ten-fold the small business tax deduction, allowing small businesses to deduct up to $50,000 in start- up expenses, all with the objective of allowing millions and millions of new small business applications. And I think what she's trying to do is sort of act as a counterpoint to some of the proposals she unveiled a few weeks ago that some Republicans claimed were overly populist and said they amounted to price controls, when she went after corporations for price gouging on things like groceries. And so, this is all sort of formulating an economic plan that I think taken altogether, Kamala Harris wants to demonstrate a very pro-business approach, particularly when it comes to small business, but also an approach that will help workers and help everyday Americans who are trying to launch these small businesses. And so, when we see her there in New Hampshire today, she'll be speaking at a brewery. The Harris campaign says this brewery was opened in part by some policies they took advantage of under the Biden Administration. So, it's all this collective approach, trying to announce her own economic policies, but also trying to embrace some of the policies that she helped enact when she was vice president under President Joe Biden.",

She will venture out from this debate camp to do some local campaign stops. But the focus is very much to narrow down her debate plans and she has a team of advisers with her.She has brought in someone as a stand-in for Donald Trump during these mock debates. He's the former Hillary Clinton aide, Philippe Reines. He actually played Trump during Clinton's mock debates back in 2016. And the objective for her team is to really sort of narrow down the policy, but also try and develop a plan for when Donald Trump goes on the attack, try and stay cool, try and not to get bogged down, but also look for ways to get under Donald Trump's skin. And then when you talk to Harris advisers, they do say so that she enters this debate as something of an underdog and they point out that no one has more experience in general election debates than Donald Trump. This will be his seventh. That's more than anyone in history. He's been the Republican nominee for three straight election cycles.

The latest targeting the western city of Lviv, which has long been considered a safe haven. Local officials say at least seven people were killed and dozens more injured. Five people were also injured in a Russian assault in central Ukraine. Now, this comes one day after two Russian ballistic missiles hit a military training facility and a nearby the hospital just north of there. That killed at least 53 people.Let's dive a little deeper. CNN Military Analyst, Colonel Cedric Leighton joining me now from Washington. Colonel, it's good to see you. First off. I just wanted to get your take on this uptick in Russian strikes on Ukraine lately, what is the strike here? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  So good morning, Amara. Good to be with you. There's, I think, a basic strategy that the Russians have really reinforcing what they've done before and what that is, is to go after both civilian and military targets that are going to affect Ukraine's ability to fight this war. What they're trying do is they're trying to cut out the civilian infrastructure. Plus they're also trying to go after the areas in which the military is growing its new people, it's young people. So this technical training center that they hit in Poltava is an example of this. This was a center where the communication specialists, kind of like the equivalent of U.S. Army's Signal Corps, gets their training. And that's the kind of thing that will make it very difficult for the Ukrainians to replenish their forces, and it's also a critical specialty that's needed in a war like this. So, it makes sense for them to target these kinds of installations.",

Perhaps he's figuring that new faces will change the way in which Ukraine is perceived in the rest of the world. But it may also signal a change in tactic diplomatically, as well as the change in strategy diplomatically and militarily.So, what that could mean is that Ukraine is looking for another phase of this war, looking to create another phase of this war.

And then, she also made sure that she was blocking the Taiwanese community here in New York City from having access to the governor. You see, Linda Sun was in charge of essentially being a liaison to the many the Asian American communities here in New York. And in her position, she made sure that the Taiwanese did not get access and even made sure to block Taiwanese cultural heritage week here in New York at one point. This all was done at the behest of the Chinese Communist Party according to federal prosecutor. Now, in exchange for that, Amara, prosecutors say that she received millions of dollars in kickbacks. Her husband was able to benefit in his personal businesses. They were given special treatment, tickets to events, even at one point, the delivery of a salted duck, a specialty dish that was prepared by the personal chef of one of these Chinese officials and was delivered to the home of her mother. Now, I should say that Sun and her husband both appeared in court yesterday. They pleaded not guilty. You're seeing images of them there, walking out of court yesterday afternoon. Their lawyers have said that they are looking forward to their day in court and that the charges are nothing more than the result of an overly aggressive investigation. So, we will see how this plays out in the next few weeks as they return to court. In the meantime, Amara, both Governor Hochul and former Governor Andrew Cuomo have tried to distance themselves from this aide, saying that she only worked for them for a short period of time and that as soon as the inappropriate behavior was flagged, they took action and that she was ultimately terminated from her job.",

And yes (ph), last year, for example, in 2023, he said that he regretted having Christmas starting only on November 1st.The Christmas is a serious business in Venezuela with most public employees enjoying reduced working hours, reduced working days, and many fear that Maduro is now using Christmas as a way to try and restore a sense of normality in the country, while the crackdown over the last few weeks has been brutal. Human Rights Watch has documented 11 cases that directly implicate the security forces of Nicolas Maduro in killings of opposition protesters. But that is not just the only novelty about this year.
