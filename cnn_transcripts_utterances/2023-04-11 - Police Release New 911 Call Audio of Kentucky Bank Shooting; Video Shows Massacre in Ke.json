On the video, according to a member of law enforcement, a woman who worked here at the bank could be heard saying good morning to the shooter. And that's when the shooter told the woman you need to get out of here. Law enforcement tells us that 25-year-old tried to shoot the woman in the back but quickly realized the safety was on the gun and the firearm also needed to be loaded. So, the shooter loaded the weapon and removed the safety and shot that person in the back. Her condition is unknown. Investigators also say the attack continued for about one minute. We know this 25-year-old shot and killed five people. After that one minute rampage, it appears, according to members of law enforcement, the shooter returned to the lobby of the bank here in Downtown Louisville, where he waited about 90 seconds, a minute-and-a-half, for members of law enforcement to arrive on scene. We know, according to investigators, police were able to stop the threat by shooting and killing that 25-year-old. Chilling details.

Before that, though, the president, as you noted, speaking to reporters before he boarded Air Force One for his trip here to Belfast, weighing in for the first time publicly on that decision by a federal judge to put a hold on or potentially strike down the ability of individuals to access medicated abortion pills, saying it was completely out of bounds. Obviously, his administration has already appealed that.And also weighing in on the detention of Wall Street Journal Correspondent Evan Gershkovich, the administration has labeled him as wrongfully detained, setting up a new process to try and get his release. The president is saying on this trip, he is trying to speak with The Wall Street Journal reporter's family. But it's when the president arrives here in Belfast that you will get a good sense of what he said to reporters before he departed was his top priority, and that's maintaining the peace and really trying to build upon the 25- year-old now Good Friday Agreement. And it was an agreement that was really kind of given a curveball by the Brexit vote that occurred on a number of years ago, and what that meant for whether the hard border or trade relations between the U.K. and Ireland potentially lighting a flame for an issue that had certainly brought a level of peace and stability that had not existed before the Good Friday Agreement, but has always remained tenuous. In particular, the president is going to focus on the economic side of things. He will give a speech tomorrow at Ulster University, making a point of not meeting at the place of government, which has been stalled out over the course of the last several years repeatedly off and on as the party sharing agreement really hasn't necessarily come to fruition, but instead meeting with younger people, students trying to underscore that there are real possibilities, real efforts here underway to expand upon what was signed into law in such a historic manner 25 years ago. But as you noted, it's not just the Northern Ireland piece of this, although that will be critical, when he arrives here in Belfast. It will be those deep familial connections. You're going to hear a lot about poets, like Haney and Yates. If you listen to the president ever, you hear a lot quoting those poets. You'll also hear a lot about familial connections, whether it be the Finnegans or the Bluets (ph). This is a personal visit for the president. It's one that I think has been circled on his calendar since he took office. It's a visit he took as vice president, but one he'll be taking again. And I think you'll see that personal connection through the trips the president takes but also what the president brings from the U.S. as his role not just as somebody with Irish ancestral heritage but also somebody who wants to utilize this relationship between the two countries going forward, Sara.",

I appreciate it, live there from Belfast, Northern Ireland.All right, let's dig deeper into what exactly the Good Friday Agreement accomplished. At its core, it is a peace deal, which the U.S. helped broker to bring an end to decades of sectarian violence known then as The Troubles. The Troubles led to more than 3,500 deaths and even more casualties. Horrific terrorist attacks were carried out by members of armed groups on both sides of the divide, one of which wanted to see Northern Ireland stay within the U.K. while the other wanted to see it become part of the Republic of Ireland. The peace agreement, which was signed in 1998, set up a new government in Northern Ireland. It represented both nationalists and unionists. It acknowledges that Northern Ireland is part of the U.K. but also gives citizens the flexibility of being able to identify fully as Irish or British. While this agreement has held for decades, Brexit added a new strain. After Brexit, Northern Ireland became the only part of the U.K. to have a land border with an E.U. country, in this case, Ireland. That led to new disagreements and tensions between the two countries. But despite those concerns, the Good Friday Agreement is still in place.
