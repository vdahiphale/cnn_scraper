Is an international crime ring behind these break-ins?Good morning. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington. We begin this hour with breaking news, sources telling CNN that fingerprints found at the ambush killing of UnitedHealthcare's CEO match the suspect, Luigi Mangione. That's according to two law enforcement officials. Also new, a law enforcement source tells CNN that when Mangione was arrested, he was carrying a spiral notebook. The handwritten notes allegedly contained lists on how to facilitate a killing. The source says one chilling notebook entry uses about killing, quote, the CEO at his own bean counting conference. New images, capture Mangione munching a hash brown at the McDonald's where an employee alerted police and he was taken into custody. This is the latest mugshot of the 26-year-old suspect. He is being held in a Pennsylvania prison, where he faces five charges, including second- degree murder. He is fighting extradition back to New York and is denied bail. His anger at corporate America boiled over as he arrived for the hearing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LUIGI MANGIONE, SUSPECTED KILLER OF UNITEDHEALTHCARE CEO:  It's completely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people. It's lived experience.

The question is going to be now, what are the charges from the prosecution standpoint? And will there be some sort of defense to this case, right, some sort of whether it's psychiatric defense, was he not responsible?I mean, given who he was and the family that he came from, and the fact that he was this smart, very well-adjusted kid who was a valedictorian of his class, he was brilliant, he wasn't one of these loner recluses, you know, it clearly something has happened in his life to put him here.

What does that tell you?MARY ELLEN O'TOOLE, :  Well, I thought the outburst really was important to see. But here's what we don't know, and it's important to understand this. We really do need to know what his demeanor was like in the car as he drove up to the venue. Was he quiet? And was he calm? Or was he agitated at that point? Because the reason I say that is once he gets out of the car, does he immediately become angry and what provoked that? Was it the cameras or was it something else? So, to be able to put it in some sort of a framework, we do have to understand that because it could have been as a result of the cameras pointed at him and he wanted to get attention. It could, however, have been something else. We just don't know.",

I mean, look, it's clear that is going to be what the prosecutors say was his motive and they're going to use things like those notebooks and other things to show that as evidence. So, the prosecution is building its case right now. It's putting all the pieces together. They're going to do things like look at what his intent is, what his motive is and all the evidence that proves it was him, like the fingerprints, like the gun that they found on him. And they're going to be building his case.And so it'll be interesting -- you know, it'll be interesting to see where the opportunities are for him to defend himself, and it's looking more and more like I think he could potentially mount a psychiatric defense. You know, I think what Mary Ellen was just saying is exactly right, because the -- because, you know, was he playing to the cameras versus is he having some sort of psychiatric event happening right as we speak and I'm watching it in real time on T.V., that those are some of the things that will be come into play, I think, in this case.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Mary Ellen, I mean, you were a senior profiler with the FBI. I mean, there are a couple of aspects about Mangione that are very interesting to me. First of all, the level of sophistication in some areas, such as having a 3D printed gun, presumably mapping out an escape route, but at the same time, apparently suffered from medical issues, severe back pain and that sort of thing, talked about brain fog. I'm sure you've seen some of these details. What does all of that add up to you?O'TOOLE:  Well, I think in terms of the preparation and so forth that the gun, the ghost gun that he made and in terms of what was going on in his life, almost two separate things, but both contributed to what happened last week. But I think with the preparation, he did prepare. He thought about it. He had a to-do list. He followed it. But the important thing is he never appeared to be experienced. And by that, I mean, it never seemed as though the shooter, before we knew who he was, was an experienced assassin. So, when you're experienced, you commit the crime before, you made mistakes and you learn from them. If you're practiced, what that means is you plan for it. You read about it on the internet. You may look at some videos, but you've never done it before. So, his crime had that quality to it, which is why I think we saw as many mistakes as we did.",

I mean, he made his presence known at this McDonald's to the extent that an employee was able to call police.So, Mary Ellen, you know, I kind of wonder if he wanted to be caught at some point, if there's something in his psyche that wanted to get caught. What are your thoughts on that? O'TOOLE:  Yes, it's really good question. And I hear that all the time across the board with many different crimes. And the way I see this case, as I've reviewed it over the last week-and-a-half, is if he wanted to get caught, he could have walked into the police station and said, you got me. I did it. But instead, he continued to drop the crumbs along the way, including the backpack in the park and then got out of New York, took a bus and then disappeared somewhere in Pennsylvania and then shows up at McDonald's. None of that, absolutely none of that suggests that he wanted to turn himself in. The flipside of that behavior, however, does suggest that he wanted recognition and credit for his behavior. But it also suggests something else consistent with the writings, which is that he may not have been done.",

That's a very high burden and it's very hard to get 12 people to agree beyond a reasonable doubt on anything, right?So, one of the things -- it only takes one juror to, quote, hang jury, to cause a mistrial, and so you'd have to do it again. And so that's going to be one of the things that if I were a prosecutor on this case, I'd be very concerned about, because there is a lot of outpouring of support and sympathy for Mr. Mangione.",

That is what we saw yesterday after he met with Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska. She said that they just had a good meeting. Obviously, that is going to be something to keep a very close eye on. What do you hope to -- what do you hope to talk to Senator Collins about today?

And then we saw that they had a phone call and a subsequent meeting on Monday. And then she said on Friday night that she believed that Pete Hegseth should have a confirmation hearing, obviously opening the door that he should continue to go through this process.Now, that is not her saying she is going to ultimately support Pete Hegseth, but it is a sign that Republicans are at least wanting these nominees to go through the process. That's very different than some of the tone and tenor we saw when Matt Gaetz, who was the first pick to lead the Justice Department for Donald Trump when he was going through this process.

Have you seen, even since I was a kid, measles, mumps, rubella, all of those things? Those have kept our nation safe, the vaccines. And it's kept us safe around the world in many places.And so you think about RFK Jr., and he's such an anti-vaxxer, that's going to put us at great risk, I believe, particularly our children, who may suffer from the lifelong consequences of these terrible diseases. And so he'll be up here on Capitol Hill, but, again, I don't think he is a serious candidate. And I do want to ask you about the killing of the UnitedHealthcare CEO. Police say they found a homemade pistol and silencer in the alleged killer's backpack, a so-called ghost gun. Unfortunately, Nevada knows all too well the devastation caused by gun violence in this country. It had the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history back in 2017.
