The IDF is again urging people to head south as it expands ground operations inside Gaza. Now all this as hundreds of thousands of Israeli forces prepare for an expected incursion into the enclave in response to the Hamas massacre as of October 7th. Here's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday.

We can just about hear the tracks on some of the tanks and armored fighting vehicles that are down there right at the border, right at the Gaza fence.They're less than a mile from where we are right now. But through the night, it has been very, very intense at times, multiple missile strikes lighting up the sky, huge detonations. We've heard helicopters come in close heavy machine gunfire from those helicopters in a way that we haven't heard before along the front line here. We've heard heavy tank fire being fired out from close to here, so heavy so sustained going on for long periods of time that this building was shaking as well. We've heard multiple artillery rounds going in from artillery batteries to the north and to the south of where we are. Huge detonations from those. Flares we've seen in the sky as well. The whole indication of the whole tempo here through the night is one of continued military confrontation of this buildup of what the Prime Minister has talked about, has talked about more commanders and warfighters being inside enemy territory, that this is going to the next phase to another phase of the operation. And that's what we've been witnessing play out here through the night. Intense, very intense at times. And that the sound of the impacts, the sounds of the -- of some of the artillery and tanks firing out so strong here, it's hard to imagine just how intense that could be on the ground in Gaza.

They gathered in Tel Aviv where people held up photos of the missing and wrote messages on a giant banner joining together to call for a comprehensive deal from the government to ensure the safe return of their loved ones.But there's also a sense of growing frustration with some saying they feel left in the dark about whether a ground operation in Gaza could endanger the wellbeing of the hostages. Netanyahu has declared a new phase in the war with Hamas. He also promised that every effort would be made to retrieve the more than 200 hostages, while the ground offensive will complicate further efforts to negotiate their release. [01:05:13] So for more on all that joining me now is Michael Oren, the former Israeli ambassador to the U.S., thank you so much for joining us here. So I just want to start with what we're seeing now. Is this do you think that the start of the ground incursion? I mean, what is this next phase that we're seeing right now? MICHAEL OREN, FORMER ISRAELI AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S.: Good to be with you. Yes, it certainly is the ground incursion. It may not look at the way similar incursion has occurred in the past, say, 2014, when the army went in sort of a massive offensive. We're talking here about the American model, interestingly enough, the American model of having forces take over a neighborhood or a village and then using that neighborhood and village as a springboard for the next village and the next neighborhood. This is as the advantage of reducing the casualties on our side. Keep in mind, this is a citizens army, we're sending our children out there, our fathers, our -- in some cases, our mothers too, to fight. And we understand there's going to be a price to be paid. We want to keep that price as low as humanly possible. It also has the advantage of ramping up pressure on Hamas. And, though, you know, there's a sense that I've heard in recent days that by in launching the ground initiative, Israel would be forfeiting some of its leverage on Hamas to release the hostages. The sense tears, it's just the opposite, that if Hamas is surrounded and in desperate straits, it will keep the hostages in good shape, it will not harm them, and use them as a last bargaining chip to get out of Gaza.

I think it's just logical as the incursion increases and Hamas finds itself increasingly isolated and surrounded, then its terms for releasing the hostages will become, I think, more lenient.And the initial terms than what they initially said was they wanted an open ended ceasefire, as well as the release of all Hamas prisoners from Israeli jails. And we're talking about terrorists who have the blood of many, many hundreds of Israelis on their hands. And that would be unacceptable to Israeli society. And a ceasefire would basically being that Hamas wins, we'd get away with mass murder, and Israel would lose its deterrence power. We wouldn't be able to return our population to the south or be anywhere. We have 300,000 evacuees right now. So a ceasefire was a non-starter. So there was nothing really to negotiate in the first round. Let's see what Hamas position will be as Israeli forces increasingly or advance and surround Hamas headquarters, for example, which is located beneath the biggest hospital in Gaza. BRUNHUBER: Yes. I understand that they're saying no to a ceasefire, but there has been growing international criticism about the growing death toll of civilians in Gaza, as you say, Israel and the U.S. voted against a ceasefire. But now the U.S. calling for humanitarian pauses to allow aid in and U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals out, can the U.S. convince Israel that a pause is necessary?",

And the thing that Hamas would have to give would be to allow the Red Cross to visit the hostages.I'm visiting hostage families every day, the great pain is they have no idea many of them, whether the loved ones are actually in captivity, or what their situations if they know. And we're talking about 222 families here. So that would be certainly a quid pro quo. Let's -- let us learn the identities of the hostages and their physical wellbeing that they're OK.",

Starlink provides internet service through satellites. But Israel is resisting the idea. It's communications minister posted that Hamas would use the service for terrorist activities.

A glaring promise of more death and destruction. The ongoing siege and a communications blackout, plunging Gaza into eerie silence. What little video has emerged so far, paints a picture of the devastation wrought by Israel's relentless bombardment. Scenes of incomprehensible loss, shrouded bodies, the latest amongst thousands of victims. Israel says it is targeted Hamas now also expanding its ground operations. A retaliation they say to the Hamas terror attacks of October 7th, which left at least 1,400 dead and more than 200 others held hostage inside Gaza. But in the besieged strip of land, the number of Palestinians killed also rises with each and every airstrike. The situation here is dire. Our homes were destroyed in the airstrikes. Six of our family members were killed. What can we do? We are all living through this. This was the scene on Friday at the Al-Shifa Hospital, the largest in Gaza. Now not only a lifeline to thousands of patients, but a sanctuary to tens of thousands including children displaced by the war. We're not even asking for food. We're not asking for water. We're asking for safety, for security. Our men, women, our children, they've all been killed. Many have come in the hope that hospitals will remain a safe haven.
