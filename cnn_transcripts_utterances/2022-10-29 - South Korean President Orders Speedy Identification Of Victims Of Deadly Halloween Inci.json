And I have to tell you, some of the images we're going to show you, they are very disturbing. Almost 150 people were killed while out partying in the capital Seoul. The crowd got out of control and many young people in costumes were apparently crushed and couldn't breathe. And we've just learned one American is among the injured. Investigators are trying to figure out what set off this terrible turn of events. The South Korean president has ordered emergency workers to quickly identify the victims for the sake of those families waking up who still haven't heard from their loved ones. Our Will Ripley has been covering this disaster all night in Seoul where it is now 8:00 a.m. I mean, Will, these were just people who were out trying to have a good time for Halloween, dressed up in their costumes. And now this. I just mentioned many of the victims of this disaster still haven't been identified. So hard to imagine what those families are going through right now.",

Sunlen, first to you, what are you hearing from lawmakers about this attack? SUNLEN SERFATY, CNN WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Certainly, Pam, we have seen bipartisan condemnation of this attack. And initially from both Republicans and Democrats. We're hearing of course their sympathies to the Pelosi family as Paul Pelosi recovers in the hospital and outrage over the extent of the violence. But as people have had now about 24 hours since this happened plus, you know, they're taking a big-picture look and saying let's take a step back, take stock of this political moment, our political climate, what's going on. And essentially saying, what does it mean for America that we are in this spot right now? And we heard that a lot today from candidates and lawmakers who are out stumping on the campaign trail. And I think that people noting that this sort of dangerous rhetoric, potentially, has a potential for even more harm going forward to people. I think Steny Hoyer, who's the House majority leader, said it really bluntly. He said, this is a dangerous time in America. It's up to us to save America. Save us from the hate and division that's going on. And of course he made a point that we are going into midterm elections next week.

Violence or threats of violence has no place in our society. What happened to Paul Pelosi was wrong. I reached out to the speaker, I called her, I know she was on a plane coming back to California.

First of all, we want to stop unnecessary spending because I believe that's what's led to a lot of the inflation is, you know, we've had stimulus in the name of COVID. We've had extended unemployment. We had the PPP loan program, which I believe contributed to inflation. There's a lot of government spending with the Inflation Reduction Act, which I believe really increased inflation.Just too much government spending. So the Republicans are going to have to get unnecessary spending under control. And secondly, we've got to reverse course on our energy policy. I believe that the Biden energy policy is kind of a model of what the Green New Deal would look like. It's, you know, turned a -- we frowned on drilling. We need to get out of the way. The government needs to get out of the way of our American energy industry. We need to let the energy industry do what it does best, and that's produce energy. We can be energy independent in the United States. We shouldn't have to go to the OPEC and beg for more oil. We can produce the oil in the United States. And I believe right now the policies of this administration have led to higher gas prices, which contributes to inflation. Now we've got a potential shortage of diesel. That could not only increase inflation, but also lead to more challenges with the supply chain shortages. So we've got a lot of challenges in our economy.

Then it will be the Republicans' opportunity to govern.And we're going to have to govern, and we're going to have to fix some of these problems. We can't just talk about it. We're going to have to actually do something about it. And I think getting spending under control and trying to reverse our energy policies, obviously we want to secure the border. We think that's created a lot of problems with respect to crime and drugs in the United States.

Behind that is being Jewish, and I kind of didn't think about the importance of it until I got here.And so he takes it seriously when it comes to cultural leadership -- leadership having to do with his faith, but most importantly, now because of the rise in antisemitism in America, you heard him talking about it, speaking out, and he did just for example, last week, he put out a statement after the Kanye West supporters unfurled a hateful banner over the 405, a freeway, in his adopted hometown in Los Angeles. So it's actually, it's not unlike what we're seeing today and hearing today with Paul Pelosi, it's a different -- maybe a different flavor of hate, a different target, Jews versus politicians, but it is all the same notion of people being stirred up, people being angry, and people in many cases being lied to.
