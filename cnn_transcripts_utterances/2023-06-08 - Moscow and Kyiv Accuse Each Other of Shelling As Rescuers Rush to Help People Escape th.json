Tonight, Moscow and Kyiv accuse each other of shelling as rescuersrush to help people escape the flooding from a massive dam collapse. Innocent victims after a brazen knife attack in a playground in France. We have new details this hour about the suspect. And it is very hard to breathe, it seems. Smoky skies that millions of Americans across the northeast staying indoors. But first, this evening, U.S. President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak are about to speak from the White House. We will bring you, of course, that live when it happens. It's meant to start about half an hour ago, but we're keeping our eyes peeled, as you can imagine. These are live images coming to us from the White House. You've got a lot of people sitting there, waiting. But I've been told, not all the seats are full, so perhaps we have to wait a tiny bit longer. Now, Mr. Sunak, as you may know is on a two-day trip to Washington, he's trying to deepen economic ties between the two countries more than three years, of course, after Brexit. Russia's war on Ukraine is also at the top of the agenda, as well as artificial intelligence and the climate emergency. The two leaders met in the Oval Office a few hours ago and touched on the special relationship. Have a listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But on the Ukrainian side, the international community, The HALO Trust, other organizations, have been very carefully mapping and de-mining the huge amounts of mines left behind by the Russian occupation. Many of them along the riverbanks itself. They are being now washed around. We've seen detonations underwater of these mines, some of them are anti- tank mines, so they're quite difficult to detonate, but equally very devastating when they do. Anti-personnel mines, of course, mingled up with them. A really chaotic situation making rescue harder, particularly, when the Russians, even though they have also been inundated on their side, have some defense in-depth as the military would call it. They've got artillery positions still capable of attacking the rescuers, the people afflicted by the flooding on the Ukrainian-controlled side of the dam, and then, of course, longer term, you've got the ecological consequences of this flood. And all of this happening at a time when the Ukrainians are increasing their shaping operations as part of their ongoing efforts to ramp-up the attacks against Russia, ahead or as part of this much wanted counteroffensive, Isa.",

That, of course, held by the Russians, and south of that frontline, the great prize of Crimea, which the Ukrainians want to be able to liberate from the Russians after they captured it in 2014. We've been seeing regular company size, a 100, 150 men, sometimes smaller, probing attacks, reconnaissance by force. A Ukrainian officer that I spoke to earlier on today described it probing the Russian lines, testing their reactions, of course, taking casualties too. They are meeting significant resistance. The Russians know that is a favored line of advance for the Ukrainians and have very significant defensive capabilities in that area. And that's what the Ukrainians are trying to test and probe and feel for any weak spots. And at the same time, we also know from not only the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, but also our own sources also on the ground, south of Bakhmut that the Ukrainians have made some significant progress, capturing up to about 3 kilometers of territory south of that city or re-capturing territory that they lost to Russian advances earlier on in this year. So, these are very dynamic frontlines. All of it, a kind of game would be an ugly term for what is such a brutal conflict. But probing one another, trying to find weak spots and with the possibility of greater levels of offensive, certainly from the Ukrainians down the line. But also, of course, destabilizing the Russian lines is very much part of what the Ukrainian campaign is all about. Keeping the Ukrainians guessing -- they're right now keeping the Russians guessing, rather. Right now, they want the Russians to guess whether or not their main effort will be on that Zaporizhzhia frontline, for example.",

In talks with the Ukraine and Ukrainians and particularly with Zelenskyy and our allies and partners, on commitments to Ukraine, long-term security, long-term security to deter future aggression after this war ends is the goal. And we're advancing this goal by providing them the support Ukraine needs now on the battlefield and helping them strengthen their military over the long term. The fact of the matter is that I believe we'll have the funding necessary to support Ukraine as long as it takes. And I believe that we're going to - - that that support will be real, even though there are -- you hear some voices today on Capitol Hill about whether or not we should continue to support Ukraine and for how long we should support them. The fact of the matter is I asked people to picture what would happen if we were not supporting Ukraine. Do we think Russia would stop in Kyiv? Do you think that's all there would be happening?

And it's also clear, though, that it does pose very real risks that we, as leaders, need to be cognizant of and put in place the guardrails to mitigate against. Actually, President Biden and I had a very good conversation on this just a couple of weeks ago in Japan in one of our sessions in Hiroshima. And we are aligned in wanting to discuss with other countries what those guardrails should be. I think here in the U.S., you've convened all the companies together recently, we've done the same in Downing Street just a couple of weeks ago. And I think there are a series of measures that we can implement working cooperatively, as we have been discussing, that will ensure that we can enjoy the benefits of this technology whilst mitigating against their risks. That's what our citizens would expect. And you talk about climate change. You know, we come together at COP to work multilaterally across multiple countries to bring down carbon emissions, to get funding to the countries that need it, to share research on how we can develop the green technologies of the future. Indeed, that's part of our conversations and agreement today, that we need to bring that same spirit of urgency, I think, to the challenges and opportunities that AI poses, because the pace of the technological change is faster than people had anticipated. And I think the letter that you mentioned kind of reminded us that we do need to work urgently to address this issue.

Number two, cooperating on data and AI, it is a limitless capacity and possibility. We -- but we have to do it with great care, not relative to one another but relative to the issue. Because when I convened the leaders in AI about I think there were 13 here in the United States, the very architects of this AI. They're also very concerned about it getting out of hand, and we got to make sure we're all on the same page. And we're looking to Great Britain to lead that effort this fall in putting together a proposal, a group of nations to deal with how do we deal with this. It not only has the potential to cure cancer and many other things that are just beyond our comprehension, but it has the potential to do great damage if it's not controlled.

And we're also addressing the national security risk posed by certain types of outbound investments. I had a discussion with Xi Jinping in China, why was I not transferring certain technological capabilities?

So what we're trying to do is figure out how together we can make sure that we have the -- let me back up and say it this way, I don't think ever in the history of human endeavor has there been as fundamental potential technological change as is presented by artificial intelligence. It is staggering. It is staggering. You have some of these leaders in the industry talking about how they're concerned whether a machine will be able to begin to think for itself, not need to be programmed. I mean, it's just -- I know it sounds like science fiction, but it is close to science fiction, some of the things. It has enormous potential. And we're looking to Great Britain to help lead that effort, to figure out a way through this.

But the bottom line was this, that the fundamental changes taking place in terms of international trade, nobody in at least very few people in United States, and I suspect around the world, knew what a supply chain meant, what they're talking about, the supply chain. When we found out during the pandemic that the reason why we couldn't build automobiles was because the outfit that we got our semiconductors from in Southeast Asia had shut down because of the pandemic, we realized that I decided that no longer would we rely on one center of support for any of the things that are needed for our economic growth. And I made it clear to all our NATO Allies and our partners, as well, that although we were going to generate a for example, an AI capacity here, I mean, excuse me, a semiconductor capacity here in the United States, attracting literally several hundred billion dollars in investment, that that was available to all of our all of our allies, all of our friends. And they're investing as they -- as we are and benefiting in a similar way. The bottom line here for me is that I think that the world is changing in a way that globalization is still real. But the measure of what we used to call in the United States trickle-down economics, where if the -- trickle- down economics resulted in Democratic and Republican administrations for generations in making sure we found the cheapest labor in the world, sent the product to -- sent the work to those -- to that neighbor or those neighbors who have the cheapest labor, and they send back their products. Well, I'm not doing that anymore. We're going to make sure that we, in fact, have a flip of that. We're sending capacity, here in the United States, we're attracting capacity to build here in the United States to send product overseas, not the reverse. And I know it sounds simplistic, but it's working so far. And it's not going to hurt any of our allies or friends in terms of the trade piece of this. Matter of fact, I'm finding they're benefiting from it as well, because they're engaging in it with us. And at home they're doing similar things. So that's why we talked about the need to have relationships in terms of certain materials the battery technologies, to share. We rely on Great Britain to produce a lot of that for us. So it is increasing trade. But right now it looks like it is because the United States is doing so incredibly well, it makes it looks like it's only the United States. It's not. It's just a change in direction in terms of how we view generating economic growth.",

That's what we declared together with our G7 partners just a few weeks ago in Hiroshima. This is a President and an administration that is completely attuned to the needs and concerns of its allies on these issues. And you can see that. Today, as the President said, we are launching negotiations between the U.K. and the U.S. on a critical minerals agreement so that the U.S. can provide us with that interaction and cooperation we need. And the Atlantic Declaration that we've announced today just talks about strengthening, deepening our cooperation. It's not about looking in and being protection, it's about the exact opposite of that. And it's about strengthening that cooperation across the full spectrum of economic, technological, and other spheres. And that's what you will see. You'll see that from the President. You'll see it from me. You'll see the U.K. and the U.S. working even more closely together on all the big economic issues of our time, because that's what the moment demands, and that's what our citizens need us to do. And that's what the President and I plan to deliver.",
