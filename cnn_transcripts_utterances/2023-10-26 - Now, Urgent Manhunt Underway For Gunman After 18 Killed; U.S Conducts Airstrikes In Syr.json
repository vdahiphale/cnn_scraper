      "sentences": "Hello. I'm Abby Phillip. Our breaking news coverage continues tonight of the urgent manhunt that is underway right now in the state of Maine for the suspect who is accused of killing at least 18 people at a bowling alley and at a restaurant.As many of the victims injured fight for their lives tonight for the past three hours, the FBI has been outside of Robert Card, the suspect's home, shouting commands. The home has already been searched today, but apparently there was some activity that was noticed that prompted those teams to return and surround the place. Now, at this very moment, it's still not clear if anyone was inside of that home or what the activity was aimed at. But what we do know is that the suspect is an Army reservist who knows survival techniques. We also know that his home is on hundreds of acres of land and woods. Now, I'm about to speak live with the Lewiston mayor on everything that has transpired right now for his community. But, first, I want to get straight to the ground with CNN's Brian Todd, who is outside of Robert Card's home in Bowdoin, Maine. Brian, quite a few last few hours of activity and you were there for so much of it. They were surrounding this home tonight with armored vehicles and drones on the scene. Walk us through what's happening right now and what led us to this point.",

A law enforcement officer came up to us a short time ago and said this is no longer a scene.But we can tell you, as you've been explaining over the last couple of minutes, it really was a scene for the last three hours, starting at about 7:00 P.M. Eastern time when law enforcement assets just flooded the zone here and surrounded Robert Card's home behind me, about 250 yards behind me, with a lot of tactical vehicles, armored vehicles, personnel, air assets like drones and other things. They had a K-9 team here. They surrounded the house. At that point, they came up to our cameras here at this position and said, you've got to cut your camera lights off because the camera lights are creating a danger for law enforcement. So, at that point, we, of course, cut our lights off and we filmed for the next two and a half hours in complete darkness. But we did get a pretty good view of everything that was going on. At one point, after we had turned our lights off and they surrounded the house, they moved a tactical vehicle pretty close to the house. Then they moved a spotlight onto the house. At that point, they began kind of a one-way dialogue. And we were told later on that it was unknown if the suspect was in the house or not. But they began a one-way dialogue. A law enforcement officer on a loudspeaker was saying things like, come out with your hands up. We don't want anyone else to get hurt. Please come out and follow our instructions. Walk to the front of the truck, indicating there was some kind of a truck in the driveway. And he even spoke on a personal level, saying we know this could be intimidating to you. We really just don't want anyone to get hurt. So, please come out and talk to us. That was a one-way dialogue. There was no indication that there was anyone on the other end conversing with them. But they did move around a lot. They positioned, again, their drones, their spotlights, all around the house, seemingly looking for something. We did get the impression when there was that dialogue going on, Abby, that this was possibly a standoff. It turns out it very likely was not a standoff. And, again, they've extracted from here. It is the second time they showed up today because a couple of hours before they came in with this latest influx, they had other law enforcement personnel here who kind of approached the house using flash bangs and calling out, FBI, come out. So, they did that and then processed the scene there and then left and came back and kind of did what I just described. So, kind of a dramatic night out here, and what they got out of it, we don't know. We don't know if they got some information. Maybe they got some kind of indication that he was not there or something else. But it was a pretty tense couple of hours.",

Back when I was on the SWAT team in New York, things were much more -- we were much more inclined to use what we call dynamic entries. Those are flash bangs, you rush in quickly, you try to overwhelm the occupants of the space and take everybody into custody quickly. Now, they try to mitigate as much risk as possible.So, what you'll see, what we saw here tonight, what you often see outside of residences where they're trying to arrest someone who is thought to be armed and dangerous, a large team will pull up, armored vehicles, loudspeakers, and they call people out of the residence. There's no rush. If you don't believe there's any hostages inside, there's no people whose lives are at risk, you have the luxury of time.

Eisenhower to the Eastern Med. And then there's also the Baton Amphibious Ready group.So, the U.S. very aware of how easily this could spiral, especially given all the tension and all the focus on the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, aware of all the sensitivities around that, the public sentiment in many of the Arab nations around the region. And that's why they're trying to essentially deter any other actors from getting involved. They have clearly called out Hezbollah in Lebanon multiple times as well as sending pretty much a stark warning to some of these groups in Iraq and Syria that might try to get involved or try to target U.S. forces. So, that's the purpose there to try to prevent that from happening. But because of the links there and because of the tension throughout the region, the U.S. very well aware that perhaps it can't keep this solely confined to Gaza. It is worth noting that in Austin's statement, he says that the U.S. response is not linked in any way to the fighting in Gaza, trying to keep the back and forth between the U.S. and these Iranian-backed groups in Iraq and Syria as a separate entity or a separate situation from what's going on in Israel and Gaza.

And so all of this put together paints a picture of someone who has skills from the military and knows how to operate in the outdoors. And then you also have the mental health component here. We spoke to his sister-in-law, Kelly O'Neill (ph), who told us that he had showed no signs of mental health issues and that this was an acute mental health episode that he had over the summer where we know now, according to our sources, that he was hearing voices, that he had thoughts of wanting to harm his fellow soldiers and shooting up a base. He was admitted to a mental health clinic then and he was released after only a couple of weeks.

What you're seeing is a person who had lived a normal life in a normalway for a long time. And then you see a series of stressors. You see the mental health crisis he comes into in the summer, where he's hearing voices. Another family member told \"The Daily Beast\" that he bought powerful hearing aids because he thought people were talking about him and when he wore those, he could hear people, you know, criticizing him. So, there's a touch of paranoia, if you accept that story, working in there. Then you see the loss of a job. That's stressor number one, the mental health issues. Stressor number two, the loss of a job. Stressor number three, and a critical one, is the loss of a key relationship. The woman he was involved with leaves, and now he is without work, without a girlfriend, suffering from these other issues. And you know, some people, when they suffer from anxiety, paranoia, depression, can internalize. They might seek help, or they might take their own lives. Others will externalize. I think that's what we're looking at here. And as Pamela said, they're going to have to look backwards and say, what was the determination they made based on that let him leave the hospital that didn't show other people that he was heading for trouble, especially people who knew he had weapons? But you know, this is a thing. Looking back, all those things are very clear. The signs that people can report that they would move forward to authorities with, have to be the kinds of things that were knowable to them at the time. A lot of this was going on inside him.",
