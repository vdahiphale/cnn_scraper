We have excerpts from her speech revealing how she will make the case against Donald Trump at the same spot where he told supporters to fight like hell, his words, back on January 6th.Also tonight, former President Trump is getting ready to rally voters in a Pennsylvania city with a very large Latino population, this just hours after he defended his Madison Square Garden rally filled with racist and hateful rhetoric, calling it, and I'm quoting him now, a love fest. Plus, CNN's exclusive new polling shows Harris and Trump are virtually tied in the crucial swing states of Nevada and Arizona. CNN's John King will join us live from Nevada as he hits five battleground states in five days. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. The final one week dash to Election Day is now underway and there's breaking news coming out of both presidential campaigns. We have information about what Kamala Harris will say when she delivers a major speech here in Washington, D.C., tonight. We're also standing by for Donald Trump's rally in battleground Pennsylvania. CNN's Kristen Holmes is awaiting Trump's remarks in Allentown. But first, let's go to CNN's Priscilla Alvarez. She's over at The Ellipse up on the Washington Mall, the site of tonight's Harris D.C. event. Priscilla, we now have excerpts, I take it, from the vice president's closing argument to voters.",

We're now getting some of those excerpts. Let me read one of them to you. It says, Donald Trump intends to use the United States military against American citizens who simply disagree with him, people he calls enemy from within. It goes on to say, this is not a candidate for president who is thinking about how to make your life better.Now, of course, in some ways, this is an extension of what she has been saying on the campaign trail, that she is focused on the American people, where the former president is consumed by plotting revenge. But the venue is notable. She's doing it here at The Ellipse. Harris advisers say they wanted to convey the gravity of the moment, of course, at a place where former president Donald Trump delivered that fiery speech on January 6, 2021 when his supporters went on to storm the U.S. Capitol. But she is also doing it in front of the White House, only 500 yards from the Oval Office. So, she's also trying to have voters visualize the candidate that they want for office. And to that end, advisers tell me that she is going to present her vision on policies and proposals, be it the economy, immigration, health care, reproductive rights, and try to capitalize on that forward-looking optimism that her campaign has tried to project from the very beginning. And the intention, Wolf, according to advisers I've spoken with, is to reach those undecided voters, to reach those disaffected Republicans or voters who are simply voters on the fence. This may be her last major opportunity to speak to those here at the Capitol, but also tuning in. They realized that they want to reach those voters that they think could still support her. Wolf?",

He was talked to by a supporter who said that she was a Puerto Rican voter, that she and the Puerto Rican community stood behind her, and Trump responded by praising himself and his actions with Puerto Rico. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: We helped you through a lot of bad storms, I'll tell you. We had some really bad ones. No president has done more for Puerto Rico than I have. (END VIDEO CLIP) [18:05:00] HOLMES: Clearly, they're not addressing that joke that, again, just to remind everyone, was that Puerto Rico is a floating island of garbage.

We have heard from Puerto Rican community leaders who say they want to hear from Donald Trump, whether it's an apology, whether it's a condemnation of those remarks, anything. So, this would be the opportunity for him to do so. Now, the campaign is clearly trying to project confidence on the ground here tonight. They are passing out signs that say Barriques (ph) for Donald Trump. That is somebody of Puerto Rican descent. They're giving those out to the crowd here in Allentown, a reminder that there are about 35,000-plus Puerto Rican voters just in this area alone. Pennsylvania as a whole has more than 400,000 Puerto Rican voters, so this is a very critical voting bloc for Donald Trump.",

Unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe people who disagree with me are the enemy. He wants to put them in jail. I'll give them a seat at the table. So, what do you think the contrast between her and Donald Trump? How effective do you think this speech that's upcoming very soon will be? LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: I think this is the speech that she's been wanting to make. It is her appeal to people to come out and vote for her. I don't know that there's many undecided people yet, persuadable people, but it is about getting people to come out and actually cast a ballot. It has only been helped by the last 48 hours since Donald Trump's rather catastrophic event in New York City that he describes as a love fest, which everybody else saw as incredibly damaging. And so I think at this point, the visuals are going to be very strong. She wants to remind people what happened on January 6th without having to explicitly say it. And everything that has happened over the last 48 hours again has really reminded people that Donald Trump brings a lot of chaos with him.",

And one of the things I think is a theory that's taking place right now among this campaign is that in the last week or two, you really have a chance for voters to pay a lot of attention. And in those moments, that's when you can really convey some of the negatives that we've been talking about, about Donald Trump. And right now, he's living the negatives.It's not just about the words that are coming out of his mouth, it's about what's actually happening, right? So, it's chaos, it's coarse, it's invective, it's cruelty toward people. Do you really want to go back to that or do you want to turn the page where Kamala Harris is talking about what she wants to do for people in homeownership and entrepreneurship, but she's also having these big rallies where people are sort of having fun. It looks like America. It's diverse. A lot of people are coming together, Republicans and Democrats and young and old. It's about living that. So, I'm an old comms guy. We focus on pictures.

I don't think we're going to see him on the stage.

And here in Nevada, we are told that it had reverberated instantly, blew up on social media.I just want to show you something. Look first at the Latino population in the United States of America. We'll bring it up on the map for you here. You see, the deeper the shading, the higher the population of Latinos in those communities. So, where am I today? I'm in Nevada. Specifically, I'm in Las Vegas, which is Clark County, Nevada, down here. This is our third trip here in the last 11 months to meet with voters to talk about the election. I want you to listen here. First voter is Antonio Munoz. He's a veteran, a retired police officer, who now has a taco bar and a catering business. And then Rafael Cerros, Jr., he runs a Spanish language radio station here in Nevada. Both say the weekend event has changed the climate. They believe in a way that will help Harris.

Remember the late Senator Harry Reid was a partner with the culinary union in a remarkable Democratic infrastructure here. We have a new Republican governor, though, here in this state who won in the midterm elections. He's relatively popular.

He came and did a demeaning and degrading stunt and fell short of a lot of the promises that he made. But more than that, if you just look at working class Latinos who were looking, again, to make their families succeed, he passed a tax plan that everybody from The Wall Street Journal to The New York Times who's done an analysis of Trump's major signature bills, he shifted money away from working families towards the wealthy.Well, Kamala Harris clearly has a plan with the expansion of the child tax credit, the expansion of the earned income tax credit, with helping new businesses and entrepreneurs with a 10x times the kind of tax expenses that they'll be able to write off. There are so many things that will help working families, Latinos, entrepreneurs, and others. So, to me, this is a plain contrast. But there's nothing worse. I just never thought I would see in my life as an American, a president of the United States, and I've seen from George Bush and Reagan to Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, none of them would have ever brought to the White House this kind of hate and bigotry towards other Americans and their countries of origin. Remember, Donald Trump talked about, excuse my language, shithole countries. Donald Trump has demeaned and degraded women. And Donald Trump in that rally in Madison Square Garden with people that his campaign selected brought folks who stood up there and talked down to other Americans, in this case, Puerto Ricans, who use racial slurs against African-Americans and who were so painfully misogynistic towards women. This really is unbecoming of any of our presidents of the last 50 years and something we should not -- all of us as Americans should not tolerate in our elected leaders and most certainly not in the leader of our nation.",

But timing is everything and Bezos admits that he had poor timing here by announcing this decision right on the eve of the presidential election. It was just about a month ago that \"The Post\" made an endorsement in the Senate race in Maryland against Larry Hogan as a matter of fact. So, 'The Post\" has been doing this for years.

So they've been focused on hiring really top-notch lawyers and also trying to resolve some of these questions before the election, which is why we've seen them intervene and over 130 different lawsuits, including some of the ones that are pending before the Supreme Court. Now, both sides have really put in place these really experienced lawyers, but they're working also with a network of lawyers at the state level. So if there is an issue in a state, they'll have this network to tap, folks with local jurisdictional expertise who can help them do whatever they need to do. They've also worked through sort of war games, different prince scenarios. For example, Republicans war-gamed natural disasters and how those could potentially impact voting. So when they saw what happened in Florida and North Carolina, they said, wow, we practiced this. Then, the Democrats, they've actually drafted thousands of pages of pleading, so they're going to be ready to just scoot off to the courthouse and file those if they need to. Now, in terms of the teams the Democrats, their team is led by former White House counsel, Dana Remus. They also have Marc Elias. He's, of course, a renowned election expert, real expertise in recounts. Now on the Trump side, they're working with a couple of veterans GOP lawyers included David Warrington, who represented Trump around January 6, and the House investigation. But it's interesting. If you look at our most recent poll, only 30 percent of Americans think if Trump loses, he will accept the results. So the reason this legal war gaming is so important is that if he does not want to accept the results, this lays the groundwork for him to challenge those results and even if he's not successful, these kinds of legal challenges also helped to sow doubt and confusion about the outcome.",
