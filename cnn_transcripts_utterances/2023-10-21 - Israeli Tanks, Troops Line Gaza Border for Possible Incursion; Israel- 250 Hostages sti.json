      "sentences": "Welcome to our continuing coverage of Israel at war. I'm Anderson Cooper in Tel Aviv tonight alongside John Berman in New York. I want to show you some new videos CNN has just received, shows Israeli tanks and military personnel near the border with Gaza.Today, the Head of Israel's Armed Forces told his commanders and \"we'll enter the Gaza Strip\". The IDF also announced it would increase airstrikes. Its spokesman said the military is now focusing on its readiness for \"the next stage\". And then there's CNN's team on the ground here saw dozens of tanks and armored personnel carriers and even bulldozers along the border with Gaza. Exactly the sort of equipment one might expect to see during a possible ground operation. This was just one of several areas where our team saw scenes like this altogether, CNN saw hundreds of tanks and armored vehicles. Sources tell CNN that the U.S. and its allies had been urging Israel to set clear goals about if and when it launches a ground assault on Gaza. President Biden was asked today whether he was encouraging Israelis to delay a possible invasion, his only response was to say, \"I'm talking to the Israelis\". These developments come after a shipment of aid carrying food, water and medical supplies was finally allowed to cross into Southern Gaza from Egypt. No fuel was allowed. Israel says Hamas could use that fuel in its war. Gazan officials say it is needed for schools and hospitals. The Head of the World Health Organization said the aid is not nearly enough, and those hospitals are already at their breaking point. We're going to have more on all this. Plus, the President's phone call today with the American hostages released by Hamas, but first wants to get the latest from the ground. Nic Robertson is in Sderot, Israel for us tonight. What is the latest that you're seeing, Nic? NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Yes, there is an uptick in airstrikes and artillery strikes on Gaza this evening. And we saw it in the afternoon as well in the northern end of Gaza that we have a good view of from here. And that certainly does fit with what the IDF are saying that they are going to have more strikes, and that is to protect troops on the ground. But it gives no indication of when an incursion might come. And we spent the day going along the Eastern border of Gaza trying to sort of compare and contrast what we've seen along that border over the past number of days or so that sort of amount of energy and that level of troops that were rushing to the border and the groupings of tanks we've seen earlier in the week where they were repairing their tracks at the side of the road. And you've got this sense of a surge of momentum towards that border with Gaza. We're not seeing that, partly because some units may have either move forward closer to Gaza. And we can't get there because security is tighter in that sort of militarized border zone region. So we don't have access, or perhaps some of them have gone back to base. There are still large areas where we're seeing armored personnel carriers and tanks lined up in fields near some of the military bases a little bit deeper inside of Israel. They don't have troops with them yet. They don't look like they're ready to go into the fight. But it does indicate a depth of reserves of military fighting equipment that Israel may need once an incursion if and when that incursion gets underway. But you know, I think what I'm trying to say here, Anderson is that it is very hard to make an assessment of the readiness of Israeli troops close to the border. But in terms of airstrikes, yes, we can hear them. There are flashes behind us this evening. You can hear the detonations and explosions in Northern Gaza.",

This is incredibly difficult work. They've gotten together the numbers, they've talked to family members, they know, who's missing.

And CNN's analysis effectively suggests that this blast at this hospital inside the Gaza Strip was caused by a rocket launched from Gaza a rocket that appears to have broken up mid-air. And then at least part of that rocket fell down on that parking lot outside the hospital, causing the explosion that has killed hundreds of people over there. Now these weapons and explosives experts who CNN spoke with, they all agree that this is the most likely scenario. Now at the same time, a definitive conclusion on this simply can't be reached without recovering physical evidence from the site, which is very difficult given the limited access that journalists have to the Gaza Strip and also the fact that that territory is indeed controlled by Hamas. Now, I want to take you through two key moments here, because one of them is from this live broadcast that was being broadcast on Al Jazeera, where you can see the rockets that were being fired around the same time as this blast occurred. One of those rockets appears to burn out in the sky before crashing into the area where the hospital is. The second piece of evidence, Anderson is the crater. And this is a key piece of evidence that the Israeli Defense Forces have also pointed to, as they tried to make the initial claim that this was not them that this was caused by a rocket fired by Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The crater that was caused by this explosion was three by three feet wide, about one foot deep. And all of the experts that CNN spoke to agreed that this is not consistent with the kind of crater that you would see from a bomb that would be dropped from an aircraft. And they also said that it is not consistent with any kind of artillery fire on that kind of a position. Now, all of this doesn't change the fact that Palestinian officials continue to insist that Israel is responsible for the strike. Israel, of course, denies that and has pointed to this very same rocket scenario. What it also doesn't change is the anger, the eruption of anger that this hospital blasts has caused in the Arab world, in the Middle East. We have watched these protests over the last couple of days at U.S. embassies and Israeli embassies in the region. And ultimately, you know, the majority of this hospital blasts has really become quite a touch point, Anderson.

And what kind of answer would unleash hell across the Middle East? They even are pointing out to the fact that they themselves warn both the Israelis and the Americans that absent a political solution, not only for Gaza, but for the West Bank. King Abdullah has been pleading with the international community to stop the settlement and the annexation, subjugation of Palestinians for a long time. And especially he's been pleading during to not overrode the status of the religious sites, that Aqsa Mosque, or even the churches in Jerusalem, they've been under attack. So they're looking at what's happening. And they said, we told you this is going to happen. Can you please put on the table something other than not only you can answer it, but something else that is not, you know, carpet bombing of civilians, basically using the food. I mean, what they're worried about is the use of food and water as a weapon of war, starvation as a weapon of war.",

I think there's certainly going to go after Hamas infrastructure, after Hamas fighters, after Hamas leadership, trying to break their grip on the Gaza Strip. I think the big question is what happens next, who takes control the Gaza Strip after the invasion?There is no good answer to that. And I think it is important that Israel should make concessions to the Palestinian Authority, they should bolster the Palestinian Authority. And I think, you know, a lot of the things that really says are absolutely correct, but and I think it has been a tragic mistake for Israel not to do more for the peace process for the two state solution. The things they've been doing, the creeping annexation of the West Bank is terrible. But let's keep this in perspective, John. Hamas is not interested in a two state solution. They are not going to be mollified with Israeli concessions. Their goal is genocide. Their goal is the eradication the State of Israel. That's why Israel has to fight Hamas. But at the same time, Israel needs to do a much better job of making concessions to the Palestinian Authority than working with a moderate Palestinians. Because what Hamas offers is a horrible deal not only for Israelis, but for Palestinians as well.",

The Americans has the same goal with basically the Taliban, the Taliban is back in power. It's easy to say, I'm going to do this.And I am no way defending what these people did. What I'm saying it's easy to in a situation where we see that settlements are increasing the professed goal by the Israeli government themselves. And we saw it on television, that it's not only Hamas, they're going after. They're going after civilians, they're telling us this in words and deeds even you know, Bibi Netanyahu, the President of Israel, Hertzog soldier after soldier. So with Arab, you know, population 400 million people are hearing we don't care about Palestinian lives and that will create for America will jeopardize America's national security. This is not anymore seen as a war on Hamas, this scene whether we want Americans to hear it or not, they have to hear it now and intervene now and pressure Israel now because what they're hearing this is an American war. They're giving 14 billion to the Americans to basically bomb you know, Gaza to oblivion, and they're doing nothing to even rain the settlers. Even rain you know, or even stop the settlement or even help the Palestinians in the West Bank, where in Hamas doesn't exist from being killed day after day after day. And I think they are seeing also the use of water and food as a weapon of war, starving a population all of them as a collective punishment and this will radicalize a generation of not only Palestinians of Arabs and Muslims.",

But officials are saying that they're hopeful that this is the start of something more sustained, more continuous.The U.N. believes in hopes that potentially tomorrow or on Monday that more of their trucks could go through today those 20 trucks were Egyptian Red Crescent trucks they drove through the Rafah border crossing. They unloaded that aid, which was food, water, medicine. Palestinian trucks then loaded the aid and drove it through to the Gaza side. Now there's a meeting today of Arab leaders here in Cairo. It's called a conference of peace. President Sisi, the Egyptian President spoke in the last hour or so he said, this is a welcome sign. But it's not enough. We need to build on this and establish a sustained humanitarian corridor. We need a humanitarian ceasefire as well. And beyond that, we need to work on establishing some kind of a peace process a two state solution so quite a long list of things that need to happen. Right now there seems to be consensus, at least on that first step of trying to establish a more continuous or sustained humanitarian corridors. The hospitals at this stage are barely functioning. The fuel supplies according to one U.N. person who I was speaking to will be out or depleted in two or three days. So that is a vital resource that is desperately needed, and negotiations ongoing to try to get at least 100 trucks in every single day in what would be the beginning of a continuous corridor and hopefully eventually also, the establishment as the Israelis had previously mentioned. And also President Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have some kind of humanitarian zone where some of the 900,000 displaced people inside Gaza could find some refuge and some respite. We are still though a long way from that.",
