I'mZain Asher in New York and this is CNN's continuing coverage of the Israel- Hamas war. Good evening. Tonight, dozens of people killed and injured after an Israeli airstrike near Gaza's Al-Shifa Hospital. I want to warn you. The video we are about to show you is indeed graphic and certainly disturbing. This video shows the aftermath, just in terms of what happened, other videos show bodies across the ground near an ambulance, a nearby car appears to be damaged as well. Palestinian health authorities say that at least 15 people were killed and 50 injured in this attack. It said the cars hit were a medical convoy heading toward the Rafah Crossing. Israel says it killed a number of Hamas operatives in this strike. They have taken responsibility for this particular attack and that Hamas is using ambulances to transport its weapons and personnel. Salma Abdelaziz joins us live now from London. Salma, at this point, what more do we know about what's happening on the ground there?",

But again, no evidence provided to us. I want, as I speak through this episode to play some social media videos because these are videos that have been geolocated and verified by CNN that begin to illustrate to you what we understand took place, beginning, of course, with those ambulances that you see damaged, some of them splattered with blood there, we understand from one of the doctors in Al-Shifa Hospital that they had organized a convoy of ambulances to drive south to the Rafah crossing, that's of course with the Egyptian border, where there has been a trickle of wounded people going into Egypt. The health authorities there say that the goal was or that they also informed rather the international committee, the ICRC as well. The ICRC acknowledges that they received that request to accompany the convoy. The result of that strike, you can see on our screens right now. Absolute havoc right outside the doors of Al-Shifa Hospital. And what is clear is that innocent blood was spilled. You played that video as well where you can see a child being carried away, where you can see bodies strewn around, bloodied in front of this ambulance. We do understand, according to health authorities in Gaza, that at least a dozen people have been killed. You can see again, those images of those victims on the ground as people scramble to get them into that hospital, Al-Shifa Hospital, which again, is an overwhelmed medical facility. This is a medical facility that has said, it is running out of fuel. It operates under partial blackouts at nighttime. It is also home to tens of thousands of displaced people, people who are absolutely on edge now after this strike. Why are families camping out in the hospital? Well, quite simply, there are no safe places in Gaza and their plight becomes ever more concerning as we hear today that the IDF has completely encircled Gaza City. The ground offensive continues to intensify. Airstrikes continue to rain down. Some three hundred to four hundred thousand civilians still trapped in Gaza City in that hellscape. Al-Shifa Hospital is very much for them, a nerve center; again, a place for displaced people, a place where journalists camp out because maybe they can charge their cameras. So this is going to send shockwaves through Gaza City and again, we have those claims and counterclaims, but the victims in this, the innocents in these, you can see them on that social media video.",

That aid is not going to make it to Gaza City all the way in the north. Remember, Israeli troops have encircled the city, that area is very much in the battle zone. I'm going to speak of two hospitals now. Al-Shifa Hospital, which is the one we have been talking about, again, tens of thousands of people camped out there. Doctors tell us that they've run out of fuel essentially, that they describe this hospital is essentially going to be a scene of carnage if they don't get help soon. Doctors have told us they have operated without proper equipment, without painkillers, that they don't have enough hospital beds and you have to remember the wounded keep coming in. This is not a static situation, by any stretch of the imagination. And now, you have this strike just outside the hospital gates on an ambulance. This is going to bring a hospital that was already at breaking point absolutely to the edge. There is one other hospital, I'm just going to mention quickly here. Al- Quds Hospital as well, which is in Gaza City. It has also received or been near in the proximity of Israeli strikes and says it has had several people wounded, its building rattled and damaged. It also houses and homes thousands of displaced people. I think it's just an indication that you see all these families hiding out in hospitals, despite the proximity of strikes to those hospitals, an indication yet again, of how there is no safe place.",

So that is the real concern that US officials clearly trying to communicate to Israeli officials. But even before Antony Blinken left Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu was saying that they are opposed to any kind of ceasefire until all of the hostages are released. So Israeli official is not backing down from this idea that they will continue to attack Hamas and they are saying that their goal and their strategy here is to dismantle the Hamas military operation that is working from those tunnel systems underneath Gaza and that clearly comes with the possibility of great civilian casualties there in Gaza.",

And there had been an enormous amount of anticipation here in northern Israel, but also elsewhere in the region, and also in the US, that he would announce that in definitive terms, say that Hezbollah is joining this war against Israel, open up in effect a second front to Israel's north, but he didn't say that. He said it's possible. He seemed to say in his comments, that just the nature of the threat, just having that threat keeps Israel occupied to some degree, as they as a glance north with a wary eye, but he did not throw his lot in with Hamas here in this war, and that's notable because there was a fair amount of fear leading up to his comments that he would do exactly, exactly that, and that's one reason why you have some 70,000 Israeli soldiers now stationed in the north to defend against and head off such an attack.

And there are a number of folks I speak to here in Israel who think that the presence of US forces in the Eastern Mediterranean, two US carrier groups, in fact, as a deterrent, helped send a message to the Hezbollah leader that if you were to choose to get involved, to a more aggressive degree, that there would be a price to pay and that holds at least for now, although, of course, it could change at any time.

All right. Ukrainian officials say Russia launched about 40 drones overnight targeting infrastructure and military facilities spanning 10 regions. The Air Force says Ukrainian air defenses brought down more than half of the drones as well as a guided missile. Storm Ciaran continues to last Europe Thursday night. Torrential rain and strong winds swept through northern and central Italy. Report say six people have died in Tuscany with several others missing. The 40,000 Tuscan residents still without power. The region's president has called a state of emergency. Eric Trump calling the ongoing New York civil fraud trial a witch-hunt for political purposes after two days of testimony.

You want to caution that the video you're about to see is indeed graphic. Video shows bodies across the ground and blood on the street as well.

Now it's becoming much, much, much more public and that's part of Secretary Blinken's trip here is to -- is to make stronger the message to Israel that more has to be done to protect the civilians. Just this week, you've had two situations and you've probably seen some more activity on the horizon there behind me. The two situations, Jabalia camp one day, Jabalia camp the next day. In those instances, the IDF saying that they're targeting Hamas. But we know huge numbers of civilians have been killed in those strikes alone. More than 9000 civilians killed, more than 22,000 injured so far, according to the Hamas-led Palestinian health officials inside of Gaza. So today, for this incident there -- again, the IDF has said it for them, it was a legitimate strike because they believed that there were Hamas operatives and weapons on board those ambulances. They frame this as a legitimate strike. What we understand from the hospital is there's a high number of casualties. What we understand from the hospital and the International Committee for the Red Cross is this convoy of ambulances was a humanitarian convoy lining up to take the worst of the injured and wounded to the south of Israel, where -- to the south of Gaza, rather, where Israel has said that people should go. There's a humanitarian safe space there. We know so many people in Gaza have said, look, we don't know how to get to these safe places. We don't think it's safe. We're afraid to do it. We can't move. Israel has said you're -- there -- you're now in a battlefield. So, to the point of Secretary Blinken issuing that statement again and to the point that the increasing pressure is coming on Israel. Yes. I think there's a very real perception that the window for Israel to continue its military activities in Gaza at the tempo, they've had them out so far. That window is closing. But to a degree, it's always been closing. But after incidents like today in the Jabalia two strikes this week, the window closes faster.

But yes, the jobs market is a good indication, if we continue to see this 150,000 range for the next one or two months. I think that's an indication that we have this really steady, slowing decline. Remember, last month, we were over 200,000 for U.S. job. So, it's been a big deceleration in one month. It's hard to know if it sticks or it rises again next month. But as long as we just keep going down, the pace of wage growth keeps going down. I think the Fed is more and more likely to make the cause permanent. And in terms of labor action, I mean, you think about now the fact that the UAW has reached a deal with the big three auto workers, obviously the Writers Strike now, there's a deal on that front too. We see a recovery next month, just in terms of job gains next month.",

This is fresh weekly data that we get and real time isreal time of any jobs market that the government -- got jobs data that the government releases. And what they're showing is that companies are hanging on to the workforce. So, whether in manufacturing like the auto workers or an information services like the artists and the Writers Strike, companies are reluctant to lose their workers and they're willing to negotiate even higher salaries to keep them. And I think that's an indication that the stock market is slowing but still solid and there's still some inflationary pressures in it.",

Just to remind our viewers a gunman killed 18 people at that bowling alley I just mentioned and a restaurant before he was found dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. The president is also going to be reading with first responders, nurses and others on the frontlines as well. Omar Jimenez joins us live now. Omar, I'm sure for the people of Lewiston, Maine.

It just happened last week. People are still figuring out where -- what funeral services are going to look like for their loved ones. There are still people in the hospital. So, it is still very much raw for this community after the shootings that killed at least 18 people. Now, to give you an idea of where we are, I'm going to show you just over my shoulder. This is where President Biden just arrived a few moments ago. These people, community members from the Lewiston area and the surrounding areas were here on hand to see his motorcade come through. You see the tail end of the motorcade here. And this is at the bowling alley, which was the first of two mass shooting sites that happened again a little bit more than a week ago. And President Biden just finished visiting the second mass shooting site from that night. A bar and grill that's just a few miles from here. And across from these people. We've seen what are essentially makeshift memorials for those that were killed to offer, of course, their condolences but also to offer strength for the community here that has gone through so much. That's why you see a lot of symbols of hearts. The state of Maine depicted with a heart over where Lewiston is -- also signs that say simply be nice to acknowledge how difficult this situation has been for many in this particular community. As far as what we're expecting President Biden to be doing, he's been meeting with first responders, nurses, some of the people that were on the front lines that particular night. We're expecting some remarks from him just a few moments from now likely to talk about the pain in this community but potentially even to talk about how this particular person, the suspect from police was able to get access to weapons. As we understand there were multiple warning signs mental health wise that were flagged to law enforcement in the months leading up to it. And it's part of why the state has launched a commission to investigate that. But also, President Biden has had to make these types of speeches many, many times in the United States after what has been an incessant amount of mass shootings over the course of this year. After those remarks, we're expecting to meet with the families have some of those killed in these shootings, likely to offer condolences and strength as he does before he then leaves this area altogether. But of course, like we talked about at the top, this is still very raw for many in this community. And his presence seems to be a positive for many of the people here who are just looking for how to process what's happened.",
