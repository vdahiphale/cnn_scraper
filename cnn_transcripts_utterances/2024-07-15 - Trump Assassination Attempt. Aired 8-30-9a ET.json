It's a tough question because if past is prologue, there's not a good chance that this sticks. How do you really bring about and keep hold of that unity?",

Senator Cornyn and I introduced a bill that would reinvest in the teaching of civics and in helping high school students, college students, civics organizations across our country teach how to reduce conflict. There are grassroots organizations across our country encouragingpeople to put down the cell phones and get off of social media, and get out there and roll up your hands, and roll up your sleeves, and get busy in the hard work of respecting each other and hearing each other. I'll remind you that President Biden, in his inaugural address, called on us to see each other not as political enemies, but as Americans with just different perspectives and views. And I do think that's hard work. I think it calls on all of us to reflect that there have been too many close calls. Kate, this shocking event in Butler is just the latest in a string that have happened in recent years. We saw an attempt of kidnapping and assassinating Governor Whitmer of Michigan, an attempt to murder Speaker Pelosi that resulted in her husband being hospitalized. My own close friend, Jeff Flake, was standing next to Steve Scalise when he was shot in an assault in our nation's capital. So words have consequences. Folks who are deranged or at the margins, or have trouble managing their anger in too many incidents have been inspired by heated rhetoric. And so, my hope is that the convention in Milwaukee, the speech by our former president, will follow the lead of President Biden, who has reached out to former President Trump, and that many of us in the Senate will do the same. And reach out and demonstrate how we can work across the aisle to sustain a more positive view, and to sustain the sort of nation we need to be. We have to better than this moment.",

The temperature must cool down.One sign of that, Donald Trump says that he's completely rewriting his convention speech with a focus on national unity now. Axios is also reporting that he ordered aides to not allow convention primetime speakers to change their remarks to dial up the outrageous over the shooting. One Republican who will be speaking on this convention stage behind me this week, South Carolina Republican Congresswoman Nancy Mace. And Congressman Mace joins me now. Thank you so much for joining me, congressman. I really appreciate your time. We heard -- let me read a quote that we heard from Donald Trump, his first reaction and what -- and the impact that this attempted assassination has had on his outlook going forward. He said, I had all prepared an extremely tough speech, really good, all about the corrupt, horrible administration, but I threw it away. I want to try to unite our country, but I don't know if that's possible. People are very divided. President Biden called for that unity as well last night. What did you think of Biden's remarks last night, first? REP. NANCY MACE (R-SC): Well, I think it's very important that all of our leaders right now talk about unity and bringing people together. What I saw Saturday night in the moments after the shooting, I was out in public, everyone, Republican, Democrat, Independent. This has been a unifying moment for Donald Trump to unify the country. What he showed in the minutes after the shooting was courage, was leadership and strength. And this is our moment as America. And quite frankly, now that we've had almost two days since the shooting, I was very angry in the first few hours of this thing, very angry. But now, I've never been more proud to be an American because I'm seeing what Donald Trump is doing to unify the country. I'm hearing it on the streets from people of all political stripes right now. This is a moment for our country. And when America is strong, the world is strong. And I'm very much looking forward to hearing what Donald Trump will say on Thursday night during his nominating speech to bring the country together, because that's needed now more than ever.",

We don't even need to go down the list of things over time.But my point is, Speaker Johnson was -- has been speaking out just the last 24 hours. And the way he said it is that, everyone, both sides of the aisle need to turn the rhetoric down, acknowledging in that Republicans need to dial down on the rhetoric as well, to bring that temperature down for the good of the country.

I was very angry in the hours after the shooting. But it is incumbent upon us.Those who are public figures, those who are elected officials, those who have followers on social media, for example, that rhetoric does have consequences. And I've been a member who's called out rhetoric on both sides of the aisle ever since I was elected. And there is an enormous responsibility. I feel that responsibility today as I'm rewriting my remarks for Wednesday night. I feel that responsibility as I hear from constituents. And I have a purple district. I have talked to Democrats, I've talked to Republicans, I've talked to Independents, and this is a moment for America to bring people together. And that responsibility weighs heavily, not just on me, but I believe on members of both sides of the aisle. And we're seeing that it takes a little bit of time. We're only two days out after the shooting, but I believe you'll see more of that unifying message in the days, weeks and months ahead. Our country needs it.",

Joining us now, CNN Political Commentators Jamal Simmons and Margaret Hoover. Thank you both for being here. Let's just speak to that, Jamal.

But what we know about change is that people do change when something happens like a big -- that's big like this, but it requires work. It requires people to sort of continue to make the effort. Well, I hope Donald Trump continues to not go into some of the rhetoric and maybe others.So he doesn't strike me as the do the work kind of a guy. So I really wonder and worry that after this week wears off, we'll go back to something else. Also, as I wrestle with this and I think about this, we've been through a lot over the last couple of years. We had the pandemic, which nobody really talks about anymore. We had January 6, where there was a moment from national unity. People died. The attack on the Capitol was a very big deal. That's not really a factor very much anymore, sort of how we talk about things. We had a president who's been convicted of 34 counts. We don't talk about that. Joe Biden had a horrible debate performance, and that's even starting to fade. So it makes me wonder if a month from now, we will still be talking about this horrific event the way we're thinking about it now. And I just wonder if Donald Trump and this event are a part of a new media environment where everything is just pounding us all the time and we just don't get the kind of import that happens. When I was a kid when Ronald Reagan got shot, and we talked about that forever. I don't know that we live in that kind of a media social environment anymore. And it distresses me as an American.",

And I think all calls about who should be at the top of the ticket on the Democratic side are appropriately frozen at the moment, John, because this isn't a moment for politics.This is still -- it is only -- it's not even been 48 hours. And I do hope, to Jamal's point, we do heed this moment and we do really relearn, I think, what has become like a muscle memory in our politics and our rhetoric to ramp things up, and rather to have a calm, cerebral engage in the policy ideas, engage in an arena of ideas, which is the premise of a civil society. Civil discourse is a responsibility of a civil society. And if we can do that and rewire these neural impulses away from heightened rhetoric that is belligerent and pugilistic, and towards a calmer place where we can try to solve problems and reason together, that will be the benefit. I agree with Jamal. There is some question about whether this will continue. But for the moment, I think things are appropriately frozen to your point, John.",

I think that when we watch President Biden over the last couple days, I think he's reminded people of why they voted for him in the first place, because here's a guy who's showing leadership. He's reached out to Donald Trump, who's the victim in this case and made sure that he talked to him. He's talking to the American people repeatedly. He's leading the national security team and all the legal experts to talk about in the situation room what's occurring. And again, talking to the American public and keeping all of us informed about this. And so, I think that's what people want, steady leadership and somebody who's going to put the country first and not put themselves own particular interests first.
