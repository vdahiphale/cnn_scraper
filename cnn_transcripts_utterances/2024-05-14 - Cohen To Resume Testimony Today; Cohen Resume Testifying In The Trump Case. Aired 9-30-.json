Bill is exactly right, the missing witness problem is terrifying for prosecutors. I never wanted to have a missing witness.The best you can do though is what you call an unavailable missing witness. So, here's what I think is going to happen. Allen Weisselberg's in prison. That's not why he can't testify. People get transported down - there's vans every couple hours from Rikers down to the courthouse. What I think the judge is going to do is bring Allen Weisselberg in, outside the presence of the jury, and say, are you willing to answer questions? And if he says, no, your honor, I'm going to invoke my Fifth Amendment right, which he should, doesn't necessarily mean he will, which he should, then he becomes unavailable. If the word from Allen Weisselberg is, I won't testify, Fifth Amendment, it's the same thing as if he was dead. He's unavailable to both sides. And then the instruction that Bill was talking about will be way better for prosecutors. It won't be, well, there was a missing witness, either side could have called him. It's, there's a missing witness. He's - I instruct you Allen Weisselberg is legally unavailable.

This is potentially a key piece of evidence and testimony for prosecutors, depending on what Michael Cohen said.Now, Cohen has entered the courtroom. He's apparently glanced back several times at the back of Trump's table. It's a highly obstructed view in there. It's difficult to see, especially once you're at the witness stand. But he would walk directly past Trump's table as he tries to make his way to the witness stand. So, that's likely what that is, is referring to, that he looked over to Trump, which is notable because it wasn't clear yesterday for a lot of it how much he was looking there.

All it is, is Michael Cohen's story here. And we really don't know the answer to that. I think we've heard time and time again from various lawyers, legal analysts, who say it really is unknown how they could perceive this.

Now, again, when I talked Donald Trump's lawyers, they say that they hope that the jury can see through Michael Cohen and they plan on using Michael Cohen - painting him as a liar, somebody who it out to get Donald Trump, has an axe to grind during that cross-examination.

Cohen confirms he took photos while he was there. Yes, I just saw that. Jurors are being shown the photo of Cohen in the White House Briefing Room, which has been displayed previously.
