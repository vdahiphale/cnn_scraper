We're awaiting his formal appeal of a historic decision barring him from the Republican primary ballot in Colorado. Tonight, Trump's GOP rivals are taking his side and slamming the ruling. Plus, President Biden says the United States is pushing Israel and Hamas to reach a new deal to free more hostages held in Gaza. We'll get an update on the talks and the potential terms and timing. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. Tonight, the U.S. Supreme Court could rule at any time on whether to expedite a review of Donald Trump's immunity claim in the federal election subversion case, this after the Trump team's legal filing a short while ago opposing the special counsel's attempt to fast track a decision. CNN Justice Correspondent Jessica Schneider is following all of these developments for us. Jessica, what are Trump's lawyers arguing?",

      "sentences": "Yes, well, they want the Supreme Court to let this appeals process play out and to not step in at this point to hear the immunity issue.So, this is what Trump's lawyers are arguing. They're saying the special counsel urges the court to leapfrog the ordinary process of appellate review and rush headlong to decide one of the most novel, complex and momentous legal issues in American history. The special counsel seeks to embroil this court in a partisan rush to judgment. The court should decline. And this argument really goes to the Trump's team desire to let this appeal drag out as long as possible. Because, really, if they can somehow delay the start of this election interference trial past the March 4th, which is now the scheduled start, that really increases the likelihood that the trial could be pushed past Election Day. And that would increase the likelihood that Trump could ultimately instruct his DOJ to dismiss these charges if, in fact, he were to be elected in November. Now, the issue in this particular case is whether Trump is immune from prosecution. Trump is claiming that he was well within his official duties and everything that he did and said surrounding January 6th, and also that he's immune because the Senate ultimately acquitted him in his impeachment trial. Now, the lower court judge ruled that Trump is not immune, that he can face these charges. And even though that ruling is against Trump, his legal team is hoping that they continue to slow-walk the final resolution of this issue, since, Wolf, all of the proceedings right now are on hold until the question of immunity is ultimately resolved. It will likely get resolved by the Supreme Court and the justices really could decide at any point whether they're going to weigh in quickly here and decide whether they're going to hear this case quickly as well.",

So, it's all but certain that Donald Trump will, in fact, continue to appear on the primary ballot and then any determination by the U.S. Supreme Court, that would really only affect Trump's placement on the general election ballot if he's the nominee. But, really, regardless, it's going to be interesting to see what the nine justices do with this big issue. This issue has never been decided by a federal court, and it really obviously will have big implications for Trump's candidacy nationwide, whether or not he can even be on the ballot because of this insurrection issue.",

Remember, the last hostage deal that resulted in a phased handover of hostages took more than a month to come together.And the reason for that, according to the Israeli side, is that they don't believe that Hamas is necessarily interested in having this come together quickly when the global pressure right now is on Israel to provide concessions, as many concessions as Hamas hopes that they can get in order to release these hostages, given that there is very intense international pressure, and perhaps even more importantly for the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, there is domestic pressure to work out a hostage deal after the accidental shooting deaths over the weekend of three Israelis who were held in Gaza. And actually even more information is coming to light by the hour, including new audio revealed from a GoPro camera recovered from a military dog on the scene of where these hostages were shot and killed over the weekend. On this GoPro camera, you can actually hear the hostages, their voices, clearly identifiable. This is five days before the incident over the weekend where they were shot and killed. This is raising a lot of questions about what is likely chaos and confusion on the ground in Gaza, questions about why the IDF didn't know that these hostages were being held in this area. And it's putting a lot of spotlight on the military effort, which so far has failed to actually rescue any more than just one Israeli hostage. The rest of the hostages that were released, the result of diplomacy. So far, the IDF has rescued one hostage and three hostages have been accidentally killed. And so what Hamas is asking for, essentially in exchange for a potential handover, is the release of very high level, high value prisoners. You're talking about potential militants, people who have been convicted of crimes here in Israel to be handed over in exchange for the women, elderly and patients in desperate need of medical care that Israel is asking to be handed over in exchange for a one-week pause in the fighting and offer that there's a number of articles now here in Israel saying that Israel has potentially been told that Hamas rejected that initial offer.

Now, we have the possibility that the U.S. Supreme Court will take up the Colorado ruling and decide whether Trump can be on state ballots. It would be the first time since Bush versus Gore in 2000 that the Supreme Court would have weighed in on such an important matter in presidential politics.",

And while he has been charged, as of now, he's not been convicted of any crime related to January 6th. But legal expert Stephen Vladeck says at least one of those previous cases where Congress has denied seats to people based on that 14th Amendment, well, that's an indication that you don't have to have been convicted to be prevented from holding office under that amendment.

And would you be comfortable with a court, not voters, with a court making that decision? REP. ELISSA SLOTKIN (D-MI): Well, I mean, I think, I was fascinated by your last segment. I didn't know that history. And this is why I do think it is in the hands of the courts, right? And Colorado obviously knew what they were doing when they put this case together. They're trying to push -- to have this metered out in federal court, and now it will be. So, I personally don't know the answer between the 14th Amendment and everything else that was just cited. So, I think it makes sense, frankly, in Colorado. We've got similar cases going on here in Michigan and other states to let the courts meter this out.",

And that means the way you conduct your tactical military operations has a long-term effect on people, that you can't bomb your way out of an ideology. And we tried that.And I served in Western Iraq, and we had a lot of tactical victories against Al Qaeda, and then two years later, this group called ISIS came out of the ashes and took over an area the size of Texas. So, I think it's from a place of wanting long-term stability and security for everyone in that region. That's why we wrote it. And I do think the secretary of defense going out there and saying very similar things, he was the commanding general in Iraq of our regional forces. So, that conversation is happening in public now. It should be happening in private among allies. But I think we need to hear each other because we all want long-term security in the region.",

It's not in ours as the United States. So, that's part of why, again, we're having this conversation now in public instead of in private, because the humanitarian situation is a really dire thing. That's not made up. That's not a fabrication. That is a real thing.

Lee is working the story for us. M.J., so what's driving the president's irritation? M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, the Biden White House and the campaign, of course, would like to turn around the public sentiment when it comes to the economy. But what we are learning is that the president himself has publicly shown some frustration to his senior advisers, that when he is trying to tout some of these big signature legislative accomplishments from his first term in office, that he can't point to as many physical evidence and structures and construction of some of these projects that those signature bills are supposed to fund as he would like for. Right now, the White House has to settle for putting up signage, signs that basically say these projects are to come, that they will be built at a future date. One senior administration official telling us that the president feels immense frustration about this, another source telling us simply that he wants this stuff now. Sources, of course, say that the president very much understands that the implementation of these kinds of big laws will take a lot of time, but that he is still impatient to try to better showcase what is supposed to be a big part of his economic record. The president actually tried to do just that earlier today in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: Through the historic bipartisan infrastructure law.

The president decided to grant him clemency in exchange for these ten Americans that are now going to be released, and on top of that, an additional 20 Venezuelans who are going to be released from Venezuelan prisons, who are deemed to be political prisoners there. And so, the Biden administration really views this as a victory, but broadly, it is just a sign of the increasingly thawing tensions between the two countries.
