Down to the wire, thousands of Republican voters in a district of 800, 000 people in Virginia are now rendering a verdict. It is technically about two men, Bob Good and John McGuire, but it's about something else, what Donald Trump prizes most. What he's always valued above all else is loyalty. And Bob Good, the chairman of the Freedom Caucus in the House, a band of congressional hardliners that has fought hard for the MAGA agenda inside of Congress, is not good enough for Trump. Good found himself on the opposite side of the primary race with Trump, and the reason is pretty simple. Good wanted Ron DeSantis to be the Republican presidential nominee, not Donald Trump. So, now enter John McGuire. He's a former Navy SEAL, a former Virginia state senator, a former attendee of the January 6th rally that preceded the insurrection. And he has Donald Trump's support now. Not necessarily because he's actually all that different from Bob Good, except in that one key metric. He didn't violate Trump's core principle. Once again, it's all about loyalty. Now, as we come on the air tonight, the race down in Virginia is an absolute nail biter. Just 200 votes separate the two men, with 94 percent of the precincts reporting tonight. The lead has been going back and forth between Good and McGuire all night and especially in the last hour. So, obviously now tonight, it is too close to call. So let's go live to CNN's Melanie Zanona. She's at Bob Good's headquarters in Lynchburg, Virginia. Melanie, what are you hearing from the Good campaign about how tight this race is tonight?",

      "sentences": "Yes, you're absolutely right. This is a very tight race, and there is a mix of excitement and anxiousness in the room behind me. Earlier in the night, I did spot Bob Good. He was sitting rather quietly with his family eating pizza, really keeping to himself. I saw him checking his phone. It seemed as though he was anxious, like the rest of the Republican Party, to see where these results are going.But not long ago, we heard some cheering coming from inside the room when some results came in and put Bob Good ahead. Again, it's still too close a call, so we'll have to wait and see. But just the fact we're even paying attention to the race is so remarkable because this really has become a race about Donald Trump. Bob Good has made some very powerful enemies inside the House Republican Party, inside the Republican Party as a whole, and chief among them is Donald Trump, as you mentioned, he never forgave Bob Good for endorsing Ron DeSantis, even though we should note that Bob Good did flip his support to Trump once Ron DeSantis got out of the race, but that wasn't good enough for Trump. So, he did a telethon haul for John McGuire last night, he's been railing against Bob Good on social media. He even told Bob Good's campaign that he needed to stop using signs that had Trump's name on them. Although we did see one of those signs in the room earlier tonight, Abby. And then, of course, there's Kevin McCarthy, the former speaker. Bob Good was one of those eight Republicans who voted to oust Kevin McCarthy as speaker. And Kevin McCarthy and his allies have been pouring a lot of money into this race trying to oust Bob Good. Now, he does have some powerful allies in his corner as well, including people like Steve Bannon and Matt Gaetz and people in MAGA world. But at this moment, the race is very close, and in the end, it's going to be a test of Trump's strength inside the GOP. Abby?",

You know, if you look at how many colleagues got involved in this race, it's rare that colleagues get involved in primaries where you have a sitting member. I've only been involved against one other member, that was Liz Cheney. And, you know, that was a lot of folks kind of worked against her. And the party ultimately officially worked against Liz Cheney.You know, Bob Good is kind of a different case, but getting to know John McGuire, I think Donald Trump has a lot of confidence in John McGuire, so do a lot of my colleagues. And I believe he's going to be the right kind of person to work with in the 119th Congress to implement the Make America Great Again, America First (INAUDIBLE).",

They're both conservative. They appeal to a lot of the same people. Main difference, you know, McGuire is a veteran Navy SEAL, but he's also got a difference in demeanor and I think people feel like he's much more collaborative.So, he's going to have similar votes, I think, in the long run. We'll see if he makes it. But, you know, I knew this race was going to be tight and people on both sides asked me to get involved and whether people were supporting John McGuire or people were supporting Bob Good and rarely do I get involved in a race, period. But this one, I really started weighing it. I go, you know, if this is going to be as tight as we think it is, and 1,000 votes or something decides the race, will I regret whether I got involved or not?

One conversation I had with a gentleman here, an African-American man, talk about the history of black people in the United States. And this is appropriate considering that Juneteenth is coming up here. He talked about 1619, the original sin of this country being committed against black people, slavery, and then juxtaposing that with Donald Trump's, you know, claim that he's going to be a dictator on day number one, right, and the fact that he's talking about pardoning people who sought to overturn American democracy. Well, who built the U.S. Capitol? It was black people. Who laid the foundations for that and for the White House? It was black people. So, the conversation was, we're not going to go from slavery in the United States to a dictatorship in the United States and do that on the black on the backs of black people. That just is not going to happen. That's what black men in Milwaukee told me. So, according to the conversations I've had with them directly, and honestly, they're voting for President Joe Biden and proudly so.",

He was mentored by Monty Urban, a Negro Leagues legend who was his first teammate on that Giants team.Throughout all that time in New York, he was the guy that everybody looked out for. The Giants moved west in 1958. Suddenly, he became the guy that looked out for everybody else and I'm talking Willie McCovey, Orlando Cepeda, Juan Marichal, the Alou Brothers. He was the guy in the clubhouse. He was the guy on the team. So, all that wisdom he got from the Negro Leagues and the Black Barons and his father playing catch as a young boy was all put together. And throughout his life, he wanted to pay it back and he spent the last many, many decades doing just that. And look at it now. It's like he's going out on his terms. It's a full circle moment.

He went from the Negro Leagues to an all-white league in which he was the only minority in 1950, right out of high school. So, he was hearing a lot of the things Jackie Robinson was hearing in 1947. This was only three years later. But he once told me, and I'll never forget this, when he was with the Trenton Giants, the abuse was so heavy, so venomous, and it was time that he had to decide. And he looked at me and said, I didn't know if I wanted to keep doing it. And I'm thinking, it gave me chills.

It was because he also had that sixth tool, and it was the intuition, the ability to coach himself on the bases.He was in awe of Willie running the bases, not needing a coach. He was in awe of Willie not needing the defensive skills that he had, the intuition, the ability to understand the game and the plays before they happened. And I grew up with my grandfather, who also honored Willie Mays. And then when I went to the Florida State, one of my coaches, Chip Baker, his favorite player was Willie Mays. So, I had to hear stories and stories of Willie Mays. And then finally, Willie, I was able to sit in front of him, and he was able to tell me his own stories, as well. And for me, that was so gratifying to be able to see the person and the human being that he was. And because of those people who brought me up in this game, my grandfather, my father, Chip Baker, one of my coaches, that was their favorite player. That was the best player of all time in their eyes. Man, looking around and seeing his godson, then Barry Bonds, be one of the greatest, as well. I understand why they were so special.
