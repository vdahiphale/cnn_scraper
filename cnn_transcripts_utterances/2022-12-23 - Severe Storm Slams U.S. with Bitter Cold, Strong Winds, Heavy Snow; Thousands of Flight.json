Subzero temperatures hitting hard out west. Here is the owner of a local towing company in Great Falls, Montana, speaking with CNN this morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GARETH OX LEA, OWNER, OX &amp; SON TOWING:  It is just definitely cold up here. And, I mean, if you ain't prepared for it, it could be really bad.

Really, what we have seen is these restrictions put in place by authorities because of the concern of these white-out conditions.We started this morning at about 6:00 A.M. with barely a drizzle, temperatures in the upper 30s, but, boy, did the situation just begin to deteriorate extremely quickly, so much so that officials here in Erie County, New York, have instituted a travel ban, meaning only essential traffic is allowed on the highways and roads right now. Many concerns to tell you about here, one of them is, of course, that folks might get sort of disoriented with these white-out conditions and get stuck on the side of the road and it could lead to tragedy there. But also this storm, as it continues to barrel eastward, it is bringing these just wicked winter winds and with it basically pushing a lot of water in nearby Lake Erie, which is less than a mile from where I'm standing and from where the pictures are being taken and sourcing much of the water closer and closer to some of the coastal communities. And that is why there are some of the communities where they even urge residents to evacuate leading up to the storm and that's where they are recommending that people continue to stay vigilant and keep an eye on water level because this is a storm, according to local officials here, that is unlike anything that many folks who lived here have ever seen before with those lake levels expected to be really just extremely high, some of the highest they've seen in perhaps decades. But, again, these pictures give you an idea of what the situation is like on the ground and this is really just getting started, authorities say, that this is going to continue into tomorrow.

It started and we declared or activated emergency operations center and subsequently declared an emergency.We've had over -- over 2,000 migrants come to Denver. You know, during the fall and winter months, we're 1,500 just this month alone. And, of course, we're dealing with a challenge across this nation with homelessness. And so this is a really difficult situation for all cities around the country. I'm in conversation with mayors almost on a daily basis across this country and it is a challenge. Cities are bearing the brunt. And I've said this all week long, the inactivity and the lack of leadership coming out of Washington on this issue. We have had opportunities to address it. We have it as a nation. And it's because of the unfortunate partisan politics in Washington that has put us in this situation.",

We want to be inclusive. We want to be open. We want to be -- act humanely but we need the federal government to assist this.

Whether or not there were efforts to put in, in fact, a slate of fake electors, will people flip to say that Trump directed them to do that? Those are cases to me that looked cleaner based on the evidence.We also know that this is a gift to the prosecutor to have these kinds of statements and investigation, notes and reports to him before he begins.
