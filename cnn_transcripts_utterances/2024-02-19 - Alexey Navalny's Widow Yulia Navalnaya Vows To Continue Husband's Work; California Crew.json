The widow ofRussian opposition leader Alexey Navalny is signaling that she might be a formidable new political opponent for the Kremlin to contend with. Yulia Navalnaya is vowing to not only continue her husband's work, but to find out and also expose anyone who was responsible for his death. In a very powerful video message posted on Monday, Navalnaya urged Russians not to be afraid, not to remain silent, but instead to stand united in their fury and in their anger and in their hope for a better future. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YULIA NAVALNAYA, WIDOW OF ALEXEY NAVALNY (through translator): I ask you to share your rage -- rage, anger and hatred with me towards those who are daring enough to kill our future. And I address you with Alexey's words, which I believe it is not a shame to do. It's not a shame to do little, but it's a shame not to do anything. It's a shame to make yourself intimidated.

      "sentences": "Well, Democrats are certainly hoping that is the case. We've seen President Biden and Chuck Schumer, thetop Democrat in the Senate, really hammering Republicans over their inaction and saying Putin is watching. There's been these twin developments over the weekend, not only Navalny's death in captivity, but also the fact that Ukraine has fallen to Russian forces on the battlefield. That news came out this weekend just as foreign leaders, including members of Congress, were gathered in Munich for an annual security conference. So, you've heard Democrats really beating this drum, especially as the House of Representatives Senate right now are both on recess, so they're not even scheduled to be back here in Washington legislating until next week. But as of right now, the fate of additional Ukraine aid rests entirely in the hands of Speaker Mike Johnson. He is the brand new Speaker. He's only been on the jobs for a few months. Sources tell me that as a rank-and-file member, he never even visited Ukraine on what is known as a congressional delegation, which is a foreign trip. And what he is dealing with right now is he has this right flank, this rambunctious group of hardliners who are completely opposed to Ukraine aid. So, he is at a crossroads. He's caught between some Republicans in his conference who do want to see additional support Ukraine. He's also, as Speaker, now saying that he recognizes the gravity of the situation, even though he had a different view as a rank-and-file member. But you have Donald Trump also injecting himself into the debate, urging Republicans to oppose any additional Ukraine funding and also railing against NATO. So, it's just a complicated position for the new Speaker. As of right now, he has not said what he plans to do. He told members during a closed door meeting last week that there's no rush to address the issue, but as the two-year anniversary of the war approaches and as all these developments come into focus, there is a new sense of urgency for Speaker Mike Johnson to make a decision here. But as of this point, it's just hard to imagine what a compromise would look like that would satisfy the right while also providing additional aid to Ukraine.",

Walk us through what she's up against, Marina. MARINA LITVINENKO, ALEXANDER LITVINENKO'S WIDOW: I'm very proud of Yulia and she made a very serious decision. In my way, when my husband was killed, I was here in London and I knew I would be able to get justice. It would be proper investigation and we will have a name of people who committed this crime. But Yulia, whose husband was killed -- Alexey Navalny, was killed in prison in Russia. And when he was poisoned in Russia, it's never been proper investigation at all. And now we will have to wait for 14 days, maybe even more to know what was exactly happened to Alexei Navalny.

And we need to support the family -- of all family of Alexey Navalny who is suffered now. But I again feel so sorry for all people in Russia who have no proper justice. They have no any rights to get truth and this is 14 days would be used against this family. They will fabricate the result. They would make anything but not truth. And in the same case, we have another example of Vladimir Kara-Murza, who was poisoned twice, and we still don't have what was behind of this.

This is coming out of Del Norte, California and you can see just how quickly this ground gives way. Gravity wins. The ground becomes so saturated from the recent heavy rainfall that unfortunately it starts to slide. Now, we are talking about extremely high rainfall values for the month of February, so much so that we're approaching some of the wettest February's on record. Look at Los Angeles, 211 millimeters above their February average to date in terms of rainfall. Santa Barbara at 176 millimeters. Today, more rainfall is occurring and will continue through the course of your Monday. You can see slight risk of flash flooding across the north and central parts. But let's focus in on southern California, particularly Ventura and Los Angeles counties, where a moderate risk of flash flooding is the latest information we can pass along to you from the Weather Prediction Center. A band of heavier rainfall moving through the region that will lead to localized urban flooding and it doesn't stop there. Look at this. More rainfall spreads in from the north, eventually making its way southward. San Francisco Bay Area will get hefty rainfall totals this time tomorrow. An additional 100 to 125 millimeters possible from L.A. westward, that includes Santa Barbara and some of the mountainous regions throughout this area of southern California. And we'll be measuring snowfall at feet across the Sierra Nevada mountain range. Very impactful winter storm warnings in place across that part of California.

The Israeli Prime Minister has said as much himself, but so far they have yet to release any details at all about exactly how they would accomplish that or where they would go beyond the Israeli Prime Minister saying effectively that there is plenty of space further north in Gaza. What we have seen already, though, in recent days is that even just the threats of this Israeli military offensive, even as it doesn't necessarily appear imminent based on the Israeli military capabilities at the moment is that even just those threats have already prompted a sense of fear, a sense of panic among some of those one and a half million people in Rafah. We have seen hundreds, if not thousands of people already beginning to flee Rafah heading for the central areas of Gaza, searching for safety. But instead, in some cases finding more war, more destruction. That was the case yesterday as an airstrike hit a neighborhood in Deir al- Balah in central Gaza, a house where approximately 40 people from Rafah had just fled and were sheltering there. Many of those killed and wounded were children, as well. And so, enter into the picture, all of this, you have Benny Gantz, a minister in the war cabinet who is now effectively giving a deadline, saying to Hamas, saying to the world that if Hamas doesn't return hostages, if Hamas doesn't agree to a deal to return hostages by Ramadan on March approximately March 10th or 11th, that Israel will indeed proceed with this offensive into Rafah. And it's very clear that the Israeli government is taking a very hard line in these negotiations and Hamas also appears to not be moving up until now. The Israeli Prime Minister just a couple of days ago said that Hamas' latest counterproposal was effectively zero change from its previous counter-proposal, that they hadn't moved even a millimeter or a nanometer, he said. And the Israeli Prime Minister says that until Hamas does move, he is not going to engage in further negotiations. So, a very tense moment, a very uncertain moment. And not only, of course, you have the fate of some 130 plus hostages hanging in the balance, but also, of course, the lives of one and a half million people in Rafah who are waiting to see whether or not there will be a ceasefire, waiting to see whether or not there will be a deal that could perhaps avert a deadly military offensive in that very same city.",

It's a complex process in part because the U.S. and other powers are talking to the Qataris and others. They are then talking to the political leadership for Hamas. They are then passing the message in some unclear way that must be logistically pretty complex to the military leadership of Hamas, which is frequently out of touch because they don't want to get tracked down by the Israelis. So, we don't even know how well the messages are being passed. And so far, Hamas has asked for a very large number of Palestinians to be released for each Israeli who's released.
