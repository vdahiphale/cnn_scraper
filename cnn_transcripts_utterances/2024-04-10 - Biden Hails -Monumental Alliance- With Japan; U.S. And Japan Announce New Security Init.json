President Biden calling the U.S. partnership with Japan \"a beacon\" to the entire world that will only get stronger.

And he took an opportunity to reiterate that message today. But Prime Minister Kashida would say only that he believed that the laws in each country would prevail. Certainly, here in the U.S., there are agencies and there's a court system that deals with anti-trust matters. So, Kishida choosing to instead rest on those authorities to make a decision rather than a political one. And neither leader acknowledging with certainty whether it did come up in the discussions behind closed doors. But there was enough business that was already being done where the ink was just drawing billions of dollars and deals on artificial intelligence and digital diplomacy with Google, Microsoft, and Amazon in Japan, as well as Honda and Toyota committing to new investments in manufacturing in the United States.

Thank God we're alive for Eid, her father explains, but we're exhausted and devastated. We should be in our home, comfortable eating, celebrating. In the ravaged enclave, millions are clinging to what is unbreakable, tradition. We insisted on praying inside Rafah's Ferut (ph) Mosque, so all the world knows that we are holding on to our mosques, to our land, to our country, Mostafa Alhelou from Gaza City says. Eid's spirit also being kept alive in makeshift kitchens, ingredients of everyone's Eid memories donated by charities outside of Gaza, lovingly crafted, and, to date, sesame and caraway cookies. We're trying to make our kids happy, remind them of the smell of Eid, Ahlam Saleh says. They didn't get the traditional new clothes. There was no joy for Eid, no balloons, no sweets. What is in abundance this year? Eid's custom of commemorating the dead. Silent clusters of sorrow surrounding fresh dog soil in other years, less tragic than today. Um Ahmad came with her children. My kids lost their father, she says. When I told them I was going to visit his grave, they told me, mom, we want to come visit Baba. This little one was banging on the stone, saying, I want to see Baba. He said, who's going to celebrate Eid with me? There is no going back, a generation here growing up with new memories of Eid, of suffering and loss a long time before the joys shared by about 1.9 billion other Muslims around the world become universal in Gaza again.

If you look at where China exports, a lot of its products, where China obtains a lot of its technology, it's very highly reliant on the developed countries of the West, the U.S. foremost, but also Japan, Europe, South Korea, if we think of the West as a -- you know, not as a locational story. So, China has to maintain for its own economic benefit. It has to maintain these relationships. And meanwhile, Japan and Korea can't go too far in identifying China as a problem. So, all of them are involved in a certain amount of give and take. And the question is how to accommodate the legitimate concerns of all the parties. But I don't think the U.S. job is any harder than that of Japan or of China. And so, having -- if you have Japan, China -- excuse me, Japan, Korea, Philippines, United States, Australia, Singapore, Thailand, mostly on board, and India maybe more or less cooperative over on the west flank, that will make China probably a lot more cautious. It runs the risk of aggravating relations, and certainly that's a concern. But without it, there's very little opportunity for having any of these countries really resist Chinese aggression, if China were to choose to be aggressive.",
