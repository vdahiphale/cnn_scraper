There have been various points over the course of thelast year when it appeared that tensions were at a boiling point and an all-out war might indeed be in the offing. And so we have seen once again, as I was conducting yesterday, a totally unrelated interview with somebody who has family in the north. They were speaking to their relatives, beginning to make preparations for whether or not they should evacuate further south, as so many tens of thousands of Israelis have already had to do. And so we are once again at that point. We have not seen any changes in the home front command guidelines. What we have seen, however, is the beginning of the mobilization of Israeli troops heading to the north. The 98th Division being diverted from the Israeli front in Gaza, being sent to the northern front with Lebanon instead, as Israeli generals, military officials and politicians begin to speak again about the possibility of the drums of war being sounded here and things escalating once again.",

And it also comes on the heels of Israel's defense minister telling a visiting U.S. envoy that the time for diplomacy with Hezbollah has actually passed. Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate, as you know. But as Jeremy also pointed out, when that may happen, unclear. The group has said in the past, it would stop attacking Israel if Israel ended the war in Gaza. All of this unfolding, of course, as the U.S. secretary of state, Antony Blinken, is back in the Middle East, still trying, along with allies in the region, to forge a diplomatic solution to end that conflict and to secure a hostage release. Here's what he had to say about the pager attack when addressing reporters in Cairo. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  With regard to Lebanon, the United States did not know about nor was it involved in these incidents. And we're still gathering the information and gathering the facts. Broadly speaking, we've been very clear and we remain very clear about the importance of all parties avoiding any steps that could further escalate the conflict that we're trying to resolve in Gaza, to see it spread to other fronts. It's clearly not in the interest of anyone involved to see that happen. And that's why, again, it's imperative that all parties to refrain from any actions that could escalate the conflict.

      "sentences": "Well, listen, I think it is noteworthy that U.S. officials who were on the secretary of state'splane, were learning about this incident, this attack on these Hezbollah pagers in Lebanon as we were flying to the region here in Egypt. Now the secretary of state is just visiting Egypt on this visit to the region. He isn't going to Israel. This is the first time that he's in the region and not visiting Israel since October 7th. So that gives you a little bit of context of just how this is unfolding here. But Erica, it's important to note that U.S. officials are making it very clear that they were not involved in these incidents that occurred. And the secretary of state, however, said that the U.S. is really in a fact-finding mission right now. He told me that it's too early to assess the damage that this could have on the operations of Hezbollah. The U.S. will watch and see what they can learn about that. But the backdrop here is also that the U.S. has continued to push for the cease-fire, continued to push for this hostage release deal. It has not yet come to fruition. And the secretary of state was very clear today, speaking here in Cairo, saying that it will require political will from both sides in order to get it done, sort of trying to shift the blame. Shift the focus away from those who haven't been involved in these negotiations, the U.S., Egypt and Qatar, and really focusing in on those who are central to making these negotiations actually come to fruition. That's Israel and that's Hamas. The U.S. being very clear that, at this moment in time, there's no deal that could come to fruition without the political will, in the words of the secretary of state, of both of those sides. And of course, there are concerns among U.S. officials that an incident like this could further escalate things, could drive this into a regional conflict, which they have been desperately trying to avoid for months now.",

So it's important to try and keep perspective on this. But be in no doubt, Lebanese state media are talking about a number of explosions that seem to be happening at roughly the same time. And there are adequate accounts now on social media to suggest that we might be looking at walkie-talkies as being the source of that, which would suggest, if indeed this plays out the same way, that we might be looking at a second wave of a sophisticated attack. One indeed, too, that might be waiting until the moment in which the militant group reach for more a low tech way of talking amongst themselves and then hitting that. But still exceptionally early information here. But be in no doubt now, this just feeds into the sense of escalation there, possibly a sense of weakness amongst Lebanese and Hezbollah as to how in control they are of their own safety in these hours. And look, bear in mind, while it seems like Hezbollah were the target of the operation yesterday, the pagers exploding, civilians were caught up in this, too. And while it tried to be targeted, it seems, in terms of how the devices were specifically interrupted on their way to Lebanon. And according to reporting in \"The New York Times,\" had explosives put inside them. There were innocent civilians caught up in this. Two children, indeed, killed.

But that is yet to come. It is reminiscent for those of us are students of the Middle East, perhaps the preemptive attack Israel carried out in the Six-Day War in '67 or even if we remember 9/11.  I mean, Al Qaeda had a preemptive attack in Afghanistan, killing their adversaries there before going ahead and conducting the major attacks in New York and D.C. So those are the kinds of actions that usually are a signal of a broader operation to come and there's certainly a lot of fear both in Lebanon but also throughout the region and world capitals, that that, in fact, might be the case. The other option we've seen some reporting in \"Al Monitor\" and other outlets on that,  is that the network that Israel had actually used to install these improvised explosive devices within these walkie-talkies and pagers was about to be uncovered by Hezbollah. And therefore, they needed to act. We won't know but certainly Israel is making all the moves militarily, including today announcing it's moving tens of thousands of troops from Gaza to its border with Lebanon.  It's making all the right moves to convince and warn Hezbollah that it is ready for a broader war.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Look, I mean, it's been fairly clear, I think, since the Israelis assassinated the key negotiator of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, inTehran, that the government of Benjamin Netanyahu was pursuing its own agenda and perhaps less fast as to what that did to the diplomacy that the U.S. has invested so much of itself in. And we have seen in the past week increasingly signs that that diplomacy for the Biden administration at least might be reaching the end of the road. They are still very fervent in their desire for some kind of ceasefire deal. That's at the heart of all the messaging you hear. But the phrase, \"the need for political will\" has kept emerging just, I think recently today from secretary of state Antony Blinken. And that may just be a subtle probe, not only Benjamin Netanyahu, who many his political fate has been staked in terms of how long this conflict continues. The day after the war ends is the day, when the reckoning for how October 6th even began for Benjamin Netanyahu. But there're also, too, I think, many analysts who looked exactly the position Hamas are in; their leader, Yahya Sinwar, as to his fate, too, in the event of some calming of the conflict suddenly becomes something significantly more complex. Already, a man hiding under tunnels, it seems, in Gaza at the moment. So a real, I think, sense of frustration as to whether this ceasefire deal could ever possibly move forward in the current circumstances. And it's into that that we have these extraordinary scenes in Lebanon injected. The Lebanese group, Hezbollah, have said that their actions in northern Israel, the rockets they fired, the persistent back and forth they've had with the Israeli army, have been to assist the people of Gaza. And essentially they've held out the notion that a ceasefire might cause them to fall silent in terms of their actions there as well. But now we have it seems an Israeli shift in focus toward the north. That clear in their messaging. And the Israeli defense minister, Yoav Gallant on Monday, suggesting that diplomacy may now be behind him and the military options may be more on the table. Whether what we're seeing here, yesterday's explosions and what appear to be a second wave, now are a bid to weaken Hezbollah ahead of a larger Israeli operation, that's unclear. I think the fact that we're seeing, it seems, a resumption of this sort of tactic suggests that maybe a wider plan is afoot here. Or it may just simply be that the strategy all along has been to wait for Hezbollah to shift towards another kind of technology to communicate and then hit that as well. But we have to say still trying to work out exactly what the main targets of these blasts has indeed been, what kind of wireless devices, I think, is a phrase we're hearing a lot here, may have detonated. Is it just one specific make? Are there multiple different sources of these blasts? And indeed, how many blasts have there been as well? So as I say, the confusion here perhaps part of the strategy to increase, to amplify the panic amongst ordinary Lebanese and also, too, amongst the militant group, Hezbollah.",

But what we're seeing is that there're reports of blasts at various locations around Lebanon, inBeirut in the south and the Bekaa Valley in the eastern part of the country. Now the official national news agency is describing the explosions taking place with what are called wireless devices. We believe they're talking about walkie-talkies. So it does appear that, whereas yesterday the focus of this -- these perhaps thousands of individual blasts was pagers, today it looks like it's walkie-talkies. So definitely this is deepening the sense of insecurity that was very palpable in the aftermath of yesterday's pager bombings. And today, we've seen, in addition to thousands of people wounded from yesterday's, now there are more injured. We don't have precise numbers at this time. It doesn't appear that the wave of bombings today was anything compared to what happened yesterday. Now we're outside the American University of Beirut Medical Center, where we spoke with the chief medical officer here, who said that as many -- up to nearly 200 people were treated here, many of them with wounds to the face, to the eyes, the hands and also to the hip. Because they were basically pulling out these pagers, looking at them and then they were blowing up in their faces. So we've spoken with, for instance, the minister of health, who told us how difficult it has been for the authorities to deal yesterday with this wave of bombings. And, today the challenge is still there but obviously there are lots of people outside the hospital. We haven't seen any ambulances arriving here yet. But there are reports, for instance, of a funeral in -- for one of the people killed yesterday, a funeral in the southern suburbs of Beirut, where many members of Hezbollah live. In that instance, eyewitnesses told us that a man lost his arms in a blast there.",

They were detonating all over the place, in grocery stores, in public spaces, in schools, it didn't matter. And civilians around were getting injured. Today, it seems it's walkie- talkies and other communication instruments. If it's walkie-talkies, the blasts are probably larger because these are larger devices. This is what we're hearing right now. So we're waiting, we're bracing ourselves to see what the second wave is like and whether this is signaling an intention by Israel to first disrupt Hezbollah's communication network and then to attack Lebanon.",

So according to a Lebanese security source, talking to my colleague, Itamar Kablawi (ph), this source is saying thatthe devices that exploded were walkie-talkies, that the preliminary information is there were 15 to 20 explosions in the southern suburbs of Beirut. And I think the images we're seeing there on AFP looked to me, by the yellow flags there, to be a Hezbollah rally. And that may tally with some of the reporting, suggesting that a funeral related to yesterday may have been targeted. And there also appear to have been 15 to 20 other explosion in southern Beirut. Now to point out, if that is indeed the full extent of the blasts we've heard today, that's 30 to 40 explosions, significantly less than the thousands which appear to have hit across Lebanon yesterday. But this source goes on to say that the walkie-talkies appear to be in the source of some of these explosions, at least, if not all of them. They are way far less widespread than the pagers and are predominantly used by Hezbollah members for crowd control in public events, et cetera. So we may be seeing a second wave here, perhaps hitting crowd areas like that. You can see a car racing through the crowds there, presumably to get away or carry injured somewhere. But clearly, this causing significant fear and panic yet again, that video you're seeing there from AFP looks to me like a Hezbollah march or rally of some description. And so -- (CROSSTALK)",

So we know 30 to 40 at this point from the security source that was talking to my colleague, Tamarka Abelow (ph). But are we entirely clear that's the full picture? We don't know at this particular stage. But if it is walkie-talkies, it's likely to have been a public event, you might think, or areas where Hezbollah are managing security. But look, step back from this. This is yet another low tech means of communication from this group, Hezbollah, who are very disciplined, very well trained, experienced in battle. Very proud of their operational security and use these walkie-talkies, presumably, to try and have some local sense of safety and ability to communicate without being intercepted. And yet again, if indeed it is these walkie-talkies that have detonated, that supply chain appears to have been infiltrated by somebody. Now these blasts may be larger, these devices are more significant than some of the images I've seen on social media would suggest. A bigger explosion potentially than that which we have seen from those pagers, which, according to some reporting, had small amounts of explosive inserted inside of them. But look, put all that to one side, we're dealing with a militant group here, proud of its own security, reeling from the extraordinary sophistication and widespread nature of the attack that they had yesterday. And having to deal at public events like what appears to be a funeral procession or a rally here that we're seeing in those AFP pictures, have a second wave of explosions of a highly similar nature hit them, maybe less. But the damage to their sense of integrity, their sense of their own security and maybe morale, too, will be pretty acute. And this will inform how they respond. They've said they will do so at a time of their choosing and give harsh atonement to those behind this. They firmly blamed Israel. And seeing the reporting, suggests the Israelis were behind this, too. But this is also going to limit what they're able to do because, for the last 24 hours, it pretty clear their communications have been in strict difficulty and they've been unaware who is unharmed. So now we have a second wave. And that's yet going to push them two ways to a moment of uncertainty, whether or not quite sure what they can do, and a moment possibly of irrational behavior, where they feel they have to do something which reminds the region of their relevance and their ability to project strength. Because at this point, they look weak.",

Israel has established its escalation dominance here.

And that if a war with Lebanon would put the war in Gaza to shame in terms of the sheer amount and scope of devastation that would be visited upon both countries. That is the silver lining here, the hope that, in fact, that both sides are looking at such a level of destruction, that even if there is some kind of performative response from Hezbollah, there is a need to save face. And need to perhaps have a semblance of deterrence restored, that there'd be a third path out of this, that the diplomacy that has been spearheaded by Amos Hochstein, President Biden's envoy on this matter, will offer the diplomatic off-ramp for both sides to step away from the brink. Then there is a diplomatic outcome that has been put on the table here.  Hezbollah pulling back a certain number of kilometers from that border with Israel, seizing its rocket fire. Israel in return also withdrawing from some of the disputed border points along the border between the two countries. So there is a diplomatic pathway to unlock. However, Hezbollah and Iran have insisted on a ceasefire in Gaza. (INAUDIBLE) reckoned with (ph) for that and that continues to be the sticking point. But maybe now things have gotten to such a point that the diplomatic pathway can have a second chance.",
