They have got thousands and thousands of hours of testimony from people who were there.They were there around the former president. And the fact that they have arrived at these recommendations is something that the Justice Department will take and take a look at. They will want to look at the evidence in particular, because one of the things that the Justice Department has been interested this is the interviews that were conducted and the transcripts of those interviews, which could be useful for the investigation, the criminal investigation, that prosecutors already have ongoing. Of course, it is now in the hands and being overseen by special counsel Jack Smith. Now as far as these charges are concerned or these recommended charges, you know, a couple of them are ones that are familiar to the Justice Department; of course, obstruction of an official proceeding. This is something that we know a federal judge has already signaled is something that he believes that the former president was involved with one of his lawyers, John Eastman when the committee was trying to get a hold of those communications between that lawyer and the former president. As far as insurrection is concerned, that could be a little bit more complicated for the Justice Department because of the way the statute is written. But no doubt about it, this is an important moment for this committee. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

They are in the same branch of government. And I'll tell you, the Justice Department does not ever want to be put in the same bucket as Congress. They are very, very separate entities, often at odds with one another even. And so there is the possibility that there could be political pressure that builds, once the House Select Committee would say what they want to see as far as prosecutions. That doesn't mean that the Justice Department will follow what their suggestions might be. But this is Washington. Merrick Garland is the attorney general. His office, you can sort of see down the mall to the Capitol building. So this is always a political environment. Garland, one of his blind spots generally would be politics. He was a judge for 23 years before taking on the position of attorney general. So there are members of Congress that probably are hoping that there would be politics factored into it. But it is a very delicate situation and we'll just have to see how Garland plays it going forward. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And in that case, the special prosecutor was actually making the referral to Congress, laying out a roadmap for Congress to impeach.So nothing has ever happened anything like this. Now the referral is symbolic. It will go to special counsel, appointed by the DOJ, Jack Smith. And he can decide what to do with this. But it gives the authority behind the investigation an attempt to provide accountability for Trump's actions, in which seven people died. And by releasing the report, I think this is incredibly important to find in this information campaign, to send a strong message. And it will be really helpful to civil society and to lawyers passing the baton onto them so that they can continue to hold people to account. There might also be some referrals to the bar association for the lawyers that have been involved in helping Trump engage in all these unlawful activities. So I think it is incredibly important that Congress is sending this type of message, even if it might be largely symbolic.",

If Trump were to go unpunished for this, that again sets a precedent of what people can do. We've seen this is what happens in countries when they start backsliding democratically. They are able to change the norms and defy our laws and rules. And now we're at a critical juncture, where Trump is no longer as popular as he was at one point. He still, to some extent, controls the Republican Party. But we saw with the 2018 midterms, he didn't do particularly well. He's struggling to even find a legal defense. So things aren't going his way and he also had the recent result, where the Trump Organization was found guilty by a jury trial on 17 counts of illegal activity. So the momentum is moving to indict. I know the special counsel is supposed to be completely unbiased and not bring in some of these political factors. But I think that things are moving that we'll see an indictment.

But in terms of the way the majority feel about Trump, I think this is more convincing evidence that he is just completely unfit to hold any kind of office, let alone the presidency. And I think this is a real problem for the Republicans because he is really tearing the party apart. They cannot win with him. And I think they -- people in the higher echelons of the Republican Party know that. But he will try to use this to his advantage, to get more people in his base behind him.
