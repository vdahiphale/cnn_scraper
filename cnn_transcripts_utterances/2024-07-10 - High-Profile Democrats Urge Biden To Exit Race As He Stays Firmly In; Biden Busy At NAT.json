The Biden camp says there is zero chance of that happening despite the building anxiety within the Democratic Party.Tonight, President Biden is busy hosting NATO leaders as the crisis surrounding his campaign threatens to overshadow the summit and the urgent international issues on the agenda. I'll ask key White House official John Kirby about the global scrutiny of the president and the challenges he's facing right now. Plus, Donald Trump is offering a potential clue about his choice of a running mate with the Republican National Convention now only five days away. Trump revealing he has an issue, his words, an issue with one vice presidential contender. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. We begin this hour with very fast moving developments as more Democrats are now pressuring President Biden to end his re-election bid. The actor, George Clooney, dropping his bombshell call for the president to step aside, and that's only intensifying the angst among Democrats in Congress who are publicly sounding the alarm. CNN's Manu Raju is standing by for us up on Capitol Hill. But, first, let's go to CNN's Kayla Tausche. She reports on the president facing these new defections as he hosts the NATO summit. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KAYLA TAUSCHE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice over): With world leaders at hand, President Biden eager to get back to business as usual. JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: Stronger supply chains, stronger economy, stronger military and a stronger nation. TAUSCHE: And the White House wants to move on from speculation about the president's political future. But for Democrats, the domino effect continues. Actor George Clooney penning an op-ed in the New York Times calling on Biden to step aside, writing, it's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe big F-ing deal Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. Filmmaker Rob Reiner joining Clooney writing on X democracy is facing an existential threat. We need someone younger to fight back. Joe Biden must step aside, and House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi noncommittal. REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short.",

And the White House in the time since that disastrous debate, I think, has done nothing to really demonstrate that they have a plan to win this election. An adviser to the president said few in Biden's inner circle are concerned enough to pierce Biden's firm position, only family could do that, and only if there's hard data. The adviser telling CNN of his wife and sister, Jill and Valerie won't let him go down in flames. Since the debate, CNN's poll of polls shows Trump leading Biden by five points, the first time this year the candidates are separated by a margin of more than three points. And some donors planning events in Chicago and Florida say they're now up in the air. But for Biden, it's full steam ahead for now.",

Tomorrow afternoon on the Senate side of the Capitol, there will be a briefing, a key briefing where members of the campaign will come and try to answer the many concerns that Democratic senators are raising behind the scenes, concerned about whether Joe Biden can actually keep the White House and whether he may go down and bring down their chances of keeping control of Congress as well.

From the moment I made my statement, I can't even count the emails, the texts, the phone calls from people saying, thank God, somebody had to say something. We have to do something about this. So, if you add up all the Democrats I would conservatively say 80, probably close to 90 percent of them want to see us have a different candidate.But do they want to say so publicly? That's a different thing. Some people have had trouble doing that. Some have felt like, well, gosh, if he's going to run anyway, what choice do we have? We have a choice.
