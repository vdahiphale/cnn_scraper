      "sentences": "You are live in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington. Good evening.A historic hurricane is barreling toward the southwestern U.S. You heard that right. Hilary is now a category 2 storm with powerful winds of more than 100 miles per hour. Parts of Southern California are under a tropical storm warning for the first time in the state's history. Officials are expecting widespread power outages and potentially catastrophic and life-threatening flooding. People on Catalina Island, just off the coast near L.A., are evacuating to Long Beach as officials urge visitors and residents to leave. And in San Bernardino County, the sheriff's department has issued an evacuation warning for parts of that area. Let's go straight to meteorologist Derek Van Dam in the CNN Weather Center. Derek, what can you tell us about Hilary right now? Picking up speed, slowing down? What's the latest?",

      "sentences": "Picking up speed, and that is important because if you're just tuning in, maybe perhaps intermittently from the West Coast or into Southern California, you may have thought, hey, maybe this is a Sunday night into Monday morning timeframe. Listen, right now is your last few moments to do your final preparations to secure your property, that type of thing, because this is more of a Sunday during the day timeframe, all right?That's when we anticipate the greatest impacts across Southern California. It will last through Monday morning but the greatest impact is certainly throughout the day on Sunday. 110-mile-per-hour winds. There is a lot that can be inferred from this satellite image and that is that we're starting to get a lot of dry air on the west side, so it's helping weaken the storm and the trajectory, starting to move quickly at 17 miles per hour out of the north northwest. So what this will do is it means that we will see an earlier landfall. Also the track has shifted a little bit further east compared to this time yesterday. So maybe perhaps a central or northern Baja Peninsula landfall before moving into Southern California. So this is going to lessen the wind impacts along the coastal areas, between San Diego and Los Angeles. Let me explain why that's important because you can actually see the winds coming out of a south easterly direction. This would be running basically parallel to the mountain ranges for some of these areas. And what will happen here is, as we advance this in time, as the winds change directions, it's literally going to extract all the available water out of the atmosphere. And it is going to produce a significant amount of heavy rain. So the flash flood threat cannot be overstated enough. It is just an incredible amount of rain. We have already seen precipitation values here exceeding two inches in some locations and we'll get significantly more rainfall from the San Bernardino County, specifically, over the eastern sections of that county have quite a flash flood threat. And here's the reason why. As we zoom into this part of Southern California, you'll notice that the mountains here, the transverse range into San Bernardino, these mountains here will actually work to almost like a wall. If you're pushing a sponge directly across a wall, it is going to take out all that water that's in the sponge and it's going to deposit it as rainfall. So that rain has to come down the valleys and into the communities below. These are some of the locations that have the mandatory evacuations. Mountain Home Village into Forest Falls, the Oak Glen Region. So we want to monitor that area very closely because rain is already ongoing across the eastern sections of San Bernardino County. But look. It's not just the southwest. It's all the way into Idaho, portions of Oregon, Nevada, into Utah. We have flash flood watches for over 25 million Americans. And so we still have another 36 hours of the heaviest of rain to come across this area -- Jim.",

Biloxi, Mobile, Pensacola, and so on.And you make the perfect point. If this is heading to the southwest, if it's heading to mountainous areas in California, those flash flood warnings, please take them very seriously because they can happen very quickly and just have deadly consequences. Derek, thank you very much. Appreciate that. Joining us now is Daniel DeSelms. He is the emergency operations manager for Palm Springs. Daniel, it's been more than 80 years since a storm like this hit Southern California. Is Palm Springs ready for a hurricane or a tropical storm to come in?

The former president and his 18 co-defendants are facing a Friday deadline to surrender in Fulton County, Georgia. They're accused there of conspiring to subvert the 2020 election results in that state. Sources tell CNN Trump is expected to surrender on either Thursday or Friday. The Fulton County sheriff says all 19 defendants will undergo the normal processing including mug shots and fingerprinting. And joining me now to talk about this and other aspects of the Trump cases is Democratic Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas. Congresswoman, thanks very much for spending a part of your weekend with us. Let me ask you this. This whole notion that Trump is going to be mug shotted, fingerprinted, and so on, what is that going to say to the world? What kind of message is that going to send to the world if we see that unfold? And it sounds like we are going to see it unfold in a few days from now. REP. SHEILA JACKSON LEE (D-TX): Well, Jim, thank you for having me. And I think what I would say on a Saturday afternoon, I wish both of us were not here discussing this topic because it is a former president of the United States who is now suffering or now experiencing indictments practically all over the nation from New York to Washington to Georgia. What the world will see is something that they have never seen before in current history of an American president. American presidents are held in high esteem. We may disagree with them politically. They run as Republicans and Democrats but the office itself has been held in the highest of esteem. We now have an individual who has been indicted in New York for charges of rape and sexual issues if you will against a woman, or convicted if you will in a civil case -- not convicted but held guilty in a civil case, found to be liable. And we have cases that is still pending in New York and Washington and now in Georgia. This is a state case. And no federal law or protection that the president needs, and he does have his protection is going to -- I assume -- stop him from going through the normal process that any criminal defendant will go through in the state of Georgia. But I will say, I am saddened to be here discussing this because what it does to the presidency of the United States, and frankly, as someone who was physically in the chamber on January 6th, 2021, saw the fear, saw the guns, heard the gunshot, saw the banging and screaming on the doors to get into the chamber. I am more stunned that that day did happen and that there couldn't be another respectful way that the former president could have expressed his opposition or his questions about the election. There have been questions about the elections since the time I was elected in the late 1990s. But it was handled in a way that followed the process of this government under the Constitution. He did not.",

We've always felt special in this country because the judiciary has been an independent judiciary for the federal government which Judge Chutkan is a part of, appointed for life. And then we do that so they cannot be subject to (INAUDIBLE) commentary.I've never seen this as a senior member in the House Judiciary Committee who has been involved in impeachments of judges. I have never seen this kind of outside attack. The former president called her biased and unfair, and gave the inference that she would not be handling his case of four counts of conspiracy under the special counsel fairly. And what does that do? Whether someone is sitting on their couch drinking or however they might be motivated, or others might be motivated, they've been given a signal that she is wrong and she is not right. I wish for her the best security, the safest way of moving around so that she can do her job, and she has to do her job without comment and she has indicated to the lawyers of Mr. Trump that he is going to be limited in receiving information or information that he might be able to comment on. And that's appropriate. As it relates to those of us in public office, I would simply say it's chilling for your family. It's chilling for your family. But I thank law enforcement who has really paid attention to this. And even though this individual may have certain issues, we don't know who else is thinking about it. The temperature needs to be brought down and the former president needs to be actively engaged in stopping the hysteria, and egging people on, provoking them to do things that are against the Constitution and the order of this nation. Law and order has to prevail not only for us but for them.",

It's a monumental issue, the most important constitutional issue of our day.

And so he's looking at one of his assistants, but they're all terrified of him. So you know, there is this really strange dynamic. It wasn't a respect towards the president, it was sheer fear towards him.
