And 3.4 percent it's like the lowest level it's been since 1969. So this report comes just two days after the Fed raised interest rates for the 10th consecutive time, all in an effort to rein in inflation. CNN business correspondent Rahel Solomon is with us now.

So 253,000 jobs added in the month of April, as you said this was stronger than almost every economist that was pulled was expecting also stronger than the months prior, unemployment rate falling to 3.4 percent.I want to put that 253,000 in perspective, we did get downward revisions for the prior two months, so a stronger than that. But you can see this is still historically strong growth, perhaps not as strong as during the pandemic. But in normal times, this is a renormalizing of the economy. So I want to show you 3.4 percent for unemployment, as you pointed out, sort of tying the 50-year low. John, we've been in this range of unemployment between 3.4 to 3.7, since March of 2022. So we've been really tight. And when you look at the sectors where we're seeing the strongest job growth, it's sectors like business, financial services, really strong hiring for accountants, a healthcare, I think nursing home facilities, that sort of thing also saw strong job growth, with leisure and hospitality, which of course, was battered by the pandemic. And all of this, despite those 10 interest rate hikes that you pointed out, despite 14 months of a very aggressive fed, that means we have still seen despite all of this, consumers continue to spend and companies continue to hire.",

They are still adding jobs, but parts of the economy that are more interest rate sensitive, not so much.I just talked to Julia Pollak. She's the Chief Economist of ZipRecruiter. And I asked her the same thing. And she said, you know, there's a funny situation going on, where you have a boom, and half the economy, and a bit of a bust in other parts of the economy and less than half of the economy, relatively low job gains in the production sector. So that's sort of what we're seeing. So if you are in parts of the economy that are more interest rate sensitive financial services, for example, certainly a tech, you might not be seeing this boom. But if you are working at a hotel or restaurant, that sort of thing, you're experiencing it.",

And so the university said that on the 25th, essentially, they separated him. That's what he's the university said, for academic reasons. And then you have all of the stabbings and then you have the community, of course, just so concerned about what's going on here.So a lot of people just breathing easily today and of course thinking about that one victim that survived who was severely injured, but it's still in the hospital.

But the Times reports prosecutors are hoping the person will help fill in some gaps about how the documents Trump took from the White House were handled, once they got to Mar-a-Lago.

And while that's a big headline, a cooperating witness of the story itself acknowledges this could be significant, but little is known about who this person is, and what they have provided beyond a photo of a storage space. Now that storage space is very significant, because we know that's where classified documents where time were stored. And they were eventually moved.But it's unclear if this person has provided any incriminating evidence or just some material that they would have access to in the course of their job at Mar-a-Lago, because as CNN has reported, pretty much anyone who works at Mar-a-Lago at this point has been subpoenaed from waiters and waitresses to people in operations all the way up to the head of security. So it's unclear when they say there's a cooperating witness. Is this someone who has flipped and could potentially expose the former president or aides to legal jeopardy? Or is this someone who's just complying with what has been requested of them by investigators. But the big story we broke on Wednesday is also significant because we now know that investigators, they're really focused on whether or not they have all of the security footage from Mar-a-Lago because that security footage is key to knowing what happened all these classified documents once they went down to Mar-a-Lago. We know that one of the things they have seen on that surveillance tape is a junior Trump aide, Walt Nauta, and another employee moving boxes out of a storage space. And yesterday, we also broke the news that Investigators spoke to Matthew Calamari Sr., He's a guy who's worked at the Trump Organization for decades. He's an Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer of the Trump Organization. He oversees security. And the reason they want to talk to him we learned is because he received a text message from Walt Nauta, asking him to talk. And investigators want to know what happened offline. And if there were any conversations about surveillance tape, and what happened after they sent a subpoena asking for that footage. Did they receive all of it? And did anyone tamper with it. So clearly, look, Sara, from our reporting from the headline in the New York Times. It's clear this investigation is far from over.",

A new report from \"The Washington Post\" this morning, they have reviewed documents showing Ginni Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, was paid tens of thousands of dollars for consulting work. \"The Post\" says it was all set up by conservative judicial activist Leonard Leo. They say Leo specified there should be quote, no mention of Ginni in any paperwork.According to \"The Post\" reporting, Leonard Leo advises a network of conservative nonprofits that work to support the nominations of conservative judges. And in January 2012, Leo told Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway to bill the judicial education project. \"The Post\" says he told Conway to then give Ginni Thomas another $25,000. They say document show, he emphasized that the paperwork should have quote, no mention of Ginni, of course. It's unclear exactly what Ginni Thomas did for Conway's polling firm or the judicial education project. Thomas has not commented for that report. CNN senior Supreme Court analyst Joan Biskupic has been looking into this. And Joan, it comes in the middle of all these questions about ethics inside the Supreme Court.",

This is just one more piece of awareness we're all getting about the very secretive world of the Supreme Court, and money surrounding the Supreme Court, individuals giving money to justices and questions being raised about why and does that actually influence the justices in cases?Let's start with what Leonard Leo has said in response to \"The Washington Post\" story. The work Ginni did here did not involve anything connected with either the courts business or with other legal issues, knowing how disrespectful, malicious and gossipy people can be, I have always tried to protect the privacy of Justice Thomas and Ginni. But let's just step back here, John, and remind people have who Leonard Leo is. Leonard Leo is arguably the most powerful person beyond the White House in Congress to have affected the federal judiciary. He was a Federalist Society leader. He helped handpick the three justices that Donald Trump put on the Supreme Court. So Leonard Leo is a very powerful individual. He's also a very good friend of Clarence Thomas' dating from 1990. But let's just then draw some distinctions between what we just learned from \"The Washington Post\" last night and what we learned from ProPublica, which has done very extensive reporting on the money that Republican billionaire Harlan Crow has given to Clarence Thomas for, you know, luxurious trips on his super yacht and private jet to all sorts of places across the globe, helped finance we learned most recently, a young grandnephew of Justice Thomas helped finance his private education. Now, those things from Harlan Crow probably should have been reported on Justice Thomas' financial disclosure forms. Money that flowed to Ginni right now, the way the justices financial disclosure forms are, that they don't -- spouses don't need to report that kind of information. But this all goes to the problem that the justices have with no formal ethics code, no watchdog able to see, are they even meeting their own standards. And that's why each of these instances is getting so much attention. And frankly, rightfully so, these people set the law of the land for the country, they do not abide by any formal ethics code. And I think what's happened is that they've just dependent on the fact that these instances fade over time. But the reality is that we're all becoming much more aware of the moneyed interests in the justices world and how much they can influence these individual justices. John?",

And there's a series of concerns here. One, you have an upcoming deadline to increase the country's debt ceiling.Yes, Democrats can do this on their own in the U.S. Senate with some Republican support but the argument coming from a lot of Democrats is it would be more helpful if they had an extra Democratic vote, that means that they could get one less Republican vote. You're also getting this renewed push from \"The New York Times\" editorial board, and I want to read you a piece of their piece earlier today. It said, quote, if members can't effectively represent their constituents, they should not hesitate to turn their job over to someone who can. Ms. Feinstein owes California a responsible decision. It's important to recognize that Senator Feinstein's impact on the Senate has been tremendous. And she served here for more than three decades. The argument coming from her office yesterday was that she hasn't caused a slowdown of the judicial nomination process, saying, quote, there has been no slowdown when I returned to the Senate, we will be able to move the remaining qualified nominees. But Sara, the issue is that there have been a number of judges in the pipeline ready to go to the Senate floor. What becomes a problem is, in the next couple of weeks, senators are going to run out of judges that have already been approved in the Senate Judiciary Committee to put on the floor. When that happens, expect that more of a pressure campaign is really going to mount because then the only judges they can get through the Judiciary Committee are going to be those that have Republican and Democratic support. And there's a number of nominees who need votes who are expected to just fall along party lines. That is what a lot of Democrats are arguing is the reasoning behind this renewed push to ask Senator Feinstein to retire. Sara?",
