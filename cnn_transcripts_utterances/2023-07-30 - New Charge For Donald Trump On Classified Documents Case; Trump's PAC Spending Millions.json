The former president took to social media today to deny that security footage from Mar-a-Lago was deleted. But that's not what prosecutors have accused here.They allege that he was part of an attempt to delete the footage. Prosecutors say a Mar-a-Lago property manager, Carlos de Oliveira, urged another employee to scrub the footage saying that quote, \"the boss, aka Trump, wanted the entire server deleted.\" De Olivera is accused of lying to investigators about moving classified documents at the resort and the indictment alleges that the desire to have this footage deleted was all aimed at trying to conceal critical information from investigators. De Olivera is due in federal court tomorrow morning. Now, Trump also says that the footage was voluntarily handed over. That's also not true. It was subpoenaed. This weekend, Trump has been on the campaign trail and on the attack. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Orange buoys four feet in diameter and anchored to the riverbed, as well as concertina wire stop them at the Eagle Pass border in Texas. A migrant family from Venezuela says they have been in Piedras Negras on the Mexican side of the border, gauging the risk of trying to cross the river with young children in tow. What we have seen is that people have gotten hurt with the razor wire, he says, adding that they're thinking twice. before taking any risk. But his wife says the family fled Venezuela for reasons that are much more compelling than floating barriers, including crime, extortion, and living under a dictatorship. Others say barriers or not, returning home is not an option. This migrant father traveling with his wife and young son says the buoys and razor wire are indeed going to make it more difficult to cross, but their mission, he says, remains unchanged, making it to the United States, barriers or not.
