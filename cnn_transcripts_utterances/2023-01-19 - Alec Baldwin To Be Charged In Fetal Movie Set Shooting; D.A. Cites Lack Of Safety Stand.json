      "sentences": "We'll begin the hour with breaking legal news. Prosecutors in New Mexico just last hour announcing Alec Baldwin, along with the film's armor will be charged with involuntary manslaughter in that fatal shooting on the set of the western movie Rust.Let's bring in CNN entertainment reporter Chloe Melas, CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig, and criminal defense attorney, former prosecutor Bernarda Villalona. Chloe, let me start with you. We have been waiting and waiting for the district attorney to finish the investigation. These new charges against two key players, including Alec Baldwin. Walk us through what we know so far. CHLOE MELAS, CNN ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER: Well look, Alec Baldwin facing two counts of involuntary manslaughter. And from everything that I am hearing from Alec Baldwin's legal team, they feel blindsided. And in a statement to CNN just moments ago, they're saying that this decision distorts Halyna Hutchins tragic death and represents a terrible miscarriage of justice. They go on to say that Baldwin had no reason to believe that there was a live bullet on the set or anywhere and especially not in the gun. You know, John, I sat down with Alec Baldwin in August, and he told me in that sit down interview that he did not believe that he would be charged, and he was adamant that he did not know there was a live bullet in the gun. He doesn't know how one got to the set, and that he had nothing to do with hiring those people who he believes were responsible for making sure that an accident like this didn't happen. So, we know, based on this statement from Alec Baldwin's attorney, they say at the end, we will fight these charges and we will win. We know that he will not be accepting a plea deal like Dave Halls the assistant director on the set. We know that he will see this through to a jury trial and that he will like they say fight these charges and we will win. We know that Alec Baldwin is currently in New York City with his family. We are waiting to hear from him potentially. But this was not something that he was expecting, especially so we know, John, that he was set to go back and finish filming the movie, because the proceeds, the profits from that film were going to go to Halyna Hutchins' family and a settlement that was just reached a few months ago.",

We don't even have the actual indictment yet.BERNARDA VILLALONA, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY &amp; FORMER PROSECUTOR: There's still a lot of questions. The question should have been - should have been this been a civil case or criminal case, but here we are as a criminal case. So, we have no answer as to the number one key question, how did those live cartridges get on the set? There are no answers to that. However, we should be hearing more information once the preliminary hearing takes place because the prosecution is going to have to pull on some evidence to be able to hold this case court, for court, for trial, that there's enough evidence for Alec Baldwin and Miss Gutierrez to continue on to a criminal trial.",

And that includes Alec Baldwin, she says that the armorer simply just weren't up to the job. Listen?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CARMACK-ALTWIES: There was such a lack of safety and safety standards on that set. That there were live rounds on set.

And if you're the prosecutor, you are going to want somebody who was part of that set, who was there, who can testify about the way things were handled and were not handled.So, it seems to me likely that he will be testifying, I guess we will learn those details as we go. It looks like the prosecutors are trying to paint a sort of totality of the circumstances case here. They're trying to point to all the different lapses in saying and they will argue ultimately to a jury, when you take them all together, that gets us over the line of negligence. And again, this will be a very human reaction, a very human calculation. And by the way, one thing that I think we should look for is, we will see expert testimony. We will see testimony from other actors, from other people who are film production professionals saying, here's what ought to be done normally. Here's what was not done in this case.",

However, when there's a chance that you think that a jury may be able to have argument as to one charge.Or the second charge, they decided to present both charges and let the jury decide which is the final charge that this person should be found guilty of? Is it the full negligence or whether Alec Baldwin should have done something extra before handling that final firearm, before deciding to put his finger on the trigger even though he says he didn't pull it.",

It doesn't necessarily mean the prosecution's case is doomed to fail. But yes, you can count on the defense lawyer standing up in front of the jury and saying, they can't even tell you how this all happened.And there's an interesting sort of contradiction here or tension between the positions that Alec Baldwin has that. He may make the argument. Chloe just laid this out, as an actor there were many other people who I reasonably relied on to make sure that gun was safe, and therefore there was no negligence. But those questions that Chloe just laid out, really go back to Alec Baldwin's role as the producer who may have had responsibility for those very same issues.",

Those steps by perhaps four months for the Congress in the White House to take a step that was once routine. Now though, the debt limit debate is riddled with rancor all the more so this year. The new Republican House Majority vows to hold firm and not move the ceiling one penny unless those House Republicans say it is coupled with spending cuts. The White House says no, it will not negotiate. It's a brand-new CNN reporting this hour, spells out just how hard a time the White House will have, winning the cooperation of even a small number of House Republicans.

With me to share the reporting and their insights, NPR's Asma Khalid, Tarini Parti of The Wall Street Journal, Tia Mitchell of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, and Jeanna Smialek of The New York Times.So, the United States, if it fails to raise its debt limit, here are some of the potential consequences. You default on your debt, even the prospect of defaulting on your debt is going to rattle financial markets. If you get to that point, there could be, could be delayed payments to federal workers, delayed social security checks, delayed what veterans' benefits. You wrote a very smart piece on this where you quote the former Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, saying there's no good plan. And he says, it's a more dangerous time than ever before to test it. What does he mean by that, more dangerous time than ever, because of the global economic uncertainty, because of the new House Republicans, both?",

We're in a situation where we've seen several big meltdowns over the last couple of years, just because of the way, you know, the stock market and bond markets are shaping up. So that's risky.The dollars importance in the global economy is arguably more central than ever before because we're implementing these sanctions against Ukraine, relying on the fact that the dollar is so central to the global economy. So, anything that plays with that centrality is pretty dangerous at this moment. And then I think he was worried that there is just more of a chance that this gets to a dangerous zone where we could make a mistake, where we could accidentally sort of trip into that realm of default.

Here's one of them. Will they hold is the question.Here's one of them. This is Dusty Johnson of South Dakota. What in the world are we doing here? If we're not willing to have a serious conversation about spending, and that is going to mean some tension with the Senate, there's going to be some tension with the other party. He says, I'm not concerned about that tension. You don't have to be concerned about it today or next week. We stress drags on weeks and into a month or more than maybe you do. TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, THE ATLANTA JOURNAL- CONSTITUTION: Yes. And I think that's where there's risk of the White House kind of losing some support by taking such a no negotiation position, because at the end of the day, there is some correlation between your debt and your spending, you're spending leads to your debt. And I think the people who are at home are looking at Congress. They're not just looking at the White House, but they're looking at Congress, and they're saying, we have to control our spending because we only have so much we can put on our credit card, you need to do the same, Republicans understand that.

Do more moderate centrist Democrats or independents in the Senate, find some way to do a modest spending reduction. And then the White House says, well, we didn't do this, but OK.[12:25:00] SMIALEK: I think you've already seen evidence that this can be sort of the direction we're headed in. You know, Manchin has already been out there talking about this from the World Economic Forum in Davos. This is clearly top of mind for some of the moderates. And that could be an off ramp for the White House. I will say, adding to Tarini's point, though, I think you have to think about the politics of this for the White House in some ways. We saw both in the 2011 debt ceiling debacle, and in the 90s, that when Republicans hold the debt limit hostage, they tend to get blamed for it. And so, I think that's probably a relevant thing that we need to keep in mind as we move forward through this process.",
