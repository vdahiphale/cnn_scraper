And so Mark Meadows and Mike Roman, a former Trump campaign aide, they both entered not guilty pleas today. They are facing nine felonies each. One of conspiracy and multiple counts for fraudulent schemes and forgery. And look, they both appeared on camera. They were virtual. There were people in the courtroom who were wearing the orange jumpsuits because they had to be there in person. Meadows and Roman both got the luxury of being able to come virtually.

But, Brianna, it -- for those who haven't had the -- really the chance to come to Normandy -- and I would encourage everyone to do so -- what you can appreciate is the gratitude of the French people here. There are banners in every village. \"Thank you, America. Thank you for our freedom.

The fact that only 11 out of the 31 NATO allies are meeting the bare minimum of 2 percent of their GDP, I think it's incredibly alarming. I'm talking the big economies of France and Germany and Italy. And we can be friends and allies but have tough conversations. From the U.S. perspective, we literally just can't afford it, to subsidize European defense any longer with the growing threat of China, with the recruiting crisis, with a readiness crisis in our own military.
