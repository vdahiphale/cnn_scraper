Things month over month are costing us less today than they were last month. This is something that so many people have been waiting for, not to mention the White House, to try and prove that their economic policies are working.You know, this wasn't a dramatic kind of slip, but really a pivotal point. And why? When you look at the year over year, it is at 3 percent. That's much cooler than people were expecting, especially when you combine it with that month over month number. I think about it, Sara, in 2022, as we were still trying to recover from the pandemic, inflation was over nine 9 percent in that year and people were really feeling it. This really lends itself to perhaps an interest rate cut in September. Some people, if you can believe it, Sara, are even banking there could be one this month that will really help people out with their interest rates in terms of mortgages or car loans, what have you. That will really make a difference to this economy. The other thing, and, remember, the Federal Reserve, and the chair, Jay Powell, has two (INAUDIBLE) inflation down to its target, which is (INAUDIBLE) close to that yet, but we're getting there in terms of the trend, but also it does require it to keep unemployment low. Last month unemployment ticked up to 4.1 percent. That is actually a good read, Sara. It means that the labor market is more imbalanced and it should keep a lid on inflation for all. Sara.",

If you're Clooney and you hold this fundraiser -- I've talked to several people who were now at that fundraiser from several weeks ago, they all came away worried about Biden, noticing how frail he was on stage, concerned about his well-being. And you can understand why in the lead-up to the debate some of those staunch Democrats kept their voices quiet. They kept their voices down at that time because they wanted to see how he would perform at the debate.But now, in the wake of the debate and the last two weeks, they feel confident to come forward.

And all that's been ripped off now. You can't unsee what's going on here. And that's fundamentally the problem for Biden. We see that in the new ABC poll that only 15 percent of people think he's appropriate of an age for this job. The reality here, Sara, is that most Americans don't want Trump or Biden.
