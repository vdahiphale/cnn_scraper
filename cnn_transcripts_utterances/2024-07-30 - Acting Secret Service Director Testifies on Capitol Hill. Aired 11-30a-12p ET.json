And I think you described the very rigorous process by which people are screened. And I think you mentioned the 2 percent standard. People who are interested in serving, only a very small fraction of those individuals are actually accepted in the Secret Service because of the high standards that your agency has. But explain to me why the Secret Service, being an elite law enforcement agency, would delegate to local law enforcement or others who did not meet that same 2 percent standard.

You can see in that photo in exhibit A, which we will make part of the record and turn over to the committee, he's already crossed over that bridge or the walkway and stepped up onto that roof.

Who was responsible for tracking down that suspicious person who fit the profile, 10 to 25 years old, young male. The FBI has warned us about it. Year after year after year, Director Wray has come before us and said:  The threat is from domestic extremism, the lone gunman. We're all aware of it in law enforcement. So I think we need individual accountability here, and people need to be held responsible, in fact, lose their jobs, if necessary, to send a message that this massive intelligence and surveillance failure, as well as the enforcement failure, cries out for accountability.
