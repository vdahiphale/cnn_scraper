Both men served in the military.One of the interesting things to me about these separate incidents is when you're dealing with people who do have military backgrounds, it does kind of change the type of threat that they could potentially be.

The reason lone wolf is such a significant terrorist threat, and has been for years, by the way, and the U.S. government is very aware of that, that we used to say that when I worked in counterterrorist financing, lone wolf was at the top of our terrorist threat list. And the reason is that they're so impossible to identify, monitor, and track.And so even though, for example, you were talking about the FBI and while maybe the FBI slipped on this, I don't know that I would even say that. They do such a remarkable job in identifying threats and thwarting plotter, plots that we don't even see or hear about. And Christopher Wray for the last year has been saying there are flashing lights everywhere, excuse me, especially since October 7. And so when it comes to the lone wolf, they're harder to track because they're inspired. They're not in touch with somebody we're tracking, like an official from a terrorist group. They are using whatever weapon they can get at their hands on, so a car, a truck, something they can cheaply fabricate. And sometimes we don't even -- people don't even notice the activity until it's too late. So, for that, we have to rely and educate family members, citizens, just citizens across the United States, if you see somebody behaving weirdly perhaps being radicalized, saying something, some kind of violent rhetoric, please share this with the FBI, and I think that's what we have to do.",

And someone who wants to commit an act like what we've just seen in the last two days, they just need to be lucky once. And I think over the last few years, what we've seen is the game has changed. So ISIS, in 2015, 2016, 2017 was a very different ISIS than the ISIS we see today. They were more like a nation state. They wanted to control territory. But ISIS today is very different. It's an ideology. It's like a franchise model. They want to inspire lone wolves. And so the threat has changed. And meanwhile, what's happened is the CIA and other counterterrorism organizations have shifted a lot of their resources from C.T. to China or Russia.
