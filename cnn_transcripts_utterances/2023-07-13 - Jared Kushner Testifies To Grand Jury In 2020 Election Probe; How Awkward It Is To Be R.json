Is Ron DeSantis the new Jeb Bush exclamation point? It turns out the safest place on earth to hide your stash is the White House. I am John Berman and this is CNN TONIGHT or CNN very nearly tomorrow. And tomorrow, we might still be counting the new developments in the investigation into Donald Trump because they have been coming in every few minutes. Jared Kushner before the grand jury, Hope Hicks before the grand jury, Alyssa Farah Griffin before federal prosecutors, and we will get to all of it. But at the center of it, three major questions that perhaps reveal what the special counsel is up to. Now, a warning to our viewers, these might seem insultingly obvious or simple, but they are legally pivotal. Number one, did Donald Trump know he lost the election? Number two, did Donald Trump say he lost the election? Number three, how on earth could he not have known he lost the election, and are you actually serious this could be a viable defense? This is at the forefront tonight as CNN has confirmed that the president's son-in-law testified before the grand jury investigating Donald Trump's actions around January 6th. \"The New York Times\" reports he was asked, Jared Kushner was asked, if he ever heard Trump acknowledge he lost the election. The \"Times\" says Kushner is said to have maintained that it was his impression that Mr. Trump truly believed the election was stolen, according to a person briefed on the matter. However, we also know that former Trump communication director and CNN contributor, Alyssa Farah Griffin, has been interviewed by federal prosecutors, and she earlier told the January 6 Committee that Trump said to her after the election -- quote -- \"Can you believe I lost to Joe Biden?\" There are also new developments in the Mar-a-Lago documents case with the special counsel lashing out at the Trump team for the request to delay the trial. We are going to have more on that shortly. First, what did Trump know and how could he not have known it? With me here, Michael Cohen, Donald Trump's former attorney, host of the \"Mea Culpa\" podcast, principal of Crisis Acts, and author of \"Revenge.\" But first, Michael stand by, I want to bring in CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig. Elie, I want to break down this line of questioning. I want to set the legal framework for this discussion. Why is the special counsel asking people, did Donald Trump know he lost the election?",

Bill Barr told him that he lost. Ivanka Trump told him that he lost. That is okay. But the problem with that is that there are other people, maybe delusional people, but other people, Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell telling him, no, you didn't lose, there has been massive fraud and you need to fight it.

From \"Rolling Stone\" earlier, Murdochs start to sour on Ron DeSantis. They can smell a loser.You know the old saying, with thoughts like this, who needs enemies? That is, well, awkward. The terrific political reporter, Mckay Coppins, notes -- quote -- \"Anything could happen but it is remarkable how the DeSantis hyped cycle has followed the 2015 Scott Walker trajectory almost beat for beat. Now, that is not a comparison any Republican would want. Walker went nowhere. He is on the Mount Rushmore of GOP candidates who are supposed to be all that and turned out all dud. Jeb Bush explanation point. You can clap now. Or for history buffs, John Connally in 1980 spent upwards of $11 million, that's 40 million in today's dollars, and famously ended up with a single delegate, Ida Mills of Arkansas. It's a lot of shade for DeSantis who is still number two in all of the polls with all kinds of money. But the \"Politico\" piece says donors -- quote -- \"faith in the Florida governor has been shaken by early campaign missteps and his hardline positions on abortion, transgender rights and other culture war issues.\" So that might be the why, but how about the what's next? Well, CNN has confirmed that donors, including one-time DeSantis backers, are meeting with South Carolina Senator Tim Scott. Both DeSantis and Tim Scott will be at the family leadership summit tomorrow in Iowa. Yes, tomorrow's news tonight. And that could be awkward. Why? Because NBC reports that there is a new DeSantis campaign memo that mentions Scott. It reads -- quote -- \"While Tim Scott has earned a serious look at this stage, his bio is lacking the fight that our electorate is looking for in the next president. We expect Tim Scott to receive appropriate scrutiny in the weeks ahead.\" If you follow the bouncing ball there, DeSantis donors meet with Scott, DeSantis campaign swipes at Scott. There are few coincidences in politics. So, just how awkward will it be in Iowa? With me now is Jay Michaelson, he is a \"Rolling Stone\" columnist, and David Urban, CNN political commentator and former Trump campaign advisor. Gentlemen, I appreciate you being with us. I'm going to ask this if you bear with me in the form of multiple choice questions. We've been doing that.",
