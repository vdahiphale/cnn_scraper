We will begin this hour in Paris for a day of great Olympic sport but also some disappointment. The world's top male triathletes are waiting at least one more day for their big event. Organizers are postponing the men's triathlon until Wednesday due to poor water quality levels in the river Seine. Now this comes despite months of work and massive amounts of money to get that river in shape for swimming. In addition to polluted waters, France gap grappling with very high temperatures this week and forecasts of more rain. Well joining me now to discuss is CNN's Melissa Bell she is in Paris, \"World Sports\", Amanda Davies is also with us to discuss the competitions that are going ahead today. And they are big standby and let start with Melissa, the men's individual triathlon race and postponed until at least Wednesday perhaps even longer.

In fact, we've had three days of relatively dry weather even if it is very hot and humid, and that hope organizers will continue to improve the pollution levels in the Seine. So, you're quite right this morning, the men were preparing to have the swimming their triathlon begin here in the Seine River behind me that had to be postponed. It will now be the men's and the women's that will take place tomorrow morning. In theory what happens is the water will be tested throughout the day. And we will hear in the very early hours of tomorrow morning whether there's pollution levels or down at the right level in order that these races can take place safety. First, the women's from about 08:00 a.m. than the men's at 10:45.

She was horrified as an athlete, a former athlete at the prospect of being cut to a duathlon. She said, that's just not the event. It's not what they trained for it. It would be so ludicrously unfair. But yeah, in terms of today, there is still so much to get excited about although there's not much confirmation or compensation is there for the triathletes, but it's all about Simone Biles and Team U.S.A. and in the Gymnastics Hall. Of course, this is the chance for redemption really as it's being billed three years on from the twisties hitting in Tokyo she is back in competition despite the concerns about the ankle and calf injury that we saw the bandages that she was wearing on Sunday and qualifying rounds she is due to compete in all four disciplines are with her teammates. As Team U.S.A. tried to get their hands back on the gold that they lost in Tokyo three years ago to the Russian Federation. They are very much the favorites for this event. The team have been doing all they can to really shield Biles from that feeling that it is on her that she is carrying the weight of this team. But she says she's ready, she celebrated with the men's equivalent who won their first team gymnastics medal in 16 years last night, they're celebrating their success on social media with the hashtag LFG. I won't explain it for reasons you well know but that's what that's her motivation heading into today's event. The tennis going on as well. We've got Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz in doubles action, but disappointment for Coco Gauff U.S. team flagbearer at the opening ceremony, of course, she's had such a spectacular couple of years on the tennis court. She was a runner up here in Paris at the French Open in 2022. She has won the doubles here, but there were high hopes that she would make a deep run in the singles competition, but she's just been knocked out in the third round by Donna Vekic haven't been five to up and with a set point in the first set.

It is stifling outside. And yeah, this heat means business. Fortunately, it's a short duration heatwave, but let me explain because this will have impacts on both the spectators and the athletes. Right now, the mercury in the thermometers at 34, you factor in the humidity, it feels like 37. The actual temperature could range anywhere from 35 to 37 degrees later this afternoon. Again, this is the heat index. So, it's a different value when you factor in the humidity levels but anywhere you slice it, it is hot. And that means it's dangerous for not only spectators but also athletes who exert themselves to their body's extremes under these types of conditions. So, media France, this is the agency that forecast the weather advises the International Olympic Committee on advancing heat waves and severe weather. They have a level two of four in and around Paris, where the majority of the Olympic venues are taking place, heatwave alerts for today. Why is Paris so vulnerable? Well, simply it comes down to the dense urban environment. This amplifies the heat across the City of Paris.

Now you may remember the 6-3 ruling earlier this month did not fully dismiss and indictment charging Trump with plotting to overturn the 2020 election but it did strip away elements of the case against him.

I want to bring in CNN's Chief Supreme Court Analyst Joan Biskupic, she wrote this report and joins us live from Washington.

And your happiness was something that was more fundamental to who you are, it was more spiritual. And you know, it was something you had to work on, and money wasn't going to make a big difference.

And we know that it is a detention facility where some prisoners from Gaza have been detained and questioned over recent months. Now, there was a CNN investigation back in May. The CNN investigation spoke to a number of Israeli whistle blowers also former Palestinian detainees from that facility and they do describe widespread abuse for example blindfolding extreme physical restraint and prolonged handcuffing. Now, the Israeli Prime Minister has told the Supreme Court that this will no longer be a long-term imprisonment facility. They are changing the nature of this facility following allegations that this is an ongoing investigation. We understand that the Israeli military saying that they are investigating a number of Israeli soldiers. Now what we have seen from these videos is that far right elements of Israeli society of the Israeli political scene as well do not appreciate that investigation. They are against the probe and we saw one particular far right lawmaker Zvi Sukkot actually breached the perimeter of this detention facility, he slipped through the bars outside and went inside the facility. This has been condemned by the Israeli military pointing out that this is a great distraction at a time when Israel is trying to weigh up options when it comes to Hezbollah on the northern border. So, it also at the same time, Becky, does highlight and show a stark illustration of the divides within the Israeli political lecture on at the moment and reminds us all that the prime minister is very much reliant on these more far right elements within his coalition to stay in power, Becky.",
