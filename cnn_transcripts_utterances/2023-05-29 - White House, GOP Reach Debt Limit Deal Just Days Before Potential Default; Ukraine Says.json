Today, the president and first lady will participate in a wreath-laying ceremony there, a very important one, as well as giving remarks after that. We are going to bring that to you live right here on CNN News Central.The clock is ticking, but there are some real signs of progress, a breakthrough in the negotiations over the debt ceiling over the weekend, a deal among the leaders. But will the other lawmakers follow their lead? One week from today, the United States could default on its debt, which would be unprecedented, as we have talked about so much. President Biden, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, they struck the debt limit deal this weekend, and the Republican-led House is expected to vote on Wednesday. The agreement would do a lot of stuff, but includes suspending the debt limit for about a year-and-a-half, through January 1st, 2025. And, importantly, that pushes of this debate until after the election. Right now, leaders on both sides of the aisle are working to convince their members to get on board. Let's check in and see where that stands in this moment. CNN's Lauren Fox is on Capitol Hill, Arlette Saenz is at the White House. Laurent, what are hearing from Republicans about this deal? We know that there's a lot -- there's a wide range but where are they today?",

The reality is that Kevin McCarthy as well as Hakeem Jeffries are probably going to lose some of the members on the far right of the Republican conference and on the far left of the progressive caucus. That is just part of the strategy here. They always knew they were going to have to thread the needle through the middle. So, that is where the focus is right now, with around the clock briefings trying to get Democrats read-in on all the specifics that are part of this deal.We expect that White House officials are going to be continuing those briefings today. There also were some briefings last night over some of these details for Senate Republicans, for Senate Democrats. We are told that those briefings both went well, although we should note there was some concern raised in the Senate Republican briefing about the defense spending, arguing from some Republicans that this number was just not high enough. So, that gives you a sense of the fight ahead. Like you noted, the vote is expected to take place in the House on Wednesday, and things could move quickly in the Senate if there is a unanimous consent to do that. But any one Republican senator can really slow this process down. So, they're going to be right up against that deadline. Kate?",

      "sentences": "All right. This morning, Ukraine says it successfully shot down 11 ballistic and cruise missiles Russia launched into Kyiv, the capital, right here. This was a rare daytime attack, and it was using the Iskander missile. About 11 of these mobile short range ballistic missiles, this is what Ukraine says it shot down. It followed an attack overnight that used different weaponry, largely the Iranian- provided Shahed drone.Now, Ukraine promises swift retaliation for this latest round of attacks. And we've seen a little bit of what the Ukrainians can do lately. They launched another over the border air attack on Belgorod inside Russia. And interestingly enough, they also hit the Russians in Russian occupied towns. This is part of Ukraine Berdiansk here, and Mariupol, the Russians have been in there since last spring. Joined now by CNN Military Analysts and retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton. Cedric, we have video I can show people of this attack in Kyiv, and you could see it's just broad daylight here. And in the video of this, you can also hear just the booms overhead. Why a daylight attack, and also why the range of weaponry that the Russians are using now, all these different kinds of missiles? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Yes, John. I think the biggest thing that you're dealing with here is the Russians are throwing everything they've got at the Ukrainians. They want to throw them off balance. And it's unusual to do a daily attack. So, that very fact that it's not a normal time for these kinds of things, normally, you do it at night or in the early morning hours before dawn, this is the kind of thing that the Russians want to do. They want to make it seem to the Ukrainians that no place is safe for them, and that's why they did it at this point in time. BERMAN:  So, Colonel, we've been pointing out for several weeks now that Belgorod, which is inside Russia -- I'm going to put the border up here so people can see, this is a border between Ukraine and Russia. Belgorod is a key transport point for troops, Russian troops going into Ukraine and also supplies, that has been a target for some time. What appears to be a little new is the Ukrainians targeting the Russian-occupied cities of Mariupol and Berdiansk. Why do you think the Ukrainians might be targeting those cities now?",

One of them is both Mariupol and Berdiansk are port cities, and they do have the capability to serve, as you mentioned, as transshipment points for the Russian forces that are occupying that southern part of Ukraine.So, what the Ukrainians are doing is they are taking the war to those supply areas. They're using longer range weaponry because they can actually affect the transport of those materials, those war materials, to the frontline. And what they can also do is they can interdict that, which means basically cut off the supply lines to the Russian forces that are deployed in that area.",

This was always going to be a big trial by fire for the airlines, especially after the staffing shortages that they had last year led to 55,000 cancelations. And it all kicked off on Memorial Day, stretched all the way to Labor Day. Also going to be a big test because of the number of people who have been traveling, 2.72 million people passed through security at America's airports on Friday. That is the highest number we have seen since the depths of the pandemic. Many days lately are bigger than the same day back in 2019 before the pandemic. The good news here is that the cancelations had been relatively low in total from Thursday to today, about 600 cancelations in total. Compare that to Memorial Day last year, airlines canceled about 2,700 flights. Passengers here tell me that that issue of all of the problems last year, they're still thinking about it.

But the COVID-?19 pandemic really did exacerbate the problem.And now ,what we're really finding is facilities and venues are faced with an immediate problem to staff the current needs of the facility. But, really, the cycle is broken in a lot of these facilities and venues. A lot of these kids grew up in going through swim lessons and spending time at the beach or the community pool and then eventually going on to that lifeguard training. And during the Pandemic when a lot of facilities and venues were closed, that broke the cycle. So, now, a lot of these lifeguards we had prior to the Pandemic have moved on to other employment and we're still back filling those roles.

But with the lifeguard shortage, it is people to keep important for people to keep in mind their own safety around the water.And we encourage at the NDPA following our five layers of protection, that includes for backyard pools and venues around your home, making sure there're barriers and restricting access to that water. 70 percent of our toddlers are drowning during non-swim time. So, a lot of times, that's them escaping the home, so making sure we're restricting access, if we are going to an unguarded venue, making sure we're actively supervising, make sure there's a water watcher in place at all times. If you can get your children into swim lessons, it's never too late. Learning to swim is a critical means of reducing the risk of drowning. And then if you're going to natural water venues, a life jacket is always a good idea. And then, five, this is why our lifeguards are there, be prepared for emergencies.
