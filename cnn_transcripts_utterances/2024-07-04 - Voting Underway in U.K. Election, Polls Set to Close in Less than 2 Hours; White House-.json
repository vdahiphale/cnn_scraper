      "sentences": "Yes, hey Brianna, that's right. Voting has been underway throughout the course of the day. The polls will be closed in about an hour and a half from now, at which point we'll get the first exit poll, which will give us a pretty good idea, I think, on what the outcome of this election will be.In terms of the turnout, well, we haven't got turnout figures yet, but I mean, I went to a polling station this morning very early and turnout seemed to be brisk. There's a lot of people lining up ready to cast their votes. If there are still people waiting in line at 10 o'clock this evening, they will still be allowed to vote. But, Brianna, all of the exit polls leading up to this voting day have pointed to a landslide victory for the opposition Labour Party, bringing to an end 14 years of Conservative Party rule in the country. It's not something that is, you know, it's something that will be a momentous change for the people of Britain because this country has been governed by the Conservative Party for so many years. But such is the disillusionment with people in Britain, according to the opinion polls, that the move towards the Labour Party, which is a left of center, it's a left-wing socialist-leaning political party in this country, is likely to be dramatic. We're talking about more than, you know, 200-seat majority in the country's parliament. And to give you some perspective on that, that's not just the best result for Labour in recent memory, it's the best result in British politics for any single party if that comes to pass. And so we're talking about a momentous shift in the political landscape in Britain as a result of this general election -- Brianna.",

People in those constituencies, they vote for a range of candidates and the winner goes on to become an MP. So each constituency sends an MP. So there's 650 MPs that will result from the election across the country. In order to get power in the country to form a government, you need to have, you know, just over 50 percent. You have to have a simple majority. So 650, that's 326 seats you need to form a government.And as I was saying, the opinion polls going into this election suggest that the Labour Party is going to get well over that figure. And so we're looking at a Labour landslide. In terms of when we'll know the results, there'll be an exit poll at 10 o'clock this evening, in just under an hour and a half from now, which is likely to be pretty accurate. They often are. But the final results then won't be in until about seven or eight, perhaps nine hours later, as the individual constituencies start to declare who was won in that particular area. And so a picture will build across the night of which party is victorious. Again, it's likely to be the Labour Party, but the extent of that victory will become apparent as the night carries on.",
