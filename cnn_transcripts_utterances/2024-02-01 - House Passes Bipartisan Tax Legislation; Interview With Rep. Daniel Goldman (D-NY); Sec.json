In -- back in December in your speech at the Reagan Library, you told Israeli leaders they have to protect civilian lives in Gaza. Since that speech, 12,000 more Palestinians have been killed. We're now at 27,000 killed. Why are you still supporting this war when this government that is the most extreme in the history of Israel, led by someone who refuses to recognize any political right for the Palestinians and with elements that are calling for ethnic cleansing and displacement of Palestinians? Do Palestinians have the right to dignity, as you said in Angola when I was with you on the trip? You said the future belongs to those who protect dignity, not trample it.",

This is -- there's no question that this is a tough -- has been a tough conflict. But we're -- as I said earlier, we are starting to see the Israelis kind of shift their stance and change their approach to a more focused and controlled -- control is probably not the right way, but a more focused effort focused on a discrete set of objectives. And so I think -- we talked to them about that weeks ago, and they said they were going to do that, and they are doing that. But I will continue to emphasize and I know Secretary Blinken and President Biden will continue to emphasize the importance of addressing the issue of the Palestinian people. It's critical.

      "sentences": "Well, John, forgive me if I need to look down at my notes here, because this was a very extensive press briefing, arguably the longest that we have ever gotten from Secretary Austin since he became the secretary.And he went through a lot here. He spoke about how he desired privacy after his cancer diagnosis. He was visibly limping to the podium. He's now using a golf cart to get around. He is apparently recovering from a leg injury that resulted from his complications from this prostate surgery. And he essentially issued a mea culpa. And he said, I am sorry. The American people have a right to know when their leaders are facing health challenges. And he did say that he did not offer to resign, nor did his chief of staff, who was kind of embroiled in this as well, because she did not inform the president until days later that he was in the hospital. And he also said that he is going to commit to being as transparent as possible moving forward, even though elements of this 30-day review that the Pentagon is carrying out will probably be classified. And so the public may not to get to see all of the details about what went wrong here. But he says that he is going to commit to doing better in the future. Now, I do want to get a little bit to his response to the Jordan attack that killed three U.S. service members. He did start out at the top there conveying his condolences to the families of those service members who were killed. And he also explicitly said that these attacks were carried out by -- quote -- \"radical militias backed by Iran.\" He said, we believe that it was done by the -- quote -- \"Axis of Resistance,\" which is this umbrella group of Iran-backed proxy groups inside Iraq. But he said the U.S. doesn't know at this point how much Iran knew or didn't actually know about this attack. But he went into a little bit also about the response that the U.S. is planning to that attack. He said that response is likely to be multitiered, something that we have heard from other officials in recent days, and that the U.S. can continue to respond a number of times to these provocations. And in a notable quote, he said: \"They have a lot of capabilities, but I have a lot more,\" so obviously signaling that the U.S. response to these attacks is going to be very forceful and very strong and warning these groups that they have a significant response here coming.",

In that press conference, for as much contrition as Austin was offering, there were still a number of unanswered questions about how exactly this breakdown in communication occurred. And even Austin himself said he's not exactly sure what happened in the days between when he was hospitalized at Walter Reed and when the White House eventually found out about his condition. He also said he wasn't exactly sure why one of his aides, in calling 911, asked for the ambulance not to use lights and sirens when it was going to his house to pick him up. And those answers will presumably be included in this review that the Pentagon is conducting about what exactly transpired. But throughout all of this, President Biden, even though he has been somewhat frustrated at how this all played out, he -- there has been no signs that he is losing confidence in Secretary Austin. The White House has said repeatedly that there are no plans whatsoever to fire him or ask for his resignation. And so, certainly, this apology from Austin directly to the president isn't necessarily a surprise. [11:15:02] And I think President Biden is certainly handling it with a certain degree of grace. But, certainly, as this was all unfolding a couple of weeks ago, there was a level of frustration among White House officials about how this all transpired. And it did lead to this effort led by the White House chief of staff, Jeff Zients, to organize all of the agencies and come up with plans for when their agency heads are incapacitated. And they were required to submit these protocols to the White House. And the White House eventually said, you need to notify us when an agency head, for example, goes under general anesthesia. So, certainly, a lot of contrition that you hear from Austin, but a lot of questions, I think, also remaining.",

Colonel Leighton, I just want to go to you. Explain why it is so important in the chain of command to get this right. COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Yes, John, this is a critical issue, because as one of the reporters asked, somebody who is in the military unit has to tell their bosses they're going in for hospitalization or for any medical procedure that will make them absent from duty, a duty station. So that's something you learn when you're a very junior person in the military all the way up to presumably a four-star general. However, in this particular case, it's pretty clear that some of the procedures that would normally be followed at a lower level were not followed. And one of the things that I wondered about is if they wanted to kind of project a feeling of strength that nothing was going on, when, in fact, they should have made it very clear that there was, in fact, an issue with the secretary and that -- but that things were under control because the deputy had control of things. So these are definitely questions that will come up in this review or the multiple reviews. And I'm sure Congress will also ask a bunch of questions about this.",

STEVE ANDERSON (RET.), U.S. ARMY:  Well, John, it's actually perhaps ironic that, 25 years ago, I worked with Lloyd Austin on the National Military Command Center. And one of the responsibilities we had was to keep track of all the senior leaders in the military. So, no one knows more than Lloyd Austin how important it is to keep track. And this was a major breakdown in judgment on his part and probably that of his staff. However, having said that, he is a great American. He is a great soldier, great leader. I have seen him in action. And we as Americans are lucky to have a secretary of defense like Lloyd Austin, who cares about troops, cares about this country and makes good decisions. We need to keep him as the secretary of defense. I think that a lot of this has been somewhat overblown by the media. I believe that what -- he screwed up. He admits he screwed up. It's going to be studied. It's going to be investigated. We will figure out what all went wrong. But he needs to continue to do the great job that he's doing of leading our great secretary of -- the entire Defense Department and performing as a secretary of defense in the manner that he has.

It was about a six-day schedule of attacks. Hundreds of rockets were fired. Hundreds of military aircraft were involved.

And yet President Biden, recognizing that there is a need for addressing solutions at the border, recognizing that we are in divided government, and recognizing that we have to do something, rather than just keep talking about it, is willing to go further than any Democrat has gone before. And there are parts of this that I do not like. But in order to unlock aid to Ukraine, to Israel, to Taiwan, and in order to actually address the problems that we have at the border, Democrats are willing to move far to the middle to compromise. And it is Donald Trump and the Republicans who are playing political games, who have said all along all the big problems at the border -- and now when there's a chance to solve them on their terms, he says, no, I don't want to do it because he wants it to be an election year issue.
