Detroit, New York remain in the top five right now for the world's worst air quality cities. This drone video we're going to show you, this is of New York from this morning, where the city's public schools have canceled all outdoor activities today. Both Philadelphia and New York are under what is called code red air quality alerts, which means there's an unhealthy amount of pollution hanging in the air. Go outside and you will feel it. The smoke is coming from Quebec, where more than 150 active wildfires are currently burning.Let's get to it. CNN's Athena Jones and CNN's Meg Tirrell, they join us now from New York with much more on this. You've been out in it all this morning, Athena. What are noticing?",

That's Jersey City, New Jersey, down there. You can sort of still make out the statue of Liberty just off the shoreline there. But the concern is about the health and safety of residents here and across the region. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy has put out a warning to individuals who are sensitive, people who have respiratory issues or asthma, heart disease. These are the kind of people that city officials and agencies are worrying about because of the kind of pollutants contained in this wildfire smoke. Wildfire smoke has what's known as particulate matter. This is among the tiniest, most dangerous type of pollutant. Why? Because when you inhale that stuff, the particles are so small, they can go deep into your lungs, get into your bloodstream and cause all sorts of issues.That is why we're seeing the precautions taking place among New York public schools. No outdoor activities. Ten school districts in Upstate New York also canceling all outdoor activities. And we expect to get an update from New York City Mayor Eric Adams soon about all of the precautions and also hope to get a sense of how much longer this is going to last. We understand there's going to be a front pushing south, the cold front, that will push more of the smoke south and east in the coming days. So, this is not quite over yet. Kate?",

You can actually tell when you're inhaling this stuff, as opposed to something like COVID-?19, which you obviously can't see. They recommend obviously staying inside whenever possible. If you're going outside, don't do any strenuous exercise. It is not the time to do a long run, for example, in this kind of conditions, wear high quality masks, particular, really, if you're in a vulnerable group, an N-95 or a KN-95. Those are what experts recommend.

That's where the documents were found. That's where the obstruction happened, also probably in D.C., where the documents were taken from. But it may be that prosecutors have decided that Florida is the right place to charge this because most of the conduct happened there, or that they're actually just going to charge a piece of it in Florida.

The vice president is someone here who the campaign says is known. He's well known 100 percent name I.D., they contend.

Those MAGA Republicans, the solid core Trump supporters, need to be moved into another camp. And by Pence not making direct shots at the former president, he's making a play to those supporters, which is key.
