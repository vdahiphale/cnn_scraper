Do you feel safer today than you did four years ago. Very simple questions. And then get off the stage. And Harris needs to do exactly the opposite, give people the chance to challenge her. What are your -- what are the ramifications or the consequences of your plans on inflation? And where are you going to make a difference in the border that you have failed to do over the last three-and-a- half years? One candidate is just rude and abusive and turning voters off.

And they're actually doing, this weekend, their -- one of their biggest interviews yet, a national sit-down with \"60 Minutes.\" That's going to air on Monday night in primetime, \"60 Minutes\" sometimes draws eight million, nine million, 10 million, 11 million viewers. So that's going to be a major moment for Harris. Even more interestingly, Trump has backed out of that interview. Trump was going to participate. Now he's not. So maybe he's taking Franks advice and talking less. Biden, meanwhile, Biden is the ultimate wing man for Kamala Harris in a moment like this. Yes, he may have stepped on her appearance this afternoon, but generally speaking, given that the economy is so important to voters and given the voters are more pessimistic than the data suggests, they should be, objectively, anytime Biden can emphasize good news about the economy, it's going to redound to Harris has benefit. And it's really important when there -- there are data sets, when there are reports, when there are new facts out there, they can't just be handed out at 8:30 am and then not follow up on. And Biden and other politicians have to repeat those points and emphasize the good news. Because as we know, Americans are feeling more sour about the economy than the data would suggest.",

      "sentences": "It's a very high- stakes moment. I think there was a certain feeling that Israel would have responded sooner to Iran.Perhaps one of the reasons was that this is -- we've just had the high holidays here, Rosh Hashanah and that this would perhaps not have been the best time for Israel to make that kind of response, given that people were celebrating with their families. And if Iran had echoed back another round of strikes, then that would have had very -- potentially very serious and damaging consequences at that time for this country. But it does appear, from what the president is saying, that Israel and the United States are in deep discussions as they we're in April last year when Iran struck back then. And back then, the White House was able, it appeared, to temper Israel's response. And it appears to be what they're trying to do again. Because an attack on Iran's oil refineries could drive up the price of oil. That would not be helpful for President Biden right now. It would not be helpful for Kamala Harris and running for the running in the election coming up. So all of this seems to sort of speak to a huge effort from the White House that President Biden alluded to. We're talking, you know, 12 hours a day, we're available all the time, to kind of tamp down Israel's response. Yet, the president there also saying that it's up to Israel to do what they will. And, you know, the potential for escalation, to your point there, is very, very real. And I think, adding to that, what we heard from a deputy military commander in Iran today, saying if Israel does strike, then they're going to be looking at the power infrastructure, the oil refineries here. Saying that there we're three power -- power generating stations in Israel and several refineries and Iran can hit them all in one go. So it's very clear the very public messaging here. Why Israel is still waiting to strike back, isn't clear, but it does speak to a very careful analysis. But we really, here, have no idea which way they'll take it, whether they will take it to prevent escalation or leave the door wide open for him.",

He's found the United States, or the way that he's publicly discussed the situation, the United States trying to hold Israel back.He publicly blamed the United States for not providing weaponry that he needed in the fight in Gaza. We know that Prime Minister Netanyahu would far prefer, if president -- if former President Trump won the election because he'd have had somebody in the White House who was much more hawkish about Iran. And that fits Netanyahu's view. So -- so, to that point, the question the president was asked about is, is Netanyahu trying to undermine you? Biden, of course, saying no, no, no. There is a very, very real tension there.",

It's behind Hezbollah, is behind Hamas, is behind the Houthis.It's behind some of the Iranian-Shia-backed militia today, who sent a drone into the Golan Heights, killing two soldiers and wounding more than two dozen others. So Iran is behind all of it. So the fact -- the notion that Israel would not seek to have a military strike that would act as a deterrence against Iran, a deterrent to them, a deterrence to others in the region, is inconceivable. Absolutely it's going to have happened. To have the United States in the region right now taking on the Houthis, trying to take down some of their military capabilities is helpful for Israel. The other thing, of course, as this time window does, while Israel calculates -- as President Biden was discussing here, calculates its target package, actually allows -- and this is not being talked about publicly and we don't know that it's happening. But gives the United States more time to organize more assets into the region should things really escalate. Because it's only just a couple of days ago that Iran did have that direct attack on Israel and the United States is perhaps not as best postured as it would want to be to support Israel. And of course, that gets to what President Biden was saying. There's no administration that's done more than his to support Israel. And of course, that is in effect in the region at the moment.

But now Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascon says there's two new key pieces of evidence they want to review for potential re-sentenced of the brothers. And the first key piece of evidence is a letter written by one of the brothers to a cousin that details the sexual abuse and was reportedly written before the murders took place.
