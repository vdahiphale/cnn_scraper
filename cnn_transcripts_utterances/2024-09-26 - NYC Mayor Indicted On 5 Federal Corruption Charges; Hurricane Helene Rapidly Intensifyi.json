Prosecutors just announced five federal public corruption charges against Eric Adams, including bribery and wire fraud.And moments from now, a New York appeals court will hear arguments of Donald Trump's push to overturn a civil fraud judgment, that could unravel his business empire and cost him half a billion dollars. And then there's Hurricane Helene. 86 million people are on alert as it rapidly intensifies, and officials warn of life-threatening storm surges. We'll bring you updates from our team on the ground. And we're expected to hear later this hour from the FEMA director at the White House. But I want to start with a high stakes appeal surge for Donald Trump, former president, fighting a $454 million fine after Judge Arthur Engoron ruled that he carried out a years' long scheme of inflating assets. Trump's lawyers say, the decision is egregious and unconstitutional, while the New York attorney general's office argues, it's backed by overwhelming evidence. So, I'm lucky to be joined by great journalists and lawyers who've been following Donald Trump's legal problems in this case over for many years now, former federal prosecutor Shan Wu, CNN's Laura Coates, CNN's Paula Reid, and CNN's Kristen Holmes. Thank you all for joining me on this busy, busy news hour. Let's start about this case. Just to remind viewers about what we expect to see here.

They were hit with this enormous, multi hundred million dollar fine for a fraud.This was a trial before a judge, not a jury, and it was really the most personal case for the former president that we've seen over the past few years, because this was about his empire, his business, not only his business, but also his family. His two adult sons were both also involved in this case. Trump attended much of this trial. It covered it day in and day out. He also testified during this case, even though he faces many civil and criminal cases. This one really, I think, cut really to the heart for him because it's about his identity as a successful businessman. And here, this judge found that he was committing fraud, that he was really lying about his net worth, about the value of some of his properties. And of course, it was expected that they would appeal, unclear, though they'll be successful.",

And once this court held, she's not covered by the tolling agreement. She was completely dismissed from the case. The same should apply to anyone who's not covered by the tolling agreement here. And I would emphasize further, though, that there's really two errors here because even if the continuing wrong doctrine did apply, it still doesn't allow the trial court to do what it did, which is to go way back in time to 2011 and 2012 and assign liability and major consequences, huge financial consequences, based on analysis that never looked at a 2017 or 2015 statement said, what liability flows from just that statement that comes much later in the course of conduct --",

What Henry says is, even if you apply the doctrine, it only applies to allow liability for statements within the limitations period.But that's not what the trial court did here. That's not what the attorney general's office contended. They said, oh, we're going to apply the continuing wrong doctrine, that contradicts Trump ones. So that was the first error. But then the second error is, once we've done that, we're going to pretend there's no statute of limitations at all, and we're going to go all the way back in time and assign crippling financial liability for transactions that concluded again in 2011 and 2012. So, there's a direct contradiction, a direct disregard of the prior -- this court's prior opinion. It becomes really clear, I think. When you look at, for example, there's a citation of the Yin-Shing Woo decision by the trial court. And trial court says, this shows this is a continuous series of wrongs, each of which gives rise to its own liability. When there is an opinion from this court, three months earlier, saying the continuing wrong doctrine does not apply. That makes it very good --",

Can I oppose that? And that is not at all what happened in the trial court.
