On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken and British Foreign Secretary David Lammy visited Kyiv, but Ukraine's brand new foreign minister echoed the appeals for fewer restrictions. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANDRII SYBIHA, UKRAINIAN FOREIGN MINISTER (through translator): The key mission is to strengthen the air shield with all the necessary contributions. We must remove all obstacles and limitations on the use of British equipment and American weapons against military targets in Russian territory.

The NASA version of this called the EMU Extra-vehicular Mobility Unit class, or national kind of kind of parlance or spacewalking suit is a $15 million suit and it is able to sustain the life of the astronaut, has all the heating and cooling necessary, and of course, the air and it's water-cooled and so forth. It's very complex, tiny space vehicle. What SpaceX is hoping to accomplish over the long run in line with Elon Musk's long-term goals of sending huge numbers of people to Mars, and who knows where else is to create these kinds of suits, the spacewalking suits that can be created much more cheaply and more or less mass produced. And so this is the first step in that effort. Billionaire Jared Isaacman has written a big check. He won't say how much for this five- day mission, this is day three and they've already set an altitude record.

They're also testing a novel communication system. You know, if you're going to go and truly think about colonizing the moon and Mars coming up with ways to get robust bandwidth is an essential thing. Elon Musk's company Starlink has created a satellite system that allows for good bandwidth using space assets and they're going to attempt to communicate using those satellites, which will actually be below them. So that'll be an interesting idea using lasers and so forth. And then there'll be a host of other medical experiments that they'll be conducting on themselves.

What is the biggest risk, Miles.O'BRIEN: Well, there is no space -- excuse me, no airlock on this particular spacecraft, Lynda. And so that means that really for all intents and purposes, all four crew members are part of this spacewalk. Two of them will not be poking their heads outside the hatch. But two of them will, Jared Isaacman and Sarah Gillis. The idea is to depressurize the entire crew compartment. In other words, you're dumping out all the air. Everybody gets suited up and is in a self-contained suit that has everything you need to stay alive. So clearly on the face of it, that's a risky proposition. You want to make sure that all those suits are working fine. You want to make sure that you have purged a lot of nitrogen out of your system. Anybody who is a diver out there is familiar with the bends or nitrogen narcosis and see you want to make sure you don't have bubbles that are created inside your blood system. So they are breathing pure oxygen right now to get ready for this. And then the whole idea of just easing out into the void. They will be attached to the space station the whole time, they're not going to free float. But they will be testing to see how the joints of these spacesuits work. When a spacesuit for a spacewalk is pressurized it becomes extremely stiff. It's like blowing up a balloon and it becomes problematic just to squeeze your hands and so forth. And so a lot of time and energy is put into the idea of making the fabric hardy enough to resist the rigors of space. And the temperature swing is several hundred degrees plus or minus whether it's daylight or darkness. And understanding how to make that fabric hard enough to withstand all that and yet pliable enough is an interesting engineering challenge.",

Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg spoke with CNN's Christiane Amanpour as he prepares to step down at the end of this month. The U.S. and its allies pulled out of Afghanistan in August 2021 after almost 20 years of fighting the Taliban. The militant group is now back in power despite all efforts by the U.S.-led coalition and $2 trillion spent by Washington alone. Stoltenberg says NATO's ultimate goal in Afghanistan was simply a step too far. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
