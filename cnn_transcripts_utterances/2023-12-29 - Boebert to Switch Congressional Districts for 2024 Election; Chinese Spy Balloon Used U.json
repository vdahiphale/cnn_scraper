      "sentences": "In a move to avoid what could have been a tough re-election fight next year, Colorado Congresswoman Lauren Boebert is switching congressional districts for the 2024 election.Her decision underscores the narrow House Republican majority and how difficult it is for them to hold on to it. Boebert now represents Colorado's 3rd District in the western part of the state, but she is headed east to run in the 4th, where Republican Congressman Ken Buck is retiring. Now, if Boebert stayed in the 3rd, she would have faced off for a second time against our next guest, Democrat Adam Frisch, who narrowly lost to Boebert in the 2022 midterm elections. Frisch joins us now. Thank you so much for joining us, Adam. We should point out that the primaries have not yet happened, so we would potentially see a different Democrat going up against whoever runs in that district. Nevertheless, you already went up against Congresswoman Boebert. You lost by a mere 500-ish votes. She's accusing Hollywood elites and progressive money groups, her words, of buying the 3rd District. What's your response to that? ADAM FRISCH (D), CANDIDATE FOR CONGRESS IN COLORADO: Boris, great to see you and happy New Year to you and all the viewers out there. You know, I don't know what to really say about that stuff. She's making up excuses. She must have done a poll -- she did a poll about a month ago focused on general election conversations. She must have been down by 7 or 8 points or something like that to me. And that's why she decided to literally pack up her bags and try to carpetbag away to the Eastern Slope or Eastern Plains. I'll be shocked even if she makes it into the top half of the primary contestants over there. The whole Republican crowd over there has no interest in seeing her over there, just like they didn't have any care in southern and western Colorado to see her here. We had two goals two years ago when I launched on this journey. One was to see Lauren Boebert defeated in Congress. And obviously we've checked that box and we're taking a victory lap. [15:35:00] The second thing that we're very, very focused on, and I would say more importantly, is to try to break a monopoly that's affecting rural America. And you know, 90 percent of these rural counties in the country are controlled by one political party. And I think monopolies are bad in politics and they're bad in business. And that's why I've been in this race. And that's why I've been done -- that's why I've been traveling 45,000 miles and counting so far.",

We spoke to the chair of the Colorado Republican Party yesterday and he said that he did not think that Boebert moving was a good move.I'm wondering, for you, if you go up against a Republican that doesn't have the kind of baggage that Boebert carries, don't you think that puts you at a disadvantage? You'd be running a different race.",

Our district's bigger than Pennsylvania. I'm always on the road. We've done 45,000 miles and counting.I have no interest in getting into any conversations about team red or team blue, especially where the Colorado Republican Party is. That'll be up to the voters out in the Eastern Plains to figure out who they want to try to represent them in a very heavily leaning district. But I remain focused on Team CD3, not team red, not team blue, not the presidential race, not the county commissioner races. I'm laser- focused on breaking this monopoly that's affected rural America and we're just not getting a very good version of either political party out here in the Western Slope. I have the same views no matter who I'm running against. I'm trying to -- I've been trying to convince people why people should be voting for us. In a district that's only 22 percent registered Democrat, we got 49.9 percent of the vote last time. Obviously, I've been able to build what I call a tri-partisan coalition, and we will continue to do that. And all those pundits last cycle that thought we were going to lose by 40,000 votes and we lost by fewer than 550, all I can say is I hope they save some of their humble pie for this cycle.

What we do know from our sourcing is that this is not believed by U.S. intelligence officials to have been the intelligence that the balloon was collecting as it transited across the United States. So as the balloon was going across the U.S., it was picking up images and other intelligence. That was being stored on the balloon itself with the expectation, presumably, that the Chinese government would be able to download and view it later, of course, because the United States shot it down. The United States has been able to study that itself. But what's interesting, I think, about this, guys, is that the sort of revelation about this use of an American service provider is it gives us kind of an image into or gives kind of a picture into how the United States was able to track this balloon in real time. It also gives us a sense of why the Biden administration might have been willing to wait until the balloon crossed all the way over the country to shoot it down. Officials told us at the time that they were collecting information from the balloon about its capabilities as it transited. This, now we understand, is part of how they were able to do that.",

There was a controversy over that. You actually wound up reimbursing the university out of your own pocket because of that controversy, partly because it was student fees that you used.
