The coordinating of fake electors. The breach of election equipment. And we still don't know, will Trump and his allies face charges here in Georgia? And if so, will there be convictions? DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: They rigged the presidential election in 2020, and we're not going to allow them to rig the presidential election of 2024.
