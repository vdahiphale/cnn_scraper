So, if anybody has any thoughts of helping us, that is Hawaii Community Foundation, Maui Strong is the name of the account that they're taking donations.

She's giving Donald Trump's team what they wanted, largely, to narrow the protection over evidence that they're receiving before trial.But, John, this hearing has taken a turn where it has been about something much bigger. that justice and the administration of justice is more important than a political campaign. And that is how this judge, Judge Tanya Chutkan, is going to manage this case going forward. Here's what she said some direct quotes. [10:45:00] \"The fact that he,\" Donald Trump, \"is running a political campaign currently has to yield to the administration of justice. And if that means he can't say exactly what he wants to say in a political speech, that is just how it's going to have to be. I cannot and I will not factor into my decision what effect it will have on a political campaign for either side.\" That comment came after Trump's lawyers raised the possibility that she was giving an unfair advantage to Joe Biden. And she says, no, that's not what this is about. This is about an order governing discovery and how much Donald Trump is going to be able to talk about the evidence that he's never seen before and is going to be learning about as he progresses toward trial. And then the other thing that has been discussed today are these statements that Donald Trump makes about witnesses. His lawyer tried to raise this idea that, oh, he's been talking about Pence, is that what you mean? Mike Pence as a candidate opposite, Trump in this Republican nomination? But the Judge Chutkan stepped back and said, no, there are other orders in this case that say Donald Trump, as a criminal defendant, is out on bail. And he, as he's out on bail, he is not able to intimidate witnesses or obstruct justice, period. And, she said, her direct quote there was, \"I will be scrutinizing them,\" meaning statements he makes that could be obstructive or intimidation, she will be scrutinizing them very carefully. And so, going forward, there's clearly a warning being sent to Donald Trump's team and the former president himself that this case is important and his political campaign, whatever he says out there publicly on social media, that is not going to dictate what happens from now until the trial.",

As if to say Donald Trump, as a defendant, out on bail needs to be careful about what he says going forward. Also, laying down a marker saying that running for president is no different than any other job. It won't get any special preference in terms of, one might interpolate or extrapolate from that, the timing of the trial, correct?I mean, if running for president is no different than any job. Running for president shouldn't be a reason to delay the trial at all. But, Katelyn, what the judge has actually ruled on, you suggested, is giving the Trump team a little bit what they want. Explain that.",

      "sentences": "Yes. So, she does, at one point, call this Trump's day job, essentially. She does say those words, it's he's day job, that he's running for president, and that she's going to be making decisions otherwise. But the legal issue here, John, that she had to determine today was whenever the Justice Department gives Donald Trump evidence that they've never seen before that's been collected in this case. Things like grand jury transcripts, other information that they have from subpoenas, search warrants, all of the investigative work that they did. When that gets given to Donald Trump, can he disclose what he's learning? Can he talk about it freely? Can he talk about what witnesses said about him in the grand jury before a trial? And there's reason that the court is saying, no, you can't do that because you have to protect what the jury will learn, for the first time, at trial as the Justice Department puts on their case.But the divide here was that the Justice Department wanted to lock all of that down and have Trump not allowed to talk about any of it as they're handing it over. And Trump's team said, well, why don't you designate what's sensitive and what's not. And the things that are very sensitive, we can abide by what you want to do here and have him not talk about that. And so, the Justice Department today they said most of what they're going to be handing over that Trump's never seen before is sensitive, but it appears the judge is having a little bit of a nuance here where she is going more with the proposal that Trump's team had legally for what to do with his evidence, how to govern it going forward, than what the Justice Department wanted, which was a little bit broader. But, really, John, these two sides on the legal issue here today, they were not that far apart. And, really, this discussion became much more about the speech that Donald Trump can make and what he needs to abide by as he awaits trial.",
