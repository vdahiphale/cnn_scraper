What to make of their two different messages and what people on the front lines of the crisis really want done.Also tonight, the two sides request trial dates in the Trump documents' case. Jack Smith wants it sooner, the defense later, and says it won't be fair unless it's much later, as in after the election. And John King's election year journey all over the map, taking him to Pennsylvania tonight to see how seniors view a race between the two oldest presidential candidates ever. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. We begin tonight, keeping them honest, with immigration, the issue Americans now call their top concern, according to recent polling. Today, President Biden and former President Trump made dueling visits to the Texas southern border, Biden to Brownsville, Trump to Eagle Pass. Two cities about 300 miles apart, two candidates who each in his own way has failed to fix a broken, severely overburdened border security and asylum system. President Biden, many believe, by omission, by not making the problem enough of a priority until recently, even after a year of increasing numbers of people crossing the border and rising border encounters, which set new records. And Donald Trump, by commission, he's actively opposing any action until after he presumably wins the election, even though today he painted the problem as an imminent existential threat. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)   DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:   These are the people that are coming into our country and they're coming from jails, and they're coming from prisons, and they're coming from mental institutions and they're coming from insane asylums and they're terrorists. They're being let into our country and it's horrible. It's horrible. You look at the jails now, you take a look at the jails throughout the region, but more importantly, throughout the world, they're emptying out because they're dumping them into the United States.

It's a problem. It needs to be addressed.Keeping him honest, though, the former president is only campaigning on it, not addressing the problem. Worse than that, as you likely know, he's come out against bipartisan Senate legislation, which toughens border security, tightens the asylum process and pays for more courts and judges and border enforcement. He told House Republicans to torpedo the bill, and they did. But imagine if he didn't. He could have gone to the border today and pointed to the tough new border legislation that he and Republican lawmakers forced the President to accept. Could have, but didn't, which left President Biden today to attempt to seize the high ground on an issue which, fair to say, he has hardly taken the lead on. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He stoked fear and he used rhetoric linking immigration and violent crime.   And this is something, again, that propelled him to the White House in2016 and also really helped build the base that we now see that surrounds and props up Donald Trump. But today he's really trying to reach people outside of that base. He's hoping that this message is going to help him to the White House again in 2024, particularly given that polling that we have seen that you mentioned that shows that immigration is the number one issue for voters and that Biden's approval rating on the issue is very low, much lower than Donald Trump's was. But one thing he didn't bring up, despite the fact that he continued to say he alone could fix the border, that if you voted him into office, he would fix it, he had all the solutions. He did not bring up the fact that he tanked to that bipartisan border bill and told Republicans, both privately and publicly, not to vote for it, not to support it. But whether or not that message gets through to people who are fearful of immigration, who are fearful of what is going on at the border, that remains unclear, because he clearly knows how to tap into that messaging.",

So what else did President Biden say besides those comments directed to the former president? Well, going into today, the intention by President Biden was to place more pressure on Congress to pass that failed Senate border bill, because it was his White House officials and Senate negotiators who worked to hammer out that compromise. So that is what the focus was for President Biden today. And it was notable that he actually cited some Republican talking points, focusing on fentanyl, cartels, criminals, in talking about the need for resources for the Department of Homeland Security. So trying to make that direct connection that without that help, without that legislation, he can't get what the department needs to enforce the U.S. Mexico border. And he repeatedly said that it was \"time to act.\" But it was notable, of course, that he did reference his predecessor in his remarks, because, as you heard there from Kristen, it was former President Donald Trump that played a critical role in scuttling this deal that Republicans had worked on hammering. And in talking to White House officials and campaign officials, they're hoping that voters can make this connection, that they can see that there was a solution on the table and that Republicans walked away from it. So that is why President Biden is leaning into this moment and trying to use this as an opportunity. And, frankly, Anderson, it has been a pivotal moment for this White House, which up until this point had really distanced itself from the U.S. Mexico border.",

This requires administration attorneys to review and what is being considered is restrictions on the ability for migrants to seek asylum in the U.S. if they cross unlawfully. Using an authority that former President Donald Trump also tried to use, he tried to shut down the border. This seems to be a little different, though we still don't have the text of it.So there is a plan B that is being worked through, but it's still not the same as enshrining something into law. And that's what White House officials come back to. They can try to do more on the U.S.-Mexico border, but none of it will be the same if it's not written in the law, which is exactly what former President Donald Trump faced, because everything he did was legally challenged in court. And they're anticipating the same could happen with any action President Biden takes. So the pressure is still going to remain on Congress. But as you heard from the former president today, there is still a push by Republicans for the President to take more executive action on the U.S.-Mexico border.",

Murphy, I mean, when you see the former president at the southern border today referring to criminals, and terrorists, and people from mental hospitals, after he effectively killed the bipartisan bill that you worked to negotiate, what runs through your mind? SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT):   Well, first of all, this invasion rhetoric is just absolutely disgusting. It's xenophobic. It's racist. Go to Ukraine, you see what an actual invasion looks like. This is somebody who dodged the draft, who has no idea what an actual war looks like. But here's the bottom line, President Trump does not want to fix the border. He does not want to fix the border because all he wants is a chaotic border because he thinks it helps him politically. We had a deal, a bipartisan compromise, a tough set of new restrictions on the border, including the ability for the President of the United States to close portions of the border when crossings get too high. And Donald Trump instructed his allies in the United States Senate to kill that bill. And he's been pretty clear why, because he thought it would help Joe Biden, because it would be good for America.

It was supported by The Wall Street Journal, the Chamber of Commerce.   This was a conservative, tough bill that would have allowed thepresident to control the border.

We weren't writing a bill that was just going to score political points. Sen. Lankford and I are very different politically, but we are committed to solving the problem. And one of the problems is that when you come into this country to seek asylum, it often takes 10 years for your claim to be adjudicated.And so it's an incentive for people to come into the country who have invalid claims because you get 10 years of working in the United States, even if you don't qualify for asylum. So what our bill would have done is not just allow the President to shut down the border, but also expedite the asylum process so that all those claims are heard in six months instead of 10 years. And what that would do is provide a tremendous disincentive to anybody coming to the United States who is going to lose their claim. So our bill would have fixed a lot of the biggest problems in the immigration system. And again, that's the reason Donald Trump opposes it, because it actually would have worked.",

Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says at least 112 people were killed. The Palestinian ambassador to the U.N. now puts the death toll at 122 people. CNN can't confirm either figure.CNN's Alex Marquardt has more details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): Pandemonium, as desperate Palestinians rush a convoy of aid trucks in the northern part of Gaza, where aid, which is already scarce, is in painfully short supply. In this drone video released by the Israeli military, the trucks are surrounded, people climbing on top of the trucks, chaos and panic. This is before dawn in Gaza City, the biggest city in the enclave. Israeli troops are nearby. You can see here Israeli tanks alongside the convoy. Then, gunshots. There are conflicting accounts of what happened. Eyewitnesses say Israeli troops fired into the crowd, fueling the chaos. A journalist, Hadar Azanoun (ph), who was on the scene, said that IDF soldiers killed about 20 people in the crowd. CNN cannot corroborate that claim. The IDF has changed its account throughout the day, most recently saying that Israeli tanks were issuing warning shots to disperse a crowd after seeing people were being trampled. An earlier account from the IDF said there were two separate incidents, one where crowds rushed the trucks and caused them to run over other civilians, and a subsequent event where IDF soldiers fired on a group of Palestinians who approached their military outpost and posed a threat. Panic appears to have spread, the IDF says, consuming the truck drivers who tried to speed away and in the process, killing dozens, ramming and running them over.",

Lieutenant Colonel Lerner, a local reporter on the scene says that shots fired by the IDF led to panic by the truck drivers and people desperate for supplies. People were run over. Then according to the director of one hospital in Gaza City who spoke to the New York Times, that person said about a 100 patients were brought in with gunshot wounds. We can't verify those numbers. I know you said earlier on air that the IDF fired warning shots. If that's all they did, how did so many people get gunshot wounds? LT. COL. PETER LERNER, SPOKESMAN, ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCES: Anderson, thank you. I'm not aware of so many people receiving any gunshot wounds. And I would say we need to be very, very cautious at accepting anything that comes out of the Hamas Ministry of Health, as we would be cautious of accepting anything coming out of the ISIS Ministry of Health or the Al-Qaeda Ministry of Health. The reality is, is this, in a humanitarian operation in the early hours of yesterday morning for the -- on the fourth consecutive day, we are conducting an operation to get humanitarian aid and food supplies into northern Gaza. As the food supplies proceeded into the northern Gaza Strip, masses of people stormed the convoy of over 30 trucks. As you can see in the footage, the amount of people that just went to the trucks, it was immense and extensive. And what we understand is that throughout the case of these actions, many people trampled, beaten, and in some cases even run over. We understand that dozens of people were actually run over and killed in this incident.",

I know earlier in the day, that's what you had said, that there were two separate issues. There was people swarming over the food convoy. And then there were also people who approached a position that was somewhat close. Is that still what you're saying happened? LERNER: Yes, absolutely. That's the reality. We understand. Here's what we know, that people were swarming the trucks. Indeed, some of those got crushed and killed by the vehicles, the trucks that were moving forward. And at a second incident adjacent at a short distance away, approaching one of our tanks and putting the soldiers at risk. Of course, in the nature of the combat that we are facing with a 360 degree risk off terrorists that are not wearing uniform that will attach an explosive device to our tanks and our armed vehicles, there is a distinct threat, and that is why they opened fire with warning shots to begin with. When the people continue to move towards the tank less than 5 meters away, that is when they -- the forces open fire towards those that continue to progress forward. This is a challenge.",

KING (on-camera): Even the Democrats there we met who support Biden think Trump does at the moment. And Trump has historically, Anderson. Let me just pull up these numbers and look, forgive me for turning my back just so I can stretch them out. In 2016, Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton among voters over 65. You see it there by seven points, right? It was smaller in 2020, and that's the difference. Joe Biden, five points. And keep it within the margins. In Pennsylvania, Trump beat Clinton by 10. Trump only beat Biden by seven. So you don't necessarily have to win this constituency, but if you keep the margins tighter, Joe Biden has to at least keep the margins tight. And the voters we talked to said it's a bit of a challenge right now.",

Let me get this one off the screen here, come out to the national map and give you a show here. This just -- look at this. If you look at -- let me bring it all the way out. You see Pennsylvania. In the key battleground states, the darker areas here where you have a higher percentage of 65 plus voters. Look, it's the -- they are the most reliable voters. They will vote almost always. And so for President Biden, he has to answer the age question, Anderson, among those who understand this issue better than anybody, of course. They're going through it every day and they talk about it. They have their own memory lapses. They can't move as fast as they could. Again, it splits mostly along partisan lines. It's mostly Democrats who say the president's fine and Republicans who say they don't. But what was most interesting, we saw it in Pennsylvania and it will matter in these other states, is the Democrats you heard in the piece. They're saying that they're still with the president. They think he's OK. But when they talk to peers, some of them have doubts. And so that's an issue as we go forward here.",
