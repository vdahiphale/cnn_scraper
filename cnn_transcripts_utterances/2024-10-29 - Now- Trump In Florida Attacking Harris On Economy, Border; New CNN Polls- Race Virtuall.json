      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, one week to go. As the clock ticks down to election day, we have brand new CNN polls from two pivotal battle ground states, which only affirm that this race could not be closer.Plus, Kamala Harris takes her closing argument to the same spot Donald Trump told supporters to fight like hell minutes before the January 6 insurrection. I'll speak with Stephanie Cutter, Senior Adviser to the Harris, Walz's campaign, this hour. And one of Trump's loudest and most controversial messengers is released from federal prison. We have new reporting on how Steve Bannon plans to use his MAGA megaphone in the final hours of this race. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We're looking at live pictures of former President Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago with seven days until the election. He is attacking Kamala Harris over issues like the economy and immigration and foreign policy. And he is also spewing lies, lies that Daniel Dale fact checked in the last hour. Now, so far, he has not said anything about Sunday night's rally at Madison Square Garden. We are going to keep monitoring those comments and take you back to Florida if he takes reporters' questions. Both Trump and Harris are making a major push today for that very small group of undecided or persuadable voters in a handful of states. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S., (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE (voiceover): We are a week out and I am just -- I'm in the zone, right? We got to cover a lot of ground. There's still a lot of people to talk with, and so I am traveling all over the country, in particular the swing states to talk with folks and organize them and remind folks of the power of their vote. DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're going to save America. We have no choice. It's the greatest there is, we love it, and we're going to save it. We have no choice. And it's going to be saving it from the incredible destruction that's been caused by crooked Joe Biden and Kamala. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But according to the 2020 exit polls, Biden won them by 26 percentage points. That -- if that actually is what emerges on election day, that's a big warning sign in Nevada for the Harris campaign.And I will just note here, we are seeing the gender gap again. It's more extreme to both ends. In Arizona, Harris winning women by 16 points. Trump men by 14 points. In Arizona, women are going for Harris by five points. In Nevada, Trump getting men by seven points. You see a sort of equal distance from the middle, but much greater on both ends in Arizona.

The darker the county means that the cost of living, your energy prices, your housing prices, your grocery prices, have outpaced the increase in your wages. And so, let's look at where we are right now. Look at how dark it is here in battle ground Nevada, right? This is the headwind the vice president is facing. Joe Biden is president, but she is he's vice president. See how dark these areas are. That means the cost of living has outpaced your wages. And again, in Arizona, where we were yesterday. Look at Maricopa County. It's the worst of the counties there. So that's the headwind for the vice president. That no matter what she says, she's trying to say her plans would help with this. But when you travel in both of these states, and remember, in Nevada, the unemployment rate during COVID was twice the national average, right? The jobs are back.

Thank you so much for being here.You are a Nevada native, so I'll start with you. What's your takeaway from what you're seeing in these two very important states? LEIGH ANN CALDWELL, CO-AUTHOR, THE WASHINGTON POST \"EARLY BRIEF\": It's really fascinating that your -- you guys is polling shows that Trump ahead one point in Nevada -- of course within the margin of error. But the reason it's interesting is because Nevada was a race that they thought a couple weeks ago that Harris was actually doing much better. But I was told by sources last week that the internal polls were tightening in the state of Nevada. I was there a couple weeks ago, mostly covering the Senate race, but there is a significant amount of support and energy for Donald Trump that I wasn't necessarily expecting. But I will say that housing is continuing to be a major issue in the state of Nevada. It is something that I think really impacts the economic discussion there. But Democrats, not only at the national level, but also Nevada Democrats are confident, because they say that their ground game is superb there, and they think that it will be able to eat Harris a win. But we're going to have to see some of these early vote numbers are also quite good for Republicans. AYESHA RASCOE, NPR HOST, \"WEEKEND EDITION SUNDAY\" AND \"UP FIRST\": Well, and that's the thing.
