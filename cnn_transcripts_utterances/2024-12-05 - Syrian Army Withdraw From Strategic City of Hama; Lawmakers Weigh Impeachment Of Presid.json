We'll hear from the White Helmets about the humanitarian situation in the middle of this conflict. And authorities in New York continue to hunt the gunman who fatally shot a healthcare CEO. We'll bring you the latest details on the terrifying attack. Plus, the Department of Government Efficiency is now hitting the Hill. We'll discuss what plans Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have for Washington. Hello, everyone, live from New York. I'm Bianna Golodryga. Zain is off today. You are watching ONE WORLD. And we begin in Syria where the government is facing another major setback and a shift in power on the ground may be exposing cracks in the alliance between the regime and its Russian and Iranian backers. The Syrian army says it's withdrawing from Hama after insurgents broke through its defenses. Now Hama is a key city, one that's synonymous with government brutality. It's also strategically important providing direct supply lines between Damascus and Aleppo. Its capture marks the second major gain for Syrian rebels who launched a lightning offensive last week and seized Aleppo, shattering the stalemate in a war that never formally ended. CNN's Ben Wedeman joins me now live from Rome. And, Ben, just stunning developments happening, as I noted, lightning speed. Hama, the country's fourth largest city, coming just days after rebels took over Aleppo. Does it appear that the city of Homs is next in their sight?",

      "sentences": "It certainly does, Bianna. What we know is that it's just about 40 kilometers, a very shortdrive from Hama, south on the M5 highway, to Homs. And even though you mentioned that Hama is synonymous with the brutality of the regime in Damascus, of course, because of the 1982 massacre there by the father of Bashar Assad, Homs o in terms of strategic importance is far greater than Hama. Homs is basically where, if you're driving north from Damascus and you want to go to the coast, you go to Homs and you go take the highway west from there. And, of course, the coast is where the Alawite minority, to which Bashar al-Assad belongs and which dominates the government in Damascus, that is its homeland. So if the rebels managed to take Homs, and Homs has a Sunni Muslim majority that obviously is not well disposed toward the regime in Damascus, that could really spell the end for the regime of Bashar al-Assad, because it would effectively not only cut off Damascus from the coast, but essentially it would mean that the sort of the axis of resistance, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Hezbollah, that link would be cut, that land bridge would be cut. So, really, the fate of Homs will really determine where this current offensive is going. If the government manages to restore a sort of get its forces back in order and actually maintain control of Homs, then perhaps the regime can survive. But if it loses Homs, it's a very questionable how much longer it can continue to function. Bianna?",

The situation was already boiling. 5.1 million people in Northwest Syria were trapped for years and the world forgot about them. 3.5 million of them were internally displaced people from the other governorates, from Homs, from Hama, from Eastern Ghouta, from Madaya, all these areas which the regime, with support from Hezbollah and the Russians, few years ago besieged and then gassed with chemical weapons and forced those communities to flee north. They were just eager to return and with the devastating earthquake which had the area last year and the sharp humanitarian funding cuts this year, it just made the life impossible for people. People now look at opportunities. People are eager to return to their homes and that. And every day we see very inspiring stories of brothers who haven't met each other for years, mothers who haven't met their children for a decade and now families are getting united. But, of course, the people are still worried from the change on the ground, worried from because of the aerial bombardment of civilian areas, worried because there are no guarantees about how the day after will look like and how the armed groups which captured these areas now will proceed with a political settlement.",

Most of them, they were actually displaced from the other parts of Syria. So when they had access to Aleppo, immediately from the second day, our colleagues were originally from Aleppo, returned to Aleppo and started serving their communities. As of today, we have four teams operating in Aleppo City and all of them from members of the city who were displaced back in 2017. And same applies now to Hama. We have prepared two teams from Hama. Sons and daughters will return in a couple of days to Hamas to resume the service delivery to the people there. This humanitarian situation is definitely dire, as I said earlier, because of the bombardment of a decade, the earthquake, the cut in humanitarian assistance, so people already in miserable conditions, but we're trying to do everything possible. First thing we're doing, opening the roads and removing the rubble of destruction. We are also burying the dead bodies. There are tens of dead bodies on the ground. And so now we have buried more than 240 dead bodies, most of them from regime soldiers and some for civilians. We have to bury them in dignity, document everything, and hopefully one day we will return their bodies to their families. Also, we are working to clear the unexploded ordnance. Sadly speaking, some civilians who couldn't wait to return to their homes, died when they arrived because of the landmines and the unexploded ordnance. So it's big responsibilities on all fronts. At the same time, we have to maintain service delivery to the population in Aleppo and Hama. Huge work to be done. But we are hopeful that this is a momentum for Syria and for the world. Because if we succeed and the international community help the Syrian people to stop the aerial bombardment and push the political solution under Security Council Resolution 2254 to be implemented, this is -- this is the time for the IDPs and the refugees to return to their hometowns.",

He has a very easy path to the nominate -- to confirmation, I think, next year. And then we have J.D. Vance, the vice president-elect, who is also seen as an heir to Trump and his selection by Trump as his running mate really gave him a leg up.

Dali faces at least one federal charge and could face up to five years in prison. CNN's Polo Sandoval joins us now. With the latest. Polo, when we spoke yesterday and you were at the airport, there was a question of whether she would be facing charges or not. We got our answer. Now, where do things stand?",

Dali did not get to go home last night. She was detained by federal agents after she landed in New York's JFK airport. Investigators have been interviewing her, is in custody and now is scheduled to face a judge in really just a little over an hour. This will be her preliminary arraignment, Bianna, which where she will hear the charge of being a stowaway on an aircraft without consent, which carries a maximum of five years in prison, if convicted. And she'll likely also enter a plea. And perhaps we may even hear from her as well if she addresses the court. So we're listening and monitoring for that. But still, she is sharing the spotlight in the story with a trove of questions right now about what all the different stakeholders are doing to keep this from happening again. In the last hour or so, we heard from the former administrator of the Transportation Security Administration who says that this is clearly three points of at -- two, possibly three points of failure, beginning with the JFK airport employee that did not notice her slip into a lane dedicated for flight personnel. After that, the TSA employee that was supposed to check her for boarding pass, now we should mention the TSA says, she was subsequently physically screened as well as her baggage to make sure she didn't pose a threat. And then the third layer, which would have been the Delta gate agents that did not ask -- that perhaps did not notice her, did not ask her for boarding pass. And eventually they have allowed her onto that flight last Tuesday. So these are all the questions that are being asked right now. As we try to learn a little bit more about this 57-year-old woman, to remind viewers, she holds a Russian passport, but is also a U.S. green card holder, which explains why she was essentially deported back to the United States. We know that she resides in Philadelphia. And then lately, according to several court filings, she filed several lawsuits alleging that she was the victim of what's described in her complaint as military grade chemical weapons, as well as a kidnapping plot. So some highly unusual allegations that are being made here. So it certainly will beg questions about what may have been her mental state when she became a stowaway on that Paris bound flight, but at least she's now in the United States. Their authorities will be prosecuting her. And we expect her in court in the coming hour or so.",
