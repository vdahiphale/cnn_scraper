President Biden hosting a trilateral summit with the leaders of Japan and South Korea at Camp David that begins in around two hours' time. It's actually the first ever high level talks between the three nations. Japan and South Korea putting aside years of fraught relations to strengthen security ties and take a tougher stance on regional players like China and North Korea. A live report just ahead plus, horrible Hilary the U.S. Southwest bracing for a weather wallop this weekend as a strengthening hurricane get set for landfall. Significant flooding is expected in a part of the nation that's been starved of rain up to now. And it feels like the first time finale for Sunday's Women's World Cup showdown between Spain and England. A first for both teams will the lionesses be a roaring success she asks complete coverage just ahead. Also this Friday problems on the pitch for global investors U.S. stocks on track for a fourth straight day of losses tech actually coming off its worst three day run now since February. Markets pressured by of course a sharp move higher in global bond yields. The bond routes sending U.S. 30 year mortgage rates high past 7 percent that's actually a more than 20 year high. Just to be clear uncertainty too over China's growing property crisis is also placing pressure across global markets. One time property giant Evergrande filing for bankruptcy protection in the United States on Thursday Evergrande helping spark the Chinese property developer crisis, which continues to this day with a number of major developers, also defaulting on their debt sparking repeated calls for Beijing to do more to support the economy. No surprise, as you would imagine, in the face of all of that another tough day of trade for the Asia majors the HANG SENG dropping some 2 percent it's now actually fallen into bear market territory. So that's a 20 percent drop from its recent highs. The NIKKEI there too slumping more than 3 percent this week also plenty to get to, as always, but first we do begin in Moscow, where Russia temporarily closed all major airports in the city earlier after an alleged drone strike. Moscow's Mayor says Russian air defenses shut down drone overnight saying debris found near Moscow's Expo Center. Meanwhile, better news for Ukraine, a U.S. official says Washington is committed to approving the transfer of F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine as soon as training is complete. The Netherlands is hailing the move as a major milestone. Let's get to the very latest with Nada Bashir. Nada, good to have you with us! Great news for Ukraine but it comes down to that key factor of training. Where are we on the training and do we don't have a sense of how long it will take to complete?",

And that is something that could take months we heard yesterday from theUkrainian Air Force Spokesperson saying that they certainly won't have pilots ready to operate these advanced U.S. made jets before the end of this year. That means the next autumn and winter will be spent fighting on the frontlines and counter offensive ongoing without these F-16s that President Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian government have been asking for since the very early stages of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Now of course, this is a more positive indication from the Biden Administration. They say they are ready to approve the transfer of these jets as soon as that training is completed. That training is set to be carried out in conjunction with America's EU partners. And it was anticipated initially that that training would begin this month. That is certainly not the case. Ukrainians Air Force says they are hoping this will begin in the near future. And in the meantime, the Biden Administration is said to be conducting talks with other EU partners in possession of these F-16s. The hopes of securing further countries that will participate and work with the U.S. to supply the Ukrainian Air Force with these all important jets. Now of course, we know that Denmark and the Netherlands are playing a crucial role here. The European partners are taking a lead on these trading protocols which are still in the works. But as soon as that process is approved and underway, this will be a hugely significant step for Ukraine. The Ukrainian President himself hopeful that this could mark a shift and a positive boost in Ukraine's counter offensive.",

Andwe had the Chinese Foreign Minister speaking out against this earlier this year kind of chastising the leaders of Japan and South Korea saying, hey, you could dye your hair blonde, but you can never become a Westerner. You should stay close to your roots. But what is helping drive Japan and South Korea two countries that have very tragic and traumatic shared colonial history together. What is driving them together in such a kind of dramatic fashion? This is the first trilateral summit involving the U.S. I believe, is a national security issues. Look at the tweets that were put out by Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida right before he flew out for the U.S. for this meeting in Camp David. He said that he'd be visiting. And as the security environment surrounding the area becomes increasingly severe, it is extremely significant for the leaders to come together under the same roof. He's going to reinforce strategic cooperation further. And as a case in point, you had Japan scrambling fighter jets today in response to two Russian reconnaissance planes that flew between the Korean Peninsula, the Strait between the Korean Peninsula and Japanese islands today. And earlier this week, Japan's Ministry of Defense, expressing grave concern when it detected a total of 11 Russian and Chinese warships that were sailing to the South West of the Island of Okinawa, with Japan saying this is the first time ever that they've seen this. The Chinese government has come out and said, hey, they were operating according to international rules. This is in international water. But what you see is in addition to the constant kind of threat and saber rattling that comes from North Korea firing missiles which worries both South Korea and Japan. You have a tightening of the relationship between China and Russia. Russia's invasion of Ukraine, China's threats to Taiwan, and that's helping bring together South Korea and Japan and the U.S. in a way that we've never seen before between these three governments.",

This week marks two years since Kabul fell to the Taliban, the fundamentalist group seizing control ofAfghanistan following a chaotic controversial withdrawal by the United States after nearly 20 years of fighting. The United Nations is urging the international community not to forget the suffering of its people, including the severe restrictions imposed on the rights of both women and girls. \"Their rights to access education and work, their freedom of movement and participation in daily and public life have been eroded by a series of discriminatory edicts issued since the takeover\". The treatment of some women and girls in Afghanistan has been laid bare by my next guests. Sola Mahfouz risked everything to get an education. At 16 she taught herself Math's and English in secret online. She sneaked into Pakistan to take her SAT test before finally escaping Afghanistan with her family to the United States. And her will and perseverance pay dividends. Today she's a Quantum Computing Researcher at Tufts University in Massachusetts. Her memoir called \"Defiant Dreams\" was co-written by the Human Rights Activist, Malaina Kapoor, and I'm very pleased to say they both join me now. Sola and Malaina, it is a huge honor to have you on the show. And I love the book, it was both heartbreaking I think, and heartwarming in equal measure. Sola, I want to begin with you because this book, at its core is about your fight for freedom, your fight, I think for the right to an education and the will the strength to risk it all in pursuit of that. Where did that come from? Where did that strength and desire come from? SOLA MAHFOUZ, CO-AUTHOR \"DEFIANT DREAMS\": So thanks for having us. You know, you know, my grandfather was self-educated. And so, you know, at age 16, I did not know how to add and subtract. And that was because when I was 11 years old, a group of men came to our door and threatened us if I continued going to school. And from that day on, the restriction on my life continued to increase you know I left home only a couple of times a year. And whenever I did, I had to wear the suffocating burqa that covered me from head to toe. Meanwhile, my brothers were going to school, and they were thriving academically, and I was deeply jealous of their lives. And in those times, for me, the world seem like dark place. And, you know, my grandfather said that education is like, opening a window to the world, and I needed that window and that light to shine in. And so I start secretly start teaching myself, English, Math, and \"Defiant Dreams\" tells a story of how I went from not knowing how to add and subtract in age 16 to all the way come here now in the U.S. doing physics, becoming a physics researcher at Tufts University developed quantum algorithms",

If successful, the Luna-25 mission would be an astronomical comeback for Russia, reclaiming some of the glory from its Soviet aerospace heyday and putting it at the forefront of a new push by several countries to explore the deep craters of the shadowy part of the moon that's believed to contain water ice. The liftoff was delayed for nearly two years, partially because of the backlash over Russia's invasion of Ukraine with the European Space Agency pulling key camera equipment from the project. And even though Luna-25 is now aloft, it's not alone in its endeavors. The Indian Spacecraft Chandrayaan 3 is already in lunar orbit. And on Thursday, India's Space Agency announced the lander module had successfully separated from the propulsion module, even quoting the lander is saying thanks for the ride mate. They're now eyeing a soft landing spot on the moon on August 23, two days after Russia's ambitious target landing date. But both missions will have to avoid the fate of the Chandrayaan 2 in 2019, which crash landed on the moon surface. Other nations are in the moon race. Earlier this month, the crew of NASA's Artemis 2 mission inspected the Orion spacecraft that is set to orbit the moon with astronauts onboard late next year. Artemis 3 will follow with plans to land a crewed spacecraft on the lunar South Pole. But NASA says this mission could be changed or delayed. If a landing system created by SpaceX isn't ready on time. China also says it plans to land astronauts on the moon by the end of the decade. Something NASA says is worrying if they get to the moon South Pole first and claim it as their territory.",

Goodtime for a swing for the fences growth for the Eagle Eye entrepreneurs behind the Swingers crazy golf club chain called Swingers, if you will a hole in one, all in one experience. It's a miniature golf course that also serves cocktails, and gourmet street food the first Swingers club opened in London 10 years ago, it now has been used in both New York and Washington D.C. and the firm just raised $52 million dollars to fund a further franchise expansion Las Vegas and Dubai locations are coming soon. And Matt Grech-Smith joins us now he's from London and he's the Co-Founder and Co-CEO of Swingers. Matt, fantastic to have you on the show, just talk us through what Swingers offers. MATT GRECH-SMITH, CO-FOUNDER AND CO-CEO OF SWINGERS: So Swingers is it takes the classic game of mini golf that makes it into a somewhat more grown up experience. So as you kind of alluded to before, we've taken the activity, but put it into a very theatrical, immersive environment. It's based on an English country golf club, all indoors. But we've added great cocktails, fantastic gourmet street food. And when you come in, we have amazing staff including caddies who will take your drinks orders when you're on the course, because we believe that a drink or two helps with your mini golf game. And they'll give you tips and tricks as you go around as well. So it just is a very theatrical, immersive and slightly competitive evening out.",

But what you'resaying is you're open seven days a week, and in the daytime, too. GRECH-SMITH: Yes, very slightly. But yes, most of our venues are open either six or seven days a week. And they open from lunchtime onwards, because what we've seen now is, especially the corporates, they like to do their corporate entertaining during work hours, some of them feel that they don't want to push their corporate activities to outside of work hours. So it's crazy. I'll walk into one of our venues on a Wednesday afternoon at 2 pm. And it'll be packed full of people socializing, competing on the courses, grabbing some food, having a few drinks. So yes, that goes all the way through the day and into the evenings as well.",

So you'll come in, you might have a drink, you might grab some food, then you'll hit the course around of golf takes 30 to 40 minutes, depending on how long, how busy the venue is. But each course is nine holes. And then you'll probably grab some another drink afterwards, and maybe some more food, I spent the head berries in the U.S. around 40 to $45. If you're an online booker, someone who's booked a ticket, and just come in with their friends, but then with the corporate customers, where they're booking a package and possibly booking a private room to host their event. And then the average prices are up towards 70, $80 per head, depending on the location and the time of day.",

Or is that sort of automatically assumed? GRECH-SMITH: The entry cost that covers the round of golf. So in the U.K., that's around 13, 14 pounds. In the U.S., it's about $25. But so we're quite democratically priced. You can grab a drink, you know, entry, sort of alcoholic drink would be a beer, which would be around 6, 7 pounds, or 10, $11. But then we've got a whole range of cocktails, wines, and all that sort of thing. So you can really craft your experience, but you'll get good values for a $50 spend, you're going to get your goal, you'll get a couple of drinks, and you'll get some food as well. So in terms of the amount of time and what you get for your money, it's a really great deal.",

Are you profitable in the London locations? GRECH-SMITH: Yes, we've been profitable. Since we got open businesses -- . Obviously, what we have is we are in the hospitality industry. We have our food and beverage revenue streams. But what kind of gives us the special sauce is that we've got a third revenue stream in terms of the competitive activity, the crazy gulf. So the moment is obviously very tricky for hospitality venues with this inflation. A lot of the fixed cost is going up. We're in the cost of living crisis, where people really have to think about their money. But having that third revenue stream and offering so much value for money as we do, and a whole rounded experience is making us really well placed to weather the storms.",

You know, Dubai, there are some pretty hot temperatures. And people definitely look for things to do with activities where they can get out the sun. And there's definitely a party scene in Dubai. So I think we're going to blend in well there. And then in September, we'll be opening in Las Vegas in the Mandalay Bay Resort Casino, which is the kind of culmination of a lot of our ambitions 10 years after we opened up pop up in East London, we'll be opening our Vegas site.

Now, it's actually Spain that is the slight favorite for the game on Sunday. And that probably has something to do with their amazing breakout star Salma Paralluelo. She's been just playing incredible. The 19 year old had the game winning goal against the Netherlands and then another goal against Sweden. And Paralluelo coming on as a sub both times and you know Julia, Spain is able to win at all.
