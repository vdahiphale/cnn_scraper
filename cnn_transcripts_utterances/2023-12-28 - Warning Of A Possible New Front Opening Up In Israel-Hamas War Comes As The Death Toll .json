What a member of Israel's war cabinet is saying about Hezbollah. Damage control -- Nikki Haley is hard at work trying to take back words that she didn't say. We'll explain. And later, you do it, I do it. And let's face it, it is a problem. Why is scrolling on our phone so addictive and what can we do to stop it. Hello everyone, live from New York, I'm Bianna Golodryga. Zain is off today. You are watching ONE WORLD. Israel is hinting at a possible military escalation with Hezbollah, as the tensions intensify along its northern border and concerns grow about the threat of a wider regional conflict. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to return to the Middle East next week, stopping in Israel to discuss the next step in its war with Hamas. Now, it comes as a member of Israel's War Cabinet is demanding an end to the attacks coming form Lebanon and warns that time for talk is quickly running out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENNY GANTZ, ISRAELI WAR CABINET MEMBER (through translator):  The stopwatch for a diplomatic solution is running out. If the world and the Lebanese government don't act in order to prevent the firing on Israel's northern residents and to distance Hezbollah from the border, the IDF will do it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

According to the Hamas-controlled health ministry, more than 21,000 people have been killed since October 7, 2010, in the past 24 hours alone. We should note the Ministry of Health is not distinguished between civilians and combatants. The IDF is issuing new warnings to civilians in central Gaza to evacuate to the south, including to regions that have repeatedly been attacked. Meanwhile, an edited video is being circulated on social media that appears to show Palestinian men and at least two children detained and stripped by the Israeli military. Nada Bashir is covering the story for us from London, Elliott Gotkine joins me now from Tel Aviv. Elliott, let's start with you. What prompted this warning of possible action against Hezbollah on the northern border of Israel and Lebanon from Benny Gantz yesterday?",

Hezbollah has been firing on Israelicommunities and Israeli positions pretty much since this war broke out with Hamas after its murderous rampage of October the 7th. Hezbollah has been firing on Israeli positions. Israel has been firing back at Hezbollah positions. And just today, and bear in mind that there are still five hours left of today here in Israel, more than 50 launches have been fired towards Israel, including one drone which set off air raid sirens in the suburbs north of Haifa, one of Israel's most important cities and home to its biggest port. So, this kind of tit-for-tat, this war that's not a war, has been going on for weeks now. We've had warnings from Prime Minister Netanyahu, from Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, we also heard from Eli Cohen, the Foreign Minister on Tuesday warning. And now we get this warning from Benny Gantz, former Chief of the General Staff, former Defense Minister and probably one of the less hawkish members of Israel's war cabinet giving this very stark warning to Lebanon and Hezbollah. Of course, the big problem is that it's not in the Lebanese government's gift to reign in Hezbollah. It doesn't control Hezbollah. Who controls Hezbollah? Iran. Is it going to reign in Hezbollah? Well, it seems that only Iran has the power to do so. If not, Israel is saying quite starkly that it will do so by force. Bianna.",

      "sentences": "It certainly is a troubling video which has been circulating for a few days now on social media. CNN hasn't been ableto confirm the exact date in which this video was shot, but has geo-located it to the Yarmouk Stadium in central Gaza. And as you can see in the video, a number of men, teenagers and what appears to be two young children seen stripped to their underwear, blindfolded hands above their heads or some tied behind their back. Elsewhere, in the video, you also see some women fully clothed but also blindfolded with their hands tied behind their back, held in the stadium as troops line the stadium, inspecting them as it shows in the video and also military vehicles roaming the stadium, as well. Now, this has really triggered and sparked concern over the treatment of Palestinians in Gaza detained by the Israeli military, particularly of course as in the video. You see many of them have been stripped down of particular concern around the detention of children. Now, the Israeli military says it strips detainees to ensure they aren't carrying explosives. But the fact that in this video, you do see detainees seemingly stripped for a longer period of time has raised concern. We've heard from the Euro- Mediterranean Human Rights Monitoring Organization, which says it has received reports of many in this region of central Gaza being detained, including women, who they say have reported mistreatment, harassment and abuse by the Israeli military, saying as well they have received reports of the detention of children as young as 12, the elderly some as old as 70, as well. Now, of course we have had warnings from the United Nations own human rights office with regards to the detention of Palestinians in Gaza. I'll read you just a bit from the statement from the U.N.'s Human Rights Office issued earlier this month saying the U.N. Human Rights Office has received numerous disturbing reports from the north of Gaza of mass detentions, ill treatment and enforced disappearance of possibly thousands of Palestinian men and boys and a number of women and girls at the hands of Israeli Defense Forces. Most were rounded up as they were attempting to move south or were taken during operations conducted on their homes, hospitals, schools and other places of refuge. The U.N. also goes on to say that it has received reports of ill treatment which, if confirmed, could amount to torture. Now, of course, the Israeli military says it has called on all civilians to evacuate South and it has reason to be suspicious of any civilians who do not heed that warning and remain in northern and central Gaza. But the U.N. has reiterated that regardless of these evacuation orders, Israel remains obligated to respect and protect the lives of civilians throughout the Gaza Strip. There is, of course, mounting concern over these evacuation orders, of course, given the fact that we continue to see airstrikes and, of course, a spreading ground incursion by the Israeli military focusing now on the South according to the Israeli military.

      "sentences": "Well, it's a very important question, Bianna.  Eighty three days after thewar began, we can analyze the strategic analysis. And I do think that the public and the decision-makers in Israel are much more realistic today than they were 83 days ago. During the first weeks of the war, we saw, we found in the Israeli discourse, all kinds of a very general slogans about the goals of the war, like erasing Hamas or defeating them in a quite short or limited operation. And I do think that today, there are two insights -- basic insights among the public, the army, and the decision makers in Israel. The first one is that you should be very focused on your goal in Hamas. You cannot pretend that you can implement the full erasing of Hamas. You can destroy the military infrastructure, even the political one, but you must understand that even after Hamas will be defeated in the military manner, Hamas will still exist in Gaza Strip, in East Jerusalem, and in the West Bank. The second insight regards the time. We do understand in Israel today that this kind of war is much tougher and much longer than we assessed 83 days ago. You know, every day, Bianna, there are achievements, there is an advance -- a military advance on the field. But we do understand that we face an ideological hardline, ideological enemy, which will really create a very complicated and a very tough arena of war. And that's why we do understand today that if we want to complete or to implement the whole target -- the whole strategic target of the war, we should be ready for a long and tough war.",

So, the idea that it could be dismantled andthey could be fully decimated, right, within a matter of three or four months seems to be rather questionable at this point. It's interesting that this was the first time this week that we'd heard from the IDF specifically attaching a number figure to the combatants they say have been killed thus far in the war -- a little over 8000. But what's notable is that none of Hamas' top military leadership, from Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Dave, Marwan Issa, are among those believed to have been killed at this point. Does that surprise you?",

They all, or almost all of them, are in the tunnels under the hospitals and other important sides in Gaza. I do think, Bianna, regarding this question of Yahya Sinwar that it is one of the prominent targets of Israel or should be one of the prominent targets of Israel, because Yahya Sinwar, the person himself is a key, is a basic key, and he's actually a game changer. If he will disappear from the political or the military arena, I do assess that things in Hamas, inside Hamas, and in Gaza Strip will be different. For example, the vanishing, the disappearance of Yahya Sinwar will cause a symbolic and even a functional damage to Hamas. I do not think that it will be the end of the game and it will be the end of the war. But it will no doubt change the whole basic equation, which is very, very strict right now and very, very complicated right now between Israel and Hamas.",

By the way, I think that the reasons for this attitude is first, the growing fear of the resistance camp and mainly of Iran, that Yahya Sinwar is going to be defeated and that Tehran will lose one of its prominent members of the resistance camp. And the other one is the willingness of Iran to respond on all kinds of operations of Israel, such as the killing of one of the supreme commanders of the revolutionary guards during the week in Syria with no direct clash between Iran and Israel, but via their proxies. I do think that Israel should now act in a very cautious manner toward the northern arena. I do think that we should retaliate for every violation, but on the same time try really to attempt to promote a diplomatic and a political solution. Regarding the Lebanese arena, I do think, Bianna, that there is also an opportunity for Israel regarding the internal arena in Lebanon. The internal arena opposes very much every kind of escalation --",

So, for her, it is a distraction in a moment where she has had all of this momentum and some wind at her back. But if you zoom out just a little further, we also have to remember that in these early states and nationally, the polling continues to show that the former president, Donald Trump, is absolutely the frontrunner, running some double digits ahead of Nikki Haley in some states of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis in Iowa. So, he's happy, and his campaign is happy to let her deal with all of this.

What you didn't mention before is that I'm a settler. I was living all my life with my family in the West Bank and in the Golan Heights. And for me, it wasn't like a mission or something that we choose. And when we came out to make hummus together, and Jalil coming with such a long heritage and experience as a family that's making hummus for hundreds of years. And with that, I had an opinion about how hummus should be taste like and what's the right way to make it. And once we settled that and we allowed ourselves try even that the recipe doesn't make sense to us in the beginning, we dare to cross this fear and dare to do this recipe and bring the both -- both of the best recipes, the secret of the family of Jalil, the secret of the hummus of my grandmother, put it all together in one plan, one plate without ego, without thinking one thing is better than the other. Just take the best and the rules that each one brings to the hummus and bring it to one plate. And without notice, it's become like also a recipe for peace and a way for us to solve so many things over the future. No ego, bring the best, and understand that if you want to create something, and food is to create energy in the end, you know. It is -- create energy and this is what we do.

Jalil, I know that you shut the restaurant down immediately following the October 7th attacks.
