Meanwhile, children will be heading back to school in Ukraine this week. And they are at the heart of so many war crimes being carried out by Russia. I spoke with the United States Ambassador At-Large for Global Criminal Justice Beth Van Schaack about what the U.S. is trying to do to help hold those responsible to account. Also in the headlines this hour in Hong Kong a powerful storm starting to bear down on the city. Hundreds of flights canceled businesses and schools have closed and Hong Kong is now under the highest warning possible. In Gabon coup leaders appear to be moving ahead with their plans to rule the country despite international condemnation, a plan to swearing the country's transitional President before the constitutional court on Monday. Ukraine says it is consolidating positions in the south of the country while Russia is reported to be strengthening its defenses. But Kyiv says its troops are making progress. The Ukrainian Security Service video shared exclusively with CNN shows just how entrenched Russia is on the frontlines South of Zaporizhzhia? Meantime for the fourth day in a row, Russia reporting Ukrainian drone attacks on its soil. Here are some of the recent targets which illustrate an apparent new effort by Ukraine to hit inside Russia. Officials say air defenses intercepted one drone headed towards Moscow overnight. We'll CNN's Chief International Correspondent Christiane Amanpour is in Kyiv for us. And I do want to talk about the progress or not as it were on the battlefield. Christiane, before we do that, let's talk about these drones because Ukraine, doesn't comment on activity outside of its borders. So what do we understand to be going on here?",

And now it turns out that Budanov, General Budanov of the Defense Intelligence Unit here basically is saying that these attacks happen from inside Russia. They are denying that it happened from Ukraine into Russia. But obviously, the implication is that there are saboteurs working on their behalf inside Russia. Then he also has been saying to a Ukrainian television interviewer, that this is all part of a strategy to take the war into, as they put it, the territory of that enemy IE into Russia, and to tie Russia up to absolutely try to put pressure on Russia in whatever way they can. Because, you know, they have had a hard time they have not got the equipment that they need in order to project into Russia. And NATO has prevented them from using any of the equipment it gives to, you know, project that into Russia. So they're doing it by the means that they can. These are by military drones, by the way. And as you know, I found -- and followed, a training encampment here in Ukraine of civilians who have been recruited to the fight in this drone warfare using civilian drones and weaponizing them and they're having a lot of impact on the battlefield as well.

Again, we can see from the Hong Kong observatory radar, you've got some of those darker yellow and green rain bands indicating the very heavy downpours at times, and it's going to continue to come in waves as it makes its way out towards the west, we do expect it to weaken as it begins to shift west. But keep in mind weakening doesn't necessarily mean we won't still have issues. We're still going to have gusty winds, we're still going to have those heavy rain bands continue as we go through the weekend. And the system continues to make its way off to the west and eventually down to the south and west. But we also have a secondary system as well, this one to the, just a little bit east of Saola. This one has sustained winds of 140 kilometers per hour moving due west at 13 kilometers per hour. This system is expected to cross over Taiwan in the next 36 to 48 hours from now. With that said, you're going to start to see some of those impacts as early as 24 hours from now, those winds are going to start to pick back up. Rain bands are going to start to increase in both intensity and frequency as we go through the weekend. And then it will continue and make its way off towards Mainland China, however slightly a little bit weaker than its current state. Now rainfall is going to be a significant concern for both of these systems. With Saola, you're looking at widespread rainfall totals of 50 to 100 millimeters, but you will have some areas that could pick up 150 if not even as much as 200 millimeters. The secondary system is quite a different story here. Much more significant rainfall, especially across Taiwan where you're looking at widespread rainfall totals of at least 200. But some areas that could pick up 250 if not even as much as 300 millimeters of rain over the course of time so again, two different systems here, Becky that we're keeping a close eye on as they continue to bring impacts throughout the weekend.",

A judge sentence Joseph Biggs to 17 years in prison that is one of the longest sentences yet for someone convicted in this case. He handed a second member 15 years in prison. Here is CNN's Evan Perez with the latest. EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR U.S. JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: A federal judge handed down lengthy prison sentences to two members of the far right pro Trump proud boys group for their roles in the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Judge Timothy Kelly sentence Joseph Biggs to 17 years and he's sentenced Zachary Rehl to 15 years. The judge said that the violence on that day robbed Americans of a long tradition of a peaceful transfer of power. Speaking from the bench during that big sentencing, the judge said the nature of the constitutional moment we were in that day is something that is so sensitive, that it deserves a significant sentence. The two men are the first of five members of the proud boys set to be sentenced in the coming days. And that includes Enrique Tarrio, the leader of the group. Prosecutors asked for sentences of more than 30 years for each of the proud boys' members. Both men spoke tearfully in court noting that they will now lose out on seeing their daughters grow up. Biggs told the court, I know that I messed up that day, but I'm not a terrorist. And Rehl told the judge, he's no longer interested in politics saying, I'm done peddling lies for other people who don't care about me. It's a clear reference to Donald Trump, the former President who inspired the violence on January 6, and who faces his own day in federal court in Washington in the coming months.

But an unexpected tick up at the same time in the unemployment rate points to an easing in the labor market. And the Fed who will be keeping a keen eye on this with regard interest rates, we'll be interested to see those numbers. Let's bring in Vanessa Yurkevich. Vanessa, certainly there appears to be some relatively robust U.S. economy here when you look at the sort of headline figures. I think it's just important that we give a sense to our viewers of what this sort of really means going forward for interest rates, for inflation and for the health of the U.S. economy as a whole.",

Well, North Koreans who have been stranded abroad for the past three years will be finally able to return home. That's because Pyongyang has begun lifting the tight COVID restrictions that effectively sealed its borders. My colleague, Paula Hancocks is in Seoul and has this report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): North Korea's athletes are back on the global stage. Its taekwondo team headlined at the opening ceremony of the World Championships in Kazakhstan this month, believed to be the first overseas sporting engagement since its borders reopened. Pyongyang confirmed its borders a reopening to allow citizens stranded outside the country for more than three and a half years to return. One week quarantine required on arrival, North Korean restrictions were among the harshest in the world. It is considered one of the last countries to reopen its borders, and even then they're only opening a crack with some international flights resuming with China and Russia. Tourism though is still a dream. Koryo Tours, which specializes in taking Westerners into North Korea, says they've heard nothing beyond plans to repatriate its own citizens. Quarantine alone makes tourism impractical.",
