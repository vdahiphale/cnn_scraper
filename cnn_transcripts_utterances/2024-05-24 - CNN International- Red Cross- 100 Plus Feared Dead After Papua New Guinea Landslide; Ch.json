It's in the north of the country where, as you say, this landslide occurred. It's believed to have killed more than 100 people, although some experts think that that is a conservative number.It happened around three o'clock this morning. The village is Kaokalam. It is located near an unused gold mine. It's known as an agricultural area, but this is the highlands of Enga province. As you can see from the pictures and the video, you know, it's part of the hillside that has just slipped down into the valley, you know, flattening houses in its path. One eyewitness told local media that the entire village was gone. There are images of villagers, you know, trying to find any survivors. Obviously now this is very much a recovery operation. The large boulders, the tree trunks, the collapsed buildings, you know, scattering the earth are making it very difficult to recover those bodies. They will need heavy machinery to move that earth. The highway, Max, to the area has been cut off, making it inaccessible at the moment for rescue workers to reach this scene. And a Red Cross official told CNN a little earlier that a recent earthquake and heavy rainfall in the area may have been responsible for triggering the deadly landslide. Let's take a listen.

Let's get more from CNN senior international correspondent Will Ripley reporting from Taipei.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A chaotic start for Taiwan's new president, Lai Ching-te, just days after taking office, China launching large-scale military exercises and protesters taking to the streets of the capital Taipei. Operation Joint Sword 2024A set to encircle Taiwan over two days. Dozens of Chinese aircraft, warships and Coast Guard vessels. Beijing describing the drills as a powerful punishment for so-called separatist forces in Taiwan. A dramatic increase in military pressure on the island democracy. WEN-TI SUNG, FELLOW, ATLANTIC COUNCIL'S GLOBAL CHINA HUB: I think Beijing will likely respond with fire fury. That's almost to be expected from Beijing. RIPLEY (voice-over): Senior security officials in Taipei tell CNN most of the aircraft crossed into Taiwan's self-declared air defense identification zone, a move the island's defense ministry calls a serious provocation. SUN LI-FANG, TAIWAN DEFENSE MINISTRY SPOKESMAN: Their military exercise is not helping with the situation around Taiwan Strait. RIPLEY (voice-over): China's military says: The exercises are a direct response to the separatist provocations and external interferences. They say: The motherland must be reunified and will inevitably be reunified. In his inauguration speech this week, Lai calling on the communist mainland to stop its military and political intimidation and recognize the sovereignty of democratic Taiwan using the island's official name, the Republic of China. LAI CHING-TE, TAIWAN PRESIDENT (through translator): I hope that China will face the reality of the Republic of China's existence and respect the choices of the people of Taiwan. RIPLEY (voice-over): Words seen by some as a departure from the cautious tone taken by his predecessor Tsai Ing-wen. President Lai's first days have been anything but calm. Massive youth protests erupted outside parliament. Demonstrators protesting a push by opposition parties to subject the island's new leader to tighter scrutiny from China-friendly lawmakers. More chaos inside Taiwan's fiercely divided parliament. A massive brawl broke out last week over those legislative reform bills. In the Taiwanese capital, confidence in the government and the military. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): If the Chinese Communist Party does attack Taiwan, it won't be easy. Taiwanese people are not afraid of war. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): I believe leaders will prioritize people's happiness. So I'm not worried. I think peace will be maintained. RIPLEY (voice-over): A fragile peace in tumultuous times for President Lai. Military threats across the Taiwan Strait and deep divisions at home.",

One was a 42-year-old male from Tel Aviv. And the third was a 30-year-old French Mexican citizen. I believe that most of them were at that Nova festival, that music festival, that was the target of some of the Hamas attacks on the 7th of October. This appears the -- basically, the Israeli military hasn't been able to free any live hostages now for quite some time. Now, William Burns, the head of the CIA, is coming to Europe to try to get the talks going again. They fell apart at the beginning of May, when there was some confusion about Egyptian offers accepted by Hamas for exchange of hostages for a ceasefire. But now they're trying again to get that to work. But certainly what we've seen is that, you know, we're now in May, the last time there was any proper release of hostages in exchange for a period of relative quiet, and the release of Palestinian prisoners and detainees was back in November, the end of November last year. And since then, there have been -- there's been much back and forth involving the Americans, the Qataris, the Egyptians, the Israelis and others. But until now, it has not borne any fruit -- Max.",

Crowds at the funeral screaming death to Israel from Iranian soil in retaliation for the bombing of Iran's embassy compound in Syria. Crowds at the funeral screaming death to Israel and death to America. Vowing to remain loyal to Raisi's hardline agenda. 100 percent, 100 percent this man says, these are all Raisi's and they will continue. And this woman says, we have come here to say if they took Raisi from us, we still have our supreme leader and we back him and we'll never leave him alone.

I think for many African countries, Kenya included, they see real benefit in not having to choose between Washington and Beijing. They want to choose both.
