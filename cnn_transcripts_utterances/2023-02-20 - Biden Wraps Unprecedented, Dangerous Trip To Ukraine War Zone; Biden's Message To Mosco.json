We talked to another group of students though, who underscored that while this was a very important symbolic gesture of support, and while they hoped it sent a strong signal to the world, they also hope that it will be followed up by more in the way of that heavy weaponry we have heard Ukrainian officials asking for again and again, that we also heard President Volodymyr Zelenskyy again today reiterating had come up in their discussion, long-range artillery, fighter jets, things of this nature. We did hear from the chief of staff of President Zelenskyy's, Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak, who said that, quote, issues have been resolved and those that were stuck have been sped up.

OKSANA MARKAROVA, UKRAINIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES:  It's almost impossible to describe it with words, but today, once again, when President Biden was in Kyiv, was with our president, we understood what we knew before, that even though our countries are divided by thousands of kilometers and ocean, we are united by bravery and by love to freedom and our willingness to fight for it.

We know that President Zelenskyy has asked repeatedly in the past for President Biden to visit. He said during the press conference that the two of them gave that this conversation had brought Ukraine one step closer to victory. And, really, it's being seen as a sort of guarantee that the U.S. is in this for the long haul, that they believe Ukraine can do it, and that they're going to help them go about doing it.In terms of the real-time, substantive on the ground impact of the trip, I think it's difficult to judge yet. Obviously, the greatest short-term need at the moment is ammunition. That has been a huge problem for the Ukrainians, particularly in the east, fierce fighting in Bakhmut. They are burning through ammunition quicker than NATO and the U.S. had been able to resupply it. That appears to have been addressed today. But the broader, long-term question here is about those heavier weapons, that long-range artillery, potentially those fighter jets. Some clues that there may be some progress on that front from the Ukrainian side, but nothing specific being described yet, Wolf.",

You know all the planning and level of detail that goes into a presidential trip, especially a secret one to an active war zone where there are no U.S. forces. That's typically not what you would see. When the president went to the Middle East in the past, there were a lot of U.S. military on the ground. It changed the calculus here.But what President Biden and his team essentially decided here is that the risk that they were taking by sending him into that active war zone was worth the message that they were sending, that unwavering support for Ukraine, that message that Clarissa was just talking about that comes in real dollars but also in just the idea that he was on the ground there. And it's literally the story of trains, planes and automobiles, Wolf. I mean, he left Washington before dawn. He got on a plane where the shades were drawn. It was kind of not where typically you would see cameras where he goes and gets on Air Force One, it was off to the side. He then flew to Poland. That is where he boarded that train for that ten-hour ride that he took into Kyiv. And that is how he got there. They did not fly into Kyiv. They cannot fly, of course. And so like other world leaders, he took this ten-hour train ride as he was there on the ground. Then got back on the train, took the ten-hour ride back, and then flew here to Poland safely, of course, making it across the border. But it was a remarkable trip that was shrouded in secrecy. They took the cell phones of the two reporters that they brought with them. Only really a handful of staff, including a photographer and a small medical team and a few aides went with President Biden here. And it just speaks to the level of how much they tried to keep this clandestine as he was making this visit.",

This is bigger than just Russia. There's more involved here.So, I think the combination of things that have been done in the last 48 hours have been very strong in terms of shoring up American support for the allied effort in Ukraine.",

Despite the boon that Ukraine has had from these incredible counteroffensives and their successes against the Russian military, it has been a very grim winter for the people of Ukraine. The fighting is fierce in the east. In the south, in Kherson, that was recently liberated, this is now being shelled relentlessly every single day. There is an ongoing ruthless campaign by the Russians to try to target every piece of critical civilian infrastructure that they can, so that the power doesn't work well, so that there are rolling blackouts, so there is a lack of heat, so that there is not enough pressure to pump running water into people's homes.So, it has been a very bleak time indeed and there are really concerns that Ukraine has low stamina at this stage, that people are exhausted, that they have also lost a huge number of troops. Russia obviously at an even greater rate, but Ukraine too is suffering from many soldiers who are being killed in action. So, it is a very difficult time, and they are looking at the horizon ahead, and they are hoping that they are going to continue to get the support they need to carry them through what could be a very ugly spring.",

And who knows, but I think we have to look for something a little bit unexpected.

I think we can look for a big chunk of criticism about what is called in Russia the satanic west and the United States. But, essentially, I think it's very important for Putin.

That is because up until fairly recently, he was still doing Sunday school lessons right here in town. We also, on the edge of town, as we were driving in, there's this large peanut statue, and this was actually used during President Carter's 1976 campaign. And we saw a man sort of feverishly repainting this statue. Carter, of course, a former peanut farmer, all day today, we saw peanut trucks going up and down main street, and he told us that, essentially, he felt like he had to do this now. He was putting this off. He's a mail carrier in addition to a painter, and he really felt as though now with so many eyes on this town, that he wanted it to look good as Plains is now being looked at on the world and national stage.
