Now, the question, really, I mean, when you think about it, Alisyn, right, is, has it broken? I mean, this was a no good, terrible week or month for Donald Trump. But yesterday with Herschel Walker's loss, I mean, was that it? S.E. CUPP, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  I think you have to parse out Republican political electives and then the Republican base. I think Republicans in office and Republican leadership are wondering how they can win again and maybe regretting that Faustian bargain they made in 2016 to accept all the crap that comes with Trump for very short-term gain, let's be clear. But the base, I think, is all-in on Trump still. They're not affected by this kind of stuff. It makes Trump more of a victim and a loner and, you know, a strongman out on his own. You still hear people like Marjorie Taylor Greene complaining that Republicans weren't like helpful enough to Herschel Walker, not that Herschel Walker was the problem. So, yes, I think you're going to see it on the politico side, not the base. And that's where you're going to need to see the change for real votes to change.",
