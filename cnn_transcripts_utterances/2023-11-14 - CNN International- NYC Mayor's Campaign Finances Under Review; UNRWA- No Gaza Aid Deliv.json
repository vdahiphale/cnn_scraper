That makes them straw donors, and that brings up the allegation of campaign finance fraud, not just creating straw donors, but getting matching funds for the campaign from the city.TODD (voice-over): CNN's John Miller was deputy commissioner of the New York Police Department and served under Mayor Adams. Miller left the department in July 2022. Mayor Adams has denied any wrongdoing, and says he has nothing to hide. Adams's phones and iPad were seized in public last week, just days after the FBI raided the home of his chief fundraiser.",

The Palestinian Telecommunications Ministry is warning that Gaza faces a complete halt of communications and internet services by Thursday.The main U.N. agency that provides assistance for Palestinian refugees says it will not be able to deliver humanitarian aid today because it's running out of fuel. Israel is forbidden just about all fuel deliveries to the territory. Meanwhile, UNICEF estimates more than 700,000 children have been displaced in Gaza since the war started on October the 7th, and more than 1.5 million people have been internally displaced. Joining me now from Ramallah in the West Bank is Nebal Farsakh, spokesperson for the Palestine Red Crescent Society. Thank you for joining us. Hearing there that no aid is getting in at all to those key parts of Gaza is that your understanding as well?",

And now at this level of the operation, they're surrounding buildings they say are full of Hamas fighters. But what you're saying is civilians are being caught in that. So they're not only getting a -- not only not getting any aid or medical support, they also can't leave their homes. Is that correct?",

They are part of family members, who family members that decisions to stay with them because basically they can't leave. Those who are sick and injured, just alone in their homes and just turn their back. And the only way to evacuate is just walking for 2-3-4 hours at least four hours. So basically, those with disabilities, people with disabilities, elderly people, sick people, they can't afford to do that. Their families have stayed with them and unfortunately, they are trapped in their homes with no food, no water, no supplies, no power.And unfortunately, even us or -- we feel helpless. We can't even reach out to them. On top of that, another example at Al-Quds Hospital, which is run by the Palestine Red Crescent, we have announced Al-Quds Hospital went out of service two days ago. And after that we only now have 300 patients with their families, along with the medical staff. Up to this moment, they are still trapped at Al-Quds Hospital, unable to go out of the of the hospital, no one can reach out to them because all the surrounding areas, all the roads are completely closed. This is the six days we have lost connection with our colleagues there. When I'm talking to you now, I'm not sure if they are still alive or not. Because basically, the only way to report anything regarding the situation there is via VHF waves, which is unstable and has constant distortion. And like they have to wait a couple of hours until they catch the signal. There have been a complete destruction of the internet and a communication line, so I can just pick up the phone and call them. So the situation is dire. They are now there for over a week with no food, no water, no electricity. On top of that they are trapped, hearing continuous bombardments that is taking place in the surrounding area. And there is continuous shooting. Yesterday we tried to evacuate them by coordination with the ICRC. Unfortunately, last minute after Israel's occupation forces have searched the cars and did everything, they have notified us that after they give the approval earlier that they can't let us -- that they can't let the convoy pass to Al-Quds Hospital because there is a military operation in that area.",

Mount Etna erupted Sunday, sending molten lava some 4,500 meters, or nearly 15,000 feet above sea level, according to the National Institute of Geophysics and volcanologists at the Observatory. Now a huge plume of smoke could be seen rising into the red sky over Sicily and some loud explosions were heard as well. However, it's not expected to disrupt nearby air services as it did when it erupted last August.Iceland also seeing some volcanic activity after hundreds of quakes over the weekend. The Icelandic Met Office now says seismic activity in the region is decreasing, although the volcanic hazard assessment remains unchanged. As a result, thousands remain evacuated CNN's Fred Pleitgen has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
