Scavino told Smith's investigators that Trump, quote, \"was just not interested in doing more to stop the violence.\" Let's discuss that and more with John Dean, CNN contributor and former White House counsel in the Nixon administration, CNN political commentator S.E.

It creates a schism between what is real, what happened, what actually happened, the reason those people are sitting in jail, and what Trump says is real. And you have -- so when you have someone like Elise Stefanik does that, right, Elise Stefanik knows they are not hostages. She knows that if you break the law like these people did, many of whom did it on camera or, you know, live streamed it, that then go to jail. This is how these things work.

But it's worth thinking about on Friday, Joe Biden gave a speech at Gettysburg. It was -- Valley Forge, not Gettysburg, I'm sorry. Valley Forge, and it was this very meaningful and important speech about democracy, which stated many, many facts, right? Like, you know, facts like how many police officers got injured, and things that were not anything that could be interpreted as anything but facts. And then the next day, Trump does this crazy rally where he says all sorts of stuff about the, you know, the Civil War, and a lot of mainstream media coverage just compares these two as if they are the same, and they are not, right? Trump is a dangerous autocrat who will not be a dictator except on day one. And Biden is trying to preserve American democracy.

So we're really comparing authoritarian personalities.And I've got to tell you that Trump is the poster boy. He is the worst we ever had, the most dangerous we've ever had, and Nixon actually had a conscience. That's something Donald Trump doesn't have, and makes it much easier for Trump to do whatever he wants to do, whereas Nixon actually had lines he wouldn't cross.

What did you think when you saw all of this? CAPT. C.B. \"SULLY\" SULLENBERGER, SUCCESSFULLY LANDED PLANE ON HUDSON RIVER: Well, I'm sure it was shocking for everyone on the airplane. It would be very sudden and very loud, it would be cold as that air from 16,000 feet entered the cabin, but it sounds like the crew handled it very well. The passengers remained calm.

Of course absent that warning light in the cockpit and maybe some noise, they wouldn't really know what was going on in the cabin, so it's important that the flight attendants inform the captain and the first office officer what the situation was and what they knew was going wrong.",

It's also fortunate there was not someone seated in that seat right by the exit, and it is important that people kept their seatbelts fastened near there, so they would not be sucked out of the airplane by the sudden rush of this change in air pressure. We had a tragic situation a number of years ago where a woman, Jennifer Riordan was actually pulled partway out of an airplane and did not survive that when an engine part hit the cabin and blew a window out.

And so -- and then you have to take credit for those things. And so yes, Jim Clyburn is so correct on that. In particular, one of the things that I talk about with my friends, Charlamagne, who has been a thorn in the side of the White House and others is this simple fact that this election is not just Donald Trump versus Joe Biden, it is Donald Trump versus Joe Biden versus the couch. And I think the White House is having a hard time understanding that a lot of Black folk may just stay home if they don't feel as if they've been spoken to, messaged towards, cared about, and the policies don't positively affect them. Right or wrong, we are going to do our damnedest to get them out, but that's a realization that the White House has come to realize.",
