      "sentences": "Yes. Good morning, Michael, and interesting analysis there. Look, I think there are four, four factors that are shaping the environment for '24 that have changed the world since Trump and Biden face each other the first time in 2020. The two big factors that are hurting Biden, the headwinds for him are, as you said, the concerns about his age, three quarters of Americans saying he's too old to do the job for a second term and concerns about inflation. You know, I talked to Stanley Greenberg, a longtime Democratic pollster since the '80s, his poll for parties all over the world, and he points out that the destabilizing effect of inflation lasts longer in the minds and in the finances of average voters and political leaders often recognize.And then, though, there are two big factors on the other side that are weakening Trump, and one of those is abortion, the desire to the majority support for maintaining legal abortion. And the second really is insurrection and democracy, the belief that he -- the majority believe in the public that his actions after 2020 were illegal and unconstitutional. And when you take age and inflation on one side, and abortion and insurrection on the other side, what you see right now is that sums the stalemate.",

I think that's a fair statement. And he looks at those accomplishments and says, you know, I still have my fastball. Second, I think the people -- him and the people around him are much more worried than you suggested that a fight to succeed him with tear apart the Democratic Party, precisely as it needs to go up against what I think virtually all Democrats and many non-Democrats view as an existential threat to American democracy, and Trump. And then third, you know, people don't -- it gets a seat -- you know, hand over power as president very often. Who was the last president not run for reelection? I think it would be Calvin Coolidge, right? There not seek at least one reelection. So, you know, there are lots of reasons why he should consider stepping off the stage. But there are also some powerful ones for why he would stay in. And I think most Democrats believe that it's going to be the latter course. And they've got to figure out a way to make this work. And by the way, if you look at the 2022 results, despite all of the problems that Biden faces, they were all present there in 2022 as well. And in the states that will likely decide the winner next year, Arizona and Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, among them, abortion and democracy did outweigh inflation and concerns about Biden in those key governor's races.",

And the second response that I have is to say, everything I offered in the opening commentary today was fact based. There was no hyperbole in there whatsoever. Very little opinion. It was me looking at polling data, and looking at the nomination schedule, and saying, you know what, maybe this is going to change. I do want to know what you think. Go to my website at smerconish.com and answer this week's poll question, will Joe Biden be the Democratic nominee in 2024? Up ahead, this statue of abolitionist heroine Harriet Tubman has toured 19 states too much a claim. Would your response to it be at all affected by the fact that the sculptor who made it was white that has caused a fracas here in Philadelphia? And I will explain.

The Drudge Report led its website this morning with the headline, \"Not Again Mask Up in New York.\" Lead story at CBS News this morning, \"COVID hospitalizations on the rise as U.S. enters Labor Day weekend.\"The past several weeks I've seen reports from all over the country of a rise in cases and yes, the CDC reports COVID-19 hospital admissions are up more than 19 percent in the most recent week, and a few school districts this is even led to canceled classes and sporting events. A handful of companies and schools have responded to outbreaks on their premises by reinstating mask mandates among them several hospital systems including Kaiser Permanente in Northern California, Morris Brown College in Atlanta, Dillard University in Louisiana, Lionsgate film studio in Santa Monica. But so far, so far, those have been the few exceptions. And this graph shows how the current rise in hospitalizations compares to past searches less than half the numbers this time last year and still lower than they've been for about 80 percent of the pandemic. But if things get worse, it may be hard to get people to revert to an abundance of caution. According to Gallup in the first two years public confidence in the U.S. healthcare system has dropped from 44 percent to 34 percent. And Donald Trump took to Truth Social to again make the issue political, accusing the latest outbreak to be hype designed to impact the 2024 election. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

ANTHONY FAUCI, FORMER CHIEF MEDICAL ADVISER TO THE PRESIDENT: Well, Michael, that's a very good question, as you said, if we get to that. I mean, we're starting to see a surge of cases, as you mentioned, about an 18 percent or 19 percent increase in hospitalizations certainly going in the wrong direction with looks like a late summer and into the fall surge. How bad it's going to get? We don't know. As you know, this is a very unpredictable virus has shown us that over the last three and a half years. I am concerned that people will not abide by recommendations. And we're not talking about mandates or forcing anybody but when you have a situation where the volume of cases in society gets to a reasonably high level, particularly the vulnerable, those who are elderly, and those with underlying conditions are going to be more susceptible and vulnerable if they do get infected to get severe disease leading to hospitalization. We know that. That's a fact. We've seen that. So I would hope that if in fact we get to the point where the volume of cases is such an organization's like the CDC recommend, CDC doesn't mandate anything, I mean, recommends that people wear masks, I would hope that they abide by the recommendation and take into account the risk to themselves and to their families.

When we were dealing, Michael, with the tsunami that we saw earlier on in the pandemic, when things had to be shut down because we were having hospitals that were overcrowded and we were having freezer trucks in front of hospitals in New York and other cities because we had no place to put the bodies, that was a very, very dramatic situation that needed something immediately to stop it.The question is, how long should a shutdown have been? And I think that there's varying degrees of differences in that. And I agree that I, if you look back at the things that I've said back then, we should try as best as possible to keep the schools open and the schools that are closed to get them open safely, by any have a number of means, including increasing the ventilation in schools, making sure that the people around the children are properly vaccinated. So I agree. I mean, there was a point where we had a shutdown, but the duration of the shutdown is something that is questionable. And I think people rather appropriately should be examining of whether or not things should have been shut down for so long. But the initial shutting down was something that really had to have been done, Michael, because we were in desperate situations then. SMERCONISH: Given the public sentiment that I shared at the outset, people saying, there's no way I'd mask up again. A final thought from Dr. Fauci.

But there may be individual institutions, organizations that are going to say, if you want to come to work, you've got to wear a mask.There's nothing that the federal government can do about that. If people want to do it locally, I think people need to realize it is extremely unlikely that you're going to see a mandate, for example, from the CDC, which has no authority to mandate anything with regard to mask, they can only recommend it.

Questions of cultural appropriation they keep popping up of late in all kinds of circumstances, TV, music, fashion, movies. And now the issue has caried into the world of public art, specifically a sculpture here in Philadelphia.Back in 2017, sculptor Wesley Wofford, who is White, was commissioned by a private collector to create a sculpture of abolitionist heroine, Harriet Tubman. When he posted pictures of the statue called a Journey to Freedom, many people asked if they could see it in person. Since the terms of his commission did not allow a reproduction he created an artist proof of it, and starting in February of 2020 went on the road with a tour of nearly 20 American cities. It was displayed here in Philadelphia from January through March of 2022 in honor of Tubman's 200th birthday. It became so popular that the city asked to buy it. But again, the contract with the original owner meant it couldn't be sold so Philadelphia commissioned Wofford to the tune of about $500,000 to make a new work featuring her to stand in front of city hall. Then the complaints began. Artists and other committee members argued that the city should have used a public selection process rather than awarding a commission. And part of the outrage was because he is a White guy. Had been selected at first the city defended its choice. Kelly Lee, the executive director of the Office of Arts and Culture and Creative Economy, who is herself African American said this in a statement, \"Philadelphia would not be commissioning this permanent Harriet Tubman statue if not for the public's positive response to Wofford's temporary statue. It would be inappropriate for the city to bring in a different artist to recreate the artistic expression of Wesley Wofford.\" And members of Tubman's maternal family released this statement, \"We believe Mr. Wofford is an excellent choice for creating the permanent statue of Harriet Tubman. We agree that a call to artists may have provided for an opportunity for an artist of color, but support Wesley Wofford receiving the commission. Ultimately, the city backtracked. They issued an open call for submissions. They then received 50 applications and recently announced these five semi-finalist designs, all created by Black artists. The public was asked to vote on its preference with that vote ending last night. This public feedback will be weighed in the final decision-making in October by a committee composed of members of Tubman's family, historians, educators, artists, and others. Wesley Wofford decided not to compete. He joins me now. He is on the board of directors of the National Sculpture Society. He has won both an Emmy and an Oscar for his work of the field of prosthetic makeup. Wesley, thank you for being here. I should underscore you did not ask for this controversy, right?
