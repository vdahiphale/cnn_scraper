All that said and establish.To put it in context, Hezbollah has in excess of 100,000 rockets and missiles. Israel believes that at least 25,000 perhaps 30,000 of them are precise munitions, meaning precise missiles, meaning that they could hit Haifa, as you mentioned, or infrastructure or military bases in the northern and even central part of Israel. And so that's an entirely different ballgame. On top of which the Israeli public, following 10 months of the war in Gaza and the horrors of October 7 is jaded, is depleted and deflated.

First, the risk isn't simply to Lebanon. It's also to Israeli cities and towns because the reprisals from Hezbollah are likely to be quite severe. You also set a targeted response. In escalation -- I don't think there's anything called targeted. I think unfortunately the calculations that people make will be based on variables that they cannot control. And with any response from the Israelis, without taking into account the broader context in which this conflict is occurring which of course is the bombardment of Gaza and the destruction of so much of it, you're going to continue to have this situation where unfortunately there will be reprisals, there will be escalations. The key to deescalating this entire situation is Gaza. It is getting a cease-fire there.

People can't calculate these sorts of things with any degree of certainty and that's why again, you know the way forward is to move towards actively de-escalation as opposed to assuming that this constant reckless behavior can continue without something really spiraling out of control. It's a deep risk, I have to be clear, John, over the past ten months. This is why so many have been calling for a ceasefire in Gaza so you don't have these sorts of situations coming up.
