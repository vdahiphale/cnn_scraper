And so, with the good economic news that Biden had, with the jobs numbers, with the Dow, and obviously the good news for Biden, and for Kevin McCarthy, on this deal, I want to give in this at noon, so that the TV news, all day was talking about this.

They're just supposed to raise the debt limit, because the money's already been spent. And it's turned into this thing, where it's being held hostage, right? Essentially, Biden had no choice but to negotiate with the Republicans, because otherwise the economy would have crashed. And guess who would have gotten blamed? Joe Biden.

The thing that I'm fascinated by Abby is why isn't President Biden getting more credit, for what is actually a really strong economy, with the jobs numbers and everything else we're talking about?

And eight GOP candidates will be there, in attendance, this weekend, including Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, Tim Scott, and former Vice President, Mike Pence, who is also set to announce his candidacy, next week.

Earlier this week, actor and former California governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger talked to reporters, about his friendship, with fellow action star, Bruce Willis, calling him a huge star, who will be remembered as a great man. Bruce Willis, you remember, has stepped away, from acting, because of his health. He was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia. It's a brain disorder. And according to Schwarzenegger, well, action heroes, they don't retire. They just reload. And he would know. But another action icon may prove him right. Harrison Ford is starring in a new Indiana Jones movie that's set to release in a few weeks. The 80-year-old says that this next chapter will be the last time that he puts on Indy's hat. And that all got us thinking about the other action heroes that many of us grew up with, whether the action stars -- and whether the action stars of the 21st Century, are measuring up to the stars of the 80s and the 90s. So, is the age of the action hero over? Are the stars of today's Marvel movies and DC Comic films, stepping up to the challenge? Well, joining me now to discuss this is Media Analyst, Paul Dergarabedian. Thank you so much, Paul, for joining us. This is such an interesting -- first of all, it's great to see actors saying nice things, about each other, and recognizing their accomplishments.",

Or maybe it's just different.Because if you think about Stallone and Willis and Schwarzenegger, they're on the Mount Rushmore of action heroes, and will forever be. And I think where they built their reputation was on the big screen, and movie theaters, before social media. Think about that. Like, it was people around the world seeing them, on the big screen, bigger than life. And Bruce Willis, we just got to give it up for Bruce Willis. Not only is he an amazing action star, he'd be at great range as an actor. If you think about \"The Sixth Sense,\" where he played Dr. Malcolm Crowe, or Butch Coolidge, in \"Pulp Fiction,\" and of course, John McClane, 1988 huge hit, coming after he was such a huge star, on TV and \"Moonlighting,\" that really put him on the map. But it's a different era now. We certainly do have action heroes today. But like you said, many of them are part of ensemble cast, in Marvel movies, or Fast X, or other films like that.
