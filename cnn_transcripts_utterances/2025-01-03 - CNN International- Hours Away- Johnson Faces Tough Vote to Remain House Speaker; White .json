It's 09:00 a.m. in the U.S. capital, at 06:00 p.m. here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Becky Anderson. You're watching \"Connect the World\", wherever you are watching you are more than welcome. Also coming up, new surveillance footage helps create a timeline of the New Orleans terror attack on Bourbon Street. A standoff in South Korea with the nation's impeached president able to keep his liberty, at least for now. And signs of hope for Gaza cease fire and hostage release talks, Israel's government approves a delegation to attend negotiations in Qatar. Well, the stock market in New York will open about 30 minutes from now, and the arrows are pointing to a moderately better start, or a higher start, at least after what has been a pretty volatile start to 2025. More on that at half past the hour. Well, a major political showdown is coming down the pike in Washington. Just about three hours from now, the U.S. House of Representatives will convene for the first time of this two-year session. Its first order of business to elect a speaker. Now, Republican Mike Johnson is hoping to keep the speaker's gavel. Incoming President, Donald Trump has endorsed him. His party has the majority, but it is a narrow one, and Johnson can only afford one Republican defection. Well, one House Republican Thomas Massie of Kentucky has already said he will not be supporting Johnson, and several others do remain uncommitted, leaving the outcome of this vote very uncertain. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. LAUREN BOEBERT (R-CO): I do believe that Mike Johnson coming out and committing to Chip Roy being the Chairman of the Rules Committee, would secure the vote on the first round. REP. VICTORIA SPARTZ (R-IN): As of right now, if we don't have concrete commitment from Speaker Johnson, I'm not going to be supporting him tomorrow, but I'm open minded. I'm going to talk to some other members, and hopefully we'll connect with him later tonight or tomorrow morning, and figure out if we can actually make real changes on this institution. REP. NICK LALOTA (R-NY): Two years ago, there was a 15-round knockout, drag out fight. This may be more like a pillow fight, despite a -- my colleagues dissenting a little bit over the last couple of weeks, I think we'll come together. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

What you want to do directly after New Year's Day is to do some math. So, let's just talk about the scenarios here in which Johnson does not become speaker, at least on the first ballot. You know, this is the narrowest majority, House Majority going into a first session of Congress since 1917. So, it's been over 100 years. Look scenario number one, if just two Republicans vote against Mike Johnson, just two, that could sink him, he wouldn't get the speakership. Or how about scenario number two, I'm not a fan of just one scenario, like two scenarios, if one votes against him and two abstain, that is vote present, that would also sink him. So, the bottom line is, when you have such a narrow majority, there are many ways in which this whole thing could become a giant screw up. And it feels like Deja vu all over again given, of course, we had those speakership ballots -- speakership battles back in 2023 where you went four rounds in October and you went, as was mentioned that clip, 15 rounds in January for Kevin McCarthy.",

For more on this vote, let's get you to Thomas Gift. He's an Associate Professor of Political Science at University College London, an expert on U.S. politics. Look, I know, you know, our viewers love a bit of -- sort of, they love the stats. They love some of this. You know, sports, sort of stat analogies. But this is, there is real significance and consequence to what we will see here today, not just for the United States, but for the world in its entirety. I want to get an overall view here of the stakes from you. Donald Trump backing Mike Johnson to retain his job as speaker. How important is this to the president-elect and to his agenda when he returns to the White House in less than three weeks from now. THOMAS GIFT, DIRECTOR OF CENTRE ON U.S. POLITICS AT UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON: Well, thanks so much for having me, Becky. It's great to be with you. Without a speaker in place, the House would be unable to certify Trump's election results on January 6. So that's first things first. There has been some talk of appointing a temporary speaker to handle that task. But in the immediate term, a prolonged leadership struggle could really paralyze a Republican legislative agenda. I mean, full stop. It could essentially delay actions like passing funding bills, addressing the debt ceiling or advancing key elements of Trump's platform, such as making the 2017 tax cuts permanent. All president's early days in office are critical for achieving major policy goals. And internal Republican discord could really squander Trump's honeymoon period, and that could jeopardize the success of his broader legislative agenda.",

So, I do think that the implications for policies that are happening within the United States are more significant. But at the same time, you know, Donald Trump's position as president is weaken whenever he can't even establish that his own party members are with him. And I think that that does have some global implications. Donald Trump has promised to end the war in Ukraine on day one. He has essentially said that everyone is going to fall in line with him when it comes to the Israel-Gaza war. If you can't even prove that Republicans are with him on this basic issue of supporting speaker, then I do think that world leaders, international leaders, are going to say, well, how much latitude does Donald Trump really have when it comes to the international arena?",

Now, the corruption investigation office said that they were blocked by 200 soldiers and members of the presidential security detail as they approach the presidential palace, you see the video here.

But to give you an idea of the backdrop that we have right now. All the people, the hundreds of people who you see standing a few blocks with all of their South Korean flags, those are supporters of South Korea's suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol. And for his part, Yoon issued a clarion call as soon as this warrant for his arrest was issued on Tuesday. And he sent a letter to supporters, paraphrasing here, saying, hey, I need you all to come out and make it much harder for law enforcement to detain, make it much harder for law enforcement to arrest me. And they answered that clarion call. So fast forward to earlier this morning, we have not only his supporters, but the equivalent of South Korea's Secret Service protecting the president and refusing to turn over suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol to investigators. Investigators who want to hold him accountable for putting this country down the road of martial law, declaring martial law one month ago, on December 3rd, into the early morning hours of December 4th. So, this is dealing with criminal charges. Meantime, we have new reporting that the suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol has his first date of his impeachment trial, the first trial session of the impeachment saga, which is set for January 14th. So, in some we're waiting to see the next move. What will prosecutors and investigators do? Will they try again to bring South Korea suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol into custody?

The other type of track, the fifth track was made by a carnivorous dinosaur called Megalosaurus. And so, they have the really distinctive three toed footprints, and they're massive.
