Two students and two teachers killed when a gunman opened fire at Appalachia High School in Winder, just north of Atlanta. The 14-year-old suspect is in custody and will be booked tonight. He will be charged with murder, and he will be charged as an adult.There are still a lot of questions remaining, not the least of which is how do we stop this from ever happening again. We're learning law enforcement questioned the suspect just last year over online threats to commit a school shooting. Local schools were alerted to monitor him. Police also confirming that he used an AR-15-style weapon. And today, for some communities, just hours into a new school year, the heartbreaking reality is that four people just went to school and have lost their lives to senseless gun violence. And they are more than a number. We now know the identity of the four people who were killed. Fourteen-year-old students, 14-year-old students. Mason Schermerhorn, Christian Angulo, and teachers Richard Aspinwall and Christina Irimie. They belonged to someone. And who can begin to even imagine the pain of their losses tonight? Well, today's events were a horrific scene that has played out time and time again, starting with the blaring sirens from a swarm of police cars that were rushing to the scene, then something no parent ever wants to see, images of students, perhaps even their own, being escorted out of their classrooms. Many of those frightened students, no doubt texting their parents, texts like this one, from a student to his mother. \"I'm scared.\" \"I'm leaving work.\" \"I love you.\" Other students witnessing the carnage first hand, like one 16-year-old who was sitting next to a suspected gunman moments before the shooting. Now, she says that he left their algebra class near the beginning. She thought he might be ditching. But he came back outside the classroom door a little bit later. But by that point, everyone knew that something was wrong. This is what happened next. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The Jackson County sheriff went and interviewed the parents who said, yes, there are guns in the house but no, our child doesn't have access to them. They interviewed the child who, we are told, informed the Jackson County sheriff that threat wasn't posted by me, and he denied everything. They notified the local school district about this threat involving one of their students.

KEVIN O'LEARY, SHARK TANK JUDGE, CHAIRMAN OF O'LEARY VENTURES:  Still too high because capital gains taxes are not just domestic, they're internationally competitive.

One that you were just asking Kevin about has to do with what tax rate is paid on capital gains presumably when there's a realization event, right? Like I buy a stock, I sell the stock, how much did it go up? I've realized those gains.The other question is, what do you do about gains that essentially go on tax forever because there's never a realization event? If you're a really rich person, you can leave your assets to your heirs and whatever gains you saw over the course of your lifetime will be wiped out and everything gets reset when that stuff is inherited. It's something called the step-up basis. And so, as a result, you do end up with a lot of appreciated assets, whether it's a stock portfolio or an art collection or anything else where the gains never get taxed. But I do think that's a problem. The specific proposal that we are referring to about taxing those unrealized gains today is basically something that the Biden administration has come up with. It's not new to Kamala Harris as a presidential candidate per se. And I think it would probably be kind of administratively unworkable, the idea that you like tax the gains as they are -- as they are being accrued, even if the stuff never gets sold or the person who owns them never dies and passes them onto their heirs. I think there are better ways to get at this sort of unfairness in the system like get rid of the step-up basis, like when somebody dies, treat that as a realization event. So, it's all technical. But I do think it is unfair that, you know, there are a lot of rich people out there who can kind of legally gain the tax code and ever see taxes on all of the money they've made over the years.",

The film, starring Sebastian Stan, has a young Trump and Jeremy Strong as his attorney, and mentor Roy Cohn. It has had no easy path to release, by the way, after its debut at the Cannes Film Festival, major labels passed on making any offers. The Trump campaign immediately spoke out, calling the film pure fiction and election interference. And then his legal team issued a cease and desist. These responses have hindered the distribution of the movie so much so that the filmmakers were driven to start a Kickstarter to even raise the money. The film does hit some theaters October 11th before election day. Joining me now, the film's executive producer, Amy Baer, and producer for the film, David -- Daniel Bekerman. Excuse me. Amy and Daniel, welcome. Thank you for both being here. Let me begin with you here, Amy, because the movie, I understand, got a standing ovation at Cannes, but you had to take it to crowdsourcing through Kickstarter. Why has it been so hard to distribute this particular movie? AMY BAER, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, \"THE APPRENTICE\":  Well, thanks for having us, Laura. You know, the movie has been gestating for a very long time. I had started the development of this project with screenwriter Gabe Sherman about seven years ago. And movies tend to take a long time to get made. You know, we are making a movie about a real person and a real person who has an ability to control the narrative in the public square. And after the Cannes Film Festival, what you just talked about did sort of dampen the enthusiasm and interest from traditional distributors in Hollywood. But we do have a distributor now, and we are releasing the movie wide on October 11th.",
