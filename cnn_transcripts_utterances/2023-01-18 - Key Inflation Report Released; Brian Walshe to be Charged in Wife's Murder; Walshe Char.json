This is more confirmation, folks, of what we've been telling you for the past few months.Year over year inflation, Producer Price Index, this is factory floor inflation, 6.2 percent. That is the slowest since March 2021. And when you look from month to month, and this is what we want to see, from November to December prices, wholesale prices fell 0.5 percent. Falling prices. Something we haven't been able to say very often. When you look at the bar chart here that I always say, you know, the trend is your friend, you can see how that price peak seems to be behind us. This is still way too high for the Fed's comfort. They want something more around, you know, the 2 percent range for consumer prices. But coming back down to earth there. And we also got -- it's a double whammy this morning of news about the economy, right? And we got retail sales from December. The last month of the year. And retail sales fell a little bit. Year over year they're up 6 percent, but they fell from month to month. And when you look at the last couple of months, this shows, I think, when we pull up the bar chart here, I think this shows that consumers are getting picky. They're tired of higher prices. They're looking for lower prices. We've seen some big name brands realize they can't keep passing on price hikes to consumers. There's this old saying, you've heard me say this before about the oil market, but, you know, high prices can cure high prices at some point. A consumer is like, you know what, I think I'm going to just reign in a little bit because I - I don't - I want - don't want to keep paying high prices, and that can actually help cool inflation. So that's a couple of the things that we're seeing here this morning in terms of the economy.",

New car prices are coming down too. I think that's an important sign for people, you know, as you're trying to build your life and maybe change out your car.

As chips become more available, they can actually get cars off the lot.So, I'd say, Kaitlan, it's a really complicated picture. There are a lot of - a lot of reasons. And I don't think you can put, you know, why inflation is falling on a bumper sticker, you know? It's just way more - way more complicated than that.

But that would lead me, Kaitlan, to that conclusion.What I'm interested in knowing, obviously, as we look today at what happens, is what else they have, right? We're going to be looking for forensics. What do they have with respect to that? What do they have in terms of cell phone data that would connect him? A lot of circumstantial evidence.

When you have information with respect to bloody knives in basements with regard to you leaving your residence when you're supposed to be on probation and supposed to be taking your kids to school but you didn't do that. And it's not only the $450 in cleaning supplies, it's the paying for them in cash. What was that all about, right? It's the misleading investigators. It's saying your wife left to the airport, when, guess what, the cell phone pings there. We don't know what police uncovered, Don, Kaitlan, as it relates to their trash that they've been going through and the different searches. So, why do I say all this.

Of course, you don't have to establish motive as a prosecutor, but inquiring minds, if it goes to a jury, want to know, what would lead you to do this?Why do I mention motive? Because it goes to intent. Is this going to be a case where it was premedicated or is it a case, right, where it was a crime of passion? Was it a case where it was some other type of murder?

But even in the absence of someone breaking, Don, or in the absence of them saying, well, I did it, and this is how, and his is why, et cetera, you know, authorities have been pretty good over the years at piecing things together. There has been information about the relationship, about some information of 2014, I believe, where there was a threat on her life, presumably from him. Whether that sees the light of day at any trial is another question. But I think that they will, authorities, through looking at text messages, emails, interviewing people about the nature of their interactions, et cetera, try to glean why he would do this.So, there's a lot we don't know. I think there's a lot more we'll learn today.

U.S. adults owning an iPhone. This is based on my estimate, based on polling and some market reports. You know, back in 2003, there was no iPhone. By 2013, about 22 percent of Americans owned an iPhone. Now, 44 percent. I think what's essentially happening is, people are like, oh, I like my -- my IOS and now I want to be able to use it with my computer, so I'm, in fact, going to use a Mac PC. So you essentially get this situation where people are migrating from an iPhone over to a PC. It's one of those very interesting things. Of course, the iPhone still far more popular than the PC, at least in terms of Mac. But in terms of the bottom line, I think this says it all, Apple's stock price. Look at that, it was just 25 cents back in 2003.",
