I don't know, a room full of journalists who want to report on the things you've said that could have a direct line to the electorate that votes in what, 97 days? Now, Harris doesn't seem bothered by it all. When she reacted to it, she was in a room full of Black sororities, who she simply said, too, the American people deserve better.

I come back to I am trying to do the work of creating opportunities for Black journalists, for increasing the pipeline of Black journalists, for creating exposure to Black journalists and Black journalism. And that's what NABJ is about. And when we have newsmaker plenaries like this, we are giving the journalists in the audience a chance to hear directly from a notable figure that many of them might not have ever had an opportunity to see in person. And again, that's part of our mission. We do it every convention year. And then every four years, we focus on the candidates for president. And I think it's important. I think I understand Trump is a different type of political figure, one we've never seen before. But I think that makes it even more important, that we're aware of the stakes. And quite frankly, the questions that were asked today by those three Black women journalists, that's a different experience than I think Trump has ever had.

I've been a frequent visitor of the Atlanta Association of Black Journalism here in Atlanta, and I have family that have benefited off of that program because, let's be frank, I'm the oldest person on this panel, I remember the 80s, it was the true conduit to get through to be a journalist, to get, you know, intern jobs here at CNN and other places. So, to answer your question as it relates to that -- you know, we all know when, you know, Vice President Kamala Harris ran for, you know, attorney general, you know, and you can check me on this, news outlets said she's the first Indian American. She did run as Indian American, okay. And then she was chosen for the vice president nominee as the candidate for Joe Biden. And he was told that you will get a Black woman. So, then, she says, well, here is a Black woman. So, in all fairness, when she asked that question to President Trump, that's a valid, you know, answer because that's based on her, where she was in her life, what she chose to be at that time.

He was doing three things. He was trying to steal, dampen, and divide. He was trying to steal attention from Kamala Harris because she has just been running over him and getting all the attention, which he can't stand. And so, by showing up there, he got attention. We're talking about him and not her. So, for the first time in about, you know, a week and a half, he's now the subject. He loves that. He's also trying to dampen enthusiasm for Black voters by raising these questions. Is she really Black? Is she really one of you? She tells other people she's not. That's all trying to dampen Black enthusiasm because the country is just in love with Kamala Harris. This Kamala mania is taking over. He's trying to figure out a way to dampen that. The last thing he's trying to do is to divide. His main attack was trying to divide Black people from immigrants and trying to throw Kamala in that same bucket as being an immigrant, she's not one of you. So, he's stealing, he's dampening, he's dividing. In other words, he's the same old, negative Donald Trump facing a rising sun of Kamala Harris who's bringing joy and unity and excitement to this country. And he's terrified.

This is not something that she just came up all of a sudden and said, by the way, I'm Black. And I just think we need to be just really clear about that because we want to deal in the truth. And I think of -- the wider conversation is something that the Trump-Vance campaign is really, I think, having a hard time dealing with, is dealing with what modern families look like. People can be of mixed race, multiple races in their families. People might not have children. There might be blended families. There might be LGBTQ families. That is what America is starting to look like. And when former President Trump appears that he doesn't really understand that intersectionality of someone being mixed race, it comes across that he's out of touch of what modern American families can look like.
