      "sentences": "Well, good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Coates and this is CNN TONIGHT.And what could be the next big thing that could change everything, like your smart phone did 15 years ago? Well, there might be an answer. It's the rise of artificial intelligence. Now, you may have heard of ChatGPT. You might have thought it was a typo when you actually saw on your screen but it's not it's called ChatGPT. But the question is what exactly is it? Well, I wasn't sure how to explain it myself. So you know what, I went right to the source. ChatGPT, briefly describe yourself for a T.V. audience. Here's what they came up with, quote, ChatGPT it's a sophisticated computer program that uses artificial intelligence to understand and generate human-like language. It can answer questions, write stories and even engage in conversation. It's been trained on a massive amount of tech data, so it's able to understand and respond to a wide range of topics and questions. It's like having a very knowledgeable and well spoken personal assistant available 24/7 to help with anything you need. Did you get all of that? That's according to ChatGPT. And tonight, we're going to talk all about artificial intelligence, the good, the bad, the pretty cool, and what it could actually mean in your future. Plus, is there anybody out there who doesn't have any classified document lying around? I mean, I joke about the number of glass houses that are popping up in Washington, D.C. but you've really got to wonder what's going on when the president of the United States and the former president of the United States and his former vice president of the United States have all been found to have classified documents in places where they should not. The question really is what happens now. There is an awful lot going on tonight but I want to get right to artificial intelligence and what it could mean for our future. Joining me now, Axios Tech Reporter Ashley Gold, also former Democratic Presidential Candidate Andrew Yang, founder of the Forward Party. I'm glad that you're both here tonight, I'm just thinking about this. And to be honest, I actually, when I first saw it, I was like, oh, I think I might be typing this in wrong. What's happening, what's going on here? ChatGPT, it says it can do a whole lot. It describes itself just now. But the possibilities really are really expansive here. Talk to me about those possibilities and what it could really do.",

We just saw last week, CNET announced it was not going to have A.I.-generated articles anymore because many of them had errors. This is the problem of the generative text. It puts forth very readable, casual sort of clear stories and texts, but that doesn't mean it's all true. It's not fact-checking the stuff in real-time.",

That was essentially the instruction. Look what it turned out and had. It really provided then a screenplay on that particular short seen, the fade in, the research lab, et cetera, what you're actually looking at. It's pretty cool thing that we're seeing a team of scientists in their lab codes and what they're doing, giving the -- really setting the scene, Sophia Petrillo-style of picture it, science lab, modern day, whatever that might be, although not in Sicily. And you've got all the dialogue actually happening right there.And so you have sort of wonder, that's really cool that this can work this way, but are there some harmful aspects to this, especially on the point that Ashley raised of, say it's not in the creative space of a screenplay, say it's instead an expectation that is providing truthful, factual information in real-time.

ChatGPT actually passed the NBA exam given by a Wharton professor. And guess what, that professor joins me now. He's Christian Terwiesch from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. Professor I'm very glad you're here right now because we're thinking about the ways in which this could be used and how it might be able to be thought of not just an automation of blue collar workers but the idea of a category known as sort of the knowledge workers or the knowledge-based employment.

It did amazingly well on three of the five questions. For two of the five questions, it needed a human hand. But one of them was sort of struggling.

Now, truth be told, Professor, this looks a lot like my own essay for Princeton University, and we didn't have ChatGPT, so it was legit back then, thank you very much. However, this is a real risk for many people, to think, well, this is a sophisticated version of CliffsNotes, right? This is the open book exams. You've got technology, you can ask people.

And so I think the cheating question is the real one. Absolutely, it needs to be banned on certain circumstances. But I really would want us to think bigger than that.

I want to say a quick aside, in the Senate and the House, I don't see how it would actually be possible at all for a senator or a House member to do this because everything is very tightly controlled.If you look at classified documents, for instance, they come in a folder. You have people watching to make sure if you take notes, that they are acceptable notes even, usually you can't take those with you, and that you are turn those documents. But evidently, for a president and vice president, but it's a little more loose. And that's somewhat understandable because I'm sure the entire White House or at least the residents of the White House, has a SCIF or a protected area where you can look at these documents.

We're talking a classified documents. But we don't yet know what these documents are. We don't know what they are really. We're talking about the documents found at Mar-a-Lago, let alone in Wilmington, or at the Penn-Biden Center, or what's happening in Indiana.Are we at a disadvantage being able to really assess what's happened here unless we know what's in those documents, which by the way, we may never know, because they're classified and they have designations like that?",

But if something that you look at may not be harmful particularly just in what you read. I read some top secret stuff that, quite honestly, is stuff you can find in the news. But the thing that is classified and the reason it's classified is because it can imply sources and methods to get that information, which our adversaries, if they put this together, they can maybe figure out who the mole is or anything else.And so, yes, I mean, if you look at what's going on, I don't think we'll ever necessarily may know the subjects but we're not going to know what's in those documents.

Every member of Congress, left to right, frankly, Republican or Democrat, needs to be on the same standard when it comes to Joe Biden and Mike Pence. More than likely, everything we're hearing is that it was basically the same way of going about it. It doesn't mean it was right.The difference is, with Donald Trump, he was alerted to this and continued to resist turning these over. That is very different than being alerted to this and proactively getting these turned over. So, there may be some differences here but, again, I would encourage the media, I would encourage citizens, constituents, to look at your member of Congress and say, are you being consistent?

And the Pew Research Center survey from April 2021 said that the death -- asked, does the death penalty deter criminals? 63 percent said no, it does not. And I think actually also, is there a risk that innocent people might be executed? Here is what the Pew Research Center found. They said, is some risk, 78 percent, some risk that an innocent person could be executed. And by the way, not for nothing, the attorney general of the United States, Merrick Garland, in his confirmation hearing, remember, this is somebody who was the prosecutor in the Oklahoma City bombings, that I believe led to the death penalty as well, being unavailable sentence, she said this at his own hearing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MERRICK GARLAND, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL:  (Inaudible) the death penalty at that time for Mr. McVeigh, in that individual case. I don't have any regret, but I have developed concerns about the death penalty in the 20 some years since then. And I -- sources of my concern are issues of exonerations of people who have been convicted of sort of arbitrary and randomness of its application, because of how seldom it's applied. And because of its disparate impact on black Americans and members of other communities of color. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

With respect to Parkland, and respect to the general argument that, while the victims deserve this form of justice. And there's -- and look, I've dealt with crime victims before, I know you have as well, try to protect the rights to the greatest extent possible. If you were to ask people, would you be okay with an innocent person dying to secure justice in this case.
