You can't begin to think about a negotiation or peace. You can't stop helping Ukraine in its fight to liberate its own territory. That's clear message from Zelenskyy today, and indeed, things we've heard from European leaders as well, that stark reminder of the brutality, even in terms of not giving enough care for Navalny's keep him alive, very much in the forefront here of a conference that could otherwise potentially had been mired in discussions as to how cohesive the NATO alliance was going to be in the likely event maybe in the months ahead of Trump returning to the presidency. But at the same time to for Zelenskyy, a reflection of the difficulties they're facing on the front line because of that slow arrival of U.S. aid ammunitions that they need to keep the fight going. Ukraine announcing this morning, that they have withdrawn after weeks, months of battle from a key town in the East called Avdiivka. Long held on to with what they possibly could but I think a change in military command has led the new chief of the military to step forward and say look, I think it's time to pull back that occurred this morning in terms of its announcement.

European leaders may have to decide without the United States potentially to enforce that. That is his way of trying to ram home the imminent threat of Russia. His reversals, his withdrawal on the battlefield this morning assisting that message to be heard the aid to be sped up. He's asking for air defense too and at the same time as well, the horrific death of Alexey Navalny and an Arctic Circle prison yesterday announced by Russian state media and confirmed by his family.

And so he have Navalny, and right now look -- looking at those people who've been coming out in many cities across Russia, with flowers in their hands, as a memorial to Navalny. I think the Kremlin is looking at that very carefully. And with concern, that is why you had police coming in and arresting a number of people across the country for doing that. And also very quickly taking down those improvisational memorials. So I think there is concern, and that election for Putin, even though he's going to win, still is kind of symbolic for the Kremlin, and not only for their own people, but around the world that Putin has, you know, turnout that brought him back to the presidency.",

Sadly, they have just been suffering so much here in the past few days, but the support certainly that the families are receiving is coming at a good time. Amara, Victor. [06:35:00]",

But the times we're living in now might call for something like that. That's basically what the message has been to these members of Congress who are here. And what they're saying in response to those questions is, look, you know, because most of them here actually support this aid, right? And have voted for it. They're saying that, you know, the House is going to work its process, that they might change the bill a little bit, and it will ultimately be up to Speaker Johnson in terms of getting it on the floor or not, but there are ways to sort of bypass that process, bypass the Speaker of the House, and get this-- get this voted on because the Republicans here who I've talked to have noted that this legislation, even in its current form, would get an overwhelming majority in the House if it were put on the floor for a vote.",

A lot of Republicans have been saying that they're less comfortable with the non-lethal aid portions to Ukraine, for example, economic aid, humanitarian aid, things like that. Their argument being that European nations should step up and shoulder that burden more than the United States should. So, again, this is an option, it's something that might be more palatable to some Republicans in the House of Representatives. But again, it all depends what Speaker Mike Johnson will do, and how he will handle this issue.

Sources familiar with U.S. Intel on the project say, the aim is to create a weapon that would cripple a vast swath of commercial and government satellites, by creating a massive energy wave.The Biden administration says the weapon is still under development and not in orbit, and poses no nuclear threat to the people of America or anywhere else in the world at the moment? CNN's Oren Liebermann has more on how this new weapon could work and how it could cause extreme disruptions to everyday life. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  According to three sources familiar with the Intelligence, Russia is trying to develop a nuclear space weapon that would use effectively the byproduct of a nuclear explosion to try to disable and destroy satellites in space. The idea here, according to the sources, is not to use the explosion itself, which is how we traditionally think of a  nuclear weapon or a nuke, instead, the explosion produces an electromagnetic pulse on incredibly powerful wave of energy that essentially fries the insides of satellites and renders them ineffective. Now, crucially, this is not a system that's operational yet. It's still in development. The White House and the Biden administration said that earlier this week, and President Joe Biden himself said on Friday that there is no threat or any sort of nuclear threat to United States at this time. But this is clearly something the U.S. is watching. And here's why? Critical satellites for the U.S., including many military satellites are built to defend against these sort of electromagnetic pulse waves and be able to withstand these waves. But an explosion like this in space would affect a lot of commercial satellites and disrupt not only U.S. satellites, but Russian satellites, Chinese and so many others. And those satellites are used for a number of different reasons, including communications, cellphone services, internet, and so much more. It would effectively disrupt or could disrupt all of that if it were used, not to mention, it would be a violation of the Outer Space Treaty of the late '60s, which prohibits the use of nuclear weapons in space. And that's why the administration is watching this so carefully, because of the threat and the risks such an explosion would have. Russia would only likely use it, the officials say, or the sources say, as a last ditch effort because it's indiscriminate. It doesn't just affect U.S. satellites, it affects any satellite that's near it and could potentially render a large number of satellites ineffective. Still, it is a capability that the U.S. is watching very closely as Russia presses forward with this program. Oren Liebermann, CNN at the Pentagon. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
