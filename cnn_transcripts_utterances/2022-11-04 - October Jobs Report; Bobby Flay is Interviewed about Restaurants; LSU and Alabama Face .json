Alabama all time the clear leader with 55 wins, LSU with 26 wins. Five ties back in the day where you could get that in college football. You can't get that anymore since, I believe, 1996. But let's take a look at the chance of winning the national title because that's, of course, what we're all interested in at the end of the day. You'll notice Ohio State, 27 percent, Georgia, 22 percent. They're actually taking on Tennessee this weekend in another big SEC matchup, 11 percent. Alabama at 10 percent. And I apologize to Don, but LSU has a less than 1 percent chance of winning the national title. It's math, Don, I don't necessarily control it. Finally, college football fandom by region. Poppy, of course, is from that Midwest. There are more in the Midwest than anywhere else at 41 percent.",
