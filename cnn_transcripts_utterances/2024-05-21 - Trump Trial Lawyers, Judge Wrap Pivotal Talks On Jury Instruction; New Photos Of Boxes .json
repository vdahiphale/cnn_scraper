He's somebody who works for the former president. And these images are from surveillance video appear to show him moving boxes sometime around June of 2022. Now, this is after Trump had received a subpoena ordering him to turn over documents and his lawyer was going to do a search to try to find some of these documents. What the government is saying is that this is proof that Nauta, at the direction of the former president, was trying to move boxes, move classified documents so that the lawyer would not be able to find it. Now part of this is all explaining why Judge Beryl Howell in Washington ordered Evan Corcoran, who is a former lawyer for the former president, ordered him to provide information, to provide documents to the prosecution. What she said as part of her ruling, she said that there was sufficient evidence that the former president was using person 18, who is Evan Corcoran, identified as Evan Corcoran, as an instrumentality or as a front man to obstruct the government's investigation and allow the former president to continue withholding these documents from the investigation. Now, Howell said that there was strong evidence that this was enough reason for the crime fraud exception that required Corcoran to provide information to prosecution. This all comes ahead, Wolf, of a hearing we have here in Fort Pierce tomorrow where the defense is trying to remove some of the evidence that they say was gathered as part of this investigation. Walt Nauta and the co-defendants along with the former president, they're all making arguments against the prosecution here tomorrow. Wolf?",

Obviously, the prosecution has got to meet their burden of proof, but now the jury is going to have instructions that tell them how they need to actually follow the law, how they need to view the evidence that was given to them, circumstantial evidence, for example, a commonly used instruction to tell them they don't necessarily have to direct evidence. They can use things like, you know, comment or phrases. If you go to bed at night, there's grass on the ground and it's green and you wake up in the morning that it's covered in snow, it probably snowed last night. What can you use for indirect testimony? Also, the big part of it will be about the issue of what is substantial. Remember, they are trying to show from a felony case that Donald Trump falsified business records, normally a misdemeanor in New York, with the intent of trying to hide another crime, that being, it seems, a conspiracy or campaign contribution. That campaign contribution, though, has to be made in furtherance of the campaign, not for a private matter. The term for the jury will be how to figure out how to evaluate his motivation. Was it to protect his wife and family or was it to protect the election in some way or his odds? These are going to be really two important aspects of the instructions.

And she used his extremely, I thought, unsavory words suggesting that the White House was keeping an eye on him. You have friends there. You can rest easy tonight. You are loved. It had the aroma of witness interference or possible witness tampering. That's what the prosecution was suggesting. Costello was an unpleasant witness.

And you had to do it to elevate it from a misdemeanor to a felony, that you were doing so to try to hide another crime.Now, it's actually quite mind boggling to many people that we're sitting here today at the conclusion of several weeks of trial and don't clearly know what is the precise law they're going to use in summation and the closing arguments to say here is the crime they were trying to hide. There are two different theories one could be a conspiracy to commit a crime. The other one could be that they were having a campaign finance contribution that they did not disclose. And that's where the idea of why the money was paid comes into play here. But you don't have to actually prove the underlying crime itself in terms of the conspiracy otherwise, or that the sexual encounter that was alleged even happened.

But it was the effort, the drama of trying to get Rudy Giuliani to appear here for the last three weeks that took center stage and really was the attention-getter of the day.So, the way it was laid out in court is that agents from the attorney general's office had been chasing Giuliani from New York to Florida, that he had been live streaming both in New York and most recently at his birthday party, in his 80th birthday party in Palm Beach, Florida. He had also been tweeting from that party saying, essentially, can't find me. And this had been this online discussion between him and agents who are trying to find him. So, in court today, because he was served as he was leaving the party to appear here in court, as the court proceeding unraveled, what you heard the attorney general's office say is that they want him to now be ordered to appear here within 30 days and have to pay a bond.

Where are the storms moving through and pass Des Moines at this point in time, but into Wisconsin, into Minnesota. And later on today, all the way into Chicago, as far south as Tulsa, these storms are really in a very long line, Wolf. This is when the moisture in the humidity of spring wants to be here and the cold front of winter says, wait, not so fast. So yes, this is a low pressure center, the dry air came out of the mountains, the cold air came out of the north, and we're firing these storms up. We still have purple boxes, which means that there are still tornadoes warnings. We're not saying they're on the ground yet. Some are just indicated by radar. You can see the rotation on the radar but when they get on the ground, this is when they're doing the most damage. And you can see some of those right there. This is near Glenwood. This would be Missouri and that would be on the ground because its colored in there. So we do know that's a confirmed tornado. Later on tonight, all the way through Chicago possibly into Milwaukee as far north as Green Bay, as far south as the Gulf Coast. This is a long line of weather that could even bring some flooding. You get 2-3 inches of rainfall with some of these radars echoes and that's what were going to see here for the rest of the evening. This is a major event for a big part of the country. We knew it was coming severe prediction center said it was coming yesterday. They even upgraded it again today and here's what you get when you get this type of weather that does hit a town. So many times, Wolf, we just -- we know these storms are coming, we do, but we just hope that they hit the cornfield and not a town. But just like Greensburg, Kansas, years ago with the EF5, this wasn't one, but Greenfield, Iowa, took a direct hit here, is really -- its going to take some time to all this mess up, at least so far, only one loss of life and with the tornado that looks like that, that kind of damage it could have been a lot worse.",

Many of those trees are just basically stumps up what they were. And so this is likely an hundred and 50 mile per hour tornado, which puts it on that border, EF-3, possibly if it's high -- they don't know if it's a big tornado, unless they find a very large and sturdy structure that got knocked down. You can't tell what kind of damage to a motor home or to a car. There's no such thing as an EF scale for a car. But when you see a brick structure, possibly that the post office and you see that get knocked down, you know, that that should be standing because it's a brick on stone structure.
