But the government was quick to deploy police to control the growing crowds. Sunday night took a violent turn in Shanghai, with police holding back the crowd as they dragged people away and loaded them into vans. Anger against the government spread across the country after a deadly fire killed 10 people in Xinjiang Province on Thursday. Well some believe zero COVID measures were the reason firefighters arrived too late to save the victims. While just hours ago Beijing reported a sixth consecutive day of record COVID infections, and that number isn't lost on protesters. They understand there needs to be preventative measures in place, but one a scale back of current policies. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translation): I think we just need to identify the close contacts or semi-close context, those people who might be infected. This is just enough. We don't need this huge screening of the whole compound. It's not necessary to be so meticulous. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translation): In Shanghai a lot of people have already been detained not only last night, they did it for everybody, for all the people, for the delivery guys not to be locked in their apartments, for everybody to be able to receive medicines and food.

It's also extraordinary to hear some of the demands from the protesters, which I think all began on Saturday night in Shanghai where a protester there shouting, chanting slogans really directly targeting that ruling Communist Party and its top leaders Xi Jinping.[01:05:00] Up to that point, even the most vehement opponents of the so-called zero-COVID policy in this country had really been dancing around the issue blaming incompetent or overzealous local officials instead of really pointing the finger at the ultimate decision in this one party system. But the Shanghai protesters really challenging the legitimacy of the party and a strongman leader, which may explain why the police there deployed some of the harshest tactics we have seen in this country when it comes to their treatment of the protesters. Because one of the biggest fears on the government's part, of course, is to have this kind of message inspire others across the nation. But that seems to be exactly what has happened since we have seen protesters in other cities in Chengdu, but also here in Beijing, shouting slogans that really touch on some fundamental aspects of the system. They, of course, say things like \"no to COVID testing, yes to freedoms,\" but also they have chanted slogans like \"no to dictatorship, yes to votes,\" and \"no to being a slave and yes to being a citizen.\" And it's notable that many of the protesters over the weekend having young people, including many students on university campuses across the country, perhaps not surprising because of what many of them, they have lived their entire college life in the past three years under some forms of lockdown. And also not to mention they are the group hit hardest by the economic slowdown brought by this policy. Even the official government figure in the summer showing that people aged between 16 and 24, their unemployment rate hitting a record breaking 20%, so this is really a segment of population that are feeling a growing sense of hopelessness and desperation. They have so laid away, almost nothing to lose. And that, of course, often translates into taken to the streets to make their voice voices heard. So that's also why this is very disconcerting to the authorities. We have already seen signs of them trying to disperse the student crowds and to send them home basically by ending the semester early. Several universities here in Beijing have sent out notices to their students about transportation arrangements to take them to train stations or airports. Steven Jiang, CNN, Beijing.

And their substitute Niclas Fullkrug savage to point with a brilliant finished seven minutes from time. Elsewhere in Grooby (ph), Costa Rica recovered from their humiliating defeat by Spain earlier on beating Japan one-nil. They did so with their first shot on target in the tournament, and it was a beauty from Keysher Fuller. It means that Spain, top of the group, a point clear of both Japan and Costa Rica. Germany's point means that if they beat Costa Rica on Thursday and Spain aren't surprised by Japan, then the two European giants will go through. This World Cup has produced some shock results and we got another in Group F when Morocco stunned the second ranked team Belgium. Abdelhamid Sabiri caught out the experienced goalie Thibaut Courtois with a tricky free kick, before the man of the match, Hakim Ziyech. He came out of retirement for this World Cup made the decisive goal for Zakaria Aboukhlal in injury time. Elsewhere in the group, Canada surprised the 2018 finalist, Croatia, with a second minute goal from Alphonso Davies. That's their first ever World Cup goal. But their joy didn't last long, Croatia drew level through Andrej Kramaric, the first of his two goals, and they were ahead at the break thanks to Mario Leiva. A 4-1 win for Croatia means that Canada are the second team to be eliminated from the tournament. Belgium know they'll probably have to be Croatia on Thursday, if they want to stay in. Morocco, though, are well-placed to advance. By Monday night, every team will have played two games and will have a much better sense of how Brazil's bid for a six world title is looking.

He has been associated with the United States as the coach of the men's national team years ago. So, you know, when you're talking about the culture, and you are saying these disparaging remarks, it is going to get a lot of attention. This is going to be something that in the crucible of a World Cup explodes, everything is magnified. And this one, it didn't need a whole lot of magnification to begin with.Well, a couple of thoughts. One is in the game of soccer and, of course football worldwide as it's known, there's a lot of gamesmanship. It's not just a run. There are a lot of games being played. In many ways, it is a great credit to those athletes, to those coaches for playing the game, for finding the angle, for doing all the things they try to win. So that's a worldwide issue. That's certainly something that I imagined Klinsmann will be bringing up and talking about. It doesn't seem to be just this one coach and just this one team. And then, I think also when you're talking about the culture, and when you're talking about, you know, the Middle East, and you're a white man and from Europe, there's going to be overtones there too. And it's very understandable. People would be not be happy to look at -- to hear this and to see this being said about a certain \"culture\".

This is the systematic starvation of many millions of Ukrainians understanding Soviet Union, when the Ukrainian language, its history, music and culture was attempted to be obliterated, by any definition, should be described as a genocide against Ukraine committed by the Soviet Union under Stalin.Now from the Ukrainian perspective, many of Stalin's techniques are now being repeated in this country with the forced deportation of Ukrainians from areas captured in Ukraine by Russia, into Russian territory, in violation of international law. And with the manipulation the Ukrainian say of the international grain markets. As a consequence of the war here, the Ukrainian saying their product of grain this year down by about 44%, 30% reduction in exports since the mid summer. And that doesn't account for the total blockage on exports earlier in the year, which have driven up grain prices, particularly in drought and famine struck Eastern Central Africa. Now the $150 million deal being agreed to or donations being greeted by the international community and efforts made by Ukraine to try and get its grain out and onto the international market, an act of defiance.

But meanwhile, we're seeing continued attacks on the ground here in the south of the country of personal city hitting at least 16 other smaller villages along the river there also being hit.

You know look, after this historic local election loss, the president of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen, resigned as the leader of her party, the ruling DPP, or Democratic Progressive Party. But she will continue to serve as the president of Taiwan until the end of her term in early 2024. But this was the worst showing in the history of the DPP. The ruling party of Taiwan only won about five municipalities, one fewer from the previous local election, and compare that to its main rival, the Kuomintang or KMT Party, they managed to win 13 municipalities, including the capital of Taiwan, Taipei. We did hear from Tsai Ing-wen earlier. She was speaking from party headquarters as she addressed this crushing loss for her party. She said this quote, \"The results failed our expectations. We humbly accept the results and accept the Taiwanese people's decision.\" And we should emphasize that these were local elections. The officials who were elected do not have a direct say in China policy. And yet, Tsai Ing-wen as the leader of the DPP, the ruling party, she framed these local elections as an opportunity to stand up to and to show defiance to China, into an increasingly muscular Beijing. That strategy failed to pan out. One analyst at Australian National University, a political scientist there whose name is Wen-Ti Sung pointed at this. Quote, \"DPP's crushing defeat is not about China, but about DPP's own failure to set a positive agenda and maintain party unity. This was,\" he adds, \"a self inflicted wound.\" After the DPP's very poor performance, all eyes and the focus now shifts to 2024.

Khamenei praised the Basij for confronting the thugs and rioters, the agents of foreign enemies, as he described them. Many seeing this as the Supreme Leader giving the green light for this brutal crackdown to continue. This has been the regimes narrative from the start -- dismissing the grievances of the people, these protests, as a foreign plot by countries like the United States, Israel, the U.K. and others to try to destabilize the Islamic Republic. And they would use this as a pretext to crack down on the protest. We heard from the United Nations human rights group on Thursday urging the Iranian regime to listen to its people, to address their grievances, saying that this narrative is a convenient one, a typical narrative of tyranny, as he described it. Saying that these old methods and the fortress mentality don't work anymore, that they need to listen to their people because this narrative is only aggravating the situation. And this is exactly what we've been seeing happening over the past more than two months of these protests. The more they crackdown, the more people are killed, people arrested. This is only making people angrier, more defiant, and more determined to continue protesting, risking everything for regime change. Jomana Karadsheh, CNN -- Istanbul. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Disturbingly, in some cases, the rapes were filmed and used to blackmail protesters into silence. There has been a real escalation, where female protesters are, as you can see here, being openly assaulted, often sexually.

In social media posts appearing under her name, Abbasi, like many young women in Iran, criticized the regime openly after the protests began. Unlike most, she did it without anonymity.It didn't take long for security forces to find and arrest her. Abbasi disappeared. Soon after, whistleblowers began to post on various social media platforms, medics sharing eyewitness accounts of what had been done to Abbasi. \"First of all,\" they say, \"there were a few plainclothesmen with her and they did not let her out of their sight. Even during a private medical examination, they were there.\" \"She was my patient. I went to her bedside. They had shaved her hair. She was scared and was trembling.\" \"When she first came in, they said it was rectal bleeding due to repeated rape. The plainclothesmen insisted that the doctor write that the rape was from prior to her arrest.\" \"And then after this issue was becoming obvious to all, they changed the entire scenario altogether.\" The details of these leaks were confirmed to CNN by an insider at Imam Ali Hospital, where Abbasi was brought to be examined. In a statement, the government said Abbasi was treated for \"digestive problems.\" The medics who treated her said that was not true. The Iranian regime denies the rape, accusing her of leading protests, an allegation which could see her face the death penalty. At this usually busy border crossing between Iraq and Iran, it is deceptively quiet. Those who can cross tell us the noose is tightening on protesters. Authorities have for decades used sexual torture against Iranians and it appears once more a familiar pattern. Sexual violence deployed to enforce an assertion of moral guardianship.
