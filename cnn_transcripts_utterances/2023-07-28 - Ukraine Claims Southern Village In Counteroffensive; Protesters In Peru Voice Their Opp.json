      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show everyone, I'm Christina Macfarlane in for Isa Soares. Tonight, Ukraine makes more gainsin the south of the country as their counteroffensive grinds on. We'll look at how significant those are. Then, anger on the streets of Peru, protesters voice their opposition to the president as she gives her first state of the union address. Plus, Donald Trump hits the campaign trail later today despite facing more charges for his alleged mishandling of classified documents. More on that coming up. Well, we begin tonight in Ukraine where the country's counteroffensive is making some key progress. Ukrainian forces are making gains along the southern front, claiming to catch a key village. That puts Ukrainian troops right on the cusp of Russia's main defense lines for the first time since the war began. Well, meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin is hoping to firm up a different sort of line, diplomatic ties with Africa. He's meeting with leaders from across the continent at a summit in St. Petersburg this week. Many of whom are pressing him to end the war in Ukraine. Russian officials say they're carefully examining the African peace initiative, raising hopes of an end to the conflict. Well, that's all happening as Russia claims to have intercepted a Ukrainian missile, targeting residential infrastructure in the city of Taganrog, vowing a harsh response to what it's explicitly calling a terror attack. CNN senior national security correspondent Alex Marquardt is following all of this, joins us now live from Kyiv. And Alex, these threats coming, I believe following a missile attack in the Russian region of Rostov, and an attempt to drone-attack on Moscow overnight. What more are you hearing on this?",

      "sentences": "Yes, there were two missile attacks fired. Two missiles fired at southern Russiaaccording to the Russian Ministry of Defense. They were both taken down by air defenses, they say, but the debris fell and did hurt some people. That debris falling from one of the missiles into that city, Taganrog, which is about 25 miles, 40 kilometers from the Ukrainian border. The second missile that was shot down, its debris falling in an empty area and not hurting anybody. But Russia is firmly accusing Ukraine of being behind what they call this terrorist attack. They say that they used two S- 200 missiles, now Christina, those missiles are normally used for air defense, so they would have been used here instead to attack targets on the ground. We have not heard any kind of claim responsibility from Ukraine. But Russia says they do reserve the right to respond because the people were hurt, and the areas that were hit certainly had nothing to do with the military. Of course, that is quite rich coming from Russia, considering the amount of damage that they have done and to the civilian population here in Ukraine throughout the course of the war. And then there was an earlier attempted drone attack it seemed in the early hours of the day, a drone flying towards Moscow, it too was taken down by air defenses according to Russian authorities. It comes just days after Ukraine did claim responsibility for sending two drones at Moscow on Monday. So despite the no claim of responsibility for the missiles or for the drone today, it does highlight the fact that Ukraine does continue to carry out attacks inside Russia. Christina?",

And the military state of play here now with retired U.S. Army Colonel Liam Collins. Colonel, thank you for joining us. You would have heard Alex talking there about how the Ukrainians have been prodding along the frontlines, and specifically, having taken the eastern -- made eastern gains in the village of Staromaiorske in the Donetsk region. I just want to show our viewers a couple of maps we have of that region to indicate exactly where it is, how incremental these gains have been. I don't know if we can get it up, but colonel, just talk to us   about the significant and sort of strategic approach here of what is happening. And that pathway that Alex mentioned, that could open up to more gains in the region. How significant is this? LIAM COLLINS, RETIRED U.S. ARMY COLONEL:  Yes, I mean, you must understand right how hard it is to conduct an offensive like this when the Russians had months and months to build up, right, miles long obstacles, not only long, but in depth, right? Dragon's teeth, mine fields, hundreds of mines. And so, they have to go out there and conduct a very complex, combine our maneuver involving artillery, engineers artillery, tanks and infantry to then breach these mine fields when they're under attack either direct fire or artillery fire from the Russians. So, it's very difficult to breach those obstacles. So making these gains that they made already, right? Slower than most people expect, but they're significant nonetheless. I'd like to try to penetrate some of those Russian lines.",

So, the Russians in the south caneither be supplied by -- through Crimea or through the west. And if they can cut that line, and then their only ability to resupply, move troops around is coming from Crimea, and that's very vulnerable as we've seen with the attacks on the bridge. Those kinds of things, so they can really seal off supplies to those Russian troops in the south, and then kind of go at them at that point.

We should say we don't know for sure who is in control of this vehicle, but colonel, just explain to us as you talk about those defenses, those multi-defenses.

Theyhave to build those right, concrete pillars in there, whatever they're building them with, they have to physically construct those. And you're not doing those right on the frontline because then it puts you at risk. So, that's going to be a little bit deeper for those types of obstacles, where the mine goes, maybe they're laying those at night, right, up, closer to the frontline. And so, it shows that the Ukrainians had made it to that point, but then once you get to that obstacle right, most vehicles aren't going to be able to just drive through these. It slows them down. They're going to need some kind of way to explosively breach them, mechanically do it with bulldozers, some other thing, and then right when they do that, that's where the Russians are focusing their artillery right at the point of that breach. And that's why it makes it so difficult. And the rule in the military is, you have to have 3 to 1 in terms of combat power so that the attacker needs to have three times the firepower, the force as a defender because they have to spend so much trying to get through those obstacles.",

She took power, you mayremember, after her predecessor who was a left-wing leader, Pedro Castillo attempted to sell for coup d'etat by dismissing Congress. And the police and the armed forces did not follow through with the order. Castillo is now in the hands of Peruvian authorities, and Boluarte, who is a right-wing politician, as the highest member of Congress back then was sworn in as interim president. And she was meant to bridge the nation to a new round of snap elections, to try and bring a consensus. That didn't happen. She stayed in power, she started forming a government and a cabinet and implementing right-wing policies. And that led to widespread protests last year in December and this year in January, and February, around Christmas, and this is why this speech today is so significant, because it's the first time that we're hearing Boluarte formally apologizing for the victims and the deaths of that cycle of protests, allegedly, at the hands of the policeman and the security forces. Here is what she said just about an hour ago when she accepted some form of responsibility. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DINA BOLUARTE, PRESIDENT, PERU (through translator):  Once again and very painfully, I recognize that such a death toll is something nobody wanted. I solemnly apologize on behalf of the state to the relatives of all victims, civilians, policemen and military, and to those who were injured. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In her speech, she claimed to have increased their investments in social spending for the poorest in Peru. And that she wants to create a climate of national agreement. Of course, Peru is one of the most polarized societies in Latin America right now. We have seen a plethora of presidents removed from office due to allegations of corruptions, judiciary investigations and Boluarte's government herself is currently under investigation by the Commission of Inter-American Human Rights. Which is a multi-lateral body that oversees human rights situations here in Latin America. What happens next, hard to say, Christina. Well, last year we had 25 victims, where most of them were in the provinces. Well, here today, we're seeing actions in Lima. So, we'll have to see how Boluarte's government will react to this new fresh round of protests just on independence day, Christina.",

But former U.S. President now faces four charges for his alleged mishandling of classified documents after leaving the White House. The superseding indictment from the special counsel add 60 pages to the case, Trump is fighting back as he gears up for a campaign rally in Pennsylvania this weekend. He's calling it harassment. And it's unclear when the indictment regarding the 2020 election and the attack on the U.S. Capitol might come down. But I want to bring in the very man to break it down for us, senior legal analyst Elie Honig joining us here. Elie, good to see you. So, just to help us understand this, Elie, we know that Trump is now facing two new obstruction charges and one willful retention of defense information, that all- important Iran document. None of this of course good for Donald Trump. But which of these charges could prove to be the more legally-damaging?",

And ideally forDonald Trump to past the November 2024 U.S. presidential election. This case was already a separate trial, fairly recently in May of 2024. They have to do the math on this, because a trial of this nature is going to take 6 to 10 weeks to try, so without two months. But the thing is, realistically, we are not going to have a trial on the eve of the election. We are not going to have a trial in September or October of 2024. So if you're already starting in May, and it's going to take two months and you have to push it back, you're really getting into that red zone, that danger zone where I think the judge is going to have to think seriously about pushing it back, and not just back a little bit, but back until after the election.

And we know, Elie, from what you're saying as well that the two trial dates are now set for 2024.

Here, we have Donald Trump, who is the leading contender for the Republican nomination, could well be the nominee, he is now facing four potential criminal cases. Criminal cases, of course, are the most serious and have the gravest consequences. He's been indicted twice already. There is a state-level case here in Manhattan where he's charged with falsifying business records about hush money payments made to the adult film actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. That case has been indicted, it's set for trial in March of 2024. Then, we have the federal indictment that we were just talking about, relating to the classified documents in Mar-a-Lago. That is set for trial in May though as we just discussed, it'll probably get pushed back. It looks like the next one up will be another federal indictment relating to January 6th or the preceding effort to steal the election. And it looks like shortly after that, later this August, a local prosecutor down in Georgia in Fulton County will also in all likelihood indict Donald Trump for his effort to interfere with the Georgia results in the 2020 election. So, those are the four criminal cases we could indeed have one of the two major party nominees for president, dealing with four separate criminal indictments during a presidential campaign.",

The Emmys, being in September, that sounds far away but they start planning these shows almost as soon as the first show ends. They start planning the next one. And that goes for all award shows. So, the writers and the SAG, all being on strike, hundreds of thousands of people being affected, obviously, the show cannot go on without Hollywood being able to be part of it.

And so this is incredibly significant and very unfortunate because the Emmys is something that everybody looks forward to. And even I'm finding, when I'm interviewing celebrities in the wake of all of this, they can't talk about their projects. That's part of the strike. You cannot talk about your projects.
