Today is a day off, maybe just -- what everyone needs after a jaw-dropping day yesterday of testimony in the Donald Trump criminal hush, money trial. Stormy Daniels took the stand and she had salacious details about her alleged encounter with Trump in 2006. The former president was cursing and shaking his head during the testimony. We know this from the transcript. Judge Juan Merchan told Trump's attorneys but he wouldn't tolerate the former president's behavior. Trump's lawyers later argued the judge should declare a mistrial in the wake of Daniels testimony and Merchan deny that motion. Trump didn't acknowledge Daniels testimony after court wrapped up for the day. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This was a very big day, a very revealing day. As you see, their case is totally falling apart. They have nothing on the books and records and even something that should bear very little relationship with the case. It's just disaster for the D.A. To the Soros-backed D.A., it's a disaster.

That testimony yesterday went there, right? I mean, it went to places that the judge basically said, hey, you've gone too far here. The judge asking for fewer details. We were not treated to fewer details. We were treated too many details, including some new ones about this alleged encounter between Trump and Stormy Daniels. And then we learn this very interesting texture from the transcript where the judge said he could hear Trump cursing under his breath shaking his head. The judge says this is contemptuous it could impact the jury. What does that say to you about the impact of the testimony yesterday?",

And I mean, it -- clearly, it got out of hand according to the judge's own reactions. You know, the judge had to tell Stormy Daniels to, you know, okay, maybe not go into quite so much detail. We don't really need to go there. And then at the same time also telling Trump, okay, if you cant be cursing under your breath. And it just goes to show how salacious of an allegation this is how, you know, how much Trump is annoyed by this being pulled up once again and -- I mean, this is just another insane moment in this political news cycle.",

I mean, he's trying to say, okay, I've all these grievances, I'm being kept off the campaign trail, but he's continuing to deny happen with Stormy Daniels and basically call the whole thing, not -- not real.

Most Biden supporters are going to remain Biden supporters.And it's unlikely at least at this stage, for these cases to really impact that. Of course, if this comes to a conviction, there have been some polls indicate that could sway some small numbers of voters against Trump, and, you know, the end of the day we are looking at a very small number of voters who are going to decide selection come November, we're looking at less than 10 percent of voters in what, six states. So whether we see this impact on the margins actually have an impact in November, we could see that potentially happen. But by and large, we're not seeing this move the polls in any significant way, at least so far.

If he doesn't have that support from the U.S., although Biden will always say he's always there for Israel.

You've still got some strong thunderstorms, lots of lightning, essentially stretching all the way from Upstate New York back into Arkansas. You can see that southern edge of the line. That's where we still have the potential for some tornado. So you still have that tornado watch, that red color, you see there in effect.
