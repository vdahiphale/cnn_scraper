And it is difficult to sort of convey to our viewers those of you who have not experience what a strong earthquake feels like how powerful these events can actually be. So the conditions are very challenging, but we are cooperating extremely well with the Turkish authorities. I understand there has been a very significant mobilization on the part of Turkey. Again, the first priority right now is to save people who are trapped in buildings that have collapsed. Immediately afterwards, I'm sure that the authorities will focus on questions of housing and feeding those people who cannot return to their own, then of course, we will start the painful process of reconstruction. Let me point out that this earthquake has not just affected Turkey, it has also affected Syria, the reputations are even more complicated because essentially, there is no official interlocutor. So, we have to work through international organizations. And a significant amount of international assistance that was directed to northern Syria, even before the earthquake inevitably has been disrupted as a result of the quake.
