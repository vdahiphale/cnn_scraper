And then those two presidents will be joined by the Canadian Prime Minister for a ceremonial dinner. Of course, we are going to see the U.S. president and the Mexican president try to show that goodwill and try to discuss areas of cooperation but there are also going to be other issues that are simply going to be incredibly tough and complicated. Chief among them, of course, is going to be immigration.Keep all of this in the context of last week, and the announcement from the Biden administration to essentially expand Title 42, this controversial program that goes back to the Trump era where migrants trying to come into the United States can be quickly expelled. Part of that agreement was Mexico saying they would be willing to accept up to 30,000 migrants who are turned away at the U.S. border back into Mexico. Notably though, and this gives you a sense of what a work in progress all of this is Jake Sullivan telling reporters here this morning that they're just going to have to simply take some time to see whether that initial agreement works out. And that as a part of this meeting, they're not really expecting to make any new announcements or any new plans, as far as immigration is concerned. So, obviously, this will again, be a top issue for these three leaders. They'll obviously talk about a number of other issues like trade, and just general economic cooperation between the three countries.",

And he did, of course, get a good sense by talking to border officials, meeting with local leaders and community leaders about the situation, but he also ended up going to a migrant aid center.And that aid center yesterday, at least when the president was there, didn't seem to have any migrants at the time. And what a senior official told me yesterday was that that was purely coincidental that when he was there, there were just no migrants at the center. And Jake Sullivan this morning telling reporters that really the focus was to meet with groups that are providing essential services to the migrants. But again, just seemed like a notable omission, given how much pressure the president has been under to go to a place like El Paso and see with his own eyes some of the scenes that our colleagues have been seeing as they have been reporting there for the last several weeks. So, again, all of this just brings and highlights what a complicated issue and potentially a political liability this has all been for President Biden.",

President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva has only been in power since January 1, and he was barely beginning the process of getting his new government up and running. Now, he has a full-blown institutional and political crisis in his hands. Brazilian officials in the capitol met again Monday in the presidential palace that the day before was under siege. The new president met with his cabinet for the first time Monday to make the vandalized buildings operational again and ensure the security situation across the country doesn't get any worse. President Lula da Silva is vowing to prosecute the rioters. And it's hard to overstate the seriousness of what happened. We have learned that at least 70 people were injured, a sixth of them severely, but no one died according to the Brazilian health ministry.

At the top, I said that this echoes of January 6, complete with the claims of a stolen election, and voting machines switching votes. Am I oversimplifying that or is it as clear and simple as it looks?BRIAN WINTER, EDITOR-IN-CHIE, AMERICAS QUARTERLY: As an American analyst who follows Brazil for a living, I'm constantly asking myself whether these similarities are misleading or not. And here the answer is no. So many similarities between January 6 in the United States and January 8 in Brazil, even the date is almost the same, albeit with two years of delay, and it's no coincidence. Bolsonaro and his followers have been openly following the example of Donald Trump going all the way back to 2016, which is the year that Trump was elected and that Bolsonaro launched his candidacy. We know that there are people, including Steve Bannon and Jason Miller, the former Trump aides who talk to members of the Bolsonaro family.

The most concerning thing about this is that it is the January 6 playbook being exported to Brazil, and being followed in a way that may show other opponents of election victories that look, you don't have to accept what happened at the ballot box. You can fight it by creating your own disinformation reality that your followers will believe in and rise up.Now, what's worse about the Brazil situation is that it appears from initial reporting that parts of the military and the security forces may have been complicit, or at least looked the other way and allowed this to happen. So that leaves everyone with, you know, holding your breath. Is this going to be the thing that starts a large series of protests across the country, which could be much more dangerous and bring back you know, shades of the 1964 coup in Brazil when a right- wing dictatorship took over from a leftist government like Brazil has right now?",

While it's true that Bolsonaro on Sunday was not out there actively egging these insurrectionists on in the way that Donald Trump was on January 6, 2021, he still bears a lot of political responsibility for what happened because he spent all of 2022 casting doubt on the integrity of Brazil's election system. He said that there could be violence if he lost. He said the only way that he would lose would be through fraud. And then he refused to explicitly concede defeat. And so, all of these things created an environment where events like the ones that we saw on Sunday could happen, even if he wasn't actually out there, egging them on.That said, I mean, I think that this was an incredibly bad strategy on the part of the people who did this because just as January 6 ended up backfiring and many ways in the United States, we see signs that the same thing is happening in Brazil. All three -- members of all three branches of government signed a statement today expressing repudiating what happened on Sunday. That includes, by the way, the head of Congress who was a Bolsonaro ally, that was like the equivalent of Mitch McConnell doing that in the United States. So -- and there are signs -- early signs that the vast majority of the Brazilian people are not sympathetic, and in fact, are turned off by what happened on Sunday. So, the risks are still there but this, so far, looks to have backfired on Bolsonaro and his supporters.",

We had much negotiation taking place well before the vote even began, certainly two or three votes in, 99.9 percent of this was covered. You're talking about this vacate to the chair as mentioned by now majority leader Steve Scalise, this has been in effect for 150 years. So, it shouldn't be a concern. I'd prefer to be 50 plus one on the conference side, but I think it's going to be fine. McCarthy's going to have to just deal with that. But it really brings a high level of accountability. Everybody's voice on the Republican side is going to make a difference. And as you can see, we have a pretty diverse group.
