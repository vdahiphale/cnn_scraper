Human rights activists say 27year old Mehran Samak, shown here in a social media video, was shot in the head by Iranian security forces for honking his horn to celebrate Iran's loss to the United States on Tuesday. CNN was also given footage from his funeral, where mourners were heard chanting anti-government slogans. Some other Iranians cheered Tuesday's U.S. World Cup victory over Iran. They saw it as a way of protesting the country's hard line Islamist regime. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh is following the story for us. And the story here of, course, it is that there are some Iranian fans who really feel like a win by the team, if they'd gone through to the next round, would have been co-opted by the Islamic regime. Sadly, it seems that one man, one young man has lost his life as a result of this. I know it's quite difficult, very difficult to get detail on the ground. But you have been talking to people. What are they telling you?",

      "sentences": "Well, Becky, from what we understand, 27 year old Mehran Samak was one of the many Iranians who, as youmentioned, took to the streets in the early hours on Wednesday in cities across the country, celebrating the football team's defeat at the World Cup. Because many felt that the Iranian regime had taken football away from them, that national pride for so many Iranians. They felt that the regime had hijacked football, hijacked this team for its own propaganda purposes. So the defeat of the team was the defeat of the regime for so many Iranians who are out celebrating as we saw. We understand from Iran Human Rights, the Norway based group as well as activists, that Mehran was shot in the head and killed by regime forces, they say, while he was out on the streets of his northern port city of Bandar Anzali in the early hours on Wednesday. The Iranian judicial authorities today saying that his death was suspicious, as they described it, saying that he was killed by a pellet bullet. And they have launched an investigation into his death. Of course, the international community doesn't really take these investigations seriously. We've heard from the United Nations over the past couple of months, all these investigations into the deaths of protesters do not meet the international standards of independence and partiality and transparency. The regime, of course, is making it very difficult for us to report, to get information on incidents like this and what has been going on in the country for the past couple of months. We are not allowed to report from inside Iran. It's very hard for us to reach people inside of the country. And people take huge risks if they try to speak with us. We have really been working hard to try and confirm more details, reports that he was out in the car with his fiancee, that he was honking his horn when he was shot. Very, very difficult for us, Becky, to report. But we are continuing to try to do so.",

In the capital, Kyiv, the administration says heavy Russian shelling left the southern city of Kherson without power. And in the Zaporizhzhya region, emergency power outages are being implemented now. Meanwhile, we're getting word that the U.S. is considering more intense training for Ukrainian forces. Some 2,500 Ukrainian soldiers could be instructed every month at a U.S. military base in Germany. The war in Ukraine, a critical topic of a major diplomatic meeting right now in Washington. U.S. President, Joe Biden, receives his French counterpart French president, Emmanuel Macron, in Mr. Biden's first state visit since he took office. The two are expected to speak to reporters soon, before going into their bilateral meeting, Mr. Biden said the two allies are united on Russia's war. But there are some differences. As CNN's Stephen Collinson writes, and I quote, \"Macron has at times been at odds with the United States over Ukraine and has kept up contacts with Vladimir Putin, even after his invasion, warning that the West should make sure it does not humiliate the Russian president if there's ever an international peace effort. \"Macron will be a key player and his open channel to Putin will, therefore, be useful for the United States.\" CNN's Melissa Bell following the story from Paris. We'll check in with her in a moment. First, let's get you to Natasha Bertrand, who is in Washington for more of her reporting about the United States training Ukrainian forces. This is an important leg to the story. This training program will be a significant move by the United States. Explain why and what more we are learning about the details of this program.",

Behind that unity we've been talking about on Ukraine, they're really strengthened over the course of last nine months or so, as you say. In the beginning, Emmanuel Macron really insisting on an open conversation with Vladimir Putin. He stood out amongst Western leaders, in fact, as that emerged as something that is not yielding anything, the unity within NATO I think surprised NATO members themselves. That unity, of course, it will be on display again in that bilateral meeting without -- the press conference, rather, in which we will hear from the two presidents reiterating, no doubt, they are determined to see this through together. But it is what the consequences of the war in Ukraine have been on Europe that will be at the heart of president Macron's concerns. The Inflation Reduction Act that will come into effect next month, Becky, Europeans say it will hugely penalize their industries as president Macron told American lawmakers on Capitol Hill yesterday. This may solve some of your problems but it really only worsens ours. Europeans feel very strongly that these subsidies protectionist in their nature are not what is needed as Europe faces this winter not just the consequences of the war and its economy but of course, the problem of energy prices. And president Macron is also looking for help on that, Becky.",

That is China's consistent formula for fighting COVID-19 since the outset. We're talking nearly three years. After an impressive wave of protests, the Chinese government apparently is rethinking its strategy. The manufacturing hub of Guangzhou removing barriers from the streets and lifting lockdowns in parts of the city. The capital Beijing also loosening local restrictions this week and just yesterday word from a top official that the country is entering a new stage and mission in pandemic controls. Thousands of buildings and communities remain in lockdown across China. Ivan Watson joining us from Hong Kong.

The internet is widely censored in China. But despite that, we are seeing nostalgia online from some people posting. And some people comparing the relative freedom that they feel that they had in the late '90s, when Jiang Zemin was the leader of China, compared to today, when there's so much more censorship.

We're expecting the couple to arrive here at ROCO (ph), which is a youth empowerment project here in Chelsea, just outside of Boston. If you hear some screaming, that's what it will be. We'll show you some pictures of them as they come in. But it has been a distraction. Also, Becky, last night, we went to an NBA match with the Boston Celtics. There was some booing as the couple were pointed out by the commentators. People are saying that's part of the same controversy. I don't think it was. I was at the game, actually. That was more about, you know, Boston seeing itself as a place where the American Revolution really started. Sorry, I'm being distracted by what's going on. And I'll get out of the way for you, Becky, I think the couple are here. I'll let the camera man zoom in and find them. They've had quite big crowds as they've been moving around these various events. It's not just been about the Earthshot awards, it's also been about going and exploring projects which are similar to the work they are interested in. Lots of security, as you can see. So Bob is now struggling to show the couple as they get out of their car. There's so many security people. We're just going to lift the camera up and see what we can get for you. The actual main event will be on Friday night, the Earthshot Prize. This has been described, oh, there, Princess of Wales arriving, Prince of Wales on the other side of the car. This is all about getting involved with young people who have been caught up in violence and supporting them to try to get them into jobs effectively. They're going to go and meet the various people involved in that. And in they go. I think the crowds are hoping for a walkabout as well afterwards, Becky. There are some crowds down there.",
