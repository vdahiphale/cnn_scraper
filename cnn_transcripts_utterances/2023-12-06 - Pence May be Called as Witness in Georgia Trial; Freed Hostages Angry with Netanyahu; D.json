Sources tell CNN that Fulton County prosecutors have a list of more than 150 potential witnesses who could be called to testify, including Mike Pence.CNN's Zachary Cohen is on this reporting this morning. Zach, what have you learned?",

Pence officially listed as a witness. We know that he went before the federal grand jury in the Jack Smith investigation, which is the federal investigation.

Prosecutors are obligated by law, Sara, to notify the defense and the court of anybody that they might call as a witness at trial. Now, who might you call as a witness at trial? It's someone who could provide what's called legally relevant evidence. Evidence that proves or disproves a central point at trial. And when someone is on trial, they're a close colleague of theirs, a top lieutenant of theirs in a political case would certainly be a relevant witness. And so, you know, Mike Pence, even if prosecutors don't choose to call him, may have evidence that could be valuable to a prosecution over election subversion here.So, again, it -- you know, who knows whether they actually end up putting him on the stand. It was important to notify the defense that they did and he might be a valuable witness.",

So, when you bring -- when prosecutors seek to bring in what's called character evidence, and that's what that would be, it's evidence of the defendant's traits, character, state of mind, whatever else, that can be used not to establish that he's just a bad guy or that he was more or less likely to commit the offense. What it can be used to establish is his motive or intent.And, once again, this is almost similar to what happened in Georgia, prosecutors have to issue a notice to the court and the defendant when they intend to introduce such evidence. This could be incredibly valuable evidence for prosecutors if the judge allows it in in establishing what Donald Trump's state of mind might have been. And one of the best examples, and they noted in that pleading, Sara, is that when Donald Trump says the words \"stand back and stand by\" to the Proud Boys, they then went and put it on their merchandise on their website. That could be evidence of at least knowledge of, you know, certainly not a link -- a direct link between Donald Trump and whipping up the Proud Boys, but they believed what he said and there was at least a meeting of the minds in some way from them, and that can be used possibly to establish some form of knowledge or intent on the part of Donald Trump.",

They accuse him of playing politics, of prioritizing politics over freeing the hostages. They say that the intelligence services in Israel didn't have a good sense of where the hostages were being held and they say that Israel's military campaign even endangered and wounded some of the hostages. I want to play a clip of one of the women in this meeting. She herself was a hostage with her children. They were freed, but her husband is still inside. She says that no one was doing anything for them, she says, and that Israeli shelling actually wounded them. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FREED HOSTAGE (through translator): You will return them all. They will not wait 50 days. They will not wait another year, because you claim that they are strong enough. You have no information. You have no information. The fact that we were shelled, the fact that no one knew anything about where we were. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

At one point, Kate, according to this recording, people started shouting \"shame\" at Netanyahu.Netanyahu defended the military action saying it was actually the military operations and the military pressure that led to the initial release of hostages. And he went on to say that more military pressure will actually help get the rest of the hostages out. Kate, the fact remains that just under 140 hostages, 138 to be exact, remain in the Gaza Strip and there is a lot of anger directed at the Netanyahu government they believe for - that the Netanyahu government is not doing enough to get them home.

They sent agents over to the region to try to work with the Ukrainian prosecutors. We've seen Merrick Garland, the attorney general, go over to meet with the Ukrainians to try to emphasize the importance of this work that they -- you know, that they - that they're pushing to try to make sure they can bring some of these people to justice for some of the crimes that were committed after the invasion of Ukraine, John.",
