We'll show you where he is and what his legal team is saying about the Siberian penal colony where the Kremlin is now keeping him.Plus, a new caravan of migrants has just started to make its way toward the southern U.S. border. This as Secretary of State Tony Blinken heads to Mexico City to address the surge. We'll take you live to the border. Plus, a new report showing Americans are skipping their use of popular weight loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy in order to indulge in their holiday favorites. We'll talk with an expert on whether that's a good idea. We're following these major developing stories and many more. It's all coming in right here to CNN NEWS CENTRAL. Vladimir Putin's most famous critic has been found alive in a Siberian prison. This follows two weeks of uncertainties surrounding the jailed opposition leader's whereabouts. He missed two scheduled court appearances last week, but a spokesman says Navalny's lawyer saw him at the remote penal colony today and that he's doing \"quite well.\" Known as the Polar Wolf, the prison is some 2,000 miles from where Navalny had been held before. His years-long protest of Putin was the subject of a CNN film and HBO Max documentary that won an Oscar this year. CNN's Nada Bashir has the latest now from London.",

      "sentences": "Well, news of Alexey Navalny's whereabouts has come as a huge relief after his legal team lost contact with the jailed Kremlin critic more than two weeks ago. But there is still deep concern over the situation he now faces after he was located on Monday at a penal colony in northwestern Siberia, described as the Polar Wolf colony. Now, in a statement on Monday, the director of Navalny's Anti- Corruption Foundation said that Navalny's lawyer had been able to visit him at the penal colony, adding that this particular colony is one of the most remote, with conditions known to be harsh and restricted contact with detainees.Navalny was sentenced back in August of this year to 19 years in prison after he was found guilty of extremism-related charges. He'd already been serving sentences of 11 and a half years in a maximum security facility on fraud and other charges and was believed to be held at a penal colony 150 miles east of Moscow until now. These are charges he and his legal representatives have consistently denied. Supporters believe his arrest and incarceration are a politically motivated attempt to stifle his criticism of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Navalny has, of course, posed one of the most serious threats to Putin's legitimacy during his rule, known for organizing anti-government street protests and using his blog and social media to expose alleged corruption in the Kremlin. His incarceration has drawn widespread international condemnation. The White House earlier this month reiterating its call for Navalny's immediate release. Nada Bashir, CNN in London.",

It seems since then that Putin has reconsolidated his power. We thought that he might be damaged in some significant way. Looks like he's emerged from it under - with everything under complete control. But moving Navalny in some ways almost speaks of a little bit of nervousness, that just even having him an hour or two from Moscow in a maximum security prison wasn't enough.",

A year ago, the Russians had been routed from Kherson and some other Ukrainian cities. There was talk in the West that there could be a rapid victory for Ukraine, that the Russian forces would collapse and, of course, they were getting ready for that spring offensive.That offensive isn't, in retrospect, gave the Russians time to dig in. The Russians have now poured more people and more armaments at this. The Ukrainians are running low on arms, which is why there was so much urgency about trying to get the congressional aid through. And clearly in 2024, while it is hard to say how this will all play out, the Ukrainians are going to have to learn how to fight on a budget. It seems unlikely to me that they're going to get the kind of money and aid that they've had for the past two years, even if Congress passes something and that's not a certainty at this point.",

The distance they must cover is nearly 1,400 miles.So it's probably going to take weeks, considering that they can only go so fast. But make no mistake about it. This means this new migrant surge that we're seeing here in Eagle Pass is going to go on for much longer. The problem is that this is a community of less than 30,000 people that is being stretched to the limit due to the amount of resources needed to deal with this challenge in terms of basic needs of the immigrants and security as well.

And as you mentioned, the situation has become so dire that President Biden called the Mexican president last week to place pressure on Mexico to do more to stem the flow of migration.Now, during that call, both leaders agreed that additional enforcement is \"urgently needed.\" But, of course, this is the type of situation the White House was hoping to avoid because border security is not only a political vulnerability for President Biden, it's also a major logistical challenge as the number of people apprehended at the U.S.- Mexico border strains federal resources. So the president asking senior U.S. officials to visit Mexico this week, they include Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Now, usually when the U.S. and Mexico engage in these talks, there are asks on the table. That has looked in the past like Mexico doing more on its northern border, to help with enforcement, as well as keeping people from moving through Mexico to get to the U.S. southern border, for example, this caravan. Now, we should note with migrants, as they pass through Central America and Mexico in caravans, they often splinter off. So not all will reach the U.S. southern border, but even those that do create more strain on an already buckling system, Jessica?",
