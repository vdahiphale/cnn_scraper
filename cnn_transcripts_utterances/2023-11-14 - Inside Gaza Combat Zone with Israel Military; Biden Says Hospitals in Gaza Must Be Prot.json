His video evidence now and photo evidence that absolutely gives credibility to the Israelis that they -- Hamas is using civilians as human shields and they're putting headquarters and weapons caches underneath hospitals. This is also evidence of a war crime, and someday this video evidence might very well be used in that to try Hamas leadership. But, look, it shows the difficulty in the situation. You can't have -- obviously you can't respond by bombing the hospital, so it shows the importance of putting boots on the ground. That's really the only way that you can root this out. The tunnels, the weapons caches, everything that's around the vicinity of hospitals, you've got to put boots on the ground. And that's why I commend the Israelis for the slow methodical shaping campaign that they're conducting. They're coming down the coastline now from the north towards that hospital, and they seem to be able to I think take it and root those people out once and for all. That's the only way you can do is use special operations and infantry troops to root them physically out of their hiding spots.",

      "sentences": "Well, the overall Powell proffer is not as strong as the Ellis proffer because Powell doesn't as conclusively repudiate the events of the run-up to January 6th, but her -- but, still, there are points of value in her -- and this is one, why? Donald Trump has already signaled he wants to defend himself by saying, I relied on the lawyers. That is a technical legal defense, but only if you're taking the advice of the lawyers in good faith.If you're picking and choosing your lawyers based upon the outcome you want, you don't get to use that defense, and so this shows that she's a firsthand direct witness to the conversation with Trump. It kind of goes back to the Scavino point. We're not going to leave no matter what, and I'm going to pick the lawyers who will give me the advice to let me stay. So in context also a very damaging moment in the disclosures of the video proffers.",

      "sentences": "It is interesting, because you also make the point -- and we got to go -- that hers might be seen as a weaker testimony to provide because at one point \"The Washington Post\" says at one point in the Powell interview, she said that Trump really did believe that he had won which could be part of the Trump defense. Regardless, it's all going to be very interesting as this goes forward, and a wild window into what the prosecutors have and what they were able to secure in order to offer -- in offering these plea deals.It's good to see you, Norm.
