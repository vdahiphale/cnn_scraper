So far this season, the flu has caused 15 million infections, 150,000 hospitalizations, and 9,300 deaths. The flu is part of the triple threat worrying federal health officials. RSV also raging, and COVID may be on the verge of a winter comeback. Right now, 14 percent of the U.S. is in high transmission, an area there for coronavirus, and that's higher than last week.CNN medical analyst, Dr. Jonathan Reiner is here with us. Doctor, good to see you. Let's start with the question I think most people are wondering. It's Christmas time, it's holiday time, Hanukkah is coming, and people will be getting together for the big family gatherings, the crowded parties, going to airports. Should we be wearing masks again at these places? DR. JONATHAN REINER, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST: Oh, yes. Maybe not so much in your holiday party if you are visiting your parents or loved ones. But when you're traveling in densely populated areas, there is so much flu around. There's still really a remarkable amount of COVID and RSV is circulating. And I think you can protect yourself very well by wearing a good mask. The better the mask you wear, the better the protection. I still think because there's so much COVID in our communities all over the United States, if you are going to visit elderly parents or people who have other health issues that make them vulnerable, it would be polite and smart to test, you know, before you get in the car. Test yourself, and then everyone can take, you know, can have a great time.",

I just read the numbers. 9,300 deaths, 150,000 hospitalizations. Obviously different strains of the flu every year, so there are different formulations of the flu vaccine. The good news is from the CDC director that this year, it's a really good match.",

Now Strep A can also present with a really severe sore throat, and although, again, any of these infections, particularly COVID can present with a sore throat. If you are COVID negative, and you're influenza negative -- because we can test for that as well -- ask your doctor for a Strep test.",

Of course, this is going to miss all of the big cities along the I-95 corridor. All the snow is going to be in the interior sections of the Northeast and New England. In fact, the rain is wrapping up for New York right now. Still raining heavily in Boston. We do have winds of 25 to 35 miles per hour. But the heaviest snow of course, in upstate New York and then of course in interior sections of New England. That's where we have the winter storm warnings in place. We also have winter weather advisories as well.So, we'll time this out. Here's the forecast radar. You can see the rain ending in New York and in just a couple of hours and we do have some snowfall left over by early tomorrow morning and then that snow should be pushing out by tomorrow evening. And we'll finally say good bye to this system that has just impacted much of the country. Snow forecast, we're looking at 18 to 24 inches across some of the higher elevations here and interior of new England. So, quite a bit of snow there. High temperatures are also going to start to fall in the coming days as we look forward into next week. We have a very, very cold air mass that's going to sweep down across the plains and enter into the country. And that's going to bring temperatures way down. Look at Minneapolis topping out at only, what, a degree below zero by the time we get into the middle part of next week -- guys. We could have some serious cold next week.",
