And the big question here is Pallone he wants these companies to turn over documents a trove of documents, including a list of meetings with OPEC officials, communications with each other over production, nonpublic communications with investors about production and efforts to influence the government and efforts to kind of keep production and supply low. Let me read you a key line from this letter from Pallone to these oil companies he wrote, if U.S. oil companies are colluding with each other and foreign cartels to manipulate global oil markets and harm American consumers, Congress and the American people deserve to know. Now remember, oil, cartels, OPEC and OPEC+, they exist to sort of coordinate on production. They're trying to move production up and down to influence prices. That of course, though, is not allowed in the United States. It's supposed to be a free market here. CEOs are not allowed to team up on supply. And it's very different from what we see in OPEC. And just a reminder, we talk about OPEC. We're talking about Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, UAE, Kuwait, Iran, and other nations.

I'm very happy that the state of Palestine, as it's called today was very happy with this because they see this is recognition of the moderate path to a settlement where Israelis and Palestinian can live in peace side by side, that's the Palestine that we recognize. And I noticed that when there was a vote in the general assembly of the U.N.
