(VIDEO PLAYING) The Israeli military says it has arrested hundreds of, quote, \"terror suspects\" after launching a major operation at Al Shifa Hospital. An eyewitness told CNN military vehicles were firing at hospital buildings and the Palestinian Health Ministry says there were multiple casualties. The IDF claims it killed more than a dozen quote \"terrorists\" while Hamas's military wing says its fighters were engaged in fierce clashes with Israeli forces. CNN cannot independently verify these claims. The leaders of Israel and the U.S. held their first known phone call in at least a month amid tensions over Israel's handling of the war in Gaza. The White House says Joe Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu discussed the hostage and ceasefire talks and the urgent need to get more aid into Gaza. President Biden also warned that Israel's plans for a major ground operation in Rafah to go after Hamas would be a mistake. More than a million Palestinians are sheltering there. The White House National Security Advisor says a senior Israeli delegation is expected to arrive in Washington this week for further discussions on possible alternatives to an offensive.

We've been hearing from other aid agencies including the United Nations describing this as an unprecedented situation, levels of hunger that we haven't seen before anywhere else or at any other time and of course the situation is not only being felt in northern Gaza where it has proven near impossible to get aid to those most in need over the last few weeks and months but also of course in southern Gaza many are living at level four phase four which is an emergency level of hunger just edging towards the brink of those catastrophic levels of hunger being experienced in northern Gaza. [03:05:12] And of course this has all come as we continue to see aid agencies coming up against several obstacles and difficulties in trying to get humanitarian aid and crucially food supplies to northern Gaza but of course this report has triggered widespread concern in the international community not least from the United Nations.

We have of course seen attempts to get aid in via airdrops by several countries as well as of course this new maritime corridor which has been established from Cyprus to Gaza but what many aid agencies including the U.N.'s own agencies are calling for is more land crossings. They have accused Israel of obstructing those land crossings, crucially the Rafah border crossing and there are concerns that if we see a military operation, a ground operation in Rafah, that could only make the situation much, much worse.

Haiti is a big country, but this does have an impact on the rest of the country because without goods flowing, without people being able to come into the capital, bring the goods to the capital to sell that, and then things coming back out to the provinces, there's an economic ripple effect that spreads across the entirety of the country.",

Putin made it sound like it was very close.

He knows that President Biden has been particularly concerned about escalation. That's the reason the President didn't give Ukraine some of America's best weapons early in the war, though later on he got to doing it.

This, of course, Rosemary, leads to something which is completely different. And maybe we should talk about this some other time.

Really there are two key reasons. The first, because we're seeing inflation. The second, because we're seeing wages go up. So right now the rate of inflation for core consumer prices, this includes everything besides food and fuel, is hovering at about 2 percent, that healthy number that indicates that the economy is growing in the right direction. Now, this is a huge shift from the years of deflation we've been seeing in the country. I spoke to an expert earlier who discussed why this was so significant. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

President Miguel Diaz-Canel says his government is willing to hold dialogue with protesters about their complaints, but accused Cuban exiles in Miami for stirring up protesters online and blamed U.S. sanctions for the shortages of basic goods. But U.S. officials say they have nothing to do with the problems facing Cuba. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VEDANT PATEL, DEPUTY SPOKESPERSON, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT: The United States is not behind these protests in Cuba and the accusation of that is absurd. I will note, though, since you asked, we are closely following these reports. Protests across several cities in Cuba yesterday called for electricity, food and fundamental freedoms. I think what we are seeing is a reflection of the dire situation on the island. We urge the Cuban government to refrain from violence and unjust detentions and are calling on the authorities to respect the Cuban citizens' right to peaceful assembly. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
