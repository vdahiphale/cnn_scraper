The sun is up in Florida, and emergency crews and residents are getting their first look at the damage left by Hurricane Milton. Rescue crews are trying to reach trapped residents in Pinellas County.And we've just learned at least four people are dead in St. Lucie County on the East Coast of Florida, according to the sheriff, after a tornado tore through a retirement community. The storm has moved offshore and is heading east into the Atlantic Ocean as a Category 1 storm, but not before leaving a trail of destruction right through the state. Later this hour, Governor Ron DeSantis and FEMA Chief Deanne Criswell will update us on the current conditions. Milton made landfall Wednesday night, just south of Tampa as a Category 3 storm. It brought damaging winds, flooding rains, storm surge. Millions of homes across the state are still without power, and part of the reason for that, dozens of tornadoes spawned by the hurricane's outer bands. Take a look at this, Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg. The stadium was supposed to house first responders, but Milton completely laid waste to this ripping the roof off of it. You can see right through to the baseball diamond there. And Tampa's Mayor warns residents, just because the storm is gone doesn't mean the danger is too. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, Buddy Dyer was here for Ian two years ago.He was here for Charley 20 years ago, so he knows hurricanes and how they can impact this community. We're expecting to hear from him and EOC officials with more detail later this morning, while we're waiting to get a clear picture of what it looks like here in Orange County. I checked with officials right next door in Brevard County, straight east here from Orange County. They've got more than 70 miles of coastline in Brevard County, Cape Canaveral is there, Cocoa Beach. 87,000 or so customers without power and a report of a tornado touchdown there as well, no report of injuries, according to county officials. We're still working to get some clarity from Cocoa Beach. Police about that tornado that touched down some damage to infrastructure. They did have to evacuate some people from an apartment building for some localized flooding there as well. A little more than 500 people who went to shelters in Brevard County, far fewer than the thousands who went to shelters here in Orange County, about 2600 here, about 1000 in shelters in Osceola County, which is straight south. So those people possibly will be able, once the sun comes up, once their communities are searched, will be able to go back to their homes.",

Yeah, you're right with the center coming in south of Tampa that pushed the worst storm surge down into places like Venice and down into Sarasota County.But the flooding that you saw in the Tampa area with 18 inches of rain in St. Petersburg, greater than 15 inches in some locations, really puts a lot of water everywhere anyway, regardless of whether it's coming from the bay or from the sky. And then they got into that Northwestern eyewall where we saw some really intense winds, and they were in that eye wall for quite some time. And you've seen the damage. You've seen the wind damage with gusts 90, 100 miles per hour across portions of central Florida. Still substantial winds ongoing along the Florida East Coast this morning, still a very dangerous situation across much of Florida. It's important to remind people that we lose a lot of people after storms in these types of major hurricane landfall. So, we want people to be safe in that post storm environment. Don't go out and about. It's dark, there's damage, there's flooded water, there may be power lines down. Don't be going out until your local officials tell you it's safe to do so. JIMENEZ: As we've been talking about the damage that we've been seeing, these are live images out of Pinellas County right now. You can see a man in the bottom left of your screen walking literally chest deep in water right now, you can see, obviously, the height of it. It seems to be a residential area. There is a man seems to be on the phone in that light green jacket on top as well, likely as the sun has come up, people are trying to figure out what to do, as they see their neighborhoods completely transformed by the effects of hurricane Milton. But again, that man walking chest deep in the water gives you, perspective to the amount that we have seen come in over just the past 24 to 48 hours as well. We're going to keep an eye on these live images as well, and as you saw someone go through on a boat. Cities dotting Central Florida's Western Coast got the initial brunt of the storm. And of course, Milton hit just two weeks after hurricane Helene left devastation across the region. Clearwater is just west of Tampa, and the mayor there had this assessment of Milton when he spoke to CNN's Kasie Hunt earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And as I drove my cars a short distance from my hotel to city hall this morning, there are trees down everywhere.

And as you can see behind me, the roof is in tatters the winds from hurricane Milton shredding it. Notably, this is one of the bases of emergency operations for the response to this hurricane.You had emergency personnel that was sheltering there. You had resources that were stationed there. Fortunately, I can report that the immediate area around the park seems to be OK. We've seen widespread flooding across Pinellas County, where we are, neighboring Hillsborough County as well, but at least in this neighborhood, things appear to be fine. That doesn't mean that this area, by any means, is free from damage from hurricane Milton. We have seen downed trees. We have seen, as I noted before, widespread flooding. We try to access part of Pinellas County that was shut down. There were sheriff's deputies blocking off a bridge, and we spoke to one of them, who relayed that there had been power lines, a number of power lines that were down. They have been putting out the word local officials that folks should stay indoors, in large part because of the unseen dangers. This is a hurricane that swept through at night. It left at least about a foot of rain in Tampa, more in other areas. In Hillsborough County, there's about two to three feet of standing water in some parts. And there could be all kinds of danger that you don't necessarily know is there underneath water or underneath rubble and potentially property or trees that are on the verge, that are teetering and about to break off or about to fall that could pose serious risk. That's why officials are putting out the word that folks should stay at home until all the damage is surveyed, until they get a clearer picture of what they are seeing. Now we know that rescues, water rescues, are going on further south, in Clearwater, Florida, as well as in Hillsborough County. This is the eastern part of Hillsborough County. This is largely an agricultural area. A lot of migrant workers there. We know that a senior citizens facility had to be evacuated. Folks were getting rescued there. It is just starting to dawn on folks here the extent of the damage from hurricane Milton. So, there's still a lot of danger out there, and they want folks to heed the warnings and stay indoors, Omar.",

Don't flush the toilet right now, and once we get that berm around it, we'll pump the water out, and hopefully we can take that back. But you know, I'm seeing images from neighboring cities with roads completely washed out that you would never have expected.

You know, of course, we weren't getting hit, getting the direct hit that central west coast and that we have a lot of friends and family there, so my prayers are with them.But we were just telling people, look, we need to take this seriously. This is something that we probably haven't faced in quite some time. So, and I think a lot of people did heed those warnings. We did have a tree fall on a car that was driving out before a curfew went into place, and that video went viral. And so, it was a great reminder telling people, hey, you need to stay off the road. There's no reason to be on the road. And even though things have died down, trees could be, you know, on the verge of falling, limbs could be loose.

More now on our top story with Florida's first light comes the first assessment of damage from hurricane Milton.

You can see some of the winds taking pieces of trees, just the extent and the magnitude of the damage that came through here. Right now, we know Milton is moving off the Florida coast, but officials are quick to point out the storm is still a dangerous hurricane with winds of 85 miles per hour. You can see where it is right now. Florida, of course, had a rough night. Take a look at this video, the roof of this stadium, Tropicana Field, with the Tampa Bay Rays play mostly ripped away by Milton's high winds. There are no reports of injuries, thankfully, from Tropicana Field, but it had been turned into an emergency shelter for first responders. CNN's Meteorologist Derek Van Dam joins us now with the latest on the storm's track. Hi Derek, so the storm is passed, but the effects of it seem like they're going to be lingering for a bit.",

As a native Floridian, I've been through so many hurricanes, and so often there are avoidable deaths after the storm, and that's what Florida Governor Ron DeSantis was trying to put out there for folks to be careful, to be cautious, because too often after these storms, folks come outside, they see the sun, the wind has died down, the rain is gone, and they think everything is fine, and that is simply not the case.You noted the dangers. There are downed power lines. There's the potential for there to be bacteria and standing water. There's a potential for there to be debris that is teetering on the verge of falling, and that obviously poses risk. And then, of course, there is human error as well. We reported extensively in the past. In fact, the governor mentioned it, that after Hurricane Helene happened, folks have accidents with chainsaws. People put generators operating indoors, that's the kind of thing that could easily be prevented, and so they want to put the word out for folks to be very careful, to not get into a situation they do not need to be in, because already it's difficult for emergency crews in a situation like this. You had a storm that came through overnight. It dumped more than a foot of water in Tampa. That isn't the worst hard-hit area, but Tampa gets that amount of water in 4 to 6 months. You can imagine that in a single day, in a single night, effectively, that creates a ton of problems. Obviously, flooding is a principal concern. It traps folks, and right now, people are trying to get to people that have been stranded. I know of at least one assisted living facility in Hillsborough County, where there are ongoing water rescues. There is at least two to three feet of standing water there. When you have a storm come through at night, and as it passes and the day comes and the storm is gone, it's very easy for folks to get confident to go outside. But of course, we haven't been able to survey all of the damage. We try to get into an area of Pinellas County that was shut down. There were sheriff's deputies blocking off a bridge there. When we asked them why, they pointed out there were downed power lines in the area, and they didn't want anyone to get hurt. This is a very tenuous situation, and that's why officials continue putting out the word that folks should do their best to stay safe shelter in place, especially if they see damage outside Omar.",
