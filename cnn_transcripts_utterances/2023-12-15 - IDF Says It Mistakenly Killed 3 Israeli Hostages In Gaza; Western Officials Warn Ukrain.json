The Israel Defense Forces says that it accidentally shot and killed three Israeli hostages in northern Gaza who were mistakenly identified as a threat. Two of the victims identified were kidnapped from their kibbutz and - by Hamas on October 7th. This is what IDF Spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus told me just this last hour.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. JONATHAN CONRICUS, IDF SPOKESPERSON: We're looking into how it happened and how it came about that these hostages were out and trying to understand how that happened, whether it was intentional or by Hamas or whether it wasn't intentional. And what we have told our troops is to exercise extreme caution when being confronted with people in civilian clothes. Again, part of the complexity here is that we're fighting in a civilian environment where almost all of the RPG crews and the IED crews that have been attacking our tanks and our troops have been dressed in civilian clothes. So it creates a very dynamic and challenging combat environment. And what we have told our troops is to be extra vigilant and do one more safety check before dealing with kinetics, with any threat that they face on the battlefield. But it is a very challenging environment that our troops are in. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But what this also sheds light on is, of course, the U.S. concerns about how Israel is conducting its military operations in Gaza and the fact that, as Jake Sullivan said earlier today, effectively, Israel's intention may be to distinguish between Hamas militants and civilians in Gaza, but that the reality on the ground reflects something entirely different.We have seen that, of course, play out for weeks now as Israel's ground offensive has resulted in heavy civilian casualties, thousands of Palestinian civilians who have been killed in Gaza. And today, it appears that the way in which Israel is prosecuting its military campaign has now also resulted in Israeli civilian casualties, with these three Israeli hostages having been killed mistakenly by Israeli forces operating in an intense combat environment in Shuja'iyya.",

      "sentences": "We want to dig deeper now with former NATO Supreme Allied Commander, CNN Military Analyst Gen. Wesley Clark.General, thanks so much for sharing part of your afternoon with us. The IDF is still gathering information about this incident. I'm wondering what that process looks like during an active war in an area where there is open conflict and how soon the hostages' families might have answers? GEN. WESLEY CLARK, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, you've got to get the unit that was engaged offline, and you've got to talk to the troops and you've got to talk to the commander. You've got to find out exactly what happened and you've got to find out what instructions they were operating under. Probably goes all the way up to the chain of command. And it may take a few days. But just looking at it from the outside, based on what we know right now, you can imagine this is a group of men moving. Some of them are armed. The Israelis are under orders to engage and block these people, to take them out. And they didn't discriminate. They couldn't see. Maybe they weren't close enough. Maybe the hostages were held in the center of a group, who knows? You can't speculate on it with any precision at this point. But soldiers in contact are prone to shoot, because their lives are at risk. So if the guidance is look one more time before you shoot, I'm sure they're going to try to do it. But when you get right down to it and soldiers are in the heat of combat and the bullets are flying back and forth, the tendency is to pick a target and take it out. And unfortunately, that may be what happened here. But we won't know. This is all speculation, Boris.",

      "sentences": "All right. Thanks, Boris.Turning now to the war in Ukraine. CNN has new reporting that suggests Ukraine's fate may depend further on further aid from the U.S., aid which has been held up in Congress for weeks. Western officials say if the U.S. fails to greenlight the funds, the effect on Ukraine could be debilitating. President Biden already described that potential scenario as a Christmas gift for Russia's Vladimir Putin. Let's get straight to CNN's Nick Paton Walsh. Nick, tell us more about this warning and why this is so important. NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Look, I mean, the key is the timeline here. It's pretty clear at this point that Congress is not, unless some magical political sleight of hand occurs in the next few days, is not going to be able to pass any legislation that gets new bulk aid to Ukraine in January, maybe later in January when Congress is back. To add to that extraordinary difficulty, the European Union just last night was unable to pass a $55 billion aid tranche for Ukraine as well. That's two extraordinary blows financially for Ukraine and some Western officials have been doing an assessment as to exactly how long Ukraine might be able to hold out if no further aid was sent. Ukrainian officials themselves, in fact, have warned that doctors, first responders' salaries might come unstuck in January if aid doesn't keep flowing. Remember, so much of Ukraine's war effort underpinned by its NATO Western allies, Western officials saying that, look, \"There is no guarantee of success with us, but there is certain failure without us,\" essentially pointing out the fact that this financial support keeps the Ukrainian military machine moving. They have had an extraordinary influx of weaponry here, training, the ability to pay salaries, to wage a war against such a well-financed machine as Russia, even though the Russian military performed so badly initially. And look, this has been a disastrous week for Volodymyr Zelenskyy. I hate to say it. He traveled across the world, to Washington, hoping to change opinions that did not occur, a display of unity alongside President Biden. President Biden today tweeting, and I paraphrase, that the world is watching and it's important for them to see how they stick by Ukraine. But he can't get Congress, so far, it seems, to change their mind. And so we're looking now at the millions, the billions, slowly evaporating into next year. I was at the front lines over the past 10 days or so. It's palpable, the anger, the anxiety amongst Ukrainian frontline troops as to exactly how are they supposed to get through this bleak winter with a resurgent Russia pushing forward in multiple towns along the front lines without any United States aid. It's hard to tell precisely when it's going to run out, but we're already seeing units angry at the lack of equipment, ammunition that they have. I saw one combat medic we've known for a number of months last night. He said, look, without the aid, we are finished. And publicly, I think you see a more stoic Ukrainian military saying we'll fight on regardless because they have no choice. And frankly, as President Biden suggested, this is a moment Vladimir Putin has been waiting for. It is a Christmas gift. The Western unity was something of an outlier when it first emerged at the beginning of this war. It has now clearly eroded and we are dealing with a split Congress on this. No immediate signs of compromise there, and a European Union, where one member, Hungary, led by Viktor Orban, clearly a Putin sympathizer, is holding that money up. [15:15:02] The EU being very sunny in the disposition, saying, look, we'll revote in it again in January, and it indeed will get through. But the signal here to Ukraine is damaging to its morale. It says the West no longer has their back. We're in for a very difficult winter here, even if the money kept coming. Pam?",

CNN has learned that the intelligence relates to Russian election interference, information that was deemed so sensitive it could only be accessed at the CIA and the people working with the Intel had to keep their notes locked in a safe at CIA headquarters. Yet, in the final weeks of the Trump administration, a binder of this intel was brought to the White House at the request of the president, as part of an effort to declassify documents. And in the final chaotic hours of his presidency, it went missing.CNN's Katie Bo Lillis is part of the team that broke this story. Fascinating reporting here, Katie Bo, what can you tell us?",

And what we're talking about here is the underlying intelligence that formed the basis of the U.S. government's assessment that Vladimir Putin sought to help Trump win the 2016 election.The disappearance of this binder was so alarming to intelligence officials that they briefed Senate Intelligence Committee leadership about the situation last year. And we're also told by one U.S. official familiar with the matter that this was not among the classified items that were found in last year's search of Trump's Mar- A-Lago estate.

There is one theory that has emerged from testimony from Cassidy Hutchinson, the former top aide to former chief of staff Mark Meadows.She told the January 6th committee that she was \"almost positive it went home with Mr. Meadows.\" She said the binder had been kept in a safe in Meadows' office when it was not being worked on. And she also wrote about this in her new book, claiming that on January 19th, the final night of the Trump presidency, that she saw Meadows leave the White House with an unredacted binder \"tucked under his arm.\" Now, we should say here that Mark Meadows' attorney strongly denies this. He said in a statement: \"Mr. Meadows was keenly aware of and adhered to requirements for the proper handling of classified material, any such material that he handled or was in his possession has been treated accordingly and any suggestion that he is responsible for any missing binder or other classified information is flat wrong.\" So at this point, Pamela, the mystery of this missing binder remains just that, a big mystery.",

      "sentences": "Right. And as you know, our reporting is Mark Meadows' lawyer is denying he has it. It was not turned up at the search of Mar-A- Lago, according to a law enforcement official speaking to CNN. And sources told CNN the binder contained raw intelligence that the U.S. and its NATO allies collected on Russians and Russian agents. Tell us, what is raw intelligence and what kind of damage could documents like these do to U.S. National Security?Well, look, there's a reason why we take sources and methods in the national security community and put them in what's called compartments, where a very limited number of people are allowed to know how intelligence was collected in the first place. That's really what we call often the crown jewels of the intelligence community, how you got the information. Now, based on your reporting. The way that this information was handled would strongly suggest exactly that, that it had the details about how the intelligence related to 2016 election interference was obtained. That's the type of information that can get people killed if it's released publicly. It's the names of sources you use. It's the electronic means of surveillance that might have been exploited to try to collect information. It's other sensitive capabilities the intelligence community possesses, where it invests billions of dollars, time, effort and again, people risking their lives to obtain. So if someone were to have absconded with that, that is a federal crime for a reason. Because it not only could put those sources at risk, it can put ongoing operations run by the American intelligence community at grave risk and put American lives further down the field in danger. So this is a very serious concern, Pamela, and I think authorities are treating it as such.",
