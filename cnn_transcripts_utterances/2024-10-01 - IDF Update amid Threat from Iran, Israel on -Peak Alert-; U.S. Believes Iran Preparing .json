He said the IDF is prepared to attack Iran, launching -- if Iran launches a missile toward Israel, he says that that will have consequences. He said the IDF have plans and abilities. He said, though, that this is not an absolute defense. And so once again, addressed the public on their need to act responsibly. Welcome back to CONNECT THE WORLD. I'm Becky Anderson in Tel Aviv. Let's get you straight to our breaking news. And this coming in to CNN just in the past few minutes. A senior White House official says that the U.S. believes Iran is preparing to launch an imminent ballistic missile attack on Israel. It follows the beginnings of a ground offensive by Israel into a sovereign country, Lebanon. The White House says it is actively supporting defensive preparations to defend Israel against this potential attack. It adds that a direct military attack from Iran against Israel will carry severe consequences for Iran. This comes as Israel's military says intense fighting is taking place in southern Lebanon after it launched what it calls a limited ground operation against Hezbollah there. Our international diplomatic editor, Nic Robertson, is in Haifa in Israel. You have certainly been on the northern border earlier today,  Nic, and we heard from the IDF earlier. You listened into what we heard about why it is that they have launched this targeted and limited, as they call it, ground offensive. That was before we heard word from the U.S. that it is expecting an imminent ballistic missile attack from Iran on Israel in retaliation to the kind of wider operations, military operations that Israel is conducting at present. Your assessment of what we are seeing and hearing at this point?",

      "sentences": "Well, listen, this statement that we got this morning is a bit of a shock.Because, over the course of the last 24 to 48 hours, U.S. officials were obviously concerned about what Iran might do as retaliation for obviously, the major operations that Israel has been carrying out against Hezbollah. But we weren't hearing specifics surrounding it. Now the fact that a senior White House official is saying that there is the expectation of an imminent ballistic missile threat against Israel by Iran, that's incredibly noteworthy. That brings this to a different level than we have been feeling from U.S. officials, frankly, over the last 24-48 hours or so. I think it's also noteworthy that in this statement from the senior White House official, we hear them saying very clearly that, if Iran does go through with this and carries out attacks against Israel, there will be severe consequences for Iran. There is sense that perhaps a statement like this could deter Iran from going ahead with some planned operations; notably, the fact that this senior White House official is also saying that the United States is working with Israel to shore up its defenses, as Nic was talking about. When there was the last Iranian attack against Israel, a major attack back in April, the U.S. worked with its allies to really solidify and effectively defend Israel. And the U.S. is sending a clear message now that they are already engaged in preparations of the like potentially in this situation. So there's a lot of questions that we will be asking U.S. officials now, exactly what does that effort look like? We heard this morning from the secretary of state. He was here. This was before the statement came out. But he did say that the United States stands with Israel and Israel's defense, even though overnight, of course, there was the ground operation. Even though Israel is calling it a limited incursion into Lebanon, that the U.S. had been warning against, that has not shaken the resolve of Biden administration officials to, even this morning, despite that action by Israel, to say that they could continue to stand by Israel's defense. That is likely informed by the fact that they are tracking this potentially imminent threat coming in from Iran right now. So we're really working to learn more in terms of the magnitude of this potential threat from Iran.",

      "sentences": "You'll recall, after that attempted Iranian strike on Israel, the United States try to restrain, told Israel not to respond in a massive wayto avoid things going out of control. And I don't recall precisely what the Israelis hit. But it appeared to be something of no significance whatsoever. So at the time in April, the danger of sort of this war broadening to involve Iran and Israel on an ongoing basis was the verdict. The question is, now, with, as I said, the United States, its diplomacy is basically in neutral and the White House seems to be empty, is the United States going to be able to or willing to be able to exercise the kind of pressure it did back in April to stop the Israelis from massively retaliating for those Iranian strikes? That's the question. And certainly what we've seen, particularly in regards to Lebanon over the last two weeks, where the Biden administration came out with this proposal, ceasefire proposal, that they had crafted with France, that we're told the Israelis actually signed onto. But then we heard Benjamin Netanyahu at the U.N., United Nations General Assembly, during his speech, not once mentioning a ceasefire. And within the hour, apparently authorizing the strike that killed Hassan Nasrallah, which only made the situation here in Lebanon even more volatile. And since then, we've seen a week or now seven days of Israeli strikes and now overnight these limited raids, as the Israelis call them. So the situation has clearly indicated the last few months is that the United States is just absolutely timid when it comes to pressuring its key ally in the Middle East, that it provides all the weapons it needs to conduct all of these military operations. It just doesn't seem willing to put it -- put  the U.S. foot on the brake and bring this situation, at least to a temporary pause. It just isn't happening.",

The precise target or the damage isn't -- it's still very early although, in the immediate aftermath of those explosions, we did hear ambulances seeming to rush to that area. That comes after, just after midnight, there was series of other strikes as well. Some of them relatively close to Beirut International Airport. Nonetheless, a few minutes later, we saw a plane land there. So this is just a continuation of what we've seen since Monday before last, 7-8 days ago, when there was that first day of Israeli shock and awe with more than 500 people being killed in that day. Now the southern suburbs at this point, it's worth stressing, are largely abandoned because of these strikes and warnings. There were warnings also last night about an hour and 40 minutes before those strikes. The Arabic spokesman for the Israeli military came out and gave a warning to just three very large neighborhoods in southern Beirut. And then just 20 minutes before the first strike, specified three individual buildings. So there's an angle of psychological warfare going on here, where entire neighborhoods are essentially told to evacuate, not only the last minute, that the Israelis get a little more specific, but definitely the southern suburbs have been battered over the last eight days; battered yet again in the last 25 minutes, Becky.",

IDF rear admiral Daniel Hagari, who is the spokesman for the IDF, says Israel is on peak alert. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REAR ADMIRAL DANIEL HAGARI, IDF SPOKESPERSON (through translator):  As of this moment, we do not identify any aerial threat launched from Iran.

And you heard Daniel Hagari, the IDF spokesperson, urging Israelis to follow instructions, to stay safe, describing the country in a state of peak alert. He said that the IDF is prepared to attack Iran if it launches a missile toward Israel. It will have consequences. We have plans and abilities, he said. So let's start with what we understand here, that the U.S. has learned of an imminent attack by Iran on Israel, similar, we are told, to the attack, the response back in April, which was some more than 300 missiles targeted at Israel, albeit intercepted at the time. Cedric, with your military brain, let's just get your thoughts are on what we are breaking as news here. COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Yes, Becky. Well, one of the key things about this is this is what we call in the intelligence business an indications and warning problem. So what that really means is the ability for the U.S. and Israel to determine what the Iranians might be doing. So what we've seen now is the launch preparations, it looks like, based on what the White House statements are. So with those launch preparations, then the calculations can be made. Will Iranians do this? It seems like they are doing, getting ready to do this. How long will it take for the missiles and rockets to come into Israel. And from where would they come? That then will set things in motion so that the defensive mechanisms that we know colloquially as the Iron Dome but which really include three different systems that the Israelis have, that those three systems, the Iron Dome, David's Sling and the Arrow system, that they are ready to go. And those systems are then augmented by U.S. and other assets in the region. So the hope on the U.S. and Israeli side is that all these systems will work basically like they  did in April, that they would actually thwart, for all intents and purposes, the major attacks that Iran is planning. So whether this is a symbolic effort by the Iranians or an actual military effort by the Iranians, we have to consider it as if it's a military effort that they're actually going to strike at targets in Israel. And that's why it would have to be considered in that way.",

      "sentences": "Well, just to take this week, we've got a mixed reaction from the Bush -- from the Biden administrationin that you heard from President Biden in the past 24 hours, saying that a ceasefire with Hezbollah was the preferred option. Not this continuing ground incursion by Israel into the Lebanese border area. But earlier this week, you had a readout of a phone call between the Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin and Israel's defense minister, in which Austin said he understood Israel's need for this operation to take apart the infrastructure that is being used by Hezbollah to attack. And that includes hundreds of miles of tunnels in this border area, in which Israel believes that there are some 100,000 of the 150,000 missiles and rockets remaining that it hasn't been able to destroy yet because they're simply buried too deep in hard rock earth. And the only way to track all these missiles down is to track and map the tunnel network. That's why you've got to go in on the ground to dismantle and destroy it. The problem is, last time, as Cedric was saying, last time the missiles were launched by Iran, it was just from Iran to Israel. None of the Hezbollah ballistic missiles were also included. They're much closer; there's less warning, there's less time to get all of those aerial defenses coordinated to respond and knock those missiles out of the sky. And the Iranian missiles that Hezbollah has stationed north of Israel, they can reach every major populated Israeli area in a matter of minutes; whereas, you know, the last time in the spring when Iran attacked, it was aiming at things like military bases, government buildings. This time it might go for populated areas and that is when you get into the escalation spiral.",

      "sentences": "Well, Becky, with the exception of the April attacks,Iran has operated short of a war in the region, leveraging its allies in the region against Israel. But contrary to what happened previously, when Hamashi (ph) was assassinated in Tehran or Iran's embassy in Syria was targeted, this time, we are not hearing that much of warning or threats about a retaliation against Israel. And this is quite telling. And some might speculate that this could be meaning that Iran might be prepared to do something. But there are no clear substantial signs for this as Iran sees this part of a long battle where a -- an isolated measure would not carry that much significance. This is something that Iran's top security chief said today. This means that this is part of a broader conflict in the region, to be seen in a broader perspective. And Iran, despite the tactical gains for Israel, we have to yet wait to see that these translate into a strategic military and political victory. A victory for Israel could be stopping Hezbollah attacks and returning those residents to the northern parts as well as decoupling Lebanon fronts from Gaza. When this happens, I think this can translate into victory for Israel. But we have to yet wait for this. This has not happened so far. And Iran didn't respond previous time to the Ismail Haniyeh assassination because it was promised a ceasefire in exchange for no response. But this didn't happen. This resulted in Israel assassinating Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah. This might somehow provoke Iran in order to revive the deterrence to do something unless this could be a kind of invitation for further attacks in future.",

And you're right to point out that that was on the back of a promise of a ceasefire -- or at least negotiations and a window for a ceasefire. Look, that does seem, both on the Lebanon story and on the Gaza file, a long way away at this point. But if Iran does respond at this point, it knows that it will be ratcheting up a wider regional conflict here and there will be a counter response, likely from Israel. What would that look like? And how concerned are those making decisions in Tehran about ratcheting up a wider conflict at this point and the impact that could have, for example, on nuclear installations in Iran and on the country as a whole?",

But noresponse will carry further risks and bigger ones. There have been calls on Iran in order to exercise restraint. This has been coming from the regional countries as well as international organizations. Tehran, you know, exercised this once. The Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran in exchange for a ceasefire in Gaza. But the results turned out to be a further escalation by Israel. And the calculus is also that, if Iran stops it here, even if it shows restraint, this will further embolden Israel in order to not to limit the war into Lebanon but in order to target other sites in other regional countries. Or even maybe to conduct some operations against some sites in Iran. So in order to stop that cycle, Tehran thinks that it needs to do something in order to revive that dynamic or the deterrence, which the both sides are pushing to the limit in order to redefine those rules of engagement and the deterrence. So Iran thinks that, in order to somehow reestablish that, you know, relative, let's say, the escalation or at least stability, it needs to do something in order to stop Israel.",
