This has the potential to paralyze the city, paralyze the infrastructure.If we go back to 2014, there was a similar lake effect snow event in Buffalo. There were fatalities associated with that. Just by buildings collapsing under the sheer weight of the snow. We're not going to measure this in inches, this is going to be measured and snow and multiple feet of it. You can see the snow, it's going to blanket the Great Lakes, Michigan to western New York. I'm going to focus in on this area because this is where we anticipate the heaviest snow. That's where we have the lake-effect snow warnings. Ewen County is located right here, just downwind of Lake Erie near Buffalo. And that is currently where the driving ban is located and the state of emergency as well. What I found very interesting -- this is the current radar. So, this is actually happening right now. There's the most intense lake-effect snow band. It is over 200 miles long, but it is only 10 miles in diameter. And that is why this forecast is so important. Where that wind direction takes the band of snow will determine who sees the heaviest of snowfall in the coming hours. Currently it's located just south of the downtown Buffalo region. This is the South Towns area and they're getting 2 to 3 inches per hour as we speak and it is piling up quickly. You'll see some of the snowfall totals in just one moment. We've already clocked in two feet of snow, this is an unofficial report in the Williamstown region. But it is the direction of the wind that I'm going to continue to harp on because that is what matters. It is a game of miles with this particular forecast because at the moment we have a west/southwesterly wind I'll tell you why that is taking that band of heavy snow just south of the downtown Buffalo region. You can see we've drawn on that diagram. That is a west southwesterly wind. That puts the heaviest snow south of the city. But as the wind changes direction from more of a southwesterly wind it creates more of a fetch or a longer duration over the open waters that are very warm over Lake Erie. So, more moisture means more snow accumulating with the southwesterly wind over the Buffalo area. Let me take you to the outer edges of Lake Erie and show you what it looks like right now. This is the overnight period in a town that's actually in the suburbs of northern Buffalo. You can see the snow flying, the waves whipping. That just gives you an indication of how intense the snow bands are really across an area. Max, by the time it's all said and done we could be seeing up to 4 to 5 feet. Potentially historic snowfalls for this area.",

But at the 11th hour interest decided to weigh in delivering its opinion to a federal court that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman -- better known as MBS -- should be granted immunity for his role in killing Jamal Khashoggi back in 2018.Now a short time ago we heard from Khashoggi's fiancee Hatice Cengiz. She tweeted her response. She said: The United States State Department has granted immunity to MBS. It wasn't a decision everyone expected. We thought maybe there would be a light to justice from the U.S.A. but, again, money came first. This is a world that Jamal doesn't know about and me. She went on to tweet: Biden saved the murderer by granting immunity. He saved the criminal and got involved in the crime himself. Let's see who will save you in the hereafter? She tweeted this final tweet: Jamaal died again today. Now Khashoggi's fiancee and human rights group filed a civil lawsuit in a Washington court back in 2020 against MBS and 28 others involved. As you said, Max, U.S. intelligence concluded that the Crown Prince ordered the murder of Khashoggi. He was a \"Washington Post\" journalist and an outspoken critic of MBS. Now the State Department just before midnight issued this court filing saying that MBS now has, quote, sovereign immunity after his father, King Salman recently made his son Prime Minister. It's based on, quote, long-standing and well established principles of common-law and its recommendation is purely a legal determination. It did however condemn the murder as heinous. Now the Crown Prince is currently attending the APEC Summit in Thailand. He arrived late last night, was warmly greeted by the Thai Prime Minister. We have yet to hear from him or from any world leader for that matter. And, Max, I think it's important to note that, you know, President Biden, he was in Saudi Arabia back in July trying to convince MBS and the Kingdom to undo a series of oil production cuts. Saudi Arabia to date has refused to do that, nor has it improved its human rights record leaving many confused as to why the Biden administration would then recommend immunity for MBS -- Max.",

As so, they actually had an opportunity within the last couple of hours to hold an emergency meeting and discuss what needs to be done here.But the reality is, Max, there's very little that actually they can do because North Korea is flagrantly defying these U.N. Security Council resolutions, every time they launch a ballistic missile. They've launched around 50 this year and they don't really care to be frank. Because they're not engaged in diplomacy with the West at the moment. China and Russia's response is muted and neutral at best so they're not really concerned about any sort of harsh blowback from this. Even though the U.S. VP Kamala Harris, you know, along with the other world leaders that she met with -- six in total -- they did issue a statement strongly condemning this launch. But at the U.N. China and Russia have permanent veto power and they haven't been able to, you know, step up the sanctions regime successfully yet. They haven't even be able to get a coordinated joint statement from the entire U.N. Security Council because China and Russia won't sign it. And so, this is the -- this is the situation that Kim finds himself in. He's essentially insulated from any serious consequences, so he's been launching missiles this year at a truly unprecedented pace. When you talk about 34 missile launch events that in and of itself is a huge number. But when you consider that on some of those days there were literally dozens of missiles launched. You had around 80 missiles in total launched over the period of just a few days, a matter of weeks ago. And this is when the U.S. and South Korea joint military drills were happening. And so, we expect really, frankly, to just see more of the same. The same kind of cycle repeating.

We saw representatives from Morocco, a very vocal Tunisian crowd, the Argentina fans, we saw a few England fans. What we don't know as yet with still a couple of days out from the tournament, now how many of these are local fans who have been here. A large African diaspora contingents of course based here in Qatar already. But the number that is being touted about is 1.2 million people expected to descend on Doha over the next five weeks. Just to put that into context, this is a country with a population of 2.3 million. So, half of the population arriving again and that is one of the big question marks for the organizers. The stress testing ahead of this tournament hasn't been able to take place up to this point because of the impact of COVID-19. A lot of the usual events have been canceled. It is a Friday so the weekend's here which is why the souk behind us at the moment is very, very quiet but the atmosphere in the souk and around last night was fantastic.

We're sitting outside in Brazil in 2014 because of the controversies around the build up to this tournament. But has been there since that now infamous day in December in 2010, in Zurich when Sepp Blatter called out Qatar's name so controversially from that envelope giving the Middle East their first ever World Cup. And what we've seen from the teams, from the journalists, those conversations around the issues of human rights, LGBTQ+ communities, workers' rights.
