Imagine for a moment that the January 6 mob here in the United States had not only breached the Capitol but also the White House and the Supreme Court building. That's exactly what happened in Brazil Sunday. An insurrection that ended with the arrest of at least 400 people left the main public buildings in the country inoperable and deepened a political crisis that has been brewing for months. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROMO (voice over): Brazil boiling over. Supporters of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro storm key buildings in the country's Capitol Sunday breaching security barriers and temporarily occupying the country's congress, presidential palace and Supreme Court. Masses of protesters flooded the country seat of power. Many dressed in the colors of Brazil's flag yellow and green, fueled by anger and distrust over Bolsonaro's defeat in a runoff election last October where he lost by less than two percentage points to current President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Protesters threw objects and scaled the roofs of buildings while clashing with police who responded with tear gas. At least one protester was seeing sitting at the desk of Brazil's congress president. CNN Brazil reports the floor of the congress building was flooded after the sprinkler system activated when protesters attempted to set fire to the carpet. By evening police began dispersing the rioters from buildings and arrested hundreds of people who were detained in buses before being taken to the police station. President Lula da Silva, who was inaugurated just a week ago describe the events as barbaric and vowed to punish the people responsible. LUIZ INACIO LULA DA SILVA, PRESIDENT OF BRAZIL (through translator): Those people that we call facets, we call them everything that's abominable in politics. They invaded the government headquarters. Then they invaded the congress like vandals destroying everything in their path.",
