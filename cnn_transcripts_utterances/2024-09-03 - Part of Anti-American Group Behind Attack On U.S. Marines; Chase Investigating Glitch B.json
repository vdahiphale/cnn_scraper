      "sentences": "Yes, Boris, Brianna, this is such a bizarre story. So over the weekend, there were these viral videos spreading of people celebrating outside of Chase banks, throwing cash up in the air, even putting Chase cards into their mouth, all because they thought they hit the jackpot.Well, what seems to have happened is they stumbled upon a temporary loophole. So what people did was they started cashing -- they started depositing checks for obscene amounts of money, apparently bad checks. And next they would withdraw large amounts of money, but smaller than those checks were. And then they got cash and they celebrated. But what Chase says is that they have been able to quickly fix this issue. And, in some cases, they were actually able to claw back some of the money. And so some of the people on social media in these TikTok videos, they've actually displayed negative balances. And one user had an ATM error on his account. And it said a negative $40,000 in charges. Now, Chase is warning people that this is one social media trend that you do not want to follow. The bank says in a statement, \"We are aware of this incident and it has been addressed. Regardless of what you see online, depositing a fraudulent check and withdrawing funds from your account is fraud, plain and simple.\" But obviously, this situation raises a lot of questions about how this was able to happen in the first place. Why didn't Chase know that these were bad checks? And how were people able to cash them? Now, a person familiar with the matter tells CNN that this incident occurred on Friday and was quickly addressed. The source said that Chase is still investigating, though, how this happened. And the bank doesn't know at this point exactly how many customers were involved or even how much money was involved. Chase is not commenting on whether or not regulators are investigating. Neither the need of the Federal Reserve nor the Comptroller of the Currency would comment to CNN on this. But, Brianna and Boris, you've got to imagine regulators are going to be determined to get to the bottom of exactly what happened and to prevent it from happening again.",
