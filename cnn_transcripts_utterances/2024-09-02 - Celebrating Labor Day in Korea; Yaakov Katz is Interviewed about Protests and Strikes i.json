So, we've got to take the good with the bad, right?So, if you're looking for a perfect Monday Labor Day extended holiday weekend forecast weather, you've got to travel to the northeast or you have to be located in the northeast or the Midwest. The places for thunderstorms today, Miami, central Texas, and a few pop-up thunderstorms across the interior west. But the bigger story here is the below average temperatures that are dominating much of the eastern two-thirds of the country. This is going to continue right into the first parts of the workweek as everyone returns home from Labor Day weekend. Blow average temperatures for places like New York City, the nation's capital, all the way to Atlanta as well, staying below average temperatures should be near 80 degrees for New York City. It will top in the middle to upper 70s. Here's a look at the forecast for many of the locations along the East Coast. Things are looking pretty, pretty temperate. And over the West Coast, the same cannot be said because we're starting to warm things up. A big September heat wave will lead to red flag fire conditions across parts of Idaho, into Montana, into Utah. The chance of showers and thunderstorms that could produce another two to four inches exists across central Texas today. That could bring a potential of some localized flooding as well. Otherwise, not too bad for your Monday. Enjoy. Jessica.",

And I think that really - what we have to ask ourselves is, how did Israel let these people down? They had been held in that tunnel and in Hamas captivity for 11 months. There had been rounds and rounds of negotiations. This was something that was tangible. We had the opportunity to potentially get to them. They were alive until just a few days ago, the autopsies tell us. How come we fail to get them?And I think that there, it's a political question. Now, of course, it takes two to tango.

People wanted to give this - this process an opportunity, a chance. They wanted to give those rounds of talks a chance to succeed.But now that six bodies have been pulled out of a tunnel, now we're going to launch protests? Now the labor union is going to strike. By the way, their strike is soon also coming to an end. They've been told by the court that they have to cut it short. So really, is this going to be the pressure that's going to push Netanyahu over the political edge to the point that he's going to be finally willing to risk the future of his coalition and make a deal that would bring back the remaining hostages? Let's remember, Jessica, there still are 100 people who are being held by Hamas. Some of them alive, and some of them sadly and tragically already dead. We owe it to these people to bring them back home to their families and to their country. So, I'm not exactly sure that this is what's going to take it. And I think that we also can't diminish from real dilemma that Netanyahu and his government face, right? If Israel pulls out of Gaza, ends the war now, Hamas is still there. They would reconstitute themselves. They would again, in just a matter of time, be capable of another October 7th. So, this is a very careful balancing act. I don't envy the prime minister. But I do think is that he did let down the people of Israel with what happened this past weekend.",

And he's had some success at that. And that is very key in key states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and especially Michigan. But he does need to run up his numbers among people who don't have college degrees, in part because Republicans under Trump have lost the college - lost a lot of the people who do have college degrees. And so that's part of the divide and the political reorientation that we're seeing under the Trump era. And he does need to keep his margin down, while also not completely ceding ground on the college educated vote.
