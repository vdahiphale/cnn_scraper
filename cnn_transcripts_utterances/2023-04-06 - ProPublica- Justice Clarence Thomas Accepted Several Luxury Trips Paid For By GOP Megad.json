According to ProPublica, Clarence Thomas and his wife Ginni, a conservative activist, have gone on many luxury trips, involving private planes and super yachts. But they didn't pay for those.No, this travel was bankrolled by a GOP megadonor. My panel is here with me ready to dive into this. We have the host of the Fast Politics Podcast, Molly Jong-Fast; John Hart, former Communications Director for Senator Tom Coburn; and a Emma Goldberg, Business Reporter for the New York Times; and Nicholas Carlson, Global Editor-in-Chief of Insider. But first, let's bring in CNN Tom Foreman to break down this explosive ProPublica report, Tom?",

      "sentences": "Hey, Alisyn. The revelations in this ProPublica report are really quite astonishing about Justice Clarence Thomas, his wife, Ginni, and Harlan Crow. He is a Texas real estate tycoon, worth a lot of money, big donator to conservative causes.So what went on here? A lot of travel paid for by Crow and enjoyed by the Justice and his wife, according to this report from ProPublica. To where? Indonesia, New Zealand, California, Georgia, Texas. The reporter behind this said, some sort of travel, some sort of perks should be happening almost every year for 20 years. Among the other perks, yes, travel on board a super yacht, where they had full amenities. On board a private jet. A $19,000 Bible that was gifted to Thomas by Crow. It belonged to Frederick Douglass, the famed abolitionist. And time at private resorts as well. All of this free to the Justice and his wife, according to this report, paid for by Crow. Who else might be along on some of these trips? Well, executives at Verizon and PricewaterhouseCoopers, the big business people, major Republican donors as well, a leader of the American Enterprise Institute and notable think tank groups who are up here in town on conservative issues and a former counsel to the former Vice President Mike Pence, among others. Now Crow, the man with the money for all of this says, look, there's nothing going on here. This is simply friendship. He's known them for a long, long time. Justice Thomas and Ginni never asked for any of this hospitality, never asked about a pending or lower court case. And Justice Thomas has never discussed one. So - but he's saying, these are just friends getting together, has nothing to do with politics. Certainly nothing to do with the court. But this is all a gathering time and again, of conservative decision makers, people pushing conservative agendas, and having very close access, according to this report, to the Justice and his wife, with them not paying the bill for anything, but his rich conservative paying the bill all the way.

And I think it's worth stating upfront, there is no historical precedent for the amount and the frequency of the kind of flouting of legal ethics here.And I mean, the Supreme Court is a body of nine people who are tasked with being our kind of ethical police, our arbiters of legal standards in this country. And so I think that the fact that one of the members of that body considered himself above his own legal standards. And that, that is also someone who has a track record of, you know, refusing to recuse himself from potential conflicts of interest, I think all of that is something that raises a lot of questions, and just alarm bells.",

And they have a serious problem of they - you know, New York has as many or more homeless people in its city. But five 5 percent of the homeless people are on the street. In San Francisco, it's 50 percent of the people who are homeless are on the street. That's 4,000 people. So you're in San Francisco, there are people shouting on the street to who knows who.
