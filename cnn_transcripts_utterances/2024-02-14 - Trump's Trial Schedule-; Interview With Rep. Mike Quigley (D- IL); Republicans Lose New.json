They spent about $15 million to win a seat that President Biden won by eight points. They won it by less than eight points. Their candidate ran like a Republican. He sounded like a Republican talking about the border and immigration, because everybody knows that's the top issue. That is in no way a bellwether of what's going to happen this fall.

Earlier today, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said that it's time for House Speaker Mike Johnson to put up a vote, to show some leadership, and be up to the moment. And, yesterday, President Biden had a pretty stark warning for Republicans as they right now are not planning to vote on this measure. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

You also have Republicans who are suggesting that they could rewrite portions of the foreign aid bill. But what's also been interesting to note in the last 24 hours is President Biden's ramped-up rhetoric against former President Donald Trump, specifically his suggestions relating to encouraging Russia to do whatever it wants to countries that do not meet their NATO obligations. The president in the past week has really leaned into trying to paint the Republican Party as beholden to Trump, not just on Ukraine aid, but also on the border and immigration, something we saw play out last night in that New York special election. The president has made clear that he plans to make that case day in and day out heading into November's election, hoping voters will take notice.",

He somehow suggested that the win by Tom Suozzi was a sign of weakness. What do you make of his assessment? REP. MIKE QUIGLEY (D-IL):  Yes, that's what people say when they lose. It's whatever it takes to not be too embarrassed. I think you have to look beyond just that special election to the recent elections in Ohio and Wisconsin. I think the fact that the economy is very strong and the fact that, when choice is on the ballot, Democrats win all will add to this. And I do think the fact that Speaker Johnson shot down the opportunities to address the issue he said was so important, we had opportunities. The secretary and the president have asked for thousands of more border guards and changes in asylum policy, only, I think, under orders from candidate Trump that Speaker Johnson shot down.",

So I think you give them credit. But as we remember, it's the economy, stupid, right? That was the line we always learned from.

But I do recognize, when there was a stand-alone provision on Ukraine, it passed overwhelmingly. And we recognize that Israel is our staunchest ally in the Middle East. It is the only democratic -- democracy in the region. And there is extraordinary amounts of humanitarian aid for those in Gaza.
