There were no life-threatening injuries. But the scene here was frantic last night as this all unfolded around 9:30. Look, this is homecoming week. It is supposed to be a joyous time at Morgan State. Students were just coming out of a huge event that crowned Mr. And Miss Morgan State University. It was a big event that draws alum, families. And that is when shots rang out, outside of a campus building. Police on patrol in the area raced in, they found those wounded students. And that is when the frantic search, the urgent search for a shooter unfolded. A SWAT team coming through buildings, going room to room searching as students were told to shelter in place for hours. Although that search at this hour has turned up very little. And it is a quiet morning here on the campus. Classes are canceled. As an emergency meeting is taking place in the coming hours, they'll discuss how to proceed with homecoming week. But, look, this is a somber day as well because it is the third straight homecoming here at Morgan State that has been marred by violence, by a shooting. The past two years, shootings at each -- injured one person. This one now injuring five people. Here's what Baltimore's mayor told us last night as this was unfolding. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR BRENDON SCOTT (D), BALTIMORE: We are dealing with, not just here in Baltimore, not just at Morgan State University, but across this country of the United States, an epidemic when it comes guns and gun violence. We have to stop saying not one more. We need action now. When is enough going to be enough? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Today's focus being providing further student debt relief. About $9 billion of additional debt relief that's being approved today.But the White House has walked a very fine line when it comes to commenting on the actual events relating to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and this future speaker's race. The White House, last night, released a statement saying that they urged the House to act quickly to elect a new speaker as there are many challenges that this country is still facing. But we will see if President Biden himself, when he's in front of reporters, might have any further thoughts to add. If you think back to when the House was going round for round with votes back in January, he said that that was a moment that was embarrassing for the country. But it comes as allies to the president argue that this highlights, this sticking to the business as usual, trying to project this calm, it really highlights the contrast that the president has been trying to push during the campaign with some of the dysfunction that's occurring up on Capitol Hill. You've seen the White House trying to push that messaging amid the government funding fight as well. But there are also some - a few challenges that are facing this White House with the election of a new speaker. They need to get the government funded in the next six weeks. There is also the issue of Ukraine aid. The White House has been stressing that they believe Ukraine aid can get the support up on Capitol Hill. But it's unclear who the next speaker will be and how they might try to decide to approach that matter. But it will be an interesting task for the president as he will soon have to face the reality of working with a new speaker on the House. Of course, he had just built up a relationship with McCarthy since he came in office and now he's going to be confronting a new reality as the House Republicans are grappling with finding their speaker.",

Right now the power is with the guy -- the king maker is the guy who can get the attention. And the attention economy that makes sense, but that's not so great for governing.
