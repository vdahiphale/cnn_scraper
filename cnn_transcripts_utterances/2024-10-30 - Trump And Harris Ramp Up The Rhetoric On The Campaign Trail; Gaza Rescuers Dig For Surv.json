And as she did so, she compared each of those to the priorities of former President Donald Trump, essentially casting him as consumed by revenge or in the case of the military, as someone disrespectful to the military service. Now, the vice president did, of course, spend some time talking about January 6th, that speech back in January 6th of 2021 by former President Donald Trump, leading to supporters storming the U.S. Capitol. Now, she talked about, again, the former president being focused on what she called, quote, the enemies list versus her to do list for Americans. And what was telling about the remarks was how much time she was spending introducing and reintroducing herself, at one point saying that many of those that were watching may not know her well yet, a recognition of her truncated campaign, but also her explaining that she has not spent all time -- all of her political career in Washington, calling back to her time also in California. And to that end, the vice president saying that she would welcome other opinions and include those who disagree with her at what she called a seat at the table. [01:05:00] So, again, the vice president, her team seeing these remarks as the kickstart to the home stretch of the election, as she again tries to peel off those Republican voters of former President Donald Trump, but also convince those that the campaign believes still needs some convincing.

Well, what we know is that location absolutely pounded home one of themes the Harris campaign has sounded in recent days, about the importance of democracy and about the threat that Trump's character presents to democracy. She's been emphasizing how former members of his own administration have come out and said that he's a fascist or similar to a fascist.But what we know from polls and from research is that for undecided voters, those things aren't really as compelling. So for some highly engaged Democrats and others, that theme of protecting democracy is a priority. But for the voters who Harris might not otherwise get, those undecided voters, the independents, the younger voters, people who are less politically engaged, that's really not what resonates most. We know that what resonates most with them is a clear communication of what her economic policies and economic priorities are. And so, you know, I think what we saw tonight was Harris using the setting to reinforce the points that she was making about the value of democracy, about unity, about moving the nation forward. But she used the text of her speech to also make sure she hit those points about making home ownership affordable, bringing down prices and protecting Medicare, protecting Social Security. So, again, those core economic policy issues that we know are actually what are most likely to make the difference for that independent voter, that undecided voter who hasn't yet made up their mind to support her.",

Gaza's Health Ministry says at least 93 people, including 25 children, were killed in Beit Lahia on Tuesday. A warning images from the scene are disturbing.The Israeli military says it's trying to understand why so many people were in the city at the time of the strike as civilians had been ordered to evacuate several weeks ago. The U.S. State Department is calling the incident horrifying. It's also calling the new Israeli law banning the U.N. Agency for Palestinians deeply troubling. CNN's Jeremy Diamond has the latest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): These men aren't looking for survivors, amid the rubble of another Israeli airstrike they are here for the bodies. After all, how could anyone survive destruction on this scale? More than 90 people were killed in this Israeli strike in northern Gaza early Tuesday morning, including 25 children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. An Israeli military spokesman said the military was targeting a suspected terrorist in the area and did not intend to collapse the building. But the bodies have not yet all been counted, as this man can attest. Here's a body and here's another and another, he says, pointing out their locations. And then there are the bodies of this boy's uncle and cousin wedged between two thick slabs of concrete, a pair of feet is all that is visible. Gaza's rescue workers cannot reach this part of northern Gaza, which has been besieged by the Israeli military for nearly a month. That means no heavy machinery, just bare hands sifting through the rubble. Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya is one of just two doctors here, and he's growing desperate, calling for a humanitarian corridor to bring surgical teams to his hospital. There are children with bones protruding from their bodies needing orthopedic surgery. There are brain injuries that require neurosurgeons, he says. But Israel's parliament may make matters worse. In an overwhelming vote, Israeli lawmakers move to ban UNRWA, the main U.N. agency aiding Palestinians, from operating in Israel or engaging with Israeli officials. Israel accuses UNRWA of ties to Hamas after linking a handful of its thousands of employees to the October 7 attacks, a blanket charge UNWRA vehemently denies. It's a move the U.S. says could not come at a worse time. JAKE SULLIVAN, SPOKESPERSON, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT: There's nobody that can replace them right now in the middle of the crisis. So, we continue to urge the government of Israel to pause the implementation of this legislation. DJAMOND (voice-over): In Gaza, that urgency is all too real. If UNWRA is gone, who is going to feed us? Who will provide us security? This young man asks, who is going to take us in? Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Jerusalem. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Everything has a certain factor, is it a wind, is it a surge? is it a flood. We know the one that moved through the Philippines didn't have much wind, but it certainly had flooding just last week. So this is what we're seeing here as the wind and the surge will probably be equal to or not even greater than the flooding potential here. An awful lot of wind damage here, many spots here, all the way even into China are going to see tropical cyclone winds somewhere, maybe even over 100 kilometers per hour and then on up toward Kyushu. Now Taiwan is no stranger to these big things. Since 1950 there had been 30 Taiwan landfalls of what's an equivalent of a category 4 or 5 Atlantic hurricane.

But this year we've already had two and really another, but Krathon and also Gaemi has already taken its toll there in damage across the eastern parts of Taiwan. There's going to be more.
