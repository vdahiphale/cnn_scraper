One missile seen here hitting a reservoir and hydroelectric plant near Kyiv, the capital. Nationwide rolling blackouts are in effect. According to Ukraine's Air Force Commander, Russia launched at least 127 missiles and 109 drones. 15 provinces came under attack. The Russian Defense Ministry says among the targets were storage sites for Western supplied weapons. Within hours of the deadly Russian airstrikes, the Ukrainian president announced there will be a response, and once again, Vladimir Zelenskyy is calling on the Biden administration to lift restrictions which prevent those weapons being used to strike deep inside Russia. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ZELENSKYY (through translator): Every leader, every partner of ours, knows what strong decisions are needed to end this war and to end it justly, there should be no restrictions on the range of weapons for Ukraine, while terrorists have no such restrictions. Defenders of life should face no restrictions on weapons, while Russia uses all kinds of its own weapons, as well as Shaheed drones and ballistic missiles from North Korea, the United States, the United Kingdom, France and other partners have the power to help us stop terror.

The aim being to essentially bring down the power grid so that the Ukrainian people had no power, and thus no heat during the winter.The aim was to demoralize the Ukrainian people and break their will. That didn't work. Looks like the Russians are trying the same thing again. But of course, they now have additional missile capabilities, with North Koreans providing ballistic missiles, the Iranians providing ballistic missiles and cruise missiles. So these attacks are being stepped up, and it's a question of how long can the Russians keep this up, versus how long can Ukraine's critical infrastructure withstand these attacks? I think what needs to happen is for the U.S. and its allies to step up deliveries of air defense and missile defense capabilities to reduce the effectiveness of these attacks.",

I mean, that is the logistics involved here.

If you have the return of President Trump to the Oval Office, then suddenly the strategic picture changes for Putin, because he has a U.S. president that is more likely to impose a some sort of negotiated ceasefire on the Ukrainians, withdraw military aid to the Ukrainians, and that negotiated ceasefire would then benefit Russia. So that would then give Putin the opportunity to actually achieve some sort of victory without necessarily going down the path of mobilization.And then, you know, if Putin does mobilize, go down the path of mobilization, then that could draw opposition from some aspects of the Russian people. So I think from Putin's perspective, it makes eminent sense to play a waiting game to continue to essentially rain destruction down on the Ukrainians and exploit the constraints that the U.S. has imposed on the Ukrainians ability to fire back and then maybe think in terms of 2025 a much more amenable political and strategic picture emerges for Russia that Putin can then exploit.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The debate over debates continues. Both campaigns -- the Harris and the Trump campaign appeared to be at an impasse. This time over whether or not the mics will be muted while the other candidate is speaking at that September 10th ABC debate. Now, originally, Donald Trump and President Joe Biden had agreed to terms that were similar to that of the CNN debate, that first debate in which the mics would be muted as we saw at that CNN debate while the other candidate was talking. Now, the Harris campaign has said that they want those mics unmuted. Now, Trumps team says that's not what we agreed to. But a lot of this here is just posturing as each side tries to figure out what's best for their candidate. However, Donald Trump himself talked about this while he was in Virginia commemorating third anniversary of the Afghanistan withdrawal. And he seemed to essentially undercut his own campaign. Take a listen. DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: So I was thinking about it. I was thinking about it. They also want to change the rules. You know, the deal was we're keeping the same rules. Now they said they want to make a change in the rules because she can't answer questions.",

Obviously now, we're almost in a complete opposite situation in which Donald Trump's team is saying, we want to agree to those original rules that we already agreed to with President Joe Biden. And Kamala Harris is saying, nope, I'm at the top of the ticket now, things have changed. Again all of this posturing, all of this, the campaigns trying to make sure that their own candidate looks the best, when they take the stage. And the big question for us will they take the stage that September 10th to debate. One thing we know is leading up to that Donald Trump's campaign says that he is going to be pounding the pavement. It's going to be quote, unquote \"Trump on steroids\". They say he's ramping up his travel. He's going to be in battleground states. We have heard this before.
