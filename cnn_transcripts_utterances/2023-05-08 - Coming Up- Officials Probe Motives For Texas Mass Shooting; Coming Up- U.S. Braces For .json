Officials sayright wing extremism may have played a part in this weekend's deadly mass shooting at a Texas mall. We are live for you in Allen Texas with the very latest. Plus, battle growing. Russia evacuates civilians from occupied South- eastern Ukraine ahead of an anticipated Ukrainian counter offensive. And debt drama. A high stakes meeting set for tomorrow in Washington as the U.S. rushes towards a possible debt default. Tuesday's debt ceiling negotiations will be a key driver of sentiment for global investors this week. On Wall Street, a cautious start to the trading day. All top U.S. stocks on track for mixed open as you can see there on your screen. Europe little bit higher as well so new strength in U.S. regional banks. Pacwest whose shares lost almost half of their value last week is set to rally more than 35 percent in early trading. It's cutting its dividend -- dividends to help stabilize operations and it says its business remains 'sound.' Other regional banks like Western Alliance are also set to advance as well. And today the U.S. Federal Reserve releases a report on just how much banks are limiting credit in the wake of the recent bank failures here in the U.S. So much to get through this hour with you. We want to begin with the very latest in Ukraine. Russia, evacuating civilians from the Zaporizhzhia region ahead of an anticipated Ukrainian counter offensive. The move raising concerns about the safety of Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe. Meanwhile, the head of the Wagner mercenary group is now suggesting his troops will stay in Bakhmut, after all, saying the Russian defense ministry has actually promised him more ammunition. Nic Robertson is joining us live now. So Nic, let's start with what the UN's nuclear power watchdog is saying. They're saying the situation around this power plant is precarious, to say the least, is very dangerous, especially considering that there is a counter offensive likely brewing obviously by Ukrainian troops in the area as well. What more can you tell us?",

      "sentences": "Well, the concern is that the Russian backed authorities have been moving civilians out of the neighboring townto that power plant where some of the workers at the power plant actually work. So, there's a concern that civilians vital to the safe working at the power plant won't be there to provide that service. So that's one level of concern. The other concern is that a counter offensive because Russian forces are based at the power plant itself, in and around it, therefore, that -- that that could damage potentially the power plant and its safety and security. And of course, the IAEA has spent a lot of time and effort to try to organize a peace plan around the power plant, but the other parts of the frontline, the Eastern Bakhmut also causing concern for the Ukrainian government. They're worried despite what the mercenary boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin of Wagner has been saying that he was going to pull his troops out over the next couple of days if he didn't get more ammunition. What Ukrainian authorities are actually seeing there and experiencing is an increase in artillery fired by Russian forces. And there is a level of concern that because tomorrow is the big Victory Day parade in Moscow on Red Square, they think Vladimir Putin would like nothing better than to declare Bakhmut, a victory. And they're determined to stop that. So, there is intensive fire on many parts of the Eastern Front Line, we've been able to -- where we're standing here, hear some heavy artillery in the distance, but that big counter offensive that gets much discussion and debate. There isn't, I would say, a lot of evidence that it's about to happen. And of course, Ukrainian officials and the Ukrainian military are not giving any clues about where it could happen, or when it could happen. But it doesn't appear to be around here and it doesn't appear to be anytime soon.",

This is perhaps the biggest day of the year for Russian, it's hard to overstate its importance, but we are seeing already that celebrations are being scaled back in some areas, particularly regions, close to Ukraine, some canceling parades, others canceling things, like fireworks display. There's a -- there's a -- there's an event called the immortal regiment where Russians tend to walk carrying pictures of relatives that died in the Second World War. Of course, Russian losses were the biggest of any country by an order of magnitude in the Second World War. That has been canceled. There's speculation that there's concern that could have drawn attention to the losses in Ukraine. We are still going to see as you see these rehearsals here, these shows of military might, ballistic missiles, armored vehicles being paraded around Russian cities and Red Square in Moscow. But that does not reflect the reality of this war in Ukraine. We are seeing that Russia unable to produce enough weapons to replace its losses is now having to dig even deeper into its historical stockpiles to try to sustain this war. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's the same type of insignia that we've seen here across the United States at various protests over the past few years by members of extremist groups. I'm also told the authorities are looking over a trove of digital evidence, the suspect had an incredible, incredibly large footprint online to include social media accounts. And I'm told that as investigators were looking at that, they found various posts that pertain to white supremacist as well as neo-Nazi type material that they believe the suspect himself had posted online. So, we're getting more and more about him as they drill down to try to figure out what it was that was motivating this person. Now, I'm also told from a source that this attack that happened here, as bad as it was, and it was awful. Obviously, it could have been so much worse, because we know that officer took down that stuff back on the suspect's person, they found multiple extra magazines, as well as that high powered assault rifle. The suspect obviously came here with several, several rounds of ammunition trying to cause mass death at this mall. Again, he was intercepted by an officer and ultimately taken down.

Now, this deadline is coming up quickly, with just eight days when lawmakers are going to be here in Washington to figure this out. That's not to say lawmakers can negotiate with the president via the telephone. But that just gives you a sense of the urgency heading into this potential June 1 deadline that the Treasury Secretary laid out. The question coming out of tomorrow's meeting is whether or not both sides are going to be starting to work together again, to find some kind of resolution. The key sticking point has been Republicans are arguing they will not increase the debt ceiling without promises of spending cuts. Meanwhile, the Democrats have been arguing that the debt ceiling should be raised without any spending cuts as it has been in the past. Is there a two-track way to move the negotiating post further? That's the big question going into tomorrow's meeting. It's just not clear right now, whether or not either side is feeling the urgency of the moment right now.
