But first, your headlines the -- Yevgeny Prigozhin theHead of the Wagner mercenary group has apparently been videoed returning fighters arriving in Belarus. That's after Britain's Intelligence Chief told CNN that Prigozhin is alive and at liberty. Three days of anti-government protests begin in Kenya frustrations are growing after unpopular tax hikes. We'll have the latest from Nairobi. The U.S. soldier in North Korean custody faced disciplinary action. Prior to his border crossing, Travis King faced assault charges and spent 50 days in a detention facility in South Korea. And Michigan's Attorney General has charged 16 people with a range of felonies for their alleged role in trying to overturn the 2020 U.S. election. Welcome to our second hour of \"Connect the World\", not any moment Israeli President Isaac Hassan will address a joint meeting of Congress in Washington D.C. that's a day often meeting with President Biden at the White House. Relations between Mr. Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have been strained with Herzog's invitation to Washington seen as a slight aimed at Mr. Netanyahu is still waiting to receive an official invitation to meet the President. Now the White House will only say the two leaders will meet at some point even as Mr. Biden publicly warns against the judicial overhaul plan. The Israeli Prime Minister wants to push through the Knesset. So tonight, we ask, can Biden and Netanyahu heal relations? Hadas Gold is back with us this hour from Jerusalem. And we've also got Kevin Liptak in Washington for us. Great to have you both on, to give us a little bit of context. I think Hadas, let's start off with you. Look, Isaac hats off early the second Israeli President to address Congress. The last time was actually Isaac Herzog's father, and that was 1987. I want you to give me a sense of the importance of the speech and what we're about to hear?",

You can see all the members there are seated, we can seeVice President Harris there, House Speaker McCarthy just waiting for the Israeli President to be walking in at any moment to start this historic speech to this joint meeting of Congress. You're right that the last Israeli President to give such a speech was his own father. The Israeli President comes from a very illustrious political family in Israel. But actually the last leader, Israeli leader to give such a speech was actually Benjamin Netanyahu himself in 2015, when he gave that somewhat infamous speech, railing against then negotiations over the Iranian nuclear deal that speech, of course, largely seen as a slap in the face to the Obama administration. So Benjamin Netanyahu has a bit of a history in terms of sometimes frosty relations with American administration. So this is not the first time that this sort of tension has been there. But for President Joe Biden, we have heard his rhetoric about this Israeli government and about their actions lately seemingly increase in intensity, especially over the past few months. He gave an interview with CNN calling this Israeli government under Netanyahu the most extreme in Israeli history. And now we're hearing him in this recent interview with The New York Times columnist Thomas Freeman, essentially, putting out even broader warning on this massive judicial overhaul. The Netanyahu government is trying to push through that would completely change the Israeli Supreme Court how it operates really encouraging Prime Minister Netanyahu to pump the brakes on this calling for compromise. Thomas Freeman, in his own words in the column even going farther, essentially is saying that his impression of what President Joe Biden is saying is that if you don't come to a broad consensus on this judicial overhaul. If you don't pump the brakes, then you risk the relations between Israel and the United States in the future. I think what we're going to hear from President Herzog, I can see now that the members of Congress are standing up, I think we're going to hear from him is talking a lot about this, the history between Israel, the United States. And how he thinks that history will endure no matter what tensions or problems may be right now in those relations.",

Butobviously, these tensions do exist with some of the more progressive members of the Democratic when you see him there shaking the hand of the House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and Vice President Kamala Harris. Hadas noted when Netanyahu spoke in 2015. That was with controversy as well. 53 members of Congress boycotted that speech it won't be as high this time. But certainly those tensions and those divisions within the Democratic Party are very much on display. As members of Congress, the most progressive members of Congress take issue with some of the policies that the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has put forward. And I think in inviting the President Hertzog, this has been an attempt to demonstrate American support for Israel if not necessarily American support for the government of Netanyahu. And so it will be interesting to see how in this speech, he sort of bridges that divide, but certainly speech not without controversy here in the United States, as it sort of drives a wedge between members of the Democratic Party, Eleni.",

But certainly President Biden has been pretty forthright in his conversations with Netanyahu, about his displeasure about this potential judicial overhaul including in their phone call on Monday, President Biden has been explicit that this kind of democratic of backsliding, as he views it could undermine U.S.-Israel relations. The U.S., certainly the Biden administration doesn't think it can uphold the type of relationship with Israel that it has had in the past, if it doesn't maintain these democratic institutions. And that, of course, it's an enormous worry for the United States because Israel, of course, aside from a stalwart, a symbolic partner, it's an important intelligence partner, important military partner. And we'll listen to I guess, Kevin McCarthy, gaveling in this joint session, it is a rare honor for Congress to extend this invitation to foreign leaders. The last one was Prime Minister Modi, a few weeks ago. Members of Congress also boycotted that speech. So not necessarily unusual that you see members of Congress are declining to attend these events. But certainly when it comes to Israel, this issue is so politically fraught, that it becomes this enormous issue when you hear members of Congress say that they don't want to attend.",

As you mentioned,Travis King was detained in the South Korean detention facility for about 50 days after facing assault charges for allegedly assaulting members of the South Korean public. So he was in that detention facility. The timeline of that is exactly that is unclear, but we know that he was released on July 10 and in between July 10 and July 17, which is when he was actually supposed to fly back to the United States to be administratively separated from the U.S. military. It's unclear what he was doing throughout those that week or so. And then on July 18, that is when he went to that tour of the DMZ and crossed that demarcation line into North Korea. Importantly on July 17, when he was supposed to fly back to the U.S. to Fort Bliss in Texas, he was escorted to the airport by U.S. military officials. But they could not actually accompany him to the gates and so they did not see him board the plane and he ultimately did not actually board that flight. A day later, that is when we saw him take that tour and that is what he ran across that line willfully according to the U.S. military. He was not coerced and now he remains in North Korean custody. Now, we are learning that the U.S. has tried to reach out to North Korean officials about this, but they have not responded. The North Koreans have notoriously been silent when it comes to diplomatic outreach by the Biden administration. And this case is no different. So they're still trying to get in touch with the North Koreans but have not had much luck at this point. And we should note that we have heard from Travis King's mother, who told ABC that she does not believe that this is something Travis would do. She was very surprised by it. She had spoken to him just a few days ago when he was saying that he was preparing to return to the United States to Fort Bliss, and that she really just wants to see him come home now obviously, Eleni.",

This will also be a problem or at least it won't be well received by the Kremlin that Putin can't come here, because they've always wanted since this war started to show that Putin wasn't isolated from the world community.
