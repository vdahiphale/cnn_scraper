      "sentences": "Well, National Security Council, Fredricka, says those sanctions are going to be announced on Friday. And I think there is two interesting things about them. First of all, of course, the White House says that they are going to have an effect on the Russians, even though, of course, we know that so far the sanctions that have been levied against Russia, not just by the United States, but, of course, many of the U.S.'s allies as well have really not stopped the Russian war machine from functioning at a very high level in Ukraine, and also really haven't stopped the Russian economy very much either.One of the interesting things about this new set of sanctions is that apparently they have been in the works for a while, because of course, while right now the White House is dealing with the death of Alexei Navalny and the fallout of that, we are also, of course, coming up on the two-year anniversary of Russia's full scale invasion of Ukraine. And so, therefore, the White House and the National Security Council, of course, were already working on a new set of sanctions that the National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has set are very broad, far- reaching sanctions that he believes will hurt the Russians. Now, the spokesman for the National Security Council, John Kirby, he said last night that those sanctions have specifically been supplemented after the death of Alexei Navalny to be even tougher and even more far-reaching than the ones that the White House had already planned. So, certainly, the White House saying that they do have a lot in store for the Russians as far as those sanctions are concerned, and that they even added to that after the death of Alexei Navalny. One of the other things that is also interesting is that the U.S.'s probably closest ally in all of this, United Kingdom, also sanctioned six individuals who were at the leadership of that penal colony called the Polar Wolf where Alexei Navalny was being kept, and of course also where he died, Fredricka.",

      "sentences": "Well, Fred, President Biden certainly has escalated his rhetoric, not just against former President Donald Trump, but also Russian President Vladimir Putin. The President, oftentimes, when he is speaking with donors at these off- camera private fundraisers speaks a little bit more freely, offering more unvarnished thoughts on a host of topics, and that is exactly what happened last night as he spoke to high-dollar donors in San Francisco.The President in his remarks specifically called out Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling him a \"crazy S.O.B.\" that guy, Putin and others. It comes as Biden has really vented and expressed this frustration following the death of Alexei Navalny who died while in prison in Russia. The President said he has laid the blame directly on Putin for Navalny's death. But, it also comes as we have increasingly heard former President Donald Trump make these comments embracing Russia. He, a few weeks ago, had suggested that Russia and Vladimir Putin do whatever the hell they want to NATO countries who are not meeting their financial obligations to the alliance. Trump also has gone to great lengths not to condemn Putin for Navalny's death, instead, trying to argue that Trump is -- himself is facing political persecution at this time like Alexei Navalny has, a statement that's really not based in any fact. But, Biden took aim at Trump about that last night in the fundraiser, saying, \"He is comparing himself to Navalny, and saying that because our country has become a communist country, he was persecuted, just like Navalny was persecuted. Where the hell does this come from? Biden went on to say, if I stood here 10 to 15 years ago and settle this, you'd all think I should be committed. It's astounding. And it really comes as the President has embraced the use of the bully pulpit to push back on resistance from the former President and Republicans currently in the House. It comes as Republicans have so far blocked efforts to pass additional aid for Ukraine, something that they are doing at the former President's urging, and this provides Biden with an opportunity to draw this contrast with Trump heading into November's elections. Now, as for that comment that the President made specifically about Putin, Russia did respond overnight. A spokesperson for the Kremlin is calling it a disgrace for the U.S. to engage in such language, and they added \"Clearly, Mr. Biden is demonstrating behavior in the style of a Hollywood cowboy to cater to domestic political interests.\" But, I think the President has long argued that Putin has posed a threat to the world and that -- they've seen that start to play out even more in the wake of Navalny's death and as they continue their campaign against Russia -- against Ukraine, which is that war is about to hit the two-year mark on Saturday.",

      "sentences": "Well, Fred, generally when we see the CIA director traveling to one of these meetings, it's because we are at an inflection point. He has been a key negotiator in these hostage talks. He was a key negotiator in the talks that led up to that truce in late November and that led to a week-long pause in the fighting and the release of dozens of hostages. And so, we may be at another inflection point. And we're also getting signs from Israeli officials that things are moving in the right direction. Yesterday, Benny Gantz, a member of the Israeli war cabinet, said that there were \"initial signs that indicate the possibility of progress in these talks.\"We know that there were negotiations yesterday in Cairo, Egypt, where a top advisor to President Biden, Brett McGurk, traveled there to meet with officials to talk about the next stages of these negotiations. But, there has been somewhat of an impasse over the last week or so as Hamas appeared to be unwilling to move from its counterproposal which sought to secure the release of more than around 1,500 Palestinian prisoners in just the first phase of this deal, which was a complete non-starter for Israeli officials. And the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeatedly saying that Hamas' counterproposal was \"delusional\", saying that he would not bow to those demands. So, despite that impasse over the last week, it does appear that there may be signs of progress. But, there is no question that looming over all of this is the threats from Israeli officials to carry out a major military operation in the southernmost city of Rafah where about 1.5 million Palestinians are currently sheltering in a city that normally houses about 300,000 residents. Israeli officials making very clear that if there is not a deal by the start of Ramadan, which would start the second week of March, that that offensive will indeed move forward. So, a lot on the line, certainly, not only those 1.5 million people in Rafah, but also, of course, about 130 Israeli hostages remaining in Gaza. Fred.",

Right now, we're hearing differing accounts over the deaths of two Chinese fishermen after their boat capsized last week. Beijing says Taiwan rammed the vessel. But, Taipei says the boat flipped over as it was making a sharp turn. And earlier this week, the Chinese Coast Guard boarded a tourist boat from Taiwan. We've got some video here as it's being escorted by Taiwan's Coast Guard. Well, it's pretty difficult to make out there. But, a Taiwanese official says this incident triggered what she calls panic among the public. I want to bring in now CNN's to Marc Stewart live from Beijing. Good to see you, Marc.

But, the message from this delegation to Taiwan, which has a new political leadership in transition, the message is that no matter what happens in the United States, no matter what happens with the United States presidential election, that the U.S. will always be showing its support. It will always have a friendship and a relationship with Taiwan.It's a message that China, that Beijing, where I am here, does not take too kindly, and once again issued a statement saying to the United States, you need to respect the sovereignty of Taiwan. These kinds of visits are not helpful. For the moment, we have just seen the statement. But, as we have seen over the years, Fredricka, sometimes China does take some kind of action, perhaps more military patrols as we've seen in the past. But, for right now, it's just a conflict of words. But, this U.S. presence in Taiwan always strikes a chord, always strikes some tension with China.",

It's a move reminiscent of what former President Donald Trump attempted to do in 2018 before a federal appeals court blocked that proposal. Republicans have focused on Mr. Biden's handling of the border crisis which they view as one of his biggest political weaknesses heading into the November election. No final decision has been made on any new executive action. But, if it goes ahead, Mr. Biden will likely face intense backlash from immigration advocates.Let's bring in CNN's Priscilla Alvarez.

      "sentences": "Well, what White House officials are reviewing here is an authority that already exists in immigration law that gives the President discretion of who is eligible to enter the United States. In this context, it would limit who is able to seek asylum between ports of entry. They are for those who are crossing the border unlawfully. It's an extraordinary move. If the White House were to move forward with it, that would garner fierce pushback from both Democrats and immigrant advocates.Now, an administration official tells me that they are evaluating multiple options, this being one of them, and that no final decision has been made. And in a statement, a White House spokesperson saying the following, \"No executive action, no matter how aggressive, can deliver the significant policy reforms and additional resources Congress can provide and that Republicans rejected. We continue to call on Speaker Johnson and House Republicans to pass the bipartisan deal to secure the border.\" Of course, what the White House is referring to there is that Senate border bill that included some of the toughest border security measures in recent memory. That included an emergency authority that would have allowed the Homeland Security Secretary to shut down the border if certain triggers were met. And at the time and during these negotiations, President Biden said that he was open to shutting down the border, if given the authority. This action, if the White House moves forward with it, seems to be an extension of that that we still don't know all of the details. And as he mentioned there, Fred, this is reminiscent of a measure that was taken under former President Donald Trump in 2018. Trump also issued a presidential proclamation using the same authority to try to block asylum entirely on the U.S.-Mexico border. Now, he was challenged in courts and eventually a federal appeals court said that this measure had to be blocked because it conflicted with asylum law. But, it is -- it speaks to the moment that we're in. President Biden is trying to turn the page on border security, seize on the issue going into November, and take on this political liability by potentially moving forward with an executive action that could anger his allies.",

They told us a car would pick us up. I have two broken legs, shrapnel in my back. I can't do anything. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (translated): Are you there alone or what? AMANPOUR (voice-over): Evan and his comrades never made it. Ukraine says there was a deal Russia would evacuate them and exchange prisoners. Instead, Russia released video of them dead. The brigade says they were shot. These are desperate times in Ukraine's fight to survive. They need to replenish the ranks of the dead and injured. And even here at the Superhumans facility in the western city of Lviv, therapists and prosthetic specialists work around the clock giving these war amputees a second chance and even a return to the front lines. 25-year-old Anastasia Savka (ph) is an army sniper. She stepped on a landmine in November near this Zaporizhzhia front, and she tells me they are scattered there like snow drops in spring, like daisies in summary. We couldn't get out for a long time because we were under very heavy fire, she tells me. To be honest, we were ready to die there. The attacks was so close, and we were thinking this was the end. Olga Rudneva is CEO of this center, which is supported by Ukrainian businessman and the American philanthropist Howard Buffett. 80 percent of the patients are military, many of the multiple amputees, and that's because, Olga says, the wounded cannot get out of the battle zone during the so-called golden hour to save their limbs.",

And time is not their friend. We reached Sergeant Mykola (ph), who is also serving now on the Zaporizhzhia regional front line. AMANPOUR: Do you have enough weapons? Do you have enough people? Do you have enough ammunition? Of course we don't, he says. There is a catastrophic shortage of people. The same with weapons. There aren't enough shells for artillery and tanks or the tanks and artillery themselves. On a brief hiatus in the rear, they've had to buy their own mortar, small caliber just for self-defense. The problem is no ammunition. Anastasia practices perfecting her balance, her endurance, regaining the strength to shoulder her weapons, and she wants to go back to the front. I think anything is possible, she says. But, whatever happens, we all need to fight this together because the enemy is advancing. No one wants their children to still be fighting the war they and their parents have been fighting ever since Putin's first invasion a decade ago. Christiane Amanpour, CNN, Kyiv. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
