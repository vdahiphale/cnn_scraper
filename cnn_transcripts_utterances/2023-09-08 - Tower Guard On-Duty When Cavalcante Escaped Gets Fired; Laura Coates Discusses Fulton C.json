Look, there was a huge legal decision in the Fulton County election subversion case involving the person right there with the name denied on top of his photo. It's what the question is, it's the defendants, of course, who wanted to move their cases from Georgia to federal court, and the judge said, no. No, to Mark Meadows.Then, of course, he was Trump's right-hand man, and his move to his criminal case to federal court is obviously not going to happen. So, what's going to happen now is, well, he's already appealed. This is not just about him, though. He is the first of five defendants who filed motions to move the election subversion case to federal court, not to mention, of course, Donald Trump, who had been eyeing the very same move. We'll tell you what all this could mean for the case. Plus, am I the only person asking? I know I'm not. But where is this Danelo Cavalcante? How are we on the ninth day that he has managed to evade police? How? He crab-walked up a wall and out of prison right under the nose of prison officials. Remember this?

By the way, there was a warrant out for his arrest in his native Brazil, as well. He's already been sentenced to life without the possibility of parole for the brutal murder of his ex-girlfriend. She was stabbed to death over 30 times in front of her two young children.And we've got breaking news tonight on the deadly earthquake in Morocco that s killed nearly 300 people and the toll seems to be rising. But I want to begin with the biggest development since the indictments. Mark Meadows bid to move his Georgia criminal case to federal court and it was rejected tonight. So, what exactly does this mean for the case? Is the ball now squarely to remain in, of course, Fani Willis' home turf and her court? Joining me now, former Trump attorney Tim Parlatore. Glad that you're with us tonight. Thanks for joining us, Tim. You know, you and I have had these conversations for a long time now about what might happen in this case and beyond. The judge said no, you didn't meet the, well, probably a lower bar than people thought it would be to get to federal court. And you know that Trump already said that he was thinking about this. And if anyone had a good chance, I think it was Mark Meadows. Does this mean that Trump, you think, might as well just assume that it will be in the Fulton County State Court?",

You know, when you have these RICO cases, oftentimes the defendants will get together, their attorneys will coordinate, and they'll all make the motions at the same time.So, instead of just dealing with one person, you can instead hit the federal judge with basically all of the defendants at the same time. And you know, when you do that, you end up with a much stronger showing. But when you have one person that goes kind of on their own and then gets knocked down, it certainly does have a negative effect on everybody else.

And so, I think that the judge, you know, correctly noted, this is the kind of thing where there's going to be a lot of litigation over this.

So, pushing it out does run that particular risk.And also, two defendants have said, I will take that risk. I want it to be in October. I want this speedy trial right. It's theirs. By the way, for everyone to realize if this appellate process goes, it'll go to the 11th Circuit of the district court, right? And you know, then the Supreme court will likely be asked to weigh in. Fun fact, everyone, the Supreme Court Justice who oversees those initial appeals requests from the 11th Circuit is a man named Clarence Thomas. The plot might just thicken in all of this. Tim, also, the grand jury in Fulton County recommended 39 indictments, 21 of those people were not charged.

So, it is interesting to me looking at the list of people that the grand jury had recommended for indictment.And of course, that's what everybody's looking at is who was recommended that she declined. But also, what I found interesting is there's one name on the indictment that wasn't mentioned at all by the special grand jury -- Mike Roman. And that was something that was very telling to me because you look and you see the grand jury voted 20 to one to indict Boris Epstein. And then they go over to the criminal grand jury, which decides, instead of indicting him, to indict Mike Roman, the guy who reported to him. So, that's a very telling thing to me.",

It's whether their mind is so fixed and definite that they can't make a decision on the case. In other words, they have already made up their mind before they have heard any evidence.And in a case like this, just about everyone in the country has already got an opinion about the way this case should proceed. I mean, we haven't seen any evidence at all. And there's a lot of people who are talking about how great this case is or how terrible this case is. So that's one piece. The second piece is, we're talking about the hardships that jurors would undergo if they were selected to be on the jury. People who are self-employed, people who bill by the hour, lawyers, salespeople, doctors. There are a lot of different people that would have a very difficult time being on a jury, even if it was just the four months that the D.A.'s office suggested that the case would be.

People think about O.J., a very different fact pattern, of course, but the number of months that it took that case, the idea of the jury selection, even, by the way, in places like Fulton County, there is a way to compare and contrast because there is another Rico case that's still playing out.It's often been referenced. It's the one against rap star Young Thug, and that indictment came in May of last year. It's still in jury selection, and this is not a former president. This is not when the microscope is, you know, in the magnifying glass, huge for that reason. I mean, just look at the comparisons there. You've got an indictment back in May. They initially, a number of defendants, I think 28, it's whittled down to now eight. They had jury selection that began in January. It's September and they've got 2000 plus potential jurors already in that case who'd have to be looked at. Is this going to be any less than that in your estimation?",

Even though Young Thug is a star, even though YSL is a big rap group, they're still not nearly as prominent as Donald Trump. So, you know, you've got an extra layer of complexity.I'm not sure why the Young Thug case is taking so long to get a jury. I don't know what's going on there. You would have thought that they'd be done in two or three months like they were in other complex RICO cases. But yeah, I mean, I think it's something to look at. Probably a better guide would be the Atlanta Public Schools RICO trial that happened back in 2013. That's going to be an excellent guide as to how long jury selection is going to take.

They go off on their own and then we've got another one to follow.This courtroom could be tied up for two years, which a lot of people don't think about but I mean, you know, as a former prosecutor, courtrooms are active u courtrooms and so, there are all kinds of cases going on -- murders, divorces. You've got people who are sitting in jail that won't be able to get a trial because this case is taking up the courtroom for the entire year you have couples that want to get a divorce that have to stay married because this courtroom is tied up for two years and that's probably why the judge really wants to get everybody together, but he may be forced to separate them into two different trials.",

You've got a former minority went on television last year for the special grand jury. We know a lot more about this report, including three senators who they wanted to indict.

I think what you saw here is the Fulton County D.A. just following the facts and wanting to inquire about what their role was and what their motives were in either reaching out to elected officials in Georgia or even getting involved in the first place.And so, that's what I see with this grand jury report. We talked about winners and losers earlier. I actually think the grand jury process won today because you saw how the grand jurors were able to apply the law and the facts to individuals in a way that wasn't just in a blanket uniform, everyone should be recommended.

Why was it that it just took you five seconds?If you were in fear, perhaps you could have tactically took cover and time is on your side to see and assess whether it was appropriate to shoot. What was the immediacy of the danger? Were you absorbing that immediacy? Did you see a gun or not? What specifically was the threat? Was it appropriate to fire once, twice, three, four, five, six times, and is that disproportional?

Remember that he broke out of a Pennsylvania prison last Thursday. Look at the video here. He was crab-walking up a wall after his conviction last month for the brutal 2021 killing of his ex-girlfriend in front of her two young children. He was sentenced recently to life without parole.Now, as the search intensifies tonight, we have news about a guard who was on duty during that escape. I want to bring in CNN s Brian Todd in Chester County, Pennsylvania. Brian, the prison tower guard who was on duty during that escape, he was fired today. What more can you tell us?",

You can't just walk up to him. I don't know what happened to not have him be able to have any cover at that point, as well.But also, there's been at least eight now credible sightings of him since his escape nine days ago. I mean eight sightings, but they haven't actually caught him. It's always, you know, in the rearview mirror essentially. So, what are they doing now to focus to try to get him?",

They re using, of course, a lot of technology that they don't want to tell us about.Again, aerial surveillance, canine surveillance, and they're just -- they're sweeping these areas and they have shifted the perimeter. We reported today they've shifted the perimeter since yesterday to the west and to the north and they keep shifting it. But they are still in this area of this massive nature preserve called Longwood Gardens because there have been two surveillance images that have captured Danelo Cavalcante. They've both been in the area of Longwood Gardens. But the problem with those images is this. Those cameras are trail cameras that were placed there by private citizens months or maybe even years ago. Those cameras do not transmit images in real time. By the time law enforcement authorities got these images, it was about a day after they had been captured. That's another issue. Some of these images that are getting to law enforcement -- are getting to them almost too late.",

This earthquake, 6.8 on the rest of the scale, hit after 11 P.M. local time, and we've seen buildings that have been damaged, cars, people getting out on the street, so much so that the Morocco interior minister is told not to panic before panic as we're trying to figure out exactly what happened here.This earthquake hit the southwest of the country, near Marrakesh, a popular tourist destination. It's got a small population, it's under a million, but a lot of people go there for tourism. And the aftershocks themselves, not just in Marrakesh and around there, but in cities as far as Rabat. So that is why officials fear that the actual death toll could increase if a few hours until dawn, and one day such as naked full account of what happened and how far it spread, those fears could very well come true, that the numbers could increase. Both of the casualties and the number of the wounded we've counted about 153 right now. The U.S. Geological Survey saying this is the strongest earthquake to reach the nation since 1900. So, even at the scale and the extent of this is something that's unprecedented. Certainly nothing that anybody who's living in Morocco or around this part of the world has seen in their lifetime.",

Of course, she's four, she's no gender sexual orientation. For two weeks, Laura, I got called a pedophile by this guy's followers. It destroyed me and my family. They were telling me to kill myself.
