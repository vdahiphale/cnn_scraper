Vance, hitting every single major battleground state, all seven of them over the course of the next five days, starting here in Pennsylvania. J.D. Vance was down in Philadelphia. The former president here in New York at a speech that was rather different than what we normally see from him. It was not a big rally. It was not a raucous affair. Instead, it was at a manufacturer.

It was energy here in the critical battleground, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
