Your answer here is Walmart, topping the list almost doubling Amazon sales in 2022 with 600 billion. Who`s a fan of self-checkout outlines at your favorite retailer or grocery store? Some people love them. Some say I prefer a perfectly fine friendly human to help me with my purchases, please. Well, some major retailers are starting to say goodbye to self-checkout lines. The machines were first introduced in the 1980s becoming more widely used in the early 2000s as stores look to cut costs and higher fewer cashiers. Well it turns out that utilizing self-service stations are actually leading to greater losses than human cashiers. Whether it be from accidental customer errors or from intentional shoplifting. One study found incontrovertible proof that companies with self-checkout machines had a loss rate of about 4%. That`s more than double the industry average. Some attempts to fix these issues like adding weight sensors have only led to further customer frustration. So far Walmart, ShopRite, Costco and the U.K.`s boots have all started to dial back their self-checkout strategy. What do you say? Good idea or bad idea? Today`s story getting a 10 out of 10 highlights the power of imagination. You`ve often heard me say that if there`s something you want to achieve, you have to see it before you see it.
