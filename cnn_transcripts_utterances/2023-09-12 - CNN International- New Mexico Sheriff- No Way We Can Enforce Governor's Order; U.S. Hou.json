Not only is he facing down a potential government shutdown at the end of this month, but he is also facing growing calls from his right flank to begin impeachment proceedings into President Joe Biden.Now on the topic of spending. Kevin McCarthy wants to move a short- term government spending bill that would keep the government's lights on until sometime in November. And he also wants to keep additional Ukraine money, which is what the White House has requested, out of that bill, in an effort to appease conservatives who don't want to see any more money flowing to Ukraine. But it is clear that that is not going to be enough to convince many conservatives to get on board with a short-term spending bill. Congressman Chip Roy is one of those conservatives. He wants to see a number of other demands in a short-term funding bill on everything from securing the border, to defunding parts of the Department of Justice. Let's take a listen to what he told reporters on Monday. REP. CHIP ROY (R-TX): The objective is to save a country that is currently crumbling around us with open borders, a weakened military, spending driving inflation, a Department of Justice that's got its focus on the wrong space. A shutdown isn't an objective. Right? The objective is to force the administration to the table to come sit down with Republicans and say, how are we going to fund a government that's supposed to carry out it's responsible duties for the American people. That's it, nothing more.",

This is a big development. This is what Ukraine have been asking for really for quite some time.And it follows a pattern of the U.S. delaying considering giving certain weapons that Ukraine is asking for. For example, the multiple launch rocket systems, the Abraham Tanks, cluster munitions, all of these Ukraine asks, there's a delay, and then eventually the U.S. gives them. Now Ukraine and other critics have said that unfortunately, this kind of delay gives Russia time to fortify its defenses. Get better at defending those defensive lines. The U.S. argues, of course, that they need this time to work out if this is a battlefield necessity or not, and then they decide to give them. Now the concern, particularly with these kinds of long-range missiles, is that it could reach far into Russian territory. But what they're arguing now, according to the officials that CNN has spoken with, familiar with these discussions. Is that they've not seen any behavior from Ukraine that indicates they are using foreign made weaponry inside Russia. Which again speaks to what we've been seeing with these drone attacks. Presumably, they are Ukrainian made, homemade. That the attacks they're seeing inside Russia are not from the U.S. weaponry or from allies, U.K. France anything like that. And so, as a result, the U.S. is now considering giving them. But also interesting the timing of this, right. We're looking this morning at the conversations between Russia and North Korea. Presumably, there is some concern here that the U.S. needs to be stepping up its act, backing Ukraine in more ways than just political moral support. But also delivering on this weaponry, Ukraine has really been asking for.",

If they do get weaponry and ammunition from North Korea, it's going to have to travel a very long way to get to the Ukrainian frontline. But these are kind of things that Putin is really asking for. And as we're seeing with this messaging from the U.S., there may just be a political stance here that they want to show that they have allies, they have ways of getting more support, prolonging this conflict and replenishing their frontlines.
