New details on just how many men Putin has sent to the front lines as we have more of Erin Burnett's exclusive interview with President Zelenskyy. Does he believe Ukraine will finally be invited to join NATO?Plus, the investigation is Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election, heating up as the special counsel focuses in on Trump's legal team. And the terrifying video of a visible crack in a support beam of a popular rollercoaster, the man who shot this video. The video that eventually forced the park to shut the ride down is my guest. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening on this Monday. I'm Erica Hill in for Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, an alarming buildup of Russian forces. Putin has now said to have more than 180,000 men to the front lines in Ukraine. That includes 50,000 near Bakhmut, according to Ukraine's defense department. And the buildup comes as Ukraine claims it is slowly making progress in the east, taking back more than 14 square miles over the past week, despite Russia's attack there, more than doubling. We are also getting some dramatic video from the north, a massive fireball seen rising over the city of Sumy, at least two people were killed, according to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Russia hit a number of residential buildings, and a security service building. These attacks underscore why Zelenskyy is out repeatedly, pressing for Ukraine to be able to join NATO. In an exclusive interview, Erin asked Zelenskyy if he believes Ukraine will ultimately get that invitation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

President Biden and the U.S. Congress, both parties despite their preparations for the elections, pay great deal of attention to the war in Ukraine. They are on our side and they support us. It's difficult for Ukraine to survive without the U.S. support. And it's a fact. I'm very direct one saying this. Without the U.S.'s help, it would become a frozen conflict. With the U.S.'s help, we will de- occupy our territory. The occupation of any next town is weakening Putin. We don't have to be scared of that. The U.S. decides today whether Ukraine will get invited to NATO. This is today situation, it's a fact. The majority of the NATO countries support invading Ukraine tornado.

Thank you.OUTFRONT now, retired U.S. Army Brigadier General Peter Zwack, former U.S. senior defense attache to Russia, and Steve Hall, former CIA chief of Russia operations. Good to see you both tonight. General, if I could begin with you, as Ben, we heard from what Ben laid out there, Ukraine's again so far have been small, somewhat incremental. Now Ukraine is talking about these, more than 180, 000, men Russia has moved to the front lines. How do you think this will impact the counteroffensive? BRIG. GEN. PETER ZWACK, U.S. ARMY (RET.): First, let's dissect that 180,000 reported. They are looked to be out of their reserve formations that were not stood up long ago. Also, the storms Z companies which are groups of convicts and things like that, so these are not elite first string troops that they are committing. I'm suspecting a lot of the reserve forces that are being pulled out are probably not particularly motivated to be there, though they are considered voluntary citizens. You've got that. Most of the 300,000 of last fall have been committed. So, it's serious, their numbers. Quantity has a certain quality of its own. Stalin would have said, these are not elite guys, but it is a factor, but it also may put stress, Erica, on the Russian people, and the regime. The battle itself, the grinding Ukrainian offensives, these are probes. They are big probes. They are hard probes. We are looking for weakness. They have not committed their main force brigades. They are looking, and we have to have tactical operation patients for this to play out. And everyone said, including the Ukraine, this would be hard and ugly.",

That's absolutely true.But there's also some stuff that's happened on the ground that I think is just irrefutable. The first is, how did -- how did the Wagner guys get as far as they did? I think everybody could probably have sat back and said, while this Prigozhin thing, it does not look like it's going to go well for the Kremlin. I mean, if we can see that, and all we have access to is general reporting, you can't tell me that the Russian intelligence services, specifically the internals service, the FSB, either didn't see this, or somehow didn't send it up the line into the -- how do you explain that? So, that's -- that's either lack of focus or a lack of -- or an increased focus on something else, to the detriment of Putin's regime, which is, you know, that's job number one for all autocrats is to stay in power. So, I think we're looking at a weakened Putin. The question remains is, how weakened? And what will his response be? Because he's going to try and show that he's, of course, not been weakened.

How I think the intense and we're reading it all around, is more and more, not just in our own nation, but also in our allies, that there will be a day where Ukraine is worthy of NATO, certainly. I think the narrative that, how the president -- put some pressure on him, is I think, this is really, really hard. I think though that the Ukrainians deserved it. They are certainly in the pipeline, but Article Five, attack on one is on attack on all. And Zelenskyy to his credit did not mention that.

We will also have a lawyer show up from Florida at that time. It's going to be a short and sweet and procedural hearing from what we know. But it does kick off a lot in that case, where they can move towards arguments, they can move to discussing classified material, and we also know that the Justice Department keeps wanting to talk to more witnesses around there. So, there could be a lot of things happening in that case, then in the January 6th investigation, Erica, there's a lot there. The prosecutors have been extremely aggressive in recent weeks, especially focused around the fake electors probe. We saw them offer immunity to get grand jury testimony out of two fake electors in the state of Nevada. We also know that there are two people that were organizing that fake elector effort on behalf of the Trump campaign, one who was subpoenaed to the grand jury, another one who in recent weeks has agreed to be talking to prosecutors and then they got to talk to Giuliani himself, Rudy Giuliani, the guy at the top of the Trump legal network, in 2020. And so, how that all comes together, if there's a case coming soon, a lot of signs point to that, but there is a lot they are the prosecutors are doing, and then finally, of course, we are almost in the window, just days away from when the Georgia grand jury in Fulton County is going to be able to look at whether they are going to be bringing an indictment, July 11th I believe is the beginning of that period of time -- Erica.",

And what I find most problematic about it all is that moderates are seeming to look at this and scratch their heads and say, it is a moments in which not just -- does it challenge our consciousness, but also, it gives us this question of, what does the Constitution say about any of this? And so, in essence what I'm learning from Republicans, that still sort of are lukewarm about Trump, is that they are willing to take a chance on him again, because they've got amnesia about the end of his term, about what he was even able to deliver. They just remember the good stuff. What they are looking now at Biden, and saying, his cognitive, ability his physical ability, it's drawing in contrast, and I think that makes it so tough for anybody in this GOP primary to come out and really swing at Trump, when all he does is enjoy these, not just blips of sympathy boost, it seems like a sustained sympathy boost, amongst those that are likely -- again likely to go for somebody, else and that could be a DeSantis type, but again, looking at Trump and feeling sort of nostalgic for the Republican Party, while we had the White House.",

Like I think people have the country thinks he's a rogue, and they don't like it. Half the country like cities a rogue, and they do like it.So, I think that what you have to do, is point out how Donald Trump being restored to presidency is going to hurt every day Americans. Not just of be the norm-busting thing, not just something that offensive sensibility of people who want to play by the rules, but how dangerous it would be for every day Americans. You have to draw a line between this reckless conduct during his time in office, now and how it's going to hurt everyday people. When we do that we may have a better chance. But I guess, you would say, don't be surprised, if he continues to rise in the polls, because it's tribal identity, people just feel like one of their own is under fire.

It was very strong.I want everybody to know that there are not bigots in the Republican Party writ large. There are a lot of people that worked so hard to make sure that same-sex Americans could have the freedom to do what they wanted to do. And those people are still in the party today. So, what I see happening when you see politicians come out and push this button, this hot button on making people fearful of where we're going as a country, of our cultural differences now, things that are happening around them, such as transgender individuals coming out and wanting to be recognized, and how -- and being told that they have the same rights. Look, we have no second class citizens in America, but what troubles me the most was where the data is showing -- and what the data is showing us. A recent Gallup poll showed a dip in support for same-sex relationships, and saw it mostly with Republicans. You know, overall, 64 percent of Americans say that same-sex relationships are morally acceptable. But that's down from 71 percent in 2022. And when you look at that 64 percent again, this is from May, from Gallup. You found 80 percent of Democrats saying that same-sex are morally acceptable, but only 40 percent of Republicans. That's a vast delta. That makes me scared that the message that some of these lawmakers are promulgating is going -- is making its way and fearful. Making Republicans fearful of what's to come. Therefore, they're making it harder for same-sex couples to be recognized as full citizens in this country.",
