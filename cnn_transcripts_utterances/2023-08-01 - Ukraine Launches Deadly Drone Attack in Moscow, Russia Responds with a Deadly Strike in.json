The mayor says several drones were shot down this morning, but one of them crashed into a high-rise tower, the same building that was hit in a previous attack on Sunday.The latest strike happened hours after Kyiv accused Moscow of attacking the hometown of the Ukrainian president. Officials say two ballistic missiles hit a school and residential tower on Monday, killing at least six people and leaving dozens wounded. A five-year- old girl was among the dead.

This appears to have been three drones, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense. Two shot down over suburbs to the west of Moscow, one in an area actually pretty close to Putin's Dacha, his country residence in a place called Novogorovka. So that has actually been an area where we've seen drones shot down before, notably at the end of May.A third one, Russia says, was thwarted by electronic warfare, essentially signal jamming that they use, but landed extraordinarily in the same building where we saw another drone hit on Sunday morning, in the early hours of Sunday morning. This is in the Moscow City business district, a very visible, very glitzy business district to the west of the capital, inside the capital itself. I should say, Russia blaming Ukraine. Ukraine hasn't said anything as of yet, but of course we have those comments from President Zelenskyy on Sunday where he said the war is gradually returning to Russia. They'll be hitting symbolic centers and military bases. I think when we talk about Moscow, this falls on the symbolic center side of things, but separately the Russian Ministry of Defense is also claiming this morning to have destroyed several maritime drones, essentially unmanned boats, that they say were trying to attack two patrol vessels of its Black Sea fleet. They were destroyed apparently by the conventional weapons on those ships itself. No word from Ukraine on that. But I think this falls under the sort of banner of Ukraine really becoming bolder in its strategy, really trying to disrupt not only behind Russian lines, but to bring this to the Russian people, make it impossible them to ignore it.

I Appreciate it.Well, Ukrainian officials say their southeastern counteroffensive is making steady gains, but progress is slower than expected, and those gains could be tough to hold. CNN's Nick Paton Wash reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The fight so fierce and victory so bitter, there is little left of Staromaiorske to defend it from. No cover for troops, no structures, just the dust of a tiny four-road village, the first gains of Ukraine's renewed full-throttle counteroffensive. So small, but symbolic, Russia even claimed Monday with constant shelling. It had pushed Ukraine out of it again. Something these men, fresh back from that fight, would scoff at. Krivbas, his call sign, fought all the 10 days of the assault until the Russians finally fled. Here he is as shells rain around in the initial advance. When you assault under enemy shelling, he says, you have nowhere to hide. That's the hardest part. They've since tried to assault again twice with small groups. And he fought for here too, Neskuchny, the town before it, where the Russians hid 200 troops in the basements, not even leaving for the toilet, so Ukraine attacked with a smaller force. He takes us to where the Russians made their final stand, the school hall and its corridors. There is no love, says the wall. They seemed to relish the nothing they brought and left no clues as to why they fought. (on-camera): One of the hard things for the Ukrainians to understand is quite why the Russians are fighting so hard for here, Neskuchny and more recent victory of Staromaiorske down the road. Is it that these are their last lines of defense? Well, no, they think there's far more fighting to be done. (voice-over): I hope that when we get through their last line of defense, he says, then they start to run. For now, they still feel there is something behind them. Yeah, we feel support, but we are very, very tired. There is so much more ahead to come. Ukraine may have put in its reserves now to the fight, but they face the same Russian brutality. Their tactics haven't changed, he says. They put the Storm Z convicts in front with no communications or information. They stand till the death. I don't understand their motivation or what they're fighting for. Riva carries a new Russian AK-12 as a trophy, as he describes the gas they used on him. There was chaotic shooting, he says, to find out where we were. Then the gas. You don't feel it. It moves slow along the ground. I was packing my rucksack when I felt burning on my throat and nose. One mine sapper, callsign Volt, is busy telling me how the Russians have started booby-trapping mines putting a grenade under an anti-tank mine when he's interrupted.

So Stephanie, as the political crisis plays out in Niger, what is the latest?STEPHANIE BUSARI, CNN SR. EDITOR, AFRICA: Rosemary, the rhetoric is heating up and in the last few minutes we've heard that the French embassy is planning to evacuate staff, certainly from Niger and that's it's going to happen very quickly. French media reporting that French nationals are also going to be evacuated from Niger and we're still waiting to clarify what exactly the evacuations are going to be but this is a -- this is a worrying development as this rhetoric heats up with Mali and Burkina Faso coming out strongly to say that they can consider any act of violence or any military strikes against Niger an act of war. Now these two countries themselves being ruled by a military junta who took power forcefully and they have also been ostracized by the ECOWAS, the regional bloc here in West Africa. And that regional bloc has come out in very strong terms against this latest coup action in Niger and said that they've given a one-week deadline for President Bazoum to be reinstated or Niger military faces action. We don't know precisely what action that will be, but these two other countries who are neighboring Burkina Faso and Mali are saying that they consider that an act of war, a declaration of war. And that is a very warring development in a region that's very unstable, that has insurgency by Islamist jihadists. And this Niger, of course, has been a key ally. excuse me, has been a key ally of the U.S. and France in fighting this insurgency. And so this is a very strategic country that has been helping to keep this insurgency at bay, but it's now looking very unstable there, Rosemary. All right.

Of course, you know, if there are strong economic sanctions against the country, as you said, it's one of the poorest country in the world, and it's in a matter of a few weeks, it could be a -- could leave the whole country in a very dramatic situation.

They could reject other Western allies, including the U.S.And they could welcome Russia as a new military partner. We have also to remember that France, you know, is a former colonial power, so there is not much support in favor of France.

The legislation passed by the Israeli parliament last month would strip the court of its power to declare government decisions unreasonable.For more, let's go to journalist Elliott Gotkine, who joined us live from Tel Aviv in Israel.

All of the justices have gotten together to hear other cases in the past, but that was when there were fewer of them. So this is the first time all 15 are getting together.And I suppose there are two main unknowns out there. The first, of course, is how is the Supreme Court going to rule? We know that the hearings are set to begin on September the 12th. We don't know how long they will go on for. And we don't know what the ultimate ruling will be. And the other thing we don't know, of course, is, will the government abide by a ruling if it were to strike down this reasonableness bill? Because that would also be unprecedented. Never before in the court's history has it struck down one of Israel's so-called basic laws. These are the closest things that Israel has to a constitution. And you know, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was interviewed by Wolf Blitzer on CNN last week. He was non-committal as to whether his government would abide by a ruling that would strike down this law. He was asked again in an interview with NBC News yesterday. Again, he was non-committal. And in fact, his Likud party put out a statement along the lines of saying, look, the government has always respected the Supreme Court's decisions, and the Supreme Court has always respected basic laws. But again, kind of failing to say explicitly whether the government would abide by ruling that would strike down this law. So there's a lot of unknowns out there. Against this backdrop, the protests are continuing. The leader of the opposition, Yair Lapid, has called for an 18-month freeze on any more judicial overhaul legislation as a condition for going back to the negotiating table to find some kind of compromise with the government. But as things stand, this is still on everyone's minds. This reasonableness bill has come into effect. And now these justices, all 15 of them, will hear some eight petitions as to whether that should remain the case or whether it should be struck down. And that, if they were to do so, it's certainly not a decision that they would take lightly. In fact, the head of the Supreme Court in the past has said that they would only strike down a basic law if the law dealt a mortal blow to free and fair elections, core human rights, the separation of powers, the rule of law, or an independent judiciary. And, of course, it will be for them to decide whether this reasonableness bill fits that description, if it has gone against these kind of deal breakers for the Supreme Court or if it hasn't. And we won't know that until those hearings begin in September. And as I say, we don't know when that ruling will come. It could be days, it could be weeks. Rosemary?",

And this has been tough because Beijing has been reporting rainfall today. This as the nation really tries to focus on both rescue and recovery.Let's first talk about rescue. You saw the effort there, but we also have been watching a rescue that happened just outside of Beijing. A man was trapped on top of his car. He was able to get out. But as you can see that floodwater is just raging around him. Fortunately, there were emergency crews nearby. They were able to take a crane, hoist a rescue worker, who then dropped down and then was able to provide a line to that man, and they were able to take him away. So a safe conclusion there. And we have seen lots of rescues across Beijing. Sometimes from cars, there have been cases where rescue teams have had to open up cars, get people and literally walk them out. We also saw, as you saw that video earlier, of people being stuck inside of buildings. And this is impacted a city of 21 million people. It has impacted significant locations such as the Winter Olympic area. There's one venue in particular that was covered by water. A brand new shopping mall saw the road in front of that basically open up. So these are some of the issues that are facing Beijing right now. And despite best efforts, it is still very difficult for people to get around. A lot of the roads have been either washed out or they are just littered with debris. Air service in some cases has been limited as well as train service. We are hearing from Chinese President Xi Jinping who really emphasized the need for mobilization for both resources, for transportation, for infrastructure.

According to the U.N., authorities have already registered more than 1,000 kidnappings in Haiti this year, most of them carried out by gangs. Now U.S. officials believe an American nurse and her child have fallen victim to this frightening surge in abductions. CNN's Jason Carroll reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

An American woman has been arrested in the Bahamas. with conspiring to kill her husband just months after the couple filed for divorce. Lindsay Shiver is accused of plotting with two locals to kill Robert Shiver on July 16th while the couple was visiting the islands. CNN's Nick Valencia has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Two local Bahamian men were also taken into custody, and according to prosecutors, the accused agreed to carry out a murder-for-hire plot on the husband of American Lindsay Shiver on the island of Abaco in the Bahamas on July 16. That plot was foiled. It's not entirely clear how. There is some reporting out there that CNN has been unable to verify. We do know that the three defendants were in a courtroom in the Bahamas on Friday, and they were not required to enter a plea, but they were told if they were seeking bail that they could appeal to the Supreme Court on the island. Social media that appeared to belong to Lindsay Shiver showed that her husband and she attended Auburn University and it appeared to show a happy churchgoing family but it was back in April that her husband filed for divorce citing his wife's adulterous conduct as the reason for that divorce filing. The next day Lindsay Shiver also filed for divorce. Now we have reached out to the attorneys in those divorce proceedings but we have not yet heard back. Meanwhile the next court date in the Bahamas for those three defendants is October 5th. Nick Valencia, CNN, Atlanta. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
