Three hundred thousand troops are now standing by. I will also show you what our own crew encountered in the city of Ashkelon live on the air.Plus, an American killed by Hamas. I'll speak to the father of a 25- year-old woman from California killed at the music festival, along with her boyfriend, losing her life while trying to escape the brutal attack. And a story that we have been following here on this program. You now know Yoni, his wife and two young daughters taken hostage, their kidnapping posted on the Internet. I'm going to speak to the brave man who's looking for any sign of life, any sign of hope for his family. Let's go OUTFRONT. And, good evening. Welcome to a special edition of OUTFRONT. I am Erin Burnett tonight live in Tel Aviv. And this hour, the breaking news and the massive show of force along the Israeli border with Gaza. There are heightened fears across Israel tonight that its war with Hamas is on the verge of possibly taking another dramatic and bloody turn. Israel says 300,000 troops right now are amassing on that Gaza border, ready for a potential land invasion in the coming hours. And we saw some of them today. We were there along a ridge. We were just about three miles from the Gaza border. We could see all of those forces amassing, tanks. And while we were there, Hamas launched a barrage of rockets towards the area, which is near the city of Ashkelon, a city of roughly 100,000 people. And roughly 60 rockets were fired by Hamas. At least six were able to break through that Iron Dome all or, in part, as we understand it. And I want to show you some of what we witnessed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BURNETT: You can see those Iron Dome interceptions right above us interceptions right above us. There is a real sense literally of a dome. Because when the strikes come in, you literally look straight above, and you can see those interceptions right above us. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, those were coming from the Israeli fire, which we could hear those deep thuds, and that acrid smell of smoke from those attacks literally blocking out the sun at some point was completely unavoidable anywhere in that area.This is a country on the cusp of what could be a much bigger war ahead. In the meantime, in the United States, there is growing pressure for the Biden administration to do more to support Israel and retaliate for what officials now say is at least 22 Americans killed during the savage onslaught by Hamas. Seventeen at this hour, 17 Americans are also still unaccounted for. And officials believe that some of those are among the hostages that are being held captive by Hamas in Gaza. The number of Israelis killed during the attack has now risen to a hard to imagine 1,200 lives. We have a team of reporters standing by across Israel. And I want to start with Nic Robertson live in Sderot tonight. And, Nic, you have started to hear the sirens, streaks across the sky during these night hours, the thunderous sounds of explosions. How high is the tension where you are at this hour?",

They are out there in the open, and they are ready. And I want to show you more about what our crew encountered near that Gaza border today just about three miles away from the actual Gaza border. That's what we could see, some of that buildup, heavy bulldozers there as well. We saw troops, military equipment building up. A bus came up and an entire bus load of soldiers got off that bus and went and joined that group.

An ominous sign of what a ground invasion would look like and what it would really entail when you talk about 2 million people so densely packed on the other side of that border.And, as we were here, an airstrike that we heard, one where we literally ducked for cover as we heard it. As we're standing here pausing within a few seconds, up to 20 people in Gaza were killed in that airstrike. Just -- okay. All right. Are you coming to us? I'm not going to be on camera, okay? Come to us. You can come to us. Tell me when I go. Oh, my gosh. Yes. Are we live? All right. We're going to let you all listen. We are right here. I'm next to the camera. Albert is filming.

This is what Israelis here are living under and, frankly, yes, they are used to living under it. But there is a whole new, as Nic said, cadence. There is a new tempo. There is a new speed. There is the feeling that they are in the precipice of something much bigger. And OUTFRONT with me now here in Tel Aviv is Matthew Chance, our chief global affairs correspondent.

So let me start with you, Matthew, and your reporting. U.S. officials are saying in terms of what started this attack and possibly what could determine how much bigger this conflict gets.

But there is a difference, there's a gap between what we just said then and what Israeli intelligence is suggesting.They are saying to me, the senior Israeli official telling me earlier that Iran greenlighted the idea of this operation, didn't know about the timing perhaps, didn't quite understand perhaps as many of us didn't, the consequences of what this operation would be, but knew this operation was in the offing, and it was being planned.

Or is this going to end up in an occupation that maybe lasts for several months? That's a different sort of thing. That's what I would want to know if I was the commander. What's the end state we're going -- we're being sent in to achieve. No matter which, either of these two possibilities, it's going to be very, very difficult. You've pointed out the bulldozers. The Israelis are probably as good as anybody in the world at using bulldozers and other capabilities inside a densely packed -- a densely populated area like this. They know how to do this.
