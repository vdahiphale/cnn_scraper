The defense minister says that this means, and it shows, he says that Israel is now in control.

I can tell you that in the northern Gaza Strip, Hamas has lost its control.

According to a Hamas spokesman and source familiar with the negotiations, Israel asked for 100 to be released. Hamas' military wing claims negotiations are focused on the possible release of 70 women and children. And they want a pause in fighting for five days for that. The point is, is both sides agree that there is a discussion about a substantial number of hostages. And both saying that now to the press is a significant step. It is unclear if any deal would include freeing the ten Americans being held. Today, though, President Biden was asked and said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Erin, the IDF has just confirmed they're moving on Al Shifa Hospital. This is a development we've come to expect over the last days and even weeks as Israel has pointed to Shifa hospital, the largest in Gaza as one of the focal points of Hamas and its infrastructure. They have accused, and the U.S. has backed them up, Hamas of using Shifa hospital as a base essentially building some of their facilities, some of their headquarters, their command and control below it.This statement just coming out a few moments ago. I'll read you a part of this. It says: Based on intelligence information and an operational necessity, IDF forces are carrying out a precise and targeted operation against Hamas in a specified area in the Shifa Hospital. They then go on to say the IDF forces include medical teams and Arabic speakers who have undergone specific training to prepare for this complex and sensitive environment with the intent that no harm is caused to the civilians being used by Hamas as human shields in recent weeks. They say they have repeatedly warned Hamas to leave the hospital and leave the area as gun fights have raged in that area. They also say they've given opportunities for patients and others to evacuate Shifa Hospital. And in the last line of their statement, I'll read this quickly as well. We call upon all Hamas terrorists present in the hospital to surrender. Again, Erin, this is a development we have expected as they've moved closer to the hospital and given the amount of focus they have, or, rather, attention they have paid to it, it was assumed at some point, they would have to move on the hospital. In many ways, perhaps, if it can be proven that they are correct, that Hamas has used it as a base a way of vindicating much of what we've seen, much of what they have said over the course of the past several weeks. BURNETT: So, Oren, a couple of things that you said there. They're saying all Hamas terrorists, they're asking them to surrender. I mean, obviously, the clear implicit -- implication there is that they believe that there are Hamas terrorists inside, that they're moving on that, specific military operation. Is there anything in this that makes you believe that there is more to it in terms of a hostage rescue situation, or what do you read between the lines here of the information they're sharing?",

There's no indication whether they believe hostages are inside the hospital.They did put out video of Rantisi Hospital, one of the other hospitals in northern Gaza and suggested hostages may have been held in that hospital. At least as of this point, it doesn't look like the IDF has made an accusation or a statement such that they believe hostages were held at any point at Shifa hospital. But you're right, Erin, that's certainly something we'll keep an eye on.",

They are bringing in medical teams, I guess that would presume to be somewhat in support of the civilian, the dire civilian situation aboveground in Shifa hospital regardless of what Hamas is present there, Arabic speakers as well.Do you have any sense from your sources of while you say this is what has been expected, obviously, it's happening around, right, 2:12 in the morning where you are. Any sense of the size or scope of what this operation may be?",

      "sentences": "That's difficult to gauge from here. We're only 40, 50 mile as way. But it's difficult to know what's happening on the ground. How many forces are moving in. What kinds of forces. This would almost certainly be a special operations raid. They have units that are focused on tunnel warfare and specialize in that.Perhaps they are involved because the accusation has always been that Hamas is under the hospital and uses the hospital as protection above it. So, you'd have to believe that there are units that focus on special operations and operating underground. And they also say, and it's interesting, I'll point this out again. They say they are in a specified area in Shifa Hospital. So, it implies that they at least have some indication or believe they do at least where that connects, where aboveground connects with below ground, where Hamas is using the hospital. It is a large complex. There is a main area. There are outer buildings as well from what we have seen. So, one of the things we'll learn as we see more how this played out both from the Israelis and, of course, from the Palestinians and Shifa Hospital where they focused, what they did, what kind of forces they used, and how many forces took part in this. BURNETT: All right. Oren, obviously, stand by. And, as you get more information, you'll come back with us as soon as you do learn more. General Schwartz, when you hear about this operation that the IDF now says as we are all speaking is going on, the largest hospital in Gaza, specified area targeted by IDF forces, asking for Hamas terrorists present to surrender as they are going in.

You've been talking to the head of the neonatal unit who ultimately had to leave. She thinks more than 50 premature babies will die. We heard her speaking there and her voice breaking.When you hear this news and you know the complex, what do you think? I mean, it is obviously a very large -- I know it's about a dozen acres all in. It's a very large space. And they're talking about something very specific. Can you even comprehend what such a thing might mean? DR. BARBARA ZIND, PEDIATRICIAN, PALESTINE CHILDREN'S RELIEF FUND: Right. I'm concerned, of course, about those premature infants, the maternal fetal or newborn area is a distance from the surgical hospital and in general what they do is they have to do surgery on a newborn, they take an ambulance to get from one to the other. They didn't in this case. And the babies are right there within the surgical part of the department because they can get some warmth. But I just think of those newborns every day that they have low oxygen, that they're not fed adequately is really permanent damage to those babies and if they survive, even. And, so, I just feel like this is -- you know, this isn't going to help those babies at all, and still you have to weigh the benefit and risk. And the risk is for those 46 babies.",

Were you shocked to see a sitting senator challenge a witness to a fight, in the middle of a committee hearing? RODNEY DAVIS (R), FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE: Well, I am shocked that the whole incident happened. Markwayne and I got elected together in the House in 2012. He's a very good friend of mine. But let's also take a step back and ask, is there culpability for Bernie Sanders and more, in particular, his staff on the Health Committee putting Sean O'Brien back on the witness stand, knowing that there is bad blood? Did they know something like this was going to happen? And it's frustrating.

Another reason there have to put on additional information and video, is because of the criticism they have faced for operating around the hospital, strikes that have affected the hospital, and the deaths inside the hospital. Officials there saying they have to bury people, essentially right in the hospital complex, babies have died in the neonatal intensive care units, when their incubators stopped working, and the generators went all. This is led to a tremendous amount of criticism directed at Israel. So in some way trying to show or proof that Hamas used it, that at least tries to explain, in many, ways what Israel was getting at, as it closed in on the hospital. That information, those statements haven't come out yet. We only have the original statement from the IDF, and so, it's unclear how many forces have gone, and what types of forces though they say. They do have Arabic speakers to be able to communicate, with the officials there, the doctors, perhaps the patients. At least as of our last updates, there were some of the 650 patients inside, and thousands of people taking shelter inside of the hospital. So, it is an incredibly difficult place to operate.

International companies increasingly uneasy putting money into China, in part because of Beijing's unpredictable crackdowns.The U.S.'s reputation is also taken a hit in China, fueled by state media's anti-West messaging, and nationalistic post on China's tightly controlled social media, ahead of the summit, rising skepticism towards U.S. intentions. One Weibo user posting that this is a U.S. delaying tactic, its strategy of containing China won't change, but only intensify. Another posting, anyone who thinks that China-U.S. relations will become better is simply naive. It's just wishful thinking. Many in China supporting she's proposed new world order, one that's not read by the U.S. The U.S. now hosting this high stakes West Coast meet up with low expectations on the outcome. No more love seat for the leaders of two superpowers. Instead, both on a hot seat with the world watching if they can tamp down tensions. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
