This is a barrier island on the Gulf Coast that is within -- well within the cone where Hurricane Milton is expected to make landfall as a very powerful storm.They're anticipating winds upwards of 125 miles an hour here. And if you look behind me, this is a huge part of the concern. This is what Governor Ron DeSantis has been talking about since Hurricane Helene swept through this area a couple of weeks ago. There are piles and piles of trash. And there's debris that could very easily become dangerous. You have a barbecue. You have what appears to be a dishwasher. There are pieces of glass, buckets, plastic shreds of wood. There are people's personal keepsakes. I found this photo on the ground just a moment ago. There were children's toys. All of this very quickly becomes dangerous and a death trap for folks that are on this island, which has essentially one way in and one way out. And when you pair this with about 15 feet of storm surge, plus a foot, a foot, nearly a foot of rainfall on top of that with nowhere for the water to go, it is an extremely dangerous situation. And we're seeing scenes much like this all around the west coast of Florida. I actually want to go live to Paul Murphy, who's on Anna-Maria Island for us. And, Paul, you are hearing from a local official who said to you that it seems like Hurricane Milton, because of all this trash, was already here.",

The storm surge here, the police chief, Bill Tokoger (ph), just toldme - he's the police chief at Homes Beach (ph) -- he said they measured it at 400 feet on the main road just behind my photojournalist, John General. These -- we're seeing the same scenes that you're seeing in Tresure Island. There are piles and piles of trash all around this island. And talking with Chief Tokoger (ph), he is saying they're not going to be able to clean up everything. This is going -- some of this is going to come up and it's going to be projectile. And what is not going to be a projectile, that surge is going to take it over Anna-Maria Island and push it further into Manatee County. Now, over here you are seeing what residents and businesses are leaving. They've tried to board up as much as they can in a short amount of time that they've had. But they have gone from a recovery to preparation mode so quick, it is a head-spin. And you're just seeing, as we've gone through Anna-Maria Island, there's another truck just laden with trash. These are -- it is a 24/7 operation. Chief Tokoger (ph) told us that they're going to try and do as much as they can until tomorrow. And he had a message, the same message we're hearing for people, from leaders across the state. If you stay, they cannot get you. They we're able to do some water rescues in Helene. That will not happen with Milton. Once the winds, which are forecasted to start here as tropical-storm- force gusts, once they start tomorrow, that around 8:00 a.m., he expects that by noon they're not going to be able -- they're going to have to evacuate the island themselves. So starting at noon tomorrow, if you're here, there will not be help coming for you. You are on your own. And he's made that very clear. It's that same message we're hearing from it from officials: Write your name, write your number, write someone else's number, your date of birth on you because when they come looking for you, they want to know who to contact because you decided to stay.",

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says his military has, quote, \"Eliminated the successor to the late Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah.\"And this is coming as Israel's fight with Hezbollah only appears to be intensifying. Israel says more than 100 rockets were fired at Haifa, which is in the north of Israel, during a one-hour barrage today. That's an attack that happened as Israel is expanding its ground incursion into southern Lebanon and stepping up its renewed assault in northern Gaza. In the meantime, U.S. officials are telling CNN that the Biden administration is no longer pushing to revive a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hezbollah. They say it's instead focused on trying to shape and limit Israeli operations in Lebanon and against Iran, rather than halting hostilities outright. Let's talk about this now with CNN military analyst and retired Army Lieutenant General Mark Hertling. General, first off, what is the effect of taking out Nasrallah's successor after taking him out? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, the killing of the successor, a line of succession, the Israelis did not know that that was part of a strike that they conducted last week until just a few days ago when they -- when they found out that Safi Al-Din (ph) was also killed in a strike. But when you see the amount of leadership that Israel has killed in Lebanon, it just shows how they're trying to make the Hezbollah operation dysfunctional. And to eliminate and to decapitate the leadership change, they feel is one way to complement their kinetic strikes against ground targets and the amount of missiles that are coming from northern Lebanon. It's a sporting move, Brianna, but whenever you can eliminate the leadership of an organization, it helps in causing chaos in your enemy's ranks.",

There's great observation into northern Israel from that location inside of Lebanon.That what -- that is what makes the rocket launchers and the missiles fired from that area and even the anti-tank direct-fire missiles from those areas become so effective against the citizens of northern Israel. So putting that flag up there, as you just saw in that film, is an indicator that, hey, from Israel, hey, we've taken the high ground. They can no longer absorb our actions. We have eliminated did the enemy from this space. But as you reported just a minute ago, there's still firing hundreds of rockets at Haifa, which is less than 100 kilometers from that border. So there is still action by the Hezbollah forces. And now they're claiming they want a peace fire -- a peace fire operation, but they're asking the Lebanese government to do that for them. At the same time, they continue to fire these rockets and missiles. They fired 200 of them yesterday. They fired 100 of them just this morning.",

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [13:50:38] SANCHEZ: Breaking news into CNN. We just got an update on the status of Hurricane Milton from federal officials. And it appears the storm is now strengthening only two miles an hour from category five winds. It remains a very strong category four hurricane barreling toward the west coast of Florida.

I mean, when you're talking about 155 miles per hour, like you mentioned, you're splitting hairs at that point.You are at a high-end category four, low-end category five. It takes 157 for it to be a category five. So kind of like that saying, you know, half a dozen or six, you know, you are kind of splitting hairs at that point. When you look at the satellite, you can see that this eye has really opened up. It's incredibly symmetrical, classic. It is getting a little bit of that look like it had yesterday. So this is why we we're kind of expecting the intensity to pick up a little bit. It's still has the possibility of teetering -- you know, getting to that category five strength. But again, it's basically there. We're two miles per hour away. When you're talking about a 150-mile-per-hour hurricane, you know, what's two miles per hour, right? So just incredible to see it keeping it's intensity in these very warm ocean waters in the Gulf of Mexico that we know traps more heat because of climate change. And when you look at the track, we haven't gotten too many updates here. we're still expecting it to kind of teeter in the intensity more as it starts to get into some dry air and some of that wind energy. But still looking at a major hurricane. Even a weakening storm from 155 miles per hour is going to be an incredibly strong and destructive one that we continue to watch for Florida -- Boris?",
