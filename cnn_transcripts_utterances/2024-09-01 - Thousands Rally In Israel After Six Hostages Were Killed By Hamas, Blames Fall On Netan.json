Heated and passionate protests seen across the country over the last several hours there in Tel Aviv. Organizers estimating 550,000 people taken to the streets tonight.These demonstrators are demanding Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reach a ceasefire and hostage deal with Hamas. The country's largest labor union is joining the fight, vowing a nationwide general strike tomorrow. The mounting anger coming after the tragic news. The IDF recovered the bodies of six hostages, including an American from a tunnel in southern Gaza. The Israeli Health Ministry saying all six of these hostages shot by short range shots likely sometime between Thursday and Friday of this week. CNN's Nic Robertson is joining us now live in Tel Aviv. And Nic, we have seen these massive protests throughout the day and the evening there. It's now just after midnight in Israel.

It was kind of the only moment throughout the entire week that everyone in the audience's attention was focused very much on what was being said from the podium.And so I think at the White House, this is being felt very deeply, certainly by President Biden and Vice President Harris, who, as you mentioned, both spoke on separate phone calls with the parents of Hersh Goldberg-Polin earlier today. President Biden did release a statement last night saying that he was devastated and outraged by this death and he said, I have worked tirelessly to bring their beloved Hersh safely to them and am heartbroken by the news of his death. It is as tragic as it is reprehensible. And the president goes on to say, Make no mistake, Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes, and we will keep working around the clock for a deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages. And it was interesting, we did hear directly from President Biden last night after these hostages were discovered beneath Rafah, saying that in his view, that he believed they were still on the verge of an agreement, a ceasefire and hostage release agreement between Hamas and Israel, and he says, we think we can close the deal. So President Biden certainly of the belief that even this tragic discovery does not necessarily prevent those talks from ongoing. I think when you talk to American officials, they do say that it does add a layer of complexity to what was already very difficult and painstaking negotiations. There are some new questions today about how serious Hamas is about reaching a deal, and certainly American officials acknowledged that this will also apply pressure on the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and certainly we're seeing that play out on the streets of Israel today. It was interesting both in President Biden's statement and in the vice president statement, neither of them applied their own pressure on Netanyahu either explicitly or implicitly. Certainly, I think they're of the belief that pressure will very much come from inside Israel itself.",

The six were captured alive and they could have been saved, but they were murdered by Hamas after surviving the torture of being a hostage in Gaza.There is obvious anger, frustration, as you've mentioned, grief. And it goes without saying this is all happening because Hamas attacked Israel and took hostages on October 7th, so we start there. But I am curious, how much responsibility do you think Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu holds here for what has transpired? OREN: Well, again, the big question is, was Hamas willing to accept the deal or not? And if Hamas was not willing to accept the deal, then Netanyahu still bears responsibility for not convincing the Israeli public that he did everything possible, that he went the extra mile, even though Hamas said no. If Hamas said yes, and Netanyahu said no, then there's a different degree of responsibility. Either way, there's going to be responsibility. But that's the nature of the position, the buck ends there. He's the prime minister.",

There is a serious escalation of terror emanating from the West Bank. Israeli policemen, one policewoman was killed, were killed this morning.So there's a war going on multiple fronts here. And the tendency in this country is to be rally around, certainly the army, and if possible, the government to resist this onslaught from all of our borders.

But it turns out Israeli army gets too close to the hostages and it doesn't have information intact on the whereabouts of those hostages.The people who are holding those hostages, the Hamas terrorists are allowed to take those hostages and execute them rather than have those hostages fall into the -- be released by the IDF. So what do you do? Do you not ramp up the threat pressure? Do you pull Israeli forces back and hope Hamas will come to the table? Or will Hamas conclude, hey, now we know the secret of getting Israel out of the Gaza Strip, we just threatened to shoot hostages? There is no -- there are no good answers here. There are none.

Certain patterns emerged. The fake accounts repost each other. It's a sign of a coordinated campaign. Here, several of the fake accounts post the exact same wording. If you're voting for the man who survived an assassination attempt, I want to follow you. It's another sign the accounts are linked. And that's not all. Some of the accounts manipulated the images of these women. Have a look at Debbie's post, the original on Instagram and now the fake one on \"X.\" Her hat now reads, make America great again. Look at this t-shirt before and then Trump 2024. For now, we don't know who is behind all these accounts, but the former U.S. National Security Council spokeswoman who also used to investigate fake accounts for Twitter, told us this. EMILY HORNE, FORMER SPOKESPERSON, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: I don't think it's unreasonable to ask questions about, could there be a state actor involved? We know that there are multiple state actors who have been using social media to try to sow disinformation campaigns in the run up to the 2024 election.
