I'm Ana Cabrera in New York.Georgia voters get the last word once again, because after weeks of brutal campaign ads, rallies, big-name appearances, midterm voting officially will be over and so will the battle for the final seat in the Senate, incumbent Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock facing Republican challenger Herschel Walker. And while Democrats already have retained control of the Senate, this race matters and stands to send a big message to Washington. CNN's Dianne Gallagher is outside a polling station in Atlanta, and John Berman is here with me at the Magic Wall. Dianne, let me start with you. It's been a long, heated campaign for these two candidates. What's their final pitch?",

They had hard pushes yesterday, both campaigns out trying to appeal to their bases and make sure that they could get these Election Day votes.Now, the incumbent Democrat, Senator Raphael Warnock, has been leaning hard on his Senate experience, the two years that he's already been in office, talking about what he's accomplished and what he has yet to do. He is also trying to characterize his opponent as someone who is not just unfit for office, but somebody who perhaps wouldn't even take it seriously. Now, for Herschel Walker, look, he has been trying to cast himself as a roadblock, essentially, for President Joe Biden, trying to appeal to the Republican base here in the state of Georgia, and make up some of those undervotes, some of those votes that were between him and the Republican Governor Brian Kemp in the general election. He got fewer votes than the governor did. And so trying to find those votes, convince people to come out on Tuesday, and appeal to their bases has essentially been this closing message here.",

It wasn't that long ago we were talking about Georgia.You can see, Raphael Warnock, he edged out Herschel Walker just by 37,000 votes. There are three counties here that I have my eye on, Jefferson county, Sumter County, and Clay County. Why, you ask? There are 159 counties. Why these three counties? Because these are the three counties that were won by the Democratic Senate candidate, Raphael Warnock, but also won by the Republican gubernatorial candidate, Brian Kemp, just three out of 159 that split their ticket. And Herschel Walker, as Dianne pointed out, he got 200,000 fewer votes than the Republican candidate for governor, Brian Kemp, here. So, Herschel Walker, he needs to pick up some of these counties, some of these areas where the Republican gubernatorial candidate, Brian Kemp, did well.

There were 1.8 million early votes, which seems like a lot, 1.8 million votes, which is a lot. And they had record-setting days. However, I kept the results from one month ago up, because, in this election one month ago, there were 2.3 million early votes. There was actually fewer early votes now than then. The question is, how much of a percentage of the overall vote will this beat? Will there be a huge Election Day turnout, where Republicans tend to do better? Or will this 1.8 million we have seen already be the vast majority of votes? We just don't know. We have to wait until the polls call today to get that answer, Ana.",

But instead of high burnout, we're seeing high turnout in the Peach State, as we just ran through with John there. Let's discuss with \"Atlanta Journal-Constitution\" political reporter Patricia Murphy. Thanks so much, Patricia, for taking a few moments with us. What do you think is driving the voter enthusiasm here? Is it something specific to these recent Georgia races or is it part of the national political moment? PATRICIA MURPHY, \"THE ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION\":  Well, we are in a situation here in Georgia where it almost seems like Election Day has never ended since 2020. And so what I hear from a lot of Georgia voters that they want this to be over, they're ready for the Senate seat to be decided once and for all, but they want to be a part of deciding it. They voted for a two- year term for Raphael Warnock in 2021. That obviously had to go to a run-off. We have been through a couple of other statewide elections so far. So, this is what they feel like. This is the final test for Herschel Walker, for Donald Trump. This is the last chance for Donald Trump to pick up a win here in Georgia for himself. But down here in Atlanta as well, it really feels like just the time to put the Senate seat to rest, Raphael Warnock, if he wins, will get a six-year term. Otherwise, it would be Herschel Walker in there for six years as well.",

Donald Trump Jr. had an event there in 2020, filled up the entire room, standing room only. Really, you had to just squash yourself in there, nowhere to park. Last night, for Herschel Walker, it was one of a series of events that he's had there, and just thinner crowds than we were seeing in the general election. He had a shorter speech. His wife spoke as well. It just did not have that same level of intensity that we felt ahead of the general election. He even had an event in the (AUDIO GAP) venue, much, much larger crowd. And so we know crowd size doesn't determine everything, but it does feel like the enthusiasm and the intensity from the Walker campaign and from the Walker fans has really drained out just a bit.",

He did not, though, say that they have narrowed down the universe of people they may refer. The committee later have put out a statement saying that they're still deciding on the specifics. Those decisions will come in the day ahead. We're expecting this committee to be meeting later today. We know they have been looking at potential evidence of perjury, obstruction of justice, witness tampering. We expect all that to be part of the discussion. A source also tells my colleague Annie Grayer that they are going to focus when it comes to criminal referrals on the main organizers and leaders of the attack. So, there are still a lot of details the committee has to flesh out, beyond the top line that they are going to do these criminal referrals. Now, when they do them, they will send them to the Justice Department. And the Justice Department then decides what they want to do about that. Merrick Garland is certainly not going to take his cues from Congress, but they will look those over. They will weigh what they want to do going forward. We should also note that DOJ's investigation is in a very different place now that the committee is wrapping up its work than where it was when the committee began. We know that they had been investigating the January 6 attack on the Capitol, efforts to subvert the 2020 election. We know they had witnesses before a federal grand jury today. So, DOJ has been moving along. But, for the committee, this is a really significant step. And we have heard from a number of members that they felt like criminal referrals would be important to sort of sum up the amount of evidence they believe they have collected.",

That's the only way we can protect the entire electric grid is, we need the federal government to step up and mandate that companies take prudent measures to protect the electric grid against these known hazards. And one kind of final thought on the physical threat, we have known about this for four decades. In may of 1981, a federal report came out about the lack of physical security of the U.S. electric grid. So this isn't something new.
