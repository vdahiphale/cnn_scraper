So he repeated his false conspiracy theory that essentially that Joe Biden is behind this case, which was brought by a locally elected district attorney. He said Biden is behind it. He has his top people working with the DAs office to make sure everything goes right.There is no basis for that. That appears to be a reference to a former Justice Department official who went to work for the DA's office. But there's no sign that was anything but his own employment decision. In fact, this former official, Matthew Colangelo, had previously been a colleague of DA Bragg, so he rejoined his old colleague. He also claimed that Joe Biden is a crooked president should be on trial. I think that's mostly opinion, but I think it's worth noting, Jake, that we've had this extended Republican House investigation impeachment inquiry, no evidence of impeachable offenses, high crimes and misdemeanors, let alone criminal offenses. And then I should note, as you did briefly, that, you know, he read this big pile of documents of articles citing headlines denouncing the case. I googled some of them as he was speaking, so he read one -- talking about the whopping outrage in Trump's indictment. Well, that's harsh criticism. Where was it from? A Fox News column. He mentioned the Daily Caller, another right wing publication. I googled another headline from the right wing National Review he mentioned. So there are some liberal scholars, legal experts, publications who have raised questions about this case.

And I think, as you saw, former President Trump has left the building as well. But we are moving along much quicker than it seemed that were this morning.It looked like this morning we had a setback. Two jurors were removed out of the seven that had been seated. And it appeared as though this was now potentially going to slow things down. But then just in the last hour or so of court, things sped up very quickly and we'd suddenly gotten to the point where we seated this jury. And the jury is made up of a bunch of professionals in Manhattan. There is a speech therapist, someone who owns their own business, a couple of people who work in finance, a security engineer. The foreman is still the man from Ireland who works in sales. But now this initial jury of 12 is set. They will hear the evidence in this case. The judge is expecting that opening statements could begin on Monday. That day will be half a day because of Passover holiday. But we will now get into this trial with jury selection -- I'm sorry, with jury selection nearly complete, opening statements coming Monday. And at the end of the hearing today, there was a suggestion that we could even get to the first witnesses in this case on Monday, the Trump's team had asked for the identities of those. The prosecution said they were not going to turn those names over because of the tweeting that Trump has made and the social media posts he's made about some of the witnesses in the case. The judge said they're not required to. So, for now, the prosecution is not sharing the first witnesses that they will call in this historic case, Jake.",

That's obviously not the procedure, each side gets a limited number. I didn't devise this legal system and I'm not sure that this is the way I would have done it. Juror number 11 during voir dire said about Trump, he just seems very selfish and self-serving, so I don't really appreciate that in any public servant, so I don't know him as a person, so I don't know how he is in terms of his integrity. He's just not my cup of tea or it's not just -- it's just not my cup of tea.Now to me, I would think, well, that can't -- that person can't be fair.

But when it comes to the challenges, just because you don't like the person, those you do have to -- there's only 10 per side that is statutorily regulated. And so this particular juror clearly expressed that regardless of how they felt about Donald Trump, that they can be fair and impartial.And that's important because jurors take that really seriously. Think about it, you could have a murder case, for example. No one's going to be pro murder or like a murderer, doesn't matter. It's can you be fair and impartial in this case and evaluate the evidence for what it is? So, clearly that juror said that they could be fair and impartial.",

And the biggest danger in these types of trials, from the defense side particularly, is someone can say those magic words and the judge, you know, they won't be dismissed for a cause, there's no reason to dismiss them. Both sides run out of their peremptory challenges, those wildcard challenges that were just described, that you can just release a juror or have them dismissed for any reason without justifying it to the judge. But the biggest danger, and in this case with somebody like Donald Trump as the defendant, are people who are hiding those biases or will have those biases come out once they have to make a decision and all the evidence is in, even though they promised in jury selection that they could be fair and impartial and put those thoughts aside. And the biggest threat in picking a jury is relying on peoples promise to put their biases aside.And sometimes it's just impossible, particularly when you have somebody as intimidating as Donald Trump.",

And he's going to continue to reengage his base as activists and say he is a victim of the Justice Department.The problem is his game right now and his mission right now is to appeal to Independent and late decided voters. They're not concerned about what happens inside a courtroom to the former president, they're concerned what happens in their pocketbook to them right now. And so, my advice to him, given that he has a world stage every time he walks in and out, talk about what he's going to do for the economy, talk about what he's going to do for the border and security, those are the issues that voters are concerned about.

And that's the concern is when he puts out something that might be critical, whether it is -- whether it's a member of a jury or a family member of those involved in the case, the concern is how will his followers respond to that.So I think it's proper to discourage him from speaking out during this case.

And that's not actually when people go to the polls and they're deciding who they believe should be president of the United States, they want to know what that person is going to do for them.

I'm going to talk about what I'm going to do if I get a second term as president. I don't think he's capable of doing that. I think his narcissism won't allow him to do that.

I think America is the leader of the free world, Jake.And I think it's important in this moment that we accept that responsibility, that we renew support for the Ukrainians who fought against this unprovoked and brutal invasion now for more than two years, give them what they need to make the fight. Because as I said here today and have said for many years, I have no doubt in my mind, having met Vladimir Putin, that if Putin were allowed to overrun Ukraine, it would not be long before he crossed the border of a NATO country where our men and women in uniform would be required to fight. So the situation is dire. Vladimir Putin continues to brutalize the people of Ukraine, literally fired a missile at a hotel that took dozens of lives and injured nearly 100 men, women, and children. Now is the time for America to lead. And I'm encouraged to see the Congress moving in that direction.",

Speaker Mike Johnson has decided to do what he believes is right and trust the American people with the outcome in this moment. And I commend him for that.But as to your question, it's a fair question. But I will tell you, I honestly believe the emergence of this new Republican isolationism, I believe is something that has come forth in the last three years, particularly with the disaster at our southern border, the record inflation, and the Russian invasion into Ukraine. I think you have many Republicans that are falling back to the notion that we've got problems here at home. We can't solve every problem in the world when the reality is that anyone that says that we can't secure our border, revive our economy, and be the leader of the free world has got a pretty small view of the greatest nation on earth. We've done both now for 75 years. We can do both again. And in our administration, I honestly believe, Jake, that, you know, we built up our military, we stood with our allies, stood up to our enemies. We didn't go looking foreign entanglements. But when the moment presented itself, whether it was a fight against ISIS, taking down Qasem Soleimani, cruise missiles into Syria, we were willing to use American force.
