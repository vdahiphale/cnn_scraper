None of the evidence in this report shows that any of these payments were illegal. They also don't have any evidence that any of these payments were made directly to Joe Biden. Now, the White House has also been very quick to respond to these allegations. Here's the statement from White House spokesman, Ian Sams. It reads, \"Congressman Comer has a history of playing fast and loose with the facts and spreading baseless innuendo while refusing to conduct his so-called investigations with legitimacy.\" And now it's also just important to note that this is only some of the first findings that Comer and the Republicans on the Oversight Committee are releasing. Comer had said that he promises to have other revelations and other findings that he wants to release in the coming weeks.",

But every month, it does increasingly look like it has been contained.We now have 10 straight months of cooling inflation. You can see on that chart there, there was this big spike in 2021-2022 that has come down. Although we should note the slowdown has sort of leveled out. You can kind of see that on the right side of the chart. Also, at 4.9 percent, this is still more than twice what the Fed is really targeting. Now, on a month over month basis, we actually saw inflation heat up between March and April, although a lot of that is due to a big spike in used-car prices that is not expected to continue. Now, where are prices going up and down the most over the last 12 months? If you actually look, last 12 months, used-car prices are down sharply. We've also seen a record plunge in prices for appliances and for health insurance. On the other hand, grocery prices, they're still going up rapidly.

Put this another way, if you spend $100 as a retired household in 2000, that same $100 is only going to get you $64 worth of stuff. Inflation has basically eaten away at the value of the Social Security checks. And even though there are cost-of-living adjustments, they have not kept up with prices.

Jean Carroll. But that is one of the only things that they are really preparing for. And that's because Donald Trump, according to his advisers, and we've heard this for the last several years, is not a man who likes to undergo intense preparation like we see from so many more traditional candidates. The big thing to watch here, though, when it comes to particularly that question, talking about that verdict is how the voters respond in this room. We know that everyone here is going to be a Republican voter, someone who plans on voting in the primary. How are they going to respond to the latest legal entanglement that Trump is liable in this verdict. And that's something we haven't seen yet from Republicans. It's something to watch very closely.",

It leaves us with a requirement to cut 22 percent of everything else in the budget in order to meet the requirements they're demanding that we limit the 2022 budget numbers. The speaker and the Republicans don't like that I point that out. But that's not my opinion. It's just basic math. And here's what it does. It makes huge cuts in important programs for millions of working and middle-class Americans, programs that they count on. According to estimates, the Republican bill would put 21 million people at risk of losing Medicaid, including 2.3 million people here in New York State and 78,000 people right here in Westchester County. It's devastating. It's not right. The Republican plan would cut federal law enforcement officers, 30,000, including 11,000 FBI agents, 2,000 border agents, DEA agents, and so on. They would be cut in order to meet the requirements. They would have to cut that many law enforcement officers. It risks shutting down 375 air traffic control towers, including five right here in New York State, like Westchester County Airport. Because we don't have enough personnel. And I've long believed that we have many obligations as a nation, but the only -- if you've heard me say this before, I apologize for repeating it. But we only have one truly sacred obligation.
