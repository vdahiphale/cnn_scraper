So far, Trump has won 32 delegates in Iowa and New Hampshire.Reihan, I guess the question I have is, because ultimately this is everybody's dropped out, that's why this is over so early, with the exception of Haley. How did Trump clear the field, with the exception of Haley, so quickly? REIHAN SALAM, CONTRIBUTING EDITOR, \"NATIONAL REVIEW\": Well, one way to look at it is that if you think of him as an incumbent president, it's natural that he would clear the field quickly. It's natural that we have an overwhelming victory. When you look at it from that vantage point, however, it is striking that Haley did quite as well as she did in New Hampshire. And this is why it is so important for Republicans to unite around Trump at this point for Trump himself, because she is surfacing a vulnerability. And that's a problem for Nikki Haley, because you could say, hey, why not, she's got the money, keep at it. But what she'll be accused of very soon is of being a stalking horse for Joe Biden. If what she is doing is demonstrating that somewhere between 15 and 25 percent of Republican voters are deeply dissatisfied with the person who is indeed likely to be the ultimate nominee, what is she accomplishing other than making it harder for Trump to pivot to the center, as I suspect he's desperate, and his campaign team, is desperate to do?",

I think it's really important to show that you can get through this valley of death of streaming, like with a lot of things, and then it becomes very lucrative. It will only be lucrative for a few people. I would say, if I had to guess, Disney because it's a must have for families, and probably Max. And the others are going to be in a world of hurt.",

Republicans have recently said, look, we're not going to cut a deal with you. You have all the authority you need to get the border under control. And Texas has been in basically open revolt against the federal government over the border. The Supreme Court recently said to Texas, hey guys, you've got to subordinate your position to that on the feds, and they've said, nope, we're not going to do it.My prediction is that President Biden is going to reach an accommodation with Governor Abbott of Texas. He's going to say, look, we're not going to try to blow up your spot. We're going to try to come to an agreement because I don't need this noise. It's going to undermine his chances for reelection.",

And of course, what the A.I. robocalls were trying to do there was dissuade Democratic voters from showing up at the polls. And it is incredibly concerning. I think this is the beginning of what we're going to see in the next year and beyond. But especially in this election, A.I. is very dangerous when it comes to misinformation, the way it can mimic voices. And what it does is it pollutes our information system. People don't know what they're listening to. People don't know who to trust anymore, and that is going to, I fear, have a very, very terrible impact on our politics.",
