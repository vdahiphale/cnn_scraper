This is something the former president has been fighting for years. He took his fight all the way to the Supreme Court, and today they ruled against him. So, when might we see what's in his taxes? Our experts will get into that. And that's just one of the legal issues hanging around Trump that seems to be accelerating. But turnaround is fair play and the Republicans are planning a smerkish board of their own investigations that we will lay put for you. Plus, new information on the investigation into the Colorado Springs LGBTQ nightclub shooting. We have disturbing new details about the suspect's teenage years. And if you've ever played out in your own head what you would do in an active shooter situation, you're not alone. One of our guests tonight says, it's time to rethink the advice to run, hide, fight. We'll find out what she says to do. But let's start with Donald Trump's taxes. Here with me, our CNN senior legal analyst, Elie Honig, former Senator Al Franken and former Congressman Joe Walsh. Great to have all of you here. Elie, this is something he's been fighting for years. I mean, since 2015 when Donald Trump first was running for president, he promised he was going to turn over his taxes and show them to the American public, and he never did it. He claimed he was being audited. We have no idea. And now, what did the Supreme Court decide, and on what grounds today?",

And this, in many ways, is the typical Donald Trump legal battle. Here's why. He got wiped out at every level of federal courts. Started in the district court lost there. District court says tax returns go over. Then he went to the court of appeals, three judges, three to zero says, Trump, you lose, Congress, you win.Then he tried to get the whole D.C. circuit to take the case. They said, no thank you. So still, he hasn't gotten a single judge. And then he tried to get to the Supreme Court, and today they issued a two-sentence ruling saying, nope, we're good. Not a single dissenter. So, he loses at every level. Yet as you said, Alisyn, what does he get? Delay? Here we are. This legal battle, in particular has been going on for over two years and there's a new Congress.

How do you survive an AR attack in a confined areas, essentially the conversation that we're having. But if you're going to judge success by do fewer people die, the evidence is starting to show that engagement with the killer if you -- if you can't get out, because in these confined spaces you often can't, can decrease the harm. We've seen it. A great peril to the per -- to the person or people who are doing it, as we've seen in Colorado and as we've seen in other instances. So why does this matter? Because the run, hide, fight logo or the slogan. Everything people in my field believed in came out of 1999. It existed before, but really, Columbine. And that lesson was, the kids should get out or they should hide. But what happened when they hid in the -- in the library was that was where all the kids were killed. Two decades later, go to the Pulse nightclub when the -- when they died, most of the people who died, who were killed, were killed in the bathroom because they tried to hide there. And so, if running is not an option, it's not entirely clear hiding is a good option because of two realities.

In other words, if you're able to distract them, what you're trying to do is buy time. That is what these guns have not given us. They do not give the victims time to run, and they do not give law enforcement time to come in. I am, as you know, been on the show many times about, you know, the capacity of these guns to kill quickly has changed everything because you -- the best law enforcement response. Forget the Uvaldes. The best law enforcement response is still going to take a minute or two. And I have to address something that's out there in response to this. There's very minimal evidence that arming more people, a good guy with a gun makes us safer. There are instances and people like me have to be honest about those instances. In Indiana mall earlier this year, there was a gunman who killed a potential mass shooter. But it is not that more guns are the solution. If that were the case, we'd be the safest country on earth.
