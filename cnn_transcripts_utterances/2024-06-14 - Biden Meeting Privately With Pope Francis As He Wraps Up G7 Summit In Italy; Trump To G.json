For a Catholic, that is a tremendous honor. For Biden, it caps a trip that included a critical decision on Ukraine. The U.S. and others now plan to loan Ukraine $50 billion paid for by frozen Moscow assets.My panel is back. This is obviously a very busy trip. He went through in the G7 and when he came back from France with a brief trip back into the United States, including meeting his son Hunter Biden when he was here. But back to Italy, you talked to the Biden campaign, the White House, how do they see what he has done overseas and how it translates back home? EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER: Well, look, the G7 is on the calendar that this is when it comes, so that's what it was going to come. It's not a discontrol. Foreign policy never a big issue for voters politically. This time around, people are thinking obviously a little bit about Ukraine, whether it's the fight for democracy or it's people who are saying, why are we sending so much money overseas to Ukraine and Israel? I think importantly, it's not always just Republicans. You hear that from -- I've heard it from black voters, people who are watching what's going on there, and some of the pushback on that. So, this is tricky, but it is Biden standing among world leaders saying we have to stand up for democracy. By the way, two of the leaders that he's standing with, Macron and Sunak, may not be in their jobs for very long themselves. And so, there's a lot of countervailing things going on. And Trump yesterday in D.C. saying that his view of what's going on is that the world is laughing at us.",
