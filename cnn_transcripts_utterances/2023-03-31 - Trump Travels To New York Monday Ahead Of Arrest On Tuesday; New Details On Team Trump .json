Sources are telling us what the Secret Service is planning right now, as Trump tonight rips into the judge who we now know will oversee his case.Plus, Stormy Daniels speaking out tonight for the first time since Trump's indictment. The woman at the center of all of this the center of those hush money payments, breaking her silence. And you will hear what she is saying tonight. Caught red-handed? That is what the Kremlin says about that American reporter who has been arrested on espionage charges. Red handed. Well, a lawyer with detailed knowledge of the case warns us that there's virtually no chance of him prevailing in court. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, Trump plotting his next move. The former president we understand weighing legal options tonight after becoming the first former president to be indicted. We know that Trump will return to New York on Monday night and time to formally surrender. That's the term on Tuesday. His attorneys say they will challenge the indictment over hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels. Now, in a moment, I'm going to speak to Jim Trusty. He's one of Trump's attorneys. That's coming up in just a moment, but the context here is important. You got the Secret Service meeting with officials to prepare for that surrender and arraignment on Tuesday in Manhattan. The former president, we understand, faces more than 30 counts related to business fraud. On Tuesday, the president will be processed in this sense, just like any other defendant, mug shot, fingerprints. Of course, the way it's handled will be very different than anybody else given who he is. But these are the basics. True for anybody, true for him. We are also learning tonight that cameras are expected to capture Trump as he walks down the hallway and into the courtroom to appear before that judge. Now, as for the judge, I mentioned we've just learned who this person is going to be. Trump's already lashing out at him. His name is Judge Juan Merchan. Trump's declaring that Merchan is the same judge who, quote, railroaded his former chief financial officer of Trump Org, Allen Weisselberg, and he said that Merchan treated his company's viciously. Well, tonight, outside the courthouse, there are growing concerns about security. The NYPD has been installing new cameras downtown as Trump's allies are calling for action. Republican Congressman Marjorie Taylor Greene, case in point, saying on Twitter: I'm going to New York on Tuesday. We must protest the unconstitutional witch hunt. Senator Lindsey Graham, quote, on the way to the D.A.'s office on Tuesday. Trump should smash some windows, rob a few shops and punch a cop. He would be released immediately. Of course, Graham trying to make a statement about policy currently in New York, but obviously in light of the potential violence here, concerning. Kara Scannell is OUTFRONT live outside the courthouse in New York. Evan Perez is live in Washington. And so, let's begin with you, Evan, because I know you've been talking to your sources. What are you learning about plans for Tuesday.",

They were doing a run through to prepare for what's going to happen on Tuesday, and we've learned a little bit about what they're what they're getting ready to do.One of the things we saw Secret Service there today, they were testing someone in magnetometers. They want to make sure they -- it's up to their standards to control who has access to that area, and it's screened to their standards. What we're expecting to see is when the former president finally gets in there and is making his way into the court into the courtroom. We're going to see him walking down this hallway. He's going to be flanked by the court security but also by the Secret Service. Armed federal security agents are going to be around him, obviously. And then once he gets in into the courtroom. We expect that the court the security secret service is going to have extra people in there to create a barrier to prevent anybody from perhaps reaching for the former president. All of these things, of course, are carefully orchestrated. They've designed a number of routes for the former president to get from Trump Tower to the court house. They don't -- they won't decide which route they're going to take until the morning of, Erin, because again, they want to make sure that they have, you know, that they want to make sure the security is up to the standard. A lot of concern, obviously, that there are things that the former president who likes to create a bit of a media spectacle, that at the last minute he might decide to do other things -- Erin.",

Today, he's taking aim at the judge who will oversee his case. As you said, he's saying -- he's suggesting that the judge had railroaded his former chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, into pleading guilty.It's a false claim. Weisselberg agreed to plead guilty on his own. It was a voluntary plea, and he got a pretty good short prison or jail sentence for making that deal. Now, he's the -- Trump is also saying that the judge was vicious for his companies. The company went to trial. It was convicted by a jury of 12 New Yorkers, and the judge sentenced that company to the maximum sentence of $1.6 million fine. Now -- at the same time that all this is going on kind of publicly, and we have all these concerns as Evan was just describing about security. The D.A. is putting out this image that this is business as usual. We saw him today inside the courtroom. He went to attend the sentencing and in a completely unrelated hate crime case, he spent the entire time during the sentencing inside the courtroom when he left. I asked him if he could explain the significance and the importance of yesterday's indictment, but he was surrounded by increased security and just walked off without answering any questions. But he certainly is projecting the image that he is here doing his job day in and day out like you would if there was not this historic moment that was made yesterday -- Erin.",

Given that there are 11 different payments that were made, that in order to cover up the crime here and make it look like it was legal retainer, which it wasn't, they structured the payments and pay them overtime in 11 different payments. And each payment will have its own charge.And in addition to that, each business, each payment was made with a check. That's one charge and then there was a business entry for that payment in his ledger -- book and ledgers. That's another charge. And then Michael Cohen would give him an invoice, saying this was a legal -- a legal fee. That's another charge. So there'd be three charges per payment is what I think, so that equals 33. Then I think we could anticipate potentially seeing a conspiracy charge. There was a conspiracy here between Donald Trump, David Pecker, Michael Cohen and others to interfere with the election, and the conspiracy charges would allow -- that would allow the D.A.'s office to do what we talked about yesterday, that speaking indictment or the talking indictment that would talk about all the facts, and evidence in this case.",

So, there is the entrance to the D.A.'s office. There's the floor where he's going to be processed on for his arrest, and then they chose a route that keeps him out of most of the public corridors right up until you get within a few feet of that courtroom door in the hallway and a -- in a -- in a four that they basically isolated, they're going to taper off the activity in other courtrooms in the afternoon so that when his arraignment comes up, the building will have almost nothing else going on, except other arrangements downstairs.",
