His battle is over another issue, Women's Reproductive Rights and whether the Pentagon is going to end up paying for travel for service members who go out the State to get a legal abortion. I do want to ask you about why you think Senator Tuberville is doing this? Is it just about that niche issue or is there something else there? And what's your frustration with it?REP. ADAM SMITH (D-WA): No, it's just about that issue. And look, he's doing it again. And I say this, he doesn't believe in democracy, right? He doesn't believe in the system of government that we've set up. Yes, you have a vote, you lose, you move on. What he and the Freedom Caucus believe is, if you don't get what you want, do as much damage as you possibly can to the government. That's an incredibly destructive approach. And this case is incredibly destructive to the defense of this country, to the national security of this country. To not be able to have top leaders appointed to their positions really undermines our ability to protect this country, bottom line. And look, I know he doesn't support the travel policy, Joe Biden want, OK. Joe Biden put that policy in place. If Senator Tuberville doesn't like that, well go support a Republican candidate for President next year, go to the ballot box and make your case. But to undermine the ability of our country to defend itself, just because you didn't get your way on one piece of policy is destructive and wrong. Now, personally, I wish the Senate would change their rules so that one senator doesn't have that kind of power. So that we actually would have a democracy where you have a fair vote, the result comes out and you go forward.",

If you ask a question to dissect someone, what do you like, what don't you like? There's going to be criticism, that's the nature of it. But I come back to the fact Joe Biden's doing a good job. And he's in a strong position to run next year, and we'll go have that election. I mean, it's always going to be difficult, but I think the President have well positioned to run for reelection.",

You're listening to Larry Krasner, he's the Philadelphia District Attorney explaining that he is about to show a video that is extremely graphic that the family did see, and the family wants the public to see. But because it is so graphic, because it is so disturbing. And because we have not seen it and know exactly what happened there.We want to hold back for a second. We will bring it to you in a bit. But we also want to do it ourselves to make sure it is something that we can show our viewers. He's also said children should not be watching this video, it is that disturbing. Let us get over to CNN Brynn Gingras. She is the Chief Law Enforcement Analyst for us this morning. We've also got, of course, John Miller. John Miller is here, and we will get to him in just a bit. Brynn, what did you hear in this press conference? This is a case of the shooting of Eddie Irizarry, 27 years old. There is body cam worn video that the public is about to say.",

      "sentences": "Yes. So, rightfully, so, as the D.A. said there, it is disturbing video. I have been able to watch it from beginning to end its two police officers body cam worn video released in full as you just heard him say that the family did want that. And it's extremely graphic.And what it does show though, Sara, is that within five seconds of police pulling over Irizarry and exiting the police vehicle, the shots were fired. And here's the thing that's so important and why I can only assume the family wanted this video released in full. It's because the initial accounts of what police said happened that day on August 14th, was that Irizarry was driving the wrong way down a one- way street driving erratically. He was pulled over by police, police got out of the car, gave multiple warnings and shot him when he was outside of the car. It was only until Irizarry family attorney came forward with neighborhood surveillance video showing very clearly that Irizarry never even exited the car. And when they did a search of that car, they actually didn't even find any gun, they found two knives. So, it was very, you know, clear that there was some sort of distrust that just immediately comes with that community because it was such a different story than what police had initially put out there. But again, what we see in those two videos are not really even commands. I will mention that we're going through it and trying to figure out exactly what was said. But multiple shots were fired within five seconds to our count, after police arrived there on the scene. So, that's going to be a major issue that I'm sure that the D.A. is going to further discuss when he talks about the one officer Mark Dial's charges that are now against him. We do know Mark Dial has turned himself in. His attorney says that he doesn't know what charges he's facing just yet. I assume he will know or does know at this point. We don't know if it's manslaughter, we don't know if it's murder charges. We'll have to wait and find out. He says though, that he called them appalling, essentially saying that when he pulled over Irizarry, they gave commands and Irizarry instead went and pulled for some sort of weapon. And the officer in his mind retreated when he fired shots showing a clear indication that he rightfully was able to shoot those shots. So, that is a little picture of a defense that we might hear as this case moves forward. But again, yes, the videos are extremely disturbing. We are going through them, be able to release bits of them. But that is why the family wanted the unedited body cam footage out there, because the initial accounts from police are so glaringly different than what actually happened.",

There's a couple of wildcards here, is there a labor agreement about how soon it has to be turned over with them in the Fraternal Order of Police, but we've got to kind of figure out, what was the delay of days between knowing this is the officers account.

His window is up, his door is closed. Mr. Irizarry that the passenger officer, rapidly comes around to the side gun drawn held out with one hand.

And also, offering debt relief and more support for developing nations. And top of the agenda as well, is continued international support for Ukraine against the invasion from Russia.Another a big issue though, is also who is not attending. This is the first G-20 Summit, the Chinese President Xi Jinping has chosen to not attend, since he took overpower. And also, not attending Russian President Vladimir Putin. Join me now for more at the stakes and what really needs to -- needs to and could be happening here at this very big summit this week --weekend. David Sanger, CNN Political and National Security Analyst, of course, with the New York Times. David, talked to me about, as you've mentioned, to me, not just the two leaders who are not there, but the third that is also not there, President Zelenskyy of Ukraine. What does this mean? [11:55:07] DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL AND NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Kate, it really is pretty remarkable because President Biden has tried to turn every one of these big international gatherings toward the issue of building support for Ukraine, and isolating Russia. So, in this particular case, as you said, Xi Jinping is not coming. He's pretty preoccupied at home with financial problems, economic problems of the scale he's never seen before. Putin didn't want to show up because he didn't want to face the condemnation. And they couldn't get the rest of the group to agree on inviting President Zelenskyy, who you'll remember was at the G-7 Summit in Hiroshima, early in the summer has been at these other events. There's going to be a struggle even to get a communique here that condemns Russia, because the Russians, and the Chinese will probably veto that. So, it's not entirely clear whether President Biden will be able to take on the biggest issue. And that'll leave him with trying to make sure that they work on debt relief, as you said, grain and other food issues. And, of course, the bilateral relationship with India, as the President tries to deepen that. You'll remember that India's leader Modi was in Washington for a State dinner only two months ago.",

And obviously with Russia, we're back in something that is somewhere between a Cold War and a hot war.Unfortunately, not with U.S. troops or NATO troops involve at this point, but a full-on conflict. So, what we're seeing here is the world fracturing into other blocks. And you've seen President Xi in recent times, gathered the BRICS meeting to try to bring South Africa, Iran, others more into their orbit.
