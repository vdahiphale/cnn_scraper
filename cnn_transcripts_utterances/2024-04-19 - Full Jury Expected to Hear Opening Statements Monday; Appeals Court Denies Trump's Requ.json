And later how House Speaker Mike Johnson's act of bipartisanship with Democrats to pass aid to Israel, Ukraine and more is being treated as betrayal by some radical Republicans. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. At the end of a historic but also harrowing day in and around New York City courtroom where opening statements in the first Trump criminal trial are now set for Monday. Historic for what are by now familiar but still astonishing reasons a former president facing felony charges for the first time ever. Harrowing in that a deeply troubled man used the occasion to set himself on fire outside the courthouse. Tonight, all 18 jurors and alternates have been chosen. An appeals court judge declined to pause the trial for a defense motion to change the venue. The former president who yesterday complained the trial was keeping him off the campaign trail complained today that it's moving too fast. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The purpose is to show that he's dishonest, that he lacks trustworthiness.And so if you look at the various things prosecutors are trying to get in, I think the judge will allow prosecutors to ask him about the civil fraud trial, perhaps defaming E. Jean Carroll. Then you get into sort of more distinct, separate stuff, like the frivolous lawsuit against Hillary Clinton feels like a stretch to me. So I think the judge is going to do what we've seen him do quite a lot of, which is a little bit for the prosecution, a little bit for the defense, and then that'll inform Donald Trump's decision whether he's going to testify.

He carried a sign with him that said, \"Trump is with Biden and they're about to fascist coup the United States.\" But his conspiracy theory material, which was all over the web and he directed people to that today before he did this, doesn't have much to do with Donald Trump or Joe Biden. It's about cryptocurrency, and universities, movie stars, and millionaires and a whole web of corruption and murder. But I think the idea he came with was there's one place where every camera from every media outlet everywhere in the world is going to be at a specific time and I'm going to make sure that I direct them to my theories.

But there are intermediate versions and I've had this with some of my trials, where they will have the jurors, for example, meet at a certain common spot a few miles away from the courthouse and then bus them in using the underground tunnel to get in and then take them back to that location.You want to give the jurors a sense of security. Jill's absolutely right. It is a scary, at times traumatic experience, and anything you can do to make them feel protected, I think, is important to do. Now, that'll be up to the judge.

Don't research it. Don't get on the internet. Don't do your own looking into the details.And I always thought there's a certain number of jurors that would go home and they'd jump right on Google and check the case out. So it is perilous that no matter what admonitions you give, unless the juror gets on social media, there's really no way to check whether they've done some kind of sidebar research on the case and that is a problem.

Is it that you just don't believe those 12 jurors and six alternates when they say that they can be fair and judge the case on the facts? DAVID URBAN, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Look, Anderson, I think it's a tough situation, right? Everybody believes, I think, in their heart they can be fair, but they come to this case with their own set of biases. And if you just look at the demographics, almost eight in 10 people in Manhattan voted against Donald Trump. So if you're one of those folks, I don't know how the jury breaks down, but I'm wondering who they voted for. And if you didn't vote for the former president, I think you'd probably come to that jury, with a real bias against him.",

At times I thought he was too fair to Donald Trump. And he asked these jurors over 40 questions. They were examined, re-examined by the parties.Look, Donald Trump is a very well-known and very polarizing figure. But Americans take it very seriously when they promise to be fair and independent. And I have seen juries over my decades of practicing law, set aside that stuff that happens outside the courtroom. We also saw a huge number of jurors who said they couldn't be fair. Over half of each of the two panels that came in of 96 jurors stepping away because they felt they couldn't meet that standard. Twenty jurors excused, over 20, for peremptory challenges. Challenges for cause. I have every confidence that this jury and this judge can be fair and that Donald Trump will be judged on the evidence and on the law, which is how it should be.",

And if I may add, the judge has described the case, and the prosecutor will argue that the case is one of election interference. The judge explained that to the jury. The same fundamental pattern, voter deception to grasp power and then a cover-up, as we find in the 2020 election interference cases.

There have been injuries. At least three injured we're hearing at this point. It's not clear, though, whether this was an accident or whether this was an attack. We don't know that at this point. But the very fact that we have had denials already just goes to show the tensions in this region at the moment, Anderson. Israel doesn't often offer these denials for this kind of incident, but the fact that an Israeli official has felt that they have to say that Israel was not involved in this, just goes to show the tensions at the moment. Of course, it just comes hours after Israel did carry out that retaliatory strike against an army base in Iran as well. The U.S. also saying that they don't have any involvements. There are U.S. troops Iraq at this point, part of this multinational mission to try and beat ISIS. This PMF, this particular group has carried out attacks against U.S. troops in the past.

Another indication. For now, it's anger contained to shouting not sending missile salvos as it did last weekend. Approximately 350 drones crews and ballistic missiles fired at Israel following a deadly strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus almost three weeks ago, mostly intercepted without major damage. The Prime Minister shunning allies calls to take the win, vowed to strike back. Now, ambiguity, deafening silence from Israeli officials, except for an illuminating online spat.

Never mind even sort of breaking it down into that level of detail of aircraft and munitions and that sort of thing. And the Iranian side really seems to be trying to sort of paper this over the idea that there's going to be an investigation, but no one was hurt. And there were these objects that had caused them to switch on the air defense system in the first place. It doesn't seem as if there's any advantage at the moment domestically where they can sort of claim nothing really bad happened. And people are out on the street shouting about how bad Israel is. You know, the tensions just exist. And perhaps that underscores the fact that we won't know more the way that ambiguity works. But it also still sort of leaves those tensions out there.

Do you think this explosion in Iraq, I mean, is it worrisome in that it could change the equation if there was a miscalculation or a misunderstanding? MICHAEL OREN, FORMER ISRAELI AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S.: Yes, probably. Good to be with you, Anderson, as always. No, I don't think so. I think it's clear that Israel was not involved in the Iraqi explosion. It would be a very sharp turn from that longstanding Israeli policy we haven't put back in Iraq. And there's certainly no shortage of Iranian-backed militias in Iraq, including Iranian-backed militias who may have participated in last Saturday night's barrage against Israel. But it hasn't been Israel's policy. If anything, Israel is seeking to strike some kind of new relationship with Iraq. It's a Sunni Arab country, despite the fact that these large Shiite Iranian-backed militias. And, frankly, you know, who could be responsible for that explosion. You could take a number. Anything from certainly Americans who wanted to take avenge for the many, many attacks of 170 attacks that were launched at American bases by these militias. It could be ISIS. It could be any number of opponents that Iran and its militias have in the region. But no, I think Israel sent that unequivocal message. It's an ambiguous message. No one's taking responsibility for it. But I think the -- I think it's been internalized by the Iranians. And that message is very simple. Iran tried to smack Israel with 350 projectiles, some of them large enough to take out entire neighborhoods but couldn't do it. But all of it -- all Iran, Israel allegedly has proven all of Iran is vulnerable to Israeli capabilities. [20:40:12] COOPER: Well, in particular, you know, in terms of sending a message that the city where this strike took place in Iran, there's a uranium processing facility there, as I understand it, which has a role in the Iranian nuclear program.
