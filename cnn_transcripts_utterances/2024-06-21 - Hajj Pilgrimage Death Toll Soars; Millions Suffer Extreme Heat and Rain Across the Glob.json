And wherever you are in this world, it's your \"First Move.\" And a warm welcome to \"First Move.\" This is what you need to know. Hundreds of people have died in this year's Hajj Pilgrimage as extreme heat and weather is soaring around the world. The tech giant Apple is delaying the launch of its A.I. features in Europe and blaming E.U. regulations. And the U.S. Supreme Court is upholding a law that bans domestic abusers from owning guns. Sumo sensation. The famous Japanese wrestlers have come to New York as they take the U.S. by storm. We'll have that and a great deal more. We begin with the extreme weather that's being suffered around the world. Fires in Brazil, a heatwave in Saudi Arabia, flooding in China. Those are the pictures, and we'll get the details in just a moment. And we begin with the severe heat. 44 degrees Celsius in Mecca, 37 in Washington, and 29 in Rio de Janeiro. Those are the highs expected for Saturday. And keep in mind, in the case of Mecca and Washington, summer's only just begun in the Northern Hemisphere. The extreme heat is behind a soaring death toll during this year's Hajj Pilgrimage. The Muslim pilgrimage drawing almost 2 million people. Now, the official number gathered by CNN is about 480, but widely believed it will be much more than a thousand by the time all the accounting has been done. Indeed, we're seeing as many as 600 additional Egyptian worshippers may have died on the route to Mecca. CNN's Scott McClean reports. And I must warn you, some of the report is disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The stoning of the devil, one of the key rituals of the Hajj pilgrimage. It's a symbolic rejection of evil. But with temperatures unusually high, even for this time of year, the temptation here, a much simpler one. Water only goes so far when it's 120 degrees Fahrenheit. Azza Hamid Brahim found out the hard way. Like many, she gave up on the way there. AZZA HAMID BRAHIM, EGYTIAN PILGRIM (through translator):  We thought we were about to die. We didn't even have the strength to reach the steels due to the extreme heat. MCLEAN (voice-over):  The soaring temperatures making this year's pilgrimage exceptionally deadly. Videos shared on social media showed bodies on the sides of roads, their faces covered. In some cases, they looked simply abandoned.",

So, theyshould make such arrangements that during the summer season, when Hajj season is in the summer, they should arrange a bit of transportation for the whole. MCLEAN (voice-over):  Saudi Arabia says it did make some arrangements to deal with the heat, deploying 1,600 soldiers along with 5,000 volunteers, installing dozens of air-conditioned tents and overhead water sprinklers to cool down crowds. But many are traveling on tourist visas, rather than Hajj specific ones that don't get access to these amenities. They add to the nearly 2 million pilgrims expected officially. The sheer scale and the heat a deadly combination. BRAHIM (through translator):  A lot of people died. The ambulances were overwhelmed. You would talk to someone and suddenly they would die. It was a very hot day. MCLEAN (voice-over):  Hajj may be officially over but with Saudi Arabia yet to release any numbers, be that injured or dead, the number of victims may still yet sharply rise.

Dramatic footage from state media showing both urban and rural areas submerged in muddy water as emergency responders rushed to rescue trapped residents using speed boats, rafts, and in some cases, carrying elderly citizens on their shoulders away from their submerged houses. Choppers have also been deployed to send in supplies as many people have found their access to roads, electricity, and communication being cut off. Now, one of the hardest hit regions is the province of Guangdong, an economic powerhouse and home to more than 100 million people. While Guangdong is no stranger to these annual summer floods, scientists have said the effect of climate change has amplified extreme weather, making it more frequent and deadlier. With continued flooding in some regions, the worst in over two decades, wreaking havoc on people's lives and livelihood, some local authorities have raised the level of flood warning to the highest, as Chinese Leader Xi Jinping has called for all out efforts to safeguard lives and property. With the floods and rains continuing to pound Southern China, many parts of Northern China have been facing severe drought and extremely record high temperatures. All the while, with the National Weather Service now warning that heavy rainfall is expected to move northwards in the coming days to impact more provinces, including the financial center of Shanghai.

This very wetland, which isabout the size of all of England burned by about 26 percent in 2020. And this year, we're already seeing more fires at this time of year than we saw four years ago. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JONES (voice-over):  The world's largest freshwater wetland scorched. Aerial footage captures the true scope of the blaze. What should be green, now turned to ash. This month alone, authorities detected 1,729 fire sources in Brazil's massive Pantanal wetlands. And nearly 1.3 million acres have already burnt this year. Along with them, some of its precious fauna, like the approximately 10 million crocodiles that call this place home. Over the crackling of the fire, you can hear the animals trying to escape, this woman says. Last week, children had to be evacuated from a school in Mato Grosso do Sul State when the fire got too close. And residents tried to continue to make a living as if life is normal, under a blanket of ash, smoke hovering over the rivers in a glowing orange sky. But experts warned that the worst may be yet to come as the region is bracing for an impending heat wave. Isabelle Bueno is part of a conservation group trying to protect the Pantanal. She says too much heat, not enough rain, lots of wind, and extremely low water levels on the main river of the biome have created the perfect storm, and only six months after the last fire season. One firefighter telling CNN the scenes look apocalyptic. They've been battling the fire for 10 days, going into remote, hard to reach areas day and night. But the area is vast and resources scarce. This fire chief of a nonprofit brigade thanks a local farmer for giving his crew a ride to the fire line. Otherwise, he says, it would be two days walk. What Pantanal urgently needs, experts say, is airplanes to drop water on the burning patches. We do the impossible with very little and we need help, she says. (END VIDEOTAPE) JONES (on camera):  And Richard, this is why a group of NGOs is asking Brazil's federal government to ask for international aid. They say that this disaster is too massive and it's greater than the national capacity for response.",

And it's blaming the portion of the Digital Markets Act that requires interoperability. The law requires that certain tech services must be interoperable with third-party services. That's why, for example, iMessage is now talking to Android messaging so much better. But in the case of A.I., Apple says that interoperability could cause privacy and security risks for its users. Remember, that part of the draw of Apple Intelligence is that it can use a lot of users' personal information, their text messages, e-mails, photos, things like that to be able to give them a more personalized response as this A.I. digital assistant. So, it sort of makes sense that Apple wouldn't want to be handing over all of that personal information to third party services if its service is interoperable. But Apple says it is in conversation with the European Commission to try to come up with some kind of solution for this, because Apple is really relying on these A.I. services to get users to upgrade to the latest iPhones when they launch in the fall. Apple hasn't really given users a good reason to upgrade their going to upgrade their phones in about four years, and that's caused iPhone sales to slip. iPhone sales were down about 10 percent in the first quarter of this year, which is a real problem for this company. This is its real bread and butter. So, Apple is going to have to hope that it can come to some sort of agreement with the European Commission for how to roll out these A.I. tools.

This is security camera footage from nearby school. It was a southwest plane, and it triggered an altitude warning, though it was able to make a safe landing. Researchers say they found a 3,000-year-old ship wreck in the Med. It was discovered about 50 miles offshore by the Israel Antiquities Authority. It's the oldest shipwreck ever discovered, they say.

Now, talking with guns, ruling on gun ownership from the highest court in the United States. The Supreme Court has upheld a law that bans domestic abusers from owning a firearm.

Now, the ruling, and in terms of what it means, Areva Martin is an attorney and legal affairs commentator, and joins us from Los Angeles. At one level, this was a fairly sort of straightforward, eight to one.

So, if you think that your dog is potentially at riskor is actually starting to suffer, what should you do? How do you keep them cool? DR. BUZBY:  Four things. Number one, move them to a shade and a cool area. Number two, get them wet. It's evaporative cooling. That's really important. And then, you can promote that, by number three, putting them in air conditioning, adding a fan to just get that evaporation speeding up. And then, number four, really, it's important to get them to an emergency veterinary hospital or to your veterinarian because this is one of those things where people don't realize the magnitude of damage that's done to the internal organs.",

It was the Hawaiian born Konishiki who made it big and he reached the sport's highest levels. He was literally big, obviously, and he broke the record for the heaviest sumo wrestler. Now, Konishiki is back, working with the Seattle based SE Productions to bring sumo to the U.S. The sumo and Sushi Tour is wrapping up its stop in New York, and it looks to balance entertainment with respect for tradition.

We've got a really nice diverse group of guys from sort of your -- what the Americans would perceive as the stereotypical big guy, all the way down to some of the smaller and more agile sumos.

But these guys are incredibly, incredibly strong and they're incredibly athletic and incredibly talented. KONISHIKI YASOKICHI, HOST, SUMO + SUSHI:  People walk in into the events with a mindset already that they think it's just two big guys in diapers hitting each other. But as we go on in the show, as they explain the lifestyle and how hard it is to become a sumo and not even know, 99 percent of us don't make it.",
