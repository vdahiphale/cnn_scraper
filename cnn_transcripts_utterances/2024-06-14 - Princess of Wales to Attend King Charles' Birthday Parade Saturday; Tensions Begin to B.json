Tonight, Catherine, thePrincess of Wales says she's making good progress in her recovery from cancer, and will be attending the king's official birthday party this weekend. We'll have more on that breaking news. Then growing tensions between Israel and Lebanon with some dramatic cross- border attacks. We're live in Beirut with the latest. Plus, Vladimir Putin issues fresh demands to Ukraine to end the war, which Kyiv is dismissing as a complete sham. That and much more straight ahead. And we do begin with our breaking news. Catherine, the Princess of Wales says she is making good progress after her cancer diagnosis, and is now expecting to attend the Trooping of the Color, and that would be King Charles' birthday parade that is going to happen on Saturday, and it will be her first public event this year and first official appearance since Christmas Day. Kensington Palace released this new photo of the princess, you see it there in front of the tree on the grounds of Windsor Castle. Catherine also says she has had good days and bad days while undergoing chemotherapy and expects her treatment though, to continue for now. Royal historian Kate Williams is in London for us and we bring her in on this story. Again, she's committed to this event tomorrow, no doubt a boost for the entire royal family, and many in Britain and beyond. What does the timing tell you here? Very last minute and it was very carefully choreographed with that, you know, very evocative photo.",

We haven't seen any engagements from her whatsoever. And so, people are really going to be thrilled to see her, but I think her statement is very moving. It comes from the heart, she talked about how she was blown away, she said by all those statements of love and affection and all the support she's received. And it was very moving to hear her say I had good days and bad days, I'm not out of the woods yet, but chemotherapy is tough and clearly, she's going through a lot, and although, she is coming out for the king's birthday parade tomorrow, what a treat for us. It's not back to work for Kate. I don't think we're going to expect to see her doing full-time royal duties until at least the Autumn, if not longer, it does sound like she's suffering from as she talks about a lot of fatigue and really, you know, the side effects of chemotherapy, which as we know, are tough.",

And I think it's very joyous for Charles that this Trooping the Color which weren't quite the same for him, he won't be on horse-back, we don't believe, it won't probably be the same for him, but Kate will be there, giving her support, that the one engagement she has been able to do is Trooping the Color. But like I imagine, that considering what she's going through, it will be very tiring for her, she will need to rest to a great degree after this, because she is -- the chemotherapy that she's going through, we don't know what the cancer is, but clearly, she's very open about the fact that she -- as she puts it, she has good days and bad days.",

So, primarily with the kids and going in and out of school with them, and time at home I'm told that she started doing some work from home as well. And this is her tentatively spec -- stepping back into her public role as, you know, there for the public as well. It might not happen. I have to say because they're taking each day as it comes, and as she said, she's having good days and bad days. So, she has a bad day, they might have to counsel on the advice of the doctors. We shouldn't read too much into that. I'm told that doesn't mean there's a sudden relapse, any engagements coming forward will be considered day-to-day and on the day, in fact. Then after that, there may be some more engagements over the Summer. They're just going to see how it goes. She does -- you know, they are making big appeals to everyone to respect her privacy. She does feel she deserves some privacy as a patient to her medical records. But at the same time, she also feels that she's giving out more information than they should initially would from the palace as you remember, Paula, when you were back in London, they didn't give us any information about medical details. There are at least giving us some information, they feel that they are -- you know, there is a bit of a compromise there when the public wants to know exactly what's going on.",

He's saying that the Princess of Wales statement will be especially meaningful to those who are fighting cancer and for their families. It is true as he says that it will be an inspiration to see her. And yet, I take your point, Max, that look, this is an hour-by-hour thing, anyone who's had a person close to them or who has themselves gone through cancer treatment knows this. Max, I have to ask you though, that picture -- we can bring it up again, she's in front of that stunning tree in her solitude, as I say, she is wearing her ring, that stunning ring that was once on the finger of, you know, the Princess of Wales, Diana, before her.

Max Foster, thanks, as we continue to follow this news, appreciate it. Now, CNN medical analyst Dr. Jonathan Reiner joins me now to fill in a lot of the answers that we have so many questions to. Now, look, first and foremost, doctor, she did not disclose the kind of cancer that she has, and we certainly would respect anybody's privacy in so doing. But in terms of so many, hundreds of millions of people gone through this in the past who are going through it now, when you look at someone like this who says two very important things, the treatment will continue for months to come. And I know I'm not out of the woods yet. What does that tell you? What should we take from that? JONATHAN REINER, PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE &amp; SURGERY, GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY:  Well, I'm glad to see her feeling well enough to do a very public event. And I -- it's hard to imagine the amount of attention she'll receive when she's seen in public for the parade. And so, it shows a lot of courage for her to feel like she can do that. And it also, you know, from a medical standpoint, it's encouraging that she feels, you know, well enough to do that. I tell people who are going through major illnesses, like princess is, that there are a series of big hurdles and smaller steps that they have to make to recover. She's been through some of the big ones. She had, you know, extensive surgery and now, you know, she's -- you know, continuing to go through chemotherapy. Those are the big steps, but the small steps are, you know, returning to elements of your life, your personal life, your private life, and that's what it looks like she's starting to do. So, I'm encouraged -- I'm encouraged to see that. One thing that she did say is that she has good days and bad days, and I tell patients that as you recover, you want to start to have more good days than bad days.

So -- but it's impossible to prognosticate without understanding the particular cancer that was diagnosed and treated, and without knowing the extent of disease that they found. But it does appear that they were concerned about a serious threat to her life, and she acknowledges that now.

In terms of what the future is, this is where I think we have to empower Palestinians and let Palestinians be the ones who make that decision.

Mr. Putin, sweeping -- his sweeping demands for a ceasefire include a complete surrender and a call for Ukraine to abandon its plans to join NATO. He dismissed those conditions as, \"a complete sham.\" The U.S. Defense Secretary rejected the offer. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LLOYD AUSTIN, U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY: He is not in any position to dictate to Ukraine what they must do to bring about a peace. That's exactly the kind of behavior that we don't want to see. We don't want to see a leader of one country wake up one day and decide that he wants to erase borders and annex the territory of his neighbor. That's not the world that any of us want to live in. And so I think, you know, he is not, in my view, not in a position to dictate to Ukraine what it must do to pursue peace. Putin can end this war today. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And we go straight to Italy now, where we find CNN's international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson. And I will get to the pope, Nic, but first, you know, Putin elbowed his way into this summit. He had for years, we'll remind everyone, a seat at that table. Now, though, you know, as I said, it's a surrender, right? That's what he's asking for Ukraine. Surrender and we'll get that peace treaty signed. It was a predictable pronouncement, but what more does it tell us about Putin's posture at this hour in this conflict?",

They said the last thing he wants to see is an automated weapon that can select a target by itself, fire the bullets by itself, aim at the target by itself. Machines killing humans, he said, is something that should never happen. He wants to see the AI as a sort of a leveling up, if you will, that the haves don't get additional advantage over the have-nots and no one country benefits over another. And that was very much what we heard from White House officials talking about AI, the idea that in developing nations, they too can get the scientific benefits, the healthcare benefits, the agricultural benefits from developments that AI is bringing and is expected to bring more of. And the other thing that the G7 focused on as well around AI, of course, they are a group of nations from around the world, the most economically powerful democracies. And AI is a technology that spans the globe to better orient their governance around AI, basically work together to find the rules and guardrails around AI going forward.",

But it is also an effort to get the Israeli government to do more to also try to deter these efforts. The State Department spokesperson in a statement earlier today made very clear that the U.S. would not tolerate what he described as these heinous acts. And he called on the government of Israel to also do more to hold these individuals accountable and to ensure that this critically needed aid gets to the people of Gaza. As you noted, this organization, Tzav 9, has been placed under U.S. sanction. They received punitive measures by both the State Department and the U.S. Treasury Department earlier today. We will see whether these actually impact the group, but it is a notable public signal. The State Department said that for months, this group has been working to disrupt the aid that is going to Gaza. In a statement today, Tzav 9 said that they were doing so because they think this aid is going to Hamas. They called it shocking that the Biden administration would put sanctions on them. We should note that there is no proof that Hamas is engaged in widespread diversion of the aid, according to aid groups and according to the United States and U.S. officials. They have seen very little instances of this happening. There have been occasional efforts by Hamas to divert the aid. But on a wide scale, this is not happening. It is getting to the people in Gaza. And, of course, that brings up the biggest situation of all, is that this aid is critically, critically needed on the ground, Paula, as thousands and thousands of people there are reliant on it. Organizations, humanitarian organizations, have said that they are on the brink of famine, if not already there. Paula?",
