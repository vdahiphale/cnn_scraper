The latest we're hearing is that a residential building was hit in the Jabalya refugee camp north of Gaza City. Preliminary reports are talking about dozens of people killed and many injured. Many of them have been rushed to the nearby Indonesian hospital.Now, this came just a few hours after the Arabic spokesman for the Israeli military had warned the people of Shajia, Jabalya and Tufah, those are three areas to the east and the north of Gaza City, to leave by 4:00 p.m. today. We're talking about a lot of people basically being ordered to leave their homes and go to the south of Gaza. But it appears that this residential building, a six-story building in the Jabalya refugee camp was hit during that time when people were supposed to be leaving. Now, we understand that many of the people in that building were displaced. They had fled to that area from other parts of Gaza, which really underscores the fact that no matter what the residents of Gaza do, when following the orders of the Israeli military, they never really end up anywhere safe. Now, at this point, we just heard a press conference from the spokesman for the Ministry of Health in Gaza, who said that at that point, and probably these numbers are old, even though he only said them about 15 minutes ago, said 193 people have been killed since the collapse of the truce. Yesterday, 652 wounded. He said, 70 percent of the dead and wounded are women and children. Now, some aid has been getting into Gaza. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society reports that this morning, 50 trucks of food and medical aid did get into Gaza through the Rafah Crossing from Egypt. That comes after 24 hours where no trucks, no relief, food, medicine, water, or anything was getting into Gaza. Isabel?",
