This is really a pivotal moment in history with lessons that certainly stillresonate today, given everything that's happening in the world, maybe now more than ever. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOLODRYGA (voice-over):  Wow. Salute to ordinary men who did extraordinary things. Eighty years ago, global leaders wrapping up their visit to Normandy, France, to commemorate the D-Day invasion that changed the course of World War II. It was a scene filled with emotion, remembrance, and reverence. U.S. President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden visited Normandy's American cemetery and laid a wreath at the gravestone of a soldier who had lived in Mr. Biden's hometown of Wilmington, Delaware. Earlier, the President spoke to the crowd and drew parallels between 1944 and the present day, making a reference to the rise of authoritarianism around the world. JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  In their hour of trial, the Allied forces of D- Day did their duty. Now, the question for us is, in our hour of trial, will we do ours? We're living in a time when democracy is more at risk across the world than any point since the end of World War II, since these beaches were stormed. ASHER (voice-over):  Just incredible seeing the air show there. And obviously, you see President Biden looking incredibly proud, raising his fist in the air there. One of his one of the key aspects of his message today is really that some things really are worth fighting for. Some things really are worth sacrificing for. The ceremonies included a 21-gun salute and a flyover, as you just saw there. But the focus wasn't on the dignitaries in attendance, but the men who put their lives on the line so many years ago. French President Emmanuel Macron bestowed his country's highest honor on 11 of the D-Day veterans who helped defeat Nazi Germany in the pursuit of freedom. For many of those veterans in attendance, most of them aged 100 and older, it will be their last reunion. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You know, the gratitude andthe, you know, lionizing, really, in the true sense of the word, of these people, so many of whom are buried in this cemetery -- the American Cemetery at Colleville-sur-Mer. And what we also know is that, as you saw, you know, President Macron and Biden, they both greeted about two dozen of the American D-Day vets, the surviving vets, and they all thanked them for saving the world. I mean, literally, that's what they said, \"You saved the world. You changed the course of history.\" And their gratitude knew no bounds. And it just reminds me of what I was reading, because on the day itself, General Eisenhower, who was in charge of Operation Overlord, as it was called, the biggest ever amphibious landing -- amphibious invasion in history before or after, basically sent out a broadcast to the rest of occupied Europe, saying, and I'm paraphrasing, that even though our forces have not come to all your countries yet, liberating France will be the beginning of the liberation and of the rest of Europe and getting -- getting the forces of tyranny and authoritarianism out. And so, I spoke to this wonderful veteran, 101-year-old Jake Larson from the United States. He had even lied about his age when he first signed up for the Army in order to be able to join. He was 15. He pretended he was 18. Anyway, he came here and survived D-Day. And when I asked him about the heroism of it all, he had a really humbling response. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Well, now, of course, you have all these leaders telling us the very real fact is that all of our ordinary, free, democratic lives are at risk by the current war raging in Europe, the war in Ukraine, which they have again vowed to stick with Ukraine and make sure that it succeeds, that it wins.

And we rememberthat that D-Day happened some three months after Putin had annexed Crimea and had started this invasion of eastern Ukraine and had, you know, started to occupy that. And he was invited. And one of the reasons was that people like Angela Merkel, who was chancellor of Germany at the time, it was Francois, sorry, it was President Hollande of France, President Obama of the United States, and they thought that they would be able to try to get Putin aside and obviously thank the Russians for the heroic sacrifice they met, they committed also in World War II, but also try to get him into some kind of peace negotiation, peace deal to end the war in Ukraine. And, you know, there was a lot of talk. There were these fancy dinners they had on the sidelines. But, of course, it never worked. And so, this has been something that's been very, very, you know, difficult because Russia did lose 20 million people during the Second World War. And so, they really did contribute a lot, but they have not been invited back since. And, in fact, I think Putin may have attended twice, but certainly not since 2014.",

This is one of 180 UNRWA facilities, so not all of the U.N., but just that main U.N. agency in Gaza, UNRWA facilities that have been targeted since the beginning of the war, according to Philippe Lazzarini, the head of that agency. And in this strike, the Israeli military says that it targeted this U.N. building, which was a school converted into a makeshift shelter for thousands of displaced Palestinians. The Israeli military says they targeted this building because 20 to 30 Palestinian militants, both Hamas and Islamic Jihad, they say were sheltering in this facility and planning attacks against Israeli troops. Now, they haven't provided any verifiable evidence for us on that front. It's not the first time, of course, that they have made this claim. What we can verify to a certain extent is the claim by the Israeli military that they are unaware of any civilian casualties in this strike. And indeed, in this case, we have seen women and children among the dead and the injured in this strike. And according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital's records of the dead who were brought in here, a majority, actually, of those who were killed were women and children, 14 children, with the youngest being four years old, and nine women were killed among the 40 people who were killed in this strike. You can see in the remnants of this strike, not only are there mattresses covered in blood torn apart in the aftermath of this strike, but we also saw the remnants of an American-made munition, the GBU-39 small-diameter bomb, according to munitions experts who reviewed our footage. And this is not the first time the Israeli military has used this type of weaponry.

Still, you can look at the remarkable crowds that have turned up here on Gold Beach, and similar scenes are playing out over on Juneau and on Omaha now that the international ceremony is over and wrapped up. Ordinary people who've come to pay their respects, pay their tribute, you've had that extraordinary solemnity and emotion that you just heard at the heart of the ceremonies that were held up at the cemeteries, at the heart of the speeches by the leaders of the Allied nations. But down here, what you have over the course of the day is a great deal of joy, celebration almost, of what was achieved. Remember that 80 years ago today, it was a country that had been occupied for four years, that was liberated against the odds. And I think as the Allied soldiers came in with this equipment that you can see out here today, the jeeps that have been so carefully and lovingly maintained, amphibious vehicles like this duck that we're on, that we've been going in and out of the water and that helped resupply the troops in those crucial days after D-Day, allowing this extraordinary military victory that seems so improbable as the first men took their first steps onto the beach. For the people here in France, seeing those soldiers come in, little by little, reconquering inch after inch of French countryside in the end, in the face of the improbable German collapse, partly, of course, thanks to that heart of that strategy that was at the very center of Operation Overlord, to trick the enemy into thinking that these Normandy landings were just a small part of a much greater invasion that was going to happen elsewhere. Such careful coordination over the course of a year involving so many millions of troops from such a wide variety of Allied nations in the end leading to the defeat of the Nazis. For the people on these shores, the French who'd been living under Nazi occupation for four years, it would have been something of a miracle to see suddenly Allied soldiers come in in the name of their liberation. And that's very much what's at the heart of these celebrations here today. French people, the Dutch -- we've seen people from Poland, Italians, all kinds of different European nations, people who've come from across the continent to pay their tributes to what was achieved for them 80 years ago. And that continues to resonate because, of course, what we've seen is the presence of President Zelenskyy here today and very much at the heart of the messages of the Allied leaders and President Biden, mainly, that the extraordinary bravery that was seen on these beaches 80 years ago today, the fight for freedom that was at the heart of this Operation Overlord, ultimately so successful, as improbable as that success may have seemed initially, is also at the heart of what's playing out in Ukraine today. And that's something that we've seen out of the more solemn and official ceremonies here, as I say, just a great deal of excitement and joy at being here. And they've come with their vehicles. They've dressed in period costumes. The music of the time is playing. And for the French who've gathered here, an important moment to remember what was done for them 80 years ago. Bianna.",

Well, we're all supposed to be excited about that. I mean, it's absolutely ridiculous. It's a complete joke. We all need to be doing between five and seven percent right now. And one of the lessons from the Second World War is that quantity really, really counts. You know, people have been arguing ever since, for example, about the virtues of the Tiger tank versus the completely brilliant U.S.- built Sherman tank. Well, the Tiger tank was incredibly complex, constantly breaking down, was very expensive, very heavy. And yes, it had a big gun and lots of armor, but that didn't count for a hill of beans when it was coming up against 49,000 Shermans, 1347 Tigers built, 49,000 Sherman tanks, 84,000 Soviet T- 34s. You know, quantity has a value of all its own. And what needs to happen now is that we need to get those factories going and start building artillery pieces and more tanks and getting those planes out of the mothballs and recruiting and putting up the wages of the honest, lowest, lowest squad in the chain and get going and kept moving fast now. Because if there's one lesson from D-Day, it's that it is the ultimate apogee of coalition warfare, of coalition, of coordination, of cooperation. And it shows what Western democracies can do when they're fully focused, pulling together against the conflict, you know, towards a common goal, towards a common crusade, frankly. And, you know, everyone needs to pull their finger out now and in very quick order.",

      "sentences": "Well, thank you. What's really interesting, Zain and Bianna, is that there are so many aspects where we seem to be relearning the historyall the time. And yet the lessons are pretty clear. You know, as James was mentioning, you have to be organized. And when you think about all of the different things that Eisenhower and his staff and, yes, General Montgomery and Field Marshal Montgomery, excuse me, and everyone else was doing at that particular point in time, they were dealing with a highly organized enemy, but an enemy that had limited resources. And they knew that. They also had a big intelligence advantage. And one of the most interesting things, I think, about D-Day was the fact that our intelligence was really, really ironclad as to what the Germans had, how many units they had. They had about 50,000 troops in the area where the Normandy invasions took place, the beach landings took place. We did that with, you know, over 150,000, in some counts 170,000 Allied troops, 73,000 of those were Americans. And that really made a big, big difference because Eisenhower was a very meticulous planner, but he also knew that one of the key things about combat was that the first thing that you put in the trash bin is the plan that you actually worked with once you made contact with the enemy. Because the planning is important, you put all those things together because you've planned something, but you know that once you make contact with the enemy, you're going to have to adapt, you're going to have to overcome, you're going to have to respond to what that enemy is doing. And what the Allied forces were able to do 80 years ago was really a textbook case of being able to actually make these things happen. They were able to improvise, they were able to move from the hedgerows to the roads and then go into areas where they eventually, you know, several months or a month and a half or so later were able to get into Paris. That was a major thing that they did and I think the key thing here is that when you put this in a modern context is we have to be so adaptable. We have to understand that sometimes our enemies are fighting a war against us and we're not even recognizing that it's a war. And we have to understand their point of view in order to properly respond to it. It doesn't necessarily mean that we go full bore after them in terms of the weapon systems that we bring in or things like that, but it does mean that we are prepared for whatever they might do next.",
