      "sentences": "Robert Hur warned us. I'm Michael Smerconish in Philadelphia.Thursday night was not just another poor first debate performance by an incumbent president ala Reagan in 1984 or Obama in 2012. They both rebounded from rust. Nor was it akin to President Ford who offered a single poor response about Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, or papa Bush looking at his watch. In other words, this was not a one off. Instead, what ails Joe Biden cannot be fixed, and eventually it comes for us all. Before the debate, I said that delivery would matter more than substance. Meaning, how things were said would matter more than what was said. After the debate others confirmed my prognostication including the Washington Post editorial page, which wrote, \"this debate may not be remembered for what was said, but rather for how it was said.\" The part of my prediction that was wrong was in thinking that Trump and his enablers had so lowered the expectation bar for Biden that he could easily exceed it. He didn't. Trump littered the debate stage with falsehoods. CNN counted 30 to Biden's nine. On any other night that would be the takeaway. But this time, all anyone will remember is Biden's befuddlement. And rookie mistakes were made by the political veteran calling into question not just his acuity, but his debate preparation. Was he unaware that he'd be on camera even when not speaking? Or did they tell him so only to have him forget? In all of those closed door sessions at Camp David, did they roll any tape? Did they show him what he would look like on a split screen? Either it was a bad look that reinforced either way it was a bad look that reinforced the concerns that have been noted in countless polls for the last year. David Wasserman of The Cook Political Report tweeted this, \"This debate making abundantly clear that Biden's insistence on running for another term, when 66 percent of voters in our swing state polls believe it's likely he won't be able to finish a second term has gravely jeopardized Democrats prospects to defeat Trump.\" It was the earliest debate in our recent history for a reason. It was team Biden's idea to end run the Commission on Presidential Debates. Why? Because he needed a reset where national and battleground polls have consistently shown him trailing Trump. Biden didn't want that narrative to cement over the summer, only to have people return in September when voting will immediately be underway. Gone are the days when Labor Day marks the start of the fall campaign, not in an age of mailing early balloting. Seen this way, the debate, it was a bit of a Hail Mary by Biden. And it was a battle fought according to Biden's rules. First, his insistence that there be no RFK Jr. Left to the Commission framework and timetable, Kennedy would arguably have fulfilled the requirements to get on the debate stage and he still might for September. Second, no audience, third muted mics, and to boot, two commercial breaks providing a respite. So eager was Trump to get Biden on a debate stage that he readily agreed to those terms. And in the end, that framework benefited Trump more than Biden. Trump's speech was untethered as usual. But his body was measured. He was not the candidate who looked over Hillary nor the candidate who interrupted Biden in 2020. Biden at times, was just lost. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I appreciate it.And, yes, we have a piece on the front page of today's Wall Street Journal that looked at some of Biden's most frequent foreign trips and its interactions with diplomats from around the world. In a way, we've been really interested in how Biden import himself in these small closed doors meetings, largely because the White House has said to us repeatedly and said to the world repeatedly that, look, if only you saw the Joe Biden we see behind closed doors, he has sharp as a tack. I think one White House spokesperson even said that he is sharper than ever when behind closed doors, and that really launched in an effort by my news organization to try to find what are these moments behind closed doors. And so was recently, some of my European colleagues were able to work with our sources. This is an effort that really got in earnest after the debate, this second piece of the story, and they were able to talk to some of their sources who've been with the President in some of these diplomatic meetings with world leaders, and some of them -- some of the participants have walked away quite concerned.",

So, there is absolutely no incentive, particularly before the debate for any Democrat to say anything about the presidency. And it's been a topic that is radioactive.So I think the expectation that a Democrat is going to stand up to their party and explain what they're seeing behind closed doors in a candid way is, I mean, that's was a bar that we were unable to cross in that story.

If the Democratic candidate or the president elect drops out after the Electoral College has met, then the Constitution finally kicks in, and the vice president elect will be inaugurated.So it's three different scenarios.

      "sentences": "Well, first thing and so the audience know how this process works, I hear your commentary and my year, I sit for 20 minutes, let me do this interview. You and I, I've never heard someone speak my words. I actually freaked out the control room because I said to them, I hear my own head echoing. You have a dead on, you have it perfectly. I've never complimented a host on air live.Man, you understand this. The American people are frustrated with these two candidates. They do not want Trump and Biden running against each other. They do want to change. All the Trump people hate Joe Biden. All the Biden people hate Donald Trump. There's only 4 percent that are truly undecided, which is why I think that you're going to see a smaller shift this time even though everyone says that Donald Trump won the debates. In our own focus group, the key moment is not that 12 went to Trump, one went to Biden in one state undecided. The key moment is not that they said to me that they didn't like Donald Trump, but they're afraid of Joe Biden, the key moments when they said and communicated that Joe Biden should not be running. They did so with respect. They did so out of sadness. A significant number of people in that group voted for Joe Biden in 2020 and they said he's not the same guy now that he was then. And so what I don't understand and what I cannot answer, if average voters see this, what do the people who work for the president, who respect him and revere him and appreciate all that he's done what they don't see. And I know use the words behind closed doors with your interview. Here's the problem. The American people start Donald Trump here, Joe Biden here side by side, they heard Trump's insults, they didn't like it, they heard Trump's asides, they were offended by it. But he completed senses, he completed thoughts. Maybe some of them weren't true, but they thought he still was presidential. And then they listen to Joe Biden, having trouble with simple sentences, having trouble completing his thoughts. And that's the power of focus groups to explain things that polls don't explain. And what they saw was somebody who not only, and I'm going to use their words, not only is asking for four years, our group said can he even make four more months? So that's the way it is.",

What this debate is going to do is to give Trump a lead in every one of the swing states, which gives him the presidency.There was still time on the Democratic side to say, thank you, Mr. President. Thank you for all that you've done. Thank you for your legislation. Thank you for your leadership. But we need somebody else as the candidate against Donald Trump because I will say on the record, on your show, if things stay as they are, Donald Trump is the next President of the United States. And the Democrats have to come to grips with that. And I say this, not as a Republican, not as a Democrat, as a pollster, the debate was so significant. Fifty-one million people watched. OK, viewership was down from 2020, but 51 million people saw the comparison. And two thirds of them chose Donald Trump.

And she has said that she intends to give the parties about the same amount of time that they had on the clock when the case went up on appeal, which was just over two months. So, if she wanted, she could theoretically try to schedule a trial to start in late August early September, but that is right on the cusp of the election. I don't know that a single district judge is going to have the nerve to say, well, we're going to take one of the two major presidential candidates and confine them to a courtroom eight hours a day in September and October of an election year.

A, what's the scope of the presidency as it relates to an election? B was Trump within or without that scope? And C, a big question that I have no idea what they're going to say, what if it's mixed?What if 80 percent of his conduct was outside the scope of the presidency but 20 percent was in? Do you pull that 20 percent out of the case? I have no idea. And that's why I'm eager to see this opinion.
