We start with breaking news. A dramatic development in yesterdays mass shooting at Apalachee High School in Georgia. We are waiting a news conference by authorities that is to take place any minute.

In coordination with District Attorney Brad Smith, the GBI has arrested Colin Gray, age 54, in connection to the shooting here at Apalachee High School.Colin is Colt Gray's father that was arrested yesterday. He is charged with the following: Four counts of involuntary manslaughter, two counts of second-degree murder, and eight counts of cruelty to children. Mr. Gray, these charges stem from Mr. Gray knowingly allowing his son, Colt, to possess a weapon. This is a very difficult time, as we know for students and parents and so many I know of students and parents here in this county and around this state are afraid. You all have likely seen reports of incidents of other students making threats today at various schools around our state. In each of these incidents, police and law enforcement took charges, they made arrests, acted very swiftly as we take incidents like this very seriously across this state. This is a time for all of us as a community and a state to come together and remain vigilant. Students must be supported and encouraged here in this community across the state to contact a member of their school faculty with any and all concerns of suspicious activity that they may see. Local, state, and federal law enforcement will continue to work together around the clock in relation to this incident here and any other incidents that come up around this state that raise concern to the safety of our students, faculty,, and citizens here in the state of Georgia. Additionally, Colt Gray that was arrested yesterday for this incident has now been charged with four counts of felony murder and again, we will continue to work tirelessly to finish -- complete this investigation as we move forward. I will go ahead and mention to you, and as I say, sometimes I'm going ahead and apologize to you because as you all know that this is a murder investigation. It is a very serious investigation, one that we take serious, one that we will continue to diligently work on and be very thorough with it, with the GBI and our local partners here. So, you'll have to forgive us if we don't answer a lot of the questions that you ask. I know you have many and we wish we could answer many of them for you, but we still obviously want to maintain the integrity of this investigation because it has a long way to go for it to be finished. Again, I also want to remind everyone that we need to continue to pray and support the victims that were involved here. The school teachers, the faculty, the students, obviously, those that lost their lives, their families and those that were injured. So, I'd like to call on the sheriff to come and give you a brief update on the status of those that were injured from yesterday's event. Thank you.",

But the biggest threat to human life is unsecured guns in the home.And this is from the perspective of Georgia, where it's not unusual to have guns or rifles in the home, where people go hunting where it's for sports. And they said, you know, these, need to be secured. If you look at the history, we were just talking about in Newtown, Connecticut, you know, he got the gun that he wasn't supposed to have access to and killed his mom. She was his first victim before he did the massacre at the school. Remember the story in Virginia of the first-grader who showed up to school and shot his teacher with a gun that was not secured, that mother was charged in that case. In the Fort Lauderdale case, the Marjory Stoneman Douglas School, you know, that shooter got the gun from home where he was with his dad. So, this is a recurring theme that you have guns and you have kids, they have to be secured. It sounds obvious, but I think parents in these cases are going to be looking at their own liability.",

He also leaned heavily on the idea that tariffs can pay for trillion dollar tax cuts, despite the fact that idea has alarmed many mainstream economists.
