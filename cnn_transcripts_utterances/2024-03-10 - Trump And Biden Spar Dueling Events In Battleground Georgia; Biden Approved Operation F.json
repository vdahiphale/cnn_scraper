The New Zealand man was able to climb out with the help of his skis. Hi, everyone. And thanks so much for joining me this afternoon. I'm Jessica Dean in for Fredricka Whitfield. And Americans now have a clearer view of what the 2024 race for the White House will look like. This weekend President Biden and former president Trump traded sharp jabs at dueling rallies in the battleground state of Georgia, which holds its primaries on Tuesday. Biden won Georgia in 2020 by about 12,000 votes. And the state will once again be key to winning the White House in November. Trump used his rally to mock Biden's State of the Union speech. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Two nights ago, we all heard crooked Joe's angry, dark, hate-filled rant of his State of the Union address. Wasn't it -- didn't it bring us together? Bring the country to -- together? I'm going to bring it together. (LAUGHTER)",

And the campaign is well aware of this. The president himself acknowledged that Palestinians are being, quote, \"unfairly victimized\" but it is again another demonstration of what the president needs to navigate as he hits the trail this week where he goes to New Hampshire, Wisconsin, and Michigan. But the president also clearly trying to capitalize on his State of the Union address. That really got the crowd going. They erupted into cheers whenever it was mentioned and the campaign tells CNN that in the 24 hours after the State of the Union, they raised $10 million.

And it just speaks to the difficult situation the diplomats and NGOs that are on the ground are facing. More diplomats and some NGOs are also evacuating personnel today.And, you know, certainly these diplomats and others have been working for aid organizations are no stranger to the danger -- to the deadly circumstances that have been present in Haiti for years. But you have seen such an escalation in the last week that has closed the airport, that has closed other parts of Port-au-Prince that has led to demonstrations outside embassies that have turned violent. And so very clearly the U.S. embassy, well, it says its embassy in Haiti will remain open. They are trying to lower the footprint, the number of diplomats who were there, the number of diplomats that are in currently exposed to danger. And so that is why they've taken this unusual step of evacuating them by military helicopter to get them out of harm's way.",

Like the Port-au-Prince airport, which they managed to close for the last week after planes were shot at and some planes actually bullet damage to them.And so it's an escalation in the country that has been wracked by gang violence for far too long. And this prevented the prime minister of Haiti, Ariel Henry, from returning. He was abroad trying to finalize a deal with the government of Kenya to bring in about 1,000 troops to help quell the gang violence. And now as a result, he is unable to return to his own country.",

We don't have any official confirmation that it's actually left or when it might leave from the port of Larnaca. But as you've mentioned, all of this is being held pretty tightly under wraps for security concerns. We don't even know exactly where in Gaza that ship is going to try to offload its cargo.The ship itself is not that big also. We're talking about a ship that is less than 120 feet long and so limited capacity for cargo, but it will also tow a small barge behind it. And it's carrying just the essentials. We're talking about rice, flour, beans, lentils, canned goods, things like that. The real basics that people need to survive because of course that is the situation that people are facing in Gaza. They need just the basics to get by. It is being organized by World Central Kitchen. Obviously they're active in disaster zones in the United States, war zones and other disaster zones across the world, and they're getting help from an NGO called Open Arms. The reason being is because they have the ship. This ship is normally used to rescue migrants in the Mediterranean. Now it's being used for very different tasks, but there are still a lot of question marks. What we have been told is that the plan is to build a jetty in Gaza where the ship will arrive and then it will be offloaded by crane. But again, how long it will need to be, what it will be made of all active question marks. And of course this is happening in an active war zone, so no shortage of complications. And the reason for the security is not only the war, but also the fact that you have desperate people there who might understandably tried get to that aid as quickly as possible, maybe even get on the ship. And this is all being organized by civilians and so a lot of people will be watching closely how this might work. This is separate, completely separate from the U.S. effort also to build that floating pier, Jessica. That effort could take a month or two. Something that the Israelis say that they welcomed, but of course it's worth noting that all of this could be avoided if Israel would simply allow more aid to get into Gaza much, much quicker.",

And although 80 percent of Israelis want Netanyahu to resign, it is still problematic for U.S. president to say, OK, I'm circumventing him, but in practice, this is what Joe Biden is doing.In an interview on MSNBC yesterday, he even raised the possibility of going to the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, and giving a speech the same way that Netanyahu did in 2015 that he went and gave a speech in Congress above the head of then-President Obama. So I think the relationship between Biden and Netanyahu are going to a very bad place. They're in collision course.

They've created this bond. And so CNN spoke to Irma Garcia's nephew, John Martinez, who said that it was Meghan who called his mother to tell her that she was coming. This was after a South by Southwest appearance where Meghan spoke at the conference and she came to the home and surprised Claudia Martinez, who is Irma's sister with a birthday cake. They obviously singing happy birthday together. But as I mentioned, the most important thing here was that she spoke to or they spoke to Joe and Irma's children and talked about their future and their goals. And the families saying that they were humble, that they were down to earth. They are compassionate. And you know, they have offered support to this family and others. Meghan had already been to Uvalde and a spokesperson for her had said that she'd gotten a personal capacity to offer condolences and to just show her support. And it's support that these families really need after a very difficult week. You know, last week, an independent investigator cleared local police officers of wrongdoing essentially saying they've done nothing wrong. This is after the Department of Justice and other agencies had agreed that there was a disastrous law enforcement response in this shooting. So a lot of the families of the victims just incredibly upset and saying they're going to continue fighting for their children, for these victims, and for justice -- Jess.",
