Let's check in to see how the DowJones is faring right now, and you can see, we are flat with a slight positive bias, but mostly red across the day. Well, those are the markets and these are the main events: Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy reiterates his call for more air defenses after a Russian strike on a grocery store leaves at least 51 people dead. Why the US economy is facing a season of strikes. And the surprise shakeup in European aviation. The Air France KLM CEO explains why they are taking a stake in SAS. Live from Dubai, it is Thursday, October 5th. I'm Eleni Giokos, in for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Welcome to the show and tonight, Volodymyr Zelenskyy is calling an airstrike on a Ukrainian grocery store a deliberate terrorist attack. The strike appears to have reduced the shop and cafe to rubble. Ukrainian officials say it killed at least 51 people in the small village east of Kharkiv. That would make the war's deadliest civilian attack in 18 months. Ukraine's Interior minister says nearly a fifth of the village was wiped out. Its Defense minister said there were no military targets in that area, and we will be live on the scene with Fred Pleitgen in just a moment. Meanwhile, I want to take you to another story. Zelenskyy says this attack highlights the need for air defense systems. He met today in Spain with European leaders and also addressed the situation in the United States. Zelenskyy expressed confidence that Washington would stay in his corner despite the political turmoil there. The ouster of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has paralyzed the US Congress. The hardline Republicans who forced McCarthy outs to oppose more aid to Ukraine, and here is what Zelenskyy had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I think you're starting to see the resolve of the Europeans starting to erode. And of course, the United States is, in a sense of political basket case over the last few years, and first with Trump and now with a divided Congress, it does appear that situation is not getting any better for the Ukrainians and I think this is exactly what the Russians are waiting for.

I mean, you look at what's going on in Washington, and it really does seem to be a superpower of falling to pieces, the so-called arsenal of democracy is now a political basket case. And in Europe, it is somewhat more unified. In terms of, you have Germany, France, Britain, for instance, which are fairly strong in their resolve when it comes to supporting the Ukrainians, but other countries, like Italy, I can tell you that sort of anecdotally, many Italians I speak with, most of them, in fact, don't seem very supportive of the Ukrainians, many are supportive of the Russians. In fact, there was an opinion poll conducted throughout Europe. In Italy, it was found that 27 percent of the respondents came out and said they blamed Ukraine, the EU, and the United States for the Russian invasion of Ukraine. I mean, it sounds absurd, but certainly you have a variety of prominent figures in Italian politics, who have never hidden their sympathy for the Russians, as opposed to the Ukrainians -- Eleni.",

In the notice, federal officials justified the decision in what they called high illegal entry. The new wall is set to go up in the Rio Grande Valley and its budget is already approved. The US Border Patrol reported over 300,000 encounters in that area between last October and August. President Biden said he would not build any more wall when he was running for the White House. Kayla Tausche is at the White House for us. Kayla, great to have you there. This is a major policy pivot from the Biden administration.

The administration is saying that it tried to appropriate those funds for other purposes, but were turned down by Congress because they had already been allocated for the border wall. And so, the Department of Homeland Security filed a filing last night saying that these funds would indeed be earmarked to create, construct these additional 20 miles of border wall. But in that filing, the secretary of Homeland Security cited an acute and immediate need to prevent unlawful entries, as the reason why these funds needed to go forward to construct the border wall, which has become a much more difficult argument for the administration to defend. They are, as you mentioned, waiving dozens of federal laws including the Clean Air Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act that are sure to anger environmentalists as a way to move forward with building this wall, and it all comes against the backdrop of funding talks with officials on Capitol Hill about how the government will fund itself from mid-November through the following year. And of course, many Republicans have been seeking wholesale changes in border policy as part of those talks. So certainly, this policy change is going to figure into those conversations -- Eleni.",

Now, we're trying to expand our horizons a little bit. We have a huge audience. We have six to seven hundred million visits to our platforms each year, and we convert roughly eight percent of that into a transaction, which means that the runway is phenomenal to do more. We have spoken to our consumer base and asked them permission to say, would you be interested if we expanded our offering beyond charms and bracelets, and we get a big thumbs up. So in fact, we've already started building that out a few years ago, but now essentially, we're going to be much more deliberate in trying to elevate our brand to be associated not just with charms, but actually with meaningful jewelry as such, and therefore they will kind of open up the addressable market for this company enormously, and which means that we have a growth prospect which is very interesting for the future.",
