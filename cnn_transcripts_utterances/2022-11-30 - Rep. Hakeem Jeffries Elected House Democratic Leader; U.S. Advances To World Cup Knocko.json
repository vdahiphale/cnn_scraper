House Democrats have just elected a new generation of leaders. Manu Raju is standing by with us with the breaking news on this. Manu, what are you hearing? MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes, Hakeem Jeffries has now just been elected by House Democrats as the next Democratic leader. This is a historic move because he will be -- he will now be the first black leader of any caucus in Congress in U.S. history. And just moments ago, the Brooklyn Democrat was named as the person who will succeed Nancy Pelosi by his caucus voted by voice vote essentially. He had run unopposed. This had been expected in the aftermath of Nancy Pelosi's decision to step aside and no longer run the caucus that she has dominated over the past two decades and said paving the way for this new generation of leaders. Now, Jefferies will also have a leadership team that is all brand new. In addition to that, have Katherine Clark, the Massachusetts Democrat, she's expected to be the number two, she'll be voted on here in a matter of minutes as well. Pete Aguilar of California will ground out the top three members, also new, much different generation three outgoing members, Pelosi, Steny Hoyer is the number two, Jim Clyburn, all in their 80s different than a much younger generation 50s and a 40-year-old as well in the top three positions, but significant here as the Democrats prepare for life without Nancy Pelosi and life in the House Minority next Congress, Kate.",
