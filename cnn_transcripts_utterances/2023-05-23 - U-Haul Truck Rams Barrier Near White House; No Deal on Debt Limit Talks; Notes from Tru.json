He is identified as -- we believe his name is pronounced Sai Varshith Kandula, 19 years old, from Chesterfield, Missouri. That information coming to us from the U.S. Park Police.And setting the scene for you here, this is where this occurred. We're about 200 yards now away from the White House. According to witnesses and police, the vehicle pulled up here. There are scuff marks here on the curb. There is oil absorbent sand and other things there that were laid down after oil spilled out of the truck there. It hit this barrier multiple times and there was concern in the minutes immediately following the incident that there might be explosives inside the U-Haul truck. And for that reason, that hotel there, the very famous Hay-Adams Hotel, was briefly evacuated but then the FBI checked the vehicle and found no explosives inside that vehicle, so people were then allowed back into the Hay-Adams Hotel. Again, new information on the suspect, identified as 19-year-old Sai Varshith Kandula of Chesterfield, Missouri. What we can also tell you is that police found inside the truck a flag that had a -- appeared to have a swastika on it, a black backpack and a roll of duct tape. There was a witness who observed the vehicle hitting this barrier multiple times, Alexander Garcia. Here is what he told the media last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And I think today it's safe to say that the security structure, you know, withstood this type of attack because, why? The Secret Service anticipates this.These types of attacks have happened before, especially with vehicles, whether it's an errant vehicle, you know, part of a motor vehicle accident, or an intentional attack. And the physical structure around the White House isn't just around the building, it radiates out in concentric circles. And we see the benefit of that security structure today. While close, that truck did not get close enough to cause any type of damage or actually threaten the president's life in that moment. Now, the Secret Service is investigating exactly with their law enforcement partners what happened and the motivation of this driver, but right now it's safe to say that the security structure around the White House worked, the complex was safe and, most importantly, the president and the first family were safe.",

And they have immediate action drills in terms of, one, quickly assessing the threat, this inbound threat. They have to maintain a 360-degree view of the complex because this could have been a diversionary tactic from the very beginning. So, they can't just focus all of their attention on this one incident, they have to make sure that the entire complex remains safe throughout the entire duration of the activity.So, in the White House itself, they go into an elevated state of readiness. If the situation does escalate, it's a multiprong attack, the Secret Service is very well-prepared to defend the complex. So, there's a lot of things going on at once, focusing on the president, the complex and then the public at large, and that's why we saw the Hay-Adams being evacuated.",

In fact, I talked to a number of Republicans this morning who say that they have a lot of trust in Speaker McCarthy to go ahead and negotiate a deal that actually cuts spending. But that is the key, they want a deal that actually cuts spending. And right now they don't have one. White House negotiators and Republican negotiators are billions, tens of billions of dollars apart when it comes to those top line spending numbers and agreement to decide how much money to spend in the future. Meanwhile, Joe Biden has some progressives who are also raising the stakes that they could have an opposition to any deal that he cuts with Kevin McCarthy. Here's what one progressive, Representative Pramila Jayapal, told my colleague Manu Raju yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL (D-WA): I think there would be a huge backlash from our entire House Democratic, you know, caucus, certainly the progressives, but also in the streets. You know, I mean, I think that this is -- it's important that we don't take steps back from the very strong agenda that the president himself shepherded and led over the last two years.

And that is something that you have heard the president really try to hammer that point over the course of the past few days.Look, White House negotiators feel that they have been flexible in their discussions with Republicans. You have also heard from top Democrats up on Capitol Hill, like Hakeem Jeffries, the minority leader in the House, who said that the White House has offered some type of compromise when it comes to spending levels by agreeing or suggesting that it -- they should be frozen at current year levels. That's something that the Democrats don't necessarily want to see happen, but that is something that the White House has put forth in order to try to get some bipartisan support, draws bipartisan support for an agreement. But really this is all coming at an incredibly critical moment. You have this ticking time -- this ticking clock really when it comes to having to push this agreement through Congress. It would take some time as that likely June 1st date is quickly approaching as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has reaffirmed. But what you've heard from the White House and what you've heard from Republicans, that there is a real sense of urgency in this moment. Yesterday the president said that the conversations with McCarthy have been productive. But beyond that the White House has been very tight- lipped about the state of negotiations, what they have -- are putting on the table or taking off the table at this moment. But it's really coming as the U.S. is potentially staring down economic catastrophe as that early June deadline is very quickly approaching.",

They believed that they would show Donald Trump potentially committing a crime in his conversations -- or wanting to advance a crime as he was talking to Evan Corcoran.And now we know that these notes, they number into the dozens of pages, there are multiple sets of them. They range in a very crucial time period from the moment that the Justice Department sent that subpoena to the Trump Org to hand over all classified documents in Donald Trump's possession, and they catalog Evan Corcoran's direct conversations with Donald Trump, his client, the whole way up to when the Justice Department comes visiting in June to collect 38 classified records that Evan Corcoran found and believed there was nothing else left at Mar-a-Lago, even though there were many other hundreds of classified records there. And so these notes, our sources -- we have a team of reporters who have been talking to people about them and one source told us that they were overly detailed, another source said that Trump's legal team was actually surprised the amount of detail here. And so we don't have much more inkling of exactly what would factor into the potential obstruction investigation. We know that Donald Trump was pushing back in these conversations, and it says that in the notes, that he -- how to respond to the subpoena. He didn't necessarily want to.

They're saying, can you let us reopen this lawsuit so we can put forward the statements that Trump made at the town hall and on social media so that the jury can consider that for punitive damages because the purposes of punitive damages is to punish someone held liable.
