So, if it's not over the west, it's over the central and eastern parts of the country, right? Even Atlanta is starting to see an increase in temperatures well above average. And there's a lot of humidity associated with this as well.Heads up today, we have the potential for some stronger storms across the upper Midwest and across even the Tennessee River Valley. So, we'll keep an eye on that, with a potential of a flood threat. The reason we have a diminishing wildfire threat across the Pacific Northwest is because of a cold front that's kind of the catalyst to cool things down throughout the Pacific Northwest. That'll be short- lived because the heat builds in for the second half of the week. You can already see red flag warnings and watches in place for portions of the west. Now, I want to give you a quick heads because the National Hurricane Center is monitoring a disturbance that is well off shore from the Windward Islands, but this could potentially develop. It's about a 50 percent chance. And this is about seven days from now. So, something we'll monitor here across the tropics. Jim.",

Now, Hezbollah has conceded that one of their fighters was killed today, but didn't go into the details of whether he was part of that - he was a victim of that Israeli drone attack. But certainly what we're seeing is that rising concern that this time we are getting very close to what could possibly deteriorate into much - something much more serious.
