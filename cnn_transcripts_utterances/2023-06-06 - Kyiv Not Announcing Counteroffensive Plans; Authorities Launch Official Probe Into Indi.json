This is just another sign a major Ukrainian counter offensive is underway. Kyiv though maintaining complete operational silence, saying it will not broadcast its plans. But they are acknowledging their latest offensive maneuvers at least in some parts. Monday, Ukraine's deputy defense minister said the country's sources are making successful advances in several directions around the beleaguered city of Bakhmut. And President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is praising those soldiers for their work.

So, you know, this is -- this is something that becomes very interesting, because it's going to be difficult for the Ukrainians to do what they should be doing.

He is however set to give evidence in court on both Tuesday andWednesday. The Duke of Sussex has been selected as one of four representatives to testify in court out of a list of more than 100 claimants suing the British newspaper group for allegedly obtaining private information through unlawful means, namely through phone hacking, voicemail interception and the use of private investigators. Now, in an opening statement on Monday, the Duke of Sussex's legal representative David Sherborne, told the court that 147 articles published in the early 1990s to 2011 was submitted as part of the British Royals claim which present in his words, telltale signs of unlawful information gathering. Information featured in these articles include private conversations between Prince Harry and his brother, William the Prince of Wales, as well as details surrounding his relationship with long term former girlfriend Chelsy Davy. MGN has however contested these claims, denying that senior editorial figures were aware of wrongdoing at the time, and maintaining that there is simply no evidence the Duke of Sussex was hacked. But there remains a great deal of anticipation around Prince Harry's upcoming witness statement, which his lawyers say will describe very graphically the impact in MGN's alleged unlawful activities have had on him from damaging his personal relationships to leading the prince to suffer from bouts of depression. Prince Harry has of course been a vocal advocate for reform across the media landscape, with a particular focus on Britain's tabloids. With repeated warnings from the Prince over the impact the media's intrusion has had not only on himself, but also on his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex and his late mother, Princess Diana. Well, while Prince Harry has spoken openly in the past, from his memoir to his Netflix docu series, the witness stand will offer no favors and could well shine a harsher spotlight on the Duke's personal life as he faces cross examination.
