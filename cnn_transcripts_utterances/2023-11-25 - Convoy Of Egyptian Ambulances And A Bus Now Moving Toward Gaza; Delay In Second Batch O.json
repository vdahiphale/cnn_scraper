CNN has learned a convoy of Egyptian ambulances and a bus are now moving toward the Gaza side of the Rafah Border Crossing. They are set to transport 20 hostages expected to be released by Hamas. That exchange is set to happen at any moment now. These late developments follow an anxious hours-long dispute that delayed the transfer of this second group of hostages. Officials say the group will contain 13 Israelis, including eight children and five women. Qatari officials say an additional seven foreign nationals who fall outside the framework of the agreement between the two sides will also be released. And we're learning Qatar, the U.S., and Egypt helped to smooth over tensions after Hamas disputed the amount of aid being delivered from Gaza and the selection of the 39 Palestinian prisoners set to be released by Israel as part of this brief four-day truce. Let's send it over to Tel Aviv and Wolf Blitzer. Wolf.",

      "sentences": "That's right. Qatar, which has been essential in the mediation of this hostage deal, has been intervening again tonight, along with Egypt and the United States as well, to try and make sure it stays on track. Hamas had been holding back the release of this second group of hostages. Of course, it said it hadn't had sufficient aid deliveries into the Gaza Strip that were promised by Israel. It also said that the prisoners that had been released from Israeli jails, the Palestinian prisoners, were not the mixture of prisoners that they had anticipated and they had agreed.Those problems appear now to have been resolved. The Qataris coming out with a statement not long ago saying that the issues have now -- you know, the obstacles have been overcome. And so, we are now expecting for a second group of hostages, including 13 Israelis and 7 foreign nationals, remember as well, to be released shortly. We don't know the time frame of that. It's obviously a very complicated logistical series of operations that have to be performed. And that's why there's been so many delays because so much could go wrong. But at the moment at, what, you know, just past 10:00 in the evening here in Tel Aviv local time, it seems like the second group of hostages will be released tonight, but we will see.",

I mean, all along the Israelis have been saying that, look, it's military pressure and military pressure alone that has forced Hamas to the negotiating table and has resulted in the releases of the hostages so far. And so, that would speak for that.Fortunately, it looks like we're in a situation right now where that's not going to be tested and that we're not going to be seeing a resumption of hostilities or the military operation in Gaza now, as long as this operation -- as long as these releases go ahead. And that's a good thing because even though there are obstacles, everybody wants to see more of these hostages released.

So, there you heard Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, the spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces, briefing us on this delay, this delay in the second batch of Israeli hostages and foreigners who were expected to be freed, but so far, they have not yet been freed.Matthew, we were listening very closely to what he had to say, and his basic message was be patient. We're watching this very, very closely. We'll let you know what's going on. But clearly, he was accusing Hamas of engaging in what he called psychological pressure to try to get what they want. But he was also making it clear, I think, abundantly clear between his words, that Israel is getting ready for more military action if that is required to get the deal done and to try to destroy Hamas.",

They're standing ready to resume military operations in the Gaza Strip.He didn't specifically repeat the threat that we were discussing earlier that at midnight tonight in just under two hours if the hostages aren't released that the military action will resume. So, that's a good thing, I think, in the sense that he was talking about significant progress. Yes, nothing's done until it's done, but there is a significant progress. And he said that, you know, as far as he was concerned a deal is still in place, which I thought was also significant.",

They'll do it through their operational means as well.And so, look, you know, even if this deal only results in the release of 50 plus Israeli hostage, which is a lot, but that's what's currently on the table, there are still, you know, 190 more that are still in Gaza. And so, what Israel is saying there is that they will use whatever means are necessary, including military means, to get those hostages out in the end.",

Wolf, if there is such a moment of anticipation across this country tonight, as people are watching the news, are waiting to see if indeed this deal comes through. And it does come after a significant day during which we saw how fragile this temporary truce between Israel and Hamas is, how fragile this deal is for the -- to secure the release of these civilian hostages. We saw hours of negotiations trying to salvage this deal. And tonight, as you just heard from the Israeli military spokesman, significant progress towards getting these hostages back. The Qatari government, of course, has said that there is indeed a deal that it will move forward tonight. But you also heard there from Daniel Hagari how fluid and how tenuous the situation is. He's made very clear that we are taking things night by night as they prepare to receive this latest group of civilian hostages, Wolf. They're also preparing for tomorrow and for the day after that. But they know that there will be more bumps along the road. They know that there will be demands by Hamas or that there will be provisions in the agreement that one side or the other says are not being properly implemented. And so, there is so much about this, Wolf, that remains fragile. And I think today certainly showed everyone that that's the case.",

There are children coming, they've been up in Shifa Hospital in the north and it's taken them days to get down here.I got onto the bus and it's just a stench because children have had limbs blown off and they spent three days, I'm sorry to have to describe it like that, but that's what it is. They've spent three days on a bus with their decomposing limbs. So, it's just a stench and the scream of kids. The hospital is full of this. And Wolf, I'm in the South. I'm in the South during a pause in fighting. It's hard to imagine what this is like for people in the North. So, the thousands of children that have been killed and the many thousand more with these horrendous wounds of war that burn victims, I can't get out of my mind.

Bring them home now. They were aware that there were delays here. I think they were hoping they could all celebrate together. The release of another 13 Israeli hostages from Gaza and their entry into Israel again.So, certainly some disappointment that they weren't able to do that as one big, essentially, what has become an extended family. And yet we had the chance to speak with some of the families of the hostages, those who remain hostages. Even now they still say, look, we feel joy because at least this process has begun. And some of us, using that larger family reference again, can celebrate. They wait for the time where they, too, hopefully, can celebrate. We also spoke with one of the family members of the youngest hostage, 10-month-old Kfir Bibas (ph). And he said, look, he didn't want to come here at first. It's incredibly difficult to see the other families of the hostages and to be here. But in the end, he felt it was important. Plus, of course, he had the support of thousands of Israelis here backing him and supporting him. We've also seen here over the course of the past couple days the names and faces of those who were hostage broadcast on the wall. The first 13 of those changed to return to Israel.
