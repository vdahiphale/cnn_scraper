NATO officials say that for every Ukrainian killed in the battle for Bakhmut, five Russian soldiers have died. And then there are countless amounts of artillery, weaponry, arsenal but has been used up, depleted on the battleground in Bakhmut, not just by Russian forces but of course by the Wagner mercenary group as well. It does bring President Putin slightly closer to that larger goal of trying to claim, illegally of course, the east of Ukraine, the Donbas region. And it gives him the opportunity to declare a win, as I mentioned. For President Zelenskyy, it holds that symbolic value as well. That is why he is intent on holding on to it. Remember, he promised his countryman, not a single inch of Ukrainian land will be lost to Russia. Not a single drop of blood will be lost in vain.

They provided the numbers, but they do not bother adding it up. Then we get this big figure, so you can see why -- 465 million guns produced for the U.S. in the last hundred 25 years. And some of those have fallen out of circulation. You know, about 100 million, one researcher estimated. But the really stunning thing that happened, was when I charted gun deaths every year, alongside annual gun production, I found that they rose and fell in tandem. So, you know, the peaks and valleys were nearly identical. I showed this to some researchers and they were stunned. First of all, why had nobody done this before? Second of all, you can really see there is some kind of relationship, or correlation. Now, that does not mean causation. We can't say for sure what causes what. Do the guns flowing into the marketplace caused the deaths? We can see that at the very least, it calls into question this argument, that more guns will reduce gun violence.
