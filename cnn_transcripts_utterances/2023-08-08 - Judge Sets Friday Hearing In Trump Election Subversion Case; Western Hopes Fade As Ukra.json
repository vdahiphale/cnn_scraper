This as the federal grand jury that indicted Trump was back at work today. Could charges against Trump's alleged co-conspirators be in the works?Also tonight, we're learning that western hopes for Ukraine's counteroffensive are fading right now as officials receive very sobering updates on the fight to retake territory from Russia. I'll get reaction from key White House official John Kirby. And in the presidential race, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis boots his campaign manager in an ongoing shakeup, replacing her with a trusted adviser, as his bid for the GOP nomination keeps on struggling. We want to welcome our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. All right, let's get right to the breaking news on a key hearing in the January 6th criminal prosecution of Donald Trump. We're joined by our Senior Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid.

And she is scheduled this hearing for Friday. She made it clear to both sides she wanted to do this hearing about how sensitive evidence in this case will be handled. She wanted to do it this week.But the Trump lawyers asked if they could push it until next week. Of course, Wolf, we know part of the overall Trump legal strategy is to delay, delay, delay, hoping to push both special counsel trials until after the election. But they also have another hearing on Thursday down in Florida related to the Mar-a-Lago documents case. Special counsel prosecutors said that they'd be available any time this week. The hearing is now scheduled for Friday. It's just another example of how she wants to move this case along quickly. And all eyes will be on Judge Chutkan on Friday because this will be her first time overseeing a hearing in this case and the former president, though, does not have to attend.",

That's notable.We know from our reporting yesterday that the special counsel back at their office, they spoke with someone who could be a really helpful witness for them. That's Bernie Kerik. He's the former New York City Police commissioner, a close associate of Rudy Giuliani. We're told investigators had a lot of questions about Giuliani. And it's unclear today exactly what the grand jury was doing if prosecutors were reading in the answers from Bernie Kerik or if they were up to something else.

Both sides are going to have opportunity to make their case for how they believe the evidence in this case should be handled.

She didn't just give the government what they wanted. She's very attuned to the needs of the defense. I think she'll decide the issues fairly. She'll have tough questions for both sides.But in this case, when you get down to the substance, there is no First Amendment right of a criminal defendant, as Donald Trump wants to argue, to use this discovery material.

But since the judge set that date, DOJ has come in and superseded. They added a third defendant and they added three new charges against Donald Trump. Now, as a prosecutor, when you supersede, you fully understand that you're taking a real risk that a judge is going to say, okay, new facts, new charges here, this date needs to move back.

Unfortunately, Keith was not one of them. Keith was at the rally at the time the United States Secret Service had evacuated the vice president. The vice president's national security adviser was down on the rally encouraging people to march on the Capitol. So, he did not stand his post. And I did bring a receipt tonight because this is an email that I got from Keith on January 6th, in the evening of January 6th. In which he said, the president is up in the residence. I recommend you stay on the Hill and finish the Electoral College issue tonight. I responded, that's our plan. And he said, that's not a good plan, that's a great plan, close this thing out tonight.

I've been speaking to officials on both sides of the Atlantic here since the start of this counteroffensive, and for many of them, their assessment of Ukraine's chances has changed markedly in recent weeks, and this is for a couple of reasons. One, it's Russia's defenses. Three defensive bands here, defensive lines, marked by tens of thousands of landmines proving highly deadly for Ukrainian forces as they come through, extremely difficult to move but also highly complex trench lines, networks of trenches, which has been really difficult to get through and to make progress and to gain land. But the other issue, I'm told, is training. In very short order, the attempt has been made here to train up Ukrainian forces on complex weapons systems, like the Abrams tanks, which is going in soon, or the German Leopard tank, and, in effect, turn Ukrainian forces into mechanized fighting units, sometimes with only eight weeks of training. And that has proven perhaps not sufficient to get them up to the grade necessary to break through these lines quickly.The final piece here, Wolf, is time. You have a weather change coming as the fall approaches. That means the fighting changes. That is seen as applying pressure. And then you have political pressure. You have some sense from Ukraine's allies that they need to see results, increasing pressure over time. Well, if we're not getting results here, then perhaps Ukraine wants to think about another plan, even some pushing for the possibility of land concessions for peace, something that, of course, Ukrainian officials have understandably resisted, as have many of their western allies. So, the combination of Russian defenses, a lack of sufficient training and time pressure has really changed a lot of these assessments to being more pessimistic, including many folks who are very optimistic, Wolf, at the start of this counteroffensive.",

They're trying to break their will. They're trying to break their back and force public opinion against this war. It's not going to work, hasn't worked before, it's not going to work now.But this idea of going after first responders after they've already hit a target, I mean, that does show a level of perniciousness that, again, we haven't seen, yet we shouldn't be surprised that Mr. Putin would resort to even more desperate, even more evil tactics to try to get at the Ukrainian people's will.",

What DeSantis has not been able to do is scare or convince anyone else to get out of this race and allow any kind of consolidation.At the same time, Trump has had some rallying from Republicans who think he's under unfair legal attacks from the Biden administration and other jurisdictions. And so a combination of those things has really prevented DeSantis from rising. I don't know if a staff change is going to help. But right now, there's no question, Trump's in the dominant position in this primary, although there's a debate coming up and a lot more legal stuff to come up as well, I guess, which could change the emotions of some voters.",

BAKARI SELLERS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATORI think what you're seeing is someone as they go out on the campaign trail, has a very, very awkward way in which he communicates with voters. And the more voters meet him, the less they like him. I mean, they like him on paper a little bit but they just don't like him when they meet him. One of the things has to be said about this direction of the campaign, like you're not going to out-racism or out-xenophobia Donald Trump. And a lot of his ultra-conservative, far, far right-leaning policies that he's trying to put forth, these culture wars, you're just simply not going to outdo Donald Trump. He has that part of the market cornered. And so now he's left flailing. I don't see him making it to the University of Florida/Florida State football game in November in the fall. November, December.

They think Donald Trump is the most electable candidate. I think they're wrong. I think Donald Trump in a general election is going to have a very difficult time with the kinds of voters who win presidential campaigns, which are not far right or far left but sort of center cut independents around major suburban areas.
