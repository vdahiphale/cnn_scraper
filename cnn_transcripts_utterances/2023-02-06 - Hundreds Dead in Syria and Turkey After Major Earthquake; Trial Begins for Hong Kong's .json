If you're just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top story this hour.A major earthquake has killed hundreds of people in Turkey and Syria. The U.S. Geological Survey says the earthquake was centered in southern Turkey. The magnitude 7.8 was so powerful that it could be felt in Lebanon as well as Israel and the Palestinian territories. Let's go to meteorologist Karen Maginnis for more on this. Karen, obviously, Turkey in the region are no strangers to earthquakes because they lie on several fault lines. Talk us through the areas that have been affected and also how long these aftershocks could continue for.",

So what resources are really left behind here to have this earthquake.President Bashar al-Assad of Syria has held an emergency meeting. He's instructed all his ministers, all provinces to put any resources they have, that means doctors, nurses, rescue staff, firefighters, anything they can to the affected area. But again, the question is what's left? What do they have to use? Over a decade of war means that much of the infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed. Hospitals and clinics -- I know we're looking at images of those. Those had been targeted and get during the conflicts. So you're looking at overwhelmed hospitals where doctors are going to be struggling to get the medical aid that they need. And then the very important thing to remember here, is that the government does not have full control of these areas. There's a huge portion of northwest Syria that is under rebel control. That means those families will be fully reliant on rebel forces, on volunteers to get that access and that help and pull people out from the rubble. One of those groups, the White Helmets which has been pulling people out of the rubble now for years because of bombings, is pulling people of the rubble today, of course, because of earthquake. One of them made in appeal on social media and I just want you to take a look at a very brief sound bite here that we want to play for you. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

You know, this case, Bianca, concerns the Hong Kong 47 which is a group of 47 pro-democracy activists who have been charged with the conspiracy to commit subversion. Which is a very serious crime here under the international security law, in fact, it's punishable by up to life in prison. And this trial, a landmark trial, it begins today.This is the largest national security trial to take place here in the territory since Beijing imposed that sweeping legislation in the wake of the 2019 anti-government Hong Kong protests. And among the 47 who are on trial, you have very prominent figures like Joshua Wong, as well as the former law professor Benny Tai, a former opposition lawmaker Claudia Mo. They represent a group that had already pleaded guilty. But when 16 other defendants are pleading not guilty, including a former journalist, her name Gwyneth Ho. They are accused of organizing and participating in an unofficial primary vote that took place in July of 2020. Now Hong Kong had hosted a similar event before without any incident in 2018, but when this vote took place, it provoked the ire of China's top representative in here in Hong Kong, the Beijing liaison office. In fact they said that this event -- you're seeing pictures of it when it took place in 2020 -- contravened the national security law. Critics say that the law is being used to you crush dissent. To crush and dismantle the opposition here in the territory. I will show you, this recent statement is posted by Human Rights Watch, it says, Maya Wany saying this. Hong Kong's biggest national security case is wrapped in legal language, but it's just part of the Chinese government's relentless efforts to smother Hong Kong's democracy movement. The very real threat of life in prison for peaceful activism shows Beijing's other contempt for both democratic political processes and the rule of law, unquote. And Bianca and Max, this is indeed a landmark trial it's expected to run for last at least 90 days but its implications will last for decades. Back to you.",

Because they don't want to be accused of breaching the national security law themselves.But a lot of people here in the territory, and, of course, a lot of people from Hong Kong, have immigrated overseas, closely watching events here to figure out what this means for the future of Hong Kong. Again, critics say that the national security law has been weaponized to crush dissent. It's been able to dismantle a once vibrant civil society here in Hong Kong. While the Hong Kong government, Chinese authorities, they continue to dispute that and say that the national security law was necessary to restore order and bring back stability to Hong Kong especially after what happened in 2019.
