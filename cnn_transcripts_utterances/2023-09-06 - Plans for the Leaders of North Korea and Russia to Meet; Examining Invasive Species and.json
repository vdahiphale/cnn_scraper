And a new U.N. report says that human movement like travel or global trade is spreading these animals, plants, and other organisms in new regions at an unprecedented rate. The report says these alien troublemaker species are driving plant and animal extinctions contributing to food scarcity and making environmental disasters worse all around the planet. And get this, we`re discovering about 200 new alien species every year and out of the 37,000 alien species that have been introduced all over the world, a whopping 3,500 of them are causing serious problems. They`re ruining crops, wiping out native species in certain areas, polluting our water and spreading disease. It`s hitting our wallets hard too.
