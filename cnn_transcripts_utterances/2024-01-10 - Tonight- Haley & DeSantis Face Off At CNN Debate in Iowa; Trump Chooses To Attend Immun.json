It's Wednesday, January 10th, 5It is 4:00 a.m. in Des Moines, Iowa, where presidential hopefuls Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley are going to be one-on-one for the first time, that's in tonight's CNN debate. That debate is the candidate's last chance to face off before the Iowa caucuses. In just five days, it remains part of the race for second place. And we'll be missing the front runner, Donald Trump, who is skipping the event to be part of a Fox News town hall. Trump also skipped a day on the campaign trail yesterday, choosing to underscore his choice, instead to appear in a D.C. courtroom to hear arguments in his federal election subversion case, over the claim that he has presidential immunity, barring him from criminal prosecution for his role leading up to the January 6th Capitol attack. Trump, who again was not required to be there, had this to say after the hearing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Julia, good morning, it's always wonderful to see you. Let's start with the debate. I mean, this is going to be our first chance to see these two facing off on the stage, just against each other. You know, this really still is the race for second place. It seems like the dynamic here is going to be Nikki Haley on the rise, which makes it likely she will come in for some attacks from Ron DeSantis. What do you expect in terms of the balance between attacks between these two and a focus on the actual person that they need to be, which is Donald Trump?",

Remember, Iowa was the state he put all of his eggs in going into this campaign. And he was the second place contender nationally for quite awhile. And still, he is narrowly leading Nikki Haley in second place in Iowa. But she is very much closed in on him, and he wants to be able to take advantage of that, knowing that there is a lot of Iowa caucusgoers that are watching this debate tonight. So I think we're going to see Ron DeSantis try to hit her. But for Nikki Haley, I'm curious to see how she handles this dynamic, because in past debates, it seems like we paid attention, or the most attention to the dynamic between her and Vivek Ramaswamy. We know that Vivek Ramaswamy has launched a number of personal attacks against her. She swiped back at him in a number of notable moments. But her and DeSantis, they've sparred over policies, their records as, you know, governor of the respective states, and of course, over China. But I think you are going to see the two of them try to contrast themselves with each other. But I'm curious to see whether they stepped up their attacks on former President Trump. We know in last week's CNN town halls they were stepping up their attacks on him. But unclear whether in a one-on-one situation, they would do the same.",

He's able to suck all the oxygen up in the room in terms of the media and coverage, and then at these town halls, what are Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis being asked about? Donald Trump.And remember, particularly if you are Ron DeSantis and you closely share a base with Trump, Nikki Haley does as well, but I think is more crossover between DeSantis and Trump, getting asked about that, you know, isn't what you want to do to contrast yourself.

So I think it opens him up to attacks from the Biden campaign and Democrats. But I think Democrats and President Biden need to be very careful, because, Kasie, you and I are talking about this and it's obviously a very important issue. But I think a lot of voters looking at this and following this coverage, you know, they're not following it as closely as some of us in the political world are. I think they're top concerns are obviously the economy and those kitchen table issues.
