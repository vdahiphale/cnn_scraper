FTX filed for bankruptcy just over a month ago with many surprised now at the speed. U.S. authorities brought charges against Bankman-Fried, who now faces extradition back to the U.S. from the Bahamas, where he was living and was the base of operations for the company he founded.

So you have the police in the Bahamas, they have arrested him saying that they anticipate that they will likely have to extradite him to the U.S. promptly upon a request from the U.S. We have authorities in the Bahamas saying that his arrest there is linked to potential financial crimes, and that the Prime Minister himself has said that the country's authorities will continue investigating in parallel to what the U.S. is doing? Then you have the Southern District of New York putting out this statement confirming the arrest of Bankman-Fried on Monday based on a sealed indictment filed by the Southern District of New York and saying that they're going to go on to say more shortly after that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission published their own tweet linked to the SDNY saying that they're commending the arrest and they're authorizing separate charges related to Bankman-Fried's violations of security laws to be filed publicly tomorrow in the Southern District of New York. Now this was all as Bankman-Fried was on the eve of he was expected to testify in front of Congress and the Chair of the House Financial Services Committee. She in his statement expressed surprise at his arrest and disappointment because she says that creditors and customers who have lost money would they deserve to hear from this individual. Now CNN has reached out to FTX to get some comment, haven't heard anything. But of course, in one of his many public appearances, Bankman-Fried has suggested that he has not committed any crimes, though we're expecting him to be charged soon. Take a listen to what more he's had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SAM BANKMAN-FRIED, FTX FOUNDER: I mean, look, I've had a bad month. This has not been anything different that's not what matters here.

And it has failed the test. It was thought that perhaps the scarcity of crypto assets would make them relatively good inflation hedges that too, has not borne out very well. So I think the reality we are seeing is that the financial foundations of this entire edifice were really very weak to begin with.

Well, details now from CNN's Rene Marsh.RENE MARSH, CNN ANCHOR &amp; GOVERNMENT REGULATION CORRESPONDENT: Well, scientists at a Department of Energy Lab in California have figured out how to successfully produce a nuclear fusion reaction with a net energy gain. That means they've succeeded in taking two hydrogen atoms and using 192 powerful lasers to force those atoms to fuse together unleashing the same kind of energy that powers the sun and stars. Until now, that has been incredibly difficult to replicate here on Earth. The key is, though, that they've been able to release more energy from the reaction than they use in the fusion process itself. And that's critically important for anything to be a viable source; it needs to have a higher energy output than the energy input used to generate the power. So this is a huge moment, mostly because the discovery could eventually unlock and unlimited cheap, clean power source for the world. Now this discovery has also proved this as a viable energy source, and no longer a hypothetical scenario. But as major as this is in the quest to pivot away from dirty energy sources like fossil fuels, we're still a far way off from powering our homes by way of nuclear fusion. It's estimated it could take two even three decades before this energy source is widely used Renee Marsh, CNN, Washington.",

Now, the Israeli military says most of the 166 Palestinians killed in the West Bank were either militants or engaging violently with their soldiers. But human rights organizations and the United Nations say that bystanders have been caught up as well as we are seeing with Jana, with the 16-year-old's death. Israeli authorities say at least 31 people have been killed in attacks targeting Israelis across the West Bank and Israel. These are numbers that in some cases and types of attacks and violent clashes that have not been seen some people say since the early 2000s. And there is a lot of worry among the international community, especially as a new Israeli government is expected to take power any day now. It will be in some estimates the most right-wing government in Israeli's history. And the international community is especially concerned about certain ministers who will be appointed, some of them who just a few years ago would've been considered the far right wing fringe of Israeli politics, now will be in positions of power including in some cases controlling Israeli police. So there's a lot of concern that the situation that is always -- already been so violent and so tenuous will potentially only worse. Hadas Gold, CNN -- Jerusalem. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The chance only comes around once every four years and the legendary Lionel Messi is running out of time.After such an extraordinary career, some think it's Messi's destiny to win it here in Qatar, in his 5th and presumably final World Cup tournament. He was born the year after Argentina's most recent World Cup triumph in 1986 when Diego Maradona carried the Albiceleste to victory. This is the first World Cup since Maradona's death, so it would certainly be a poetic time to do it. If it is truly meant to be for Argentina, then the road has been far from straightforward. A shocking defeat in their opening game against Saudi Arabia was followed by a rousing win against Mexico, and a routine victory over Poland. Their round of 16 knockout win against Australia was closer than it should've been and they almost blew it in a tempestuous quarterfinal against the Netherlands, which required a penalty shootout. The stakes couldn't be higher, and the emotions are starting to show, getting this far has come at a price. Ahead of Tuesday's game against Croatia, two defenders are suspended. But Argentina's fans still believe that this is going to be their year and they have never lost a World Cup semifinal. But as Argentina put in one of their final training sessions before the semifinal, they must know that Croatia will be a tough nut to crack. Argentina lost to them in the group stage 4 years ago, and the 2018 finalists also seem to have destiny on their side. They've won two penalty shootouts to get this far.

We believe that Jin was inside, it's been confirmed by the military that he is now starting that five weeks of basic training. Now, this is required of all able-bodied men here in South Korea. They're expected to carry out 18 to 21 months of training. It's mandatory and it's supposed to happen before the age of 28. Jin was allowed to defer it a couple of years, a law passing saying that if you excelled at popular culture and art, you can defer it until you're 30 and BTS certainly ticked that box. So we did see some fans here, a few came along. One lady, Mandy, had flown all the way from Hong Kong. She said a couple of days ago just so that she could show her support for Jin. We also spoke to someone who had been through this training camp last year and he said that it is a pretty brutal camp. The fact that it is so far north as you can see, it's snowing at the moment, I can confirm. It is bitterly cold and it is only December. So this is a particularly hardcore boot camp that Jin has joined at this point. But certainly the fans are not going to forget him. He is just the first of the group to go through this system. Now, there was some debate even in parliament as to whether or not BTS should be exempted from carrying out this military service because of the incredible soft power that they represent and provide for Korea. There are some professional athletes if they won an Olympic Medal, for example, an Asian Games gold, they are exempted and they do some kind of alternative community activity. The same for classical musicians. It's not the same for K-Pop artists at this point much to the disappointment of the BTS fans, the army. And so that is why we are seeing Jin starting his five weeks training camp today but he will then be going on to do 18 months of military service. Of course, there are six more members of the group that will be doing the same, John.",
