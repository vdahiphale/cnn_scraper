The Israeli military says it killed more than 20 Hamas fighters who fired on Israeli troops from the entrance to Al- Quds while embedded with civilians.

Including these premature babies, wrapped in foil and blankets in a desperate attempt to keep them alive out of their incubator. In the hospital's yard, dozens of dead bodies slowly decay, unable to be buried. The hospital's complex has been struck repeatedly amid nearby fighting with Hamas militants.
