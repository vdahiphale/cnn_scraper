      "sentences": "Well, that's right. Well, there is a series of people who are in the running. And I should just know, I want to do that at the top, that this is still very much in flux.So just because we've learned, and this is according to a source familiar with the process, that some of these people have received vetting materials, Donald Trump could still change his mind. This is by no means a finalist. But what we're told is that people like Senator J.D. Vance, Senator Tim Scott, Senator Marco Rubio, and Doug Burgum, the North Dakota governor, are all some of the top contenders on his VP list. Other names include Elise Stefanik. But again, I think it's interesting to know, because we reported a couple weeks ago that Donald Trump had been asking an outside firm to vet these different people. Now they're starting to actually get some of these materials themselves, which just shows how much closer we are to him making a decision. Now, when I talk to Donald Trump's team, they say, look, again, this is in flux. These are moving parts. But he's more likely to announce his decision closer to the Republican National Convention in July. And also, I mean, just reporting on Donald Trump for several years now, he's the kind of man that when he's at Mar-a-Lago, when he's going to these different events, he'll be in Arizona tomorrow, he likes to ask his allies, his donors, who do you think should be VP? And he'll float a name. He'll say, what do you think about Burgum? And of course, we've seen all these men as well really showing their loyalty to Donald Trump, particularly in the aftermath of him being convicted last week. And so I think the names that you see and what I'm laying out here aren't entirely surprising. The people who are receiving these materials, it shouldn't be surprising. But of course, this is Donald Trump we're talking about. So nothing is set in stone.",

So one of Donald Trump's leading super PACs, really his original super PAC, it's called MAGA, Inc., Make America Great Again, Inc., says that they raised $70 million last month. Now, that's not part of the $141 million that Donald Trump's campaign and the RNC raised last month. And a lot of this they also attribute to being off of his conviction.And look, I mean, there was a memo that they sent to donors yesterday that really laid out their pathway for how they think Donald Trump can secure 270 electoral votes in November. And I thought it was fascinating because, you know, they talked about four states in particular, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, all states that Trump lost in 2020 but they think they can win in the upcoming election. And I think it's a really good look at just how his outside groups think this is how we're going to win in the fall.",

We allow the Senate to take it up, allow the Senate to eventually pass this out of the body because of opposition from Republicans. We do expect a couple of Republicans, Senators Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins to vote with the Democrats, but that's not going to be enough. They need nine Republicans to vote to move ahead.Now, Republicans say that this is something that is not necessary. They believe it's a campaign ploy. They say that it's essentially that Democrats are trying to force this issue to play politics over the issue of reproductive rights in this hotly contested election season. They have some policy objectives, too, namely that this would also guarantee access to the morning-after pill, of course, widely known or widely used, one of them being Plan B. There's some philosophical objections that don't want to guarantee that right. But nevertheless, this battle is expected to play out on the campaign trail, as top Senators told me earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEN. JOHN CORNYN (R-TX): It's not a serious attempt to legislate. This is just a show vote in anticipation of the election. Democrats think they can win this case, this election, based on reproductive rights, and somehow they're suggesting that contraception is in jeopardy, which is just blatantly false.",
