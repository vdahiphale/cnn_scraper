Sources tell CNN, President-elect Donald Trump is considering declaring a National Economic Emergency. And the rapid pace of AI development, it is all the talk of this year's Consumer Electronics Show. Live from New York. It is Wednesday, January 8th. I'm Paula Newton, in for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. And a very good evening to everyone, as we continue with our developing story. The California National Guard has been deployed to Los Angeles County as raging wildfires push emergency workers to their maximum limits. Four major infernos, look at them there, racing across the area as we speak, leaving tens of thousands of people under evacuation orders. Now, the Palisades Fire has grown to nearly 5,000 hectares, with zero containment. Think about that. The fires are being fueled, of course, by those fierce winds. Evacuees reporting downed trees and crushed cars. The Los Angeles County Fire Chief confirms that the situation has now turned deadly. Two people have lost their lives so far, and many more are injured. CNN's Nick Watt has our report. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Carmen Balber is the executive director of the Group Consumer Watchdog. She joins us now from Los Angeles. Very grateful to have you here. I hope you and your family are safe. And for those people who now at least are safe, they're safe, their family members are safe, their pets are safe. They're evacuated. They've lost everything. What is the challenge that follows now? What can they expect that their insurance company will pay?",

      "sentences": "It's a long road, but there are a lot of protections in place in California to ensure that yourinsurance company does pay what they've promised, but it's really important for those who are evacuated now, especially if they know already that they've lost their home, that they start documenting everything. And that starts with receipts for their evacuation costs because one thing that some homeowners may not know is that their insurance company will generally cover additional expenses for leaving your home. That's everything from lodging to food to transportation. That's necessary because you can't return to your home so start keeping receipts.",

About 4 percent of people in thestate have moved to what we call our insurer of last resort. But now too many people are in it. It's called the Fair Plan, and that has lower benefits. It has lower coverage. People can expect to be repaid less from their Fair Plan policies often than traditional insurance. But most Californians do still have regular insurance in the regular home insurance market, and they should expect those claims to be paid.",

One of the things that these fires are telling us is that mitigation is critical to help protect our state from the worst of wildfires, and by mitigation, I mean home hardening so higher building standards, protecting your roof, closing eaves against those wildly blowing embers to make homes less likely to burn down, and brush clearance to prevent some of this home- to-home passage of the fire that we're seeing here today. It's really shown the importance of those mitigation steps. And we need protections that say, if you mitigate, insurance companies have to cover you. That will help keep Californians insured.",

Right now we're focused on thisone right here, as you can see, a business complex fully engulfed in these plumes of smoke, are just rising high into the air, dropping embers. And we have to be a bit careful about where the wind is carrying these embers right now. And you can see because of that how easy it is for another structure to catch on fire. The structure across the street is already burned, and there's nothing left of that. We can also, at some point here, turn a little bit to show you just how extensive this is all around. This business is gone. That business is gone. Look further up the street. That business is on fire. Across the street, there's another business on fire. That's just beyond the Bank of America. Actually, over this fence here we see an apartment complex that's also on flames over here. In order to get to this location, Paula, we actually drove through several neighborhoods where the flames had already come through. And those homes, unfortunately, are mostly gone. That's in that direction over there. When we drove past, there was nothing left of that. We're talking about the -- just down to the foundations of those homes. Some cars left the metal frames of those cars. Let's go back over here and you can actually just see, I don't know if you can see in the distance just how many emergency vehicles are trying to stop people from coming up this road. Of course, we are being extremely cognizant of when this might be too intense and how to get ourselves out of here, but this is just to show you the extent of this. This is the heart of the city. This is a main business intersection where you pretty much see every single block has either already gone up in flames or is in flames -- Paula.",

We saw certain people still hangingaround because there are some homes intact, and they're trying to protect those homes. So just because of the nature of how these embers fly and how the wind changes so suddenly, it can randomly skip over a house. And so there are some people just trying to protect what's left and what's standing there. It definitely, when you look around here, it seems rather futile.

But let's turn back on this side.I think it's just getting more intense here. But that's obviously very difficult to do if you've got very strong wind gusts. And I will tell you last night, standing by the ocean there by the Palisades Fire, it felt like tropical storm force winds. And so if you've got those kinds of winds, even if you did fly an aircraft, which it wouldn't be safe to do, dropping buckets of water from the ocean onto flames won't be terribly effective in that situation where the water would just scatter to, you know, places that are not the target of where you were trying to drop. So the winds definitely made everything more difficult. You are correct. We're expecting a little bit of a reprieve as the day goes on and what we really need, Paula, which does not seem to be in the cards, is rain and I don't see that happening.",

Our teams are spread across the Capitol. We're going to check in with them in moments, but we're going to start with our LEAD story and the incredible grim scenes on the West Coast. Four wildfires burning out of control in and around Los Angeles. New images showing incredibly large flames burning right now in Altadena, California. These flames fueled by these strong winds, gusts of up to 100 miles per hour, and homes, cars, and businesses reduced to ash in just minutes. The flames spreading so fast that fire hydrants are running out of water. At least two people have been killed. Fire officials say there are, quote, \"significant number of people injured.\" And the Los Angeles County fire chief says there are simply not enough firefighters to contain these blazes. CNN anchor Anderson Cooper is on the scene in Altadena, California, right now near the Eaton Fire. Anderson, what we saw from you there about an hour ago was heartbreaking.
