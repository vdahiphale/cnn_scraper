The skies here in Washington, D.C., are growing more ominous right now as millions of Americans in the Eastern United States are at serious risk right now from severe storms and even tornadoes. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. Let's get right to the breaking news this hour, the very severe weather outbreak on the East Coast of the United States, millions of Americans right now facing dangerous storms, including tornadoes.

It's eased up but it's gotten darker and darker here in the district, the Capitol just about two blocks behind us, and yet it's become harder to see that iconic dome.And, you know, one of the things we have heard from officials here in the district and really across the region today has been about the precautions needed to keep people safe as the storm blows through in the next few minutes. Government buildings shut down here in the district at 3:00 P.M. today, the federal government telling employees to go home in order to be off the roads when these intense conditions, rain and potential flooding, blow through. And it's not just the rain. We're talking about wind, these wind gusts that could be hurricane strength, 70 miles per hour. That could cause downed trees, could cause other issues and create very dangerous conditions for people across this region. We know schools, libraries, the zoo here in D.C., all shutting down activities outdoors or just shutting down early to make sure that people would not be out in the elements. And we're seeing more ground stops from Atlanta to New York on flights coming into those airports, here in Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia. It is going to be a mess for flyers in the coming hours, Wolf, a lot of concern. But the worst of it here in Washington is still to come here.

D.C., Baltimore, you're in it right now, Philadelphia not yet, but it's on its way, all the way down to the south, where wind gusts have been over 75 miles per hour.Right now, I just counted them, 600,000 households at this point without power, we haven't even moved through the big cities yet for that matter. And here you go all the way from Upstate New York through Pennsylvania, even toward Scranton, into Pennsylvania, and then down at D.C., along the I-95 all the way down to the 75 there in Atlanta, Georgia. So, let's zoom into a couple spots here. We still have these pink boxes, which are brief tornado spin-ups. These are not big monsters tornadoes but it doesn't matter if it's over your home. So, up here, here's Scranton right there. There's the I-81 corridor on up toward the north. Something else I'm very worried about is this, right here. See what's happening to that? It's call a bow echo. The wind is coming in behind this bow echo and accelerating to 80 miles per hour. Where are you there? Philadelphia, you are next and that 80-mile-per-hour wind gust could be on your doorstep quickly. If these winds are moving at 80, that's faster than you can drive there. Here's the weather into D.C., Baltimore all the way down toward Dale City, a little bit of a gap through parts the Virginia, but then, again, Charlotte picking up some weather, Atlanta picking up the wind gusts right now, even the thunder and lightning here right over CNN Center has been tremendous just in the past 15 minutes. So, yes, it's still coming, for some. As soon as it's gone, pretty much it's gone for you. But I don't want you to go outside yet because the lightning with this weather has been behind the storm as well. Don't go out and take pictures. We've already heard of people being hit by lightning today because they were outside and they shouldn't have been outside.

It's not uncommon in trials to have one side say, this is how we believe evidence should be handled, and the other side disagrees. They'll probably work it out in the end. Now, it's going to come down to two big issues, I think. It's, one, what to make of statements that Trump has made in the past, right, because he hasn't mishandled evidence yet, which is ultimately what protective orders are about. And the judge will have to assess, well, what do we may of things that happened in the past and then sort of this idea of what is sensitive material. They go back and forth about how to handle what they deem as sensitive. And I think that will be what the judge will be resolving and I think she would probably do it pretty soon.",

Trump's team is actually already winning the fight here just because this is going to cause delay. The areas they identify they want to fight about in there, for example, they want only sensitive information to be withheld, while that immediately sets up the fight over who is going to define what the sensitive information is.

The question is just what would be the broad parameters of the protective order.I'm also interested to see how quickly she makes this decision.

They're not able to move forward in the way they would like. And a lot of this relates to minefields that we've been seeing placed by the Russians, slowing the Ukrainian advance, making sometimes their advances through de- miners, a matter of ten meters an hour or so, very complex and tough work, causing grueling casualties. And this occurs, obviously, with the ticking clock of fears of potentially how fast they can move before winter sets in, slowing down their advance generally.
