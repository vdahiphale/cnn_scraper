Catherine Cortez Masto gets to stay as the senator from the state of Nevada.And with that, the Democrats get to keep and maintain control of the U.S. Senate. Here's how it all went down. The Republican, Adam Laxalt, was in the lead for days and then, on Saturday evening, Clark County released a batch of about 23,000 votes. And here is how those votes were divided. Catherine Cortez Masto receiving about 14,000 of those votes or 60 percent of the vote. Laxalt received more than 8,000 votes or about 35 percent of that batch. Now that put Catherine Cortez Masto in the lead and CNN called the race at that point in time. Her campaign taking to Twitter, saying, quote, \"What did people get wrong about this race? \"The first Latina senator knows her community better than anonymous sources. The daughter of a Teamster knows how to fight for working families. And CCM's -- or Catherine Cortez Masto's -- a former AG and crime attacks couldn't stick.\" Again, the Democrat here, Catherine Cortez Masto, keeps her seat and stays a senator of Nevada -- Rosa Flores, CNN, Las Vegas.

And I think it's important to note that this meeting is taking place on neutral ground here in Bali, here on the sidelines of the international summit. It wasn't all that long ago it was fairly common for a U.S. President to go to Beijing, for the Chinese president to go to the White House. I covered many of those visits. Now it's almost untenable to imagine that happening at this point in the relationship. So this meeting will be very important. Of course, President Biden puts a lot of stake in meeting a leader face-to-face. He can suss out their personality, develop this interpersonal relationship which he has already developed that. They met for hours and traveled for several thousand miles together when they were both vice president. Biden now comes into this as the leader of the country. Now they are both coming into this at a very interesting political moment. Certainly President Biden feeling some wind at his back because of Democrat success in the midterm elections. President Xi coming out of the Communist Party congress, having been elevated to an unprecedented third term. How those dynamics will affect this meeting is also going to be very interesting to watch, when they sit down on Monday.

That is well past the long-standing strategic and big U.S. policy the U.S. has upheld for so long. And certainly the tensions were aggravated over the summer when the American House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan. You saw tensions really sort of escalate to new levels after that point. During this meeting, White House officials say President Biden is going to be honest about where he sees this issue at this point in time. One thing that Xi's very fond of doing when it comes to this issue is using a metaphor when he's talking to President Biden. He said it in various iterations, which is, if you play with fire, you will get burned. When you're using language like that, I don't think there's any great expectation that the tensions will be eased. But they want to get a greater understanding about where they stand so there's no misunderstandings so even if these tensions continue over the next couple of years, months, there isn't a miscalculation that could tip over into an all-out conflict.",

ZELENSKYY (through translator):  It's enough when you can no longer hear explosions. It's enough when the air defense system ensure no missiles hit the ground or buildings. It's enough when you are not being fired at and no missiles are launched against you because Russia is working together with its partner, if I may call it that, with Iran. Since the 10th of October, we've seen them use around 450 kamikaze drones, attack drones, air reconnaissance, attack drones, kamikaze drones, missiles. Over this time, we've had over 2,500 hits, that's without artillery, 2,500 hits by drones, explosives or missiles. That is a large number. Do we have enough defenses? No, I don't think we have enough at all. Is it enough to make 100 or 1,000 calls? Probably not enough either, too few. But I'm ready to make 1,000 calls if every call I make results in more air defense systems. I'm ready to stay on the phone and just do that. It's difficult. A joint decision on the protection of Ukraine and Ukrainian airspace will definitely help us. And all the answers are there.

There is a vaccine against Russian strikes and we know it. There is a vaccine against Russia and we know exactly which countries have it and in what amount.

There is still a runoff in Georgia, which takes place on December 6th.But no matter what happens there, the Democrats will maintain control of the Senate. If the Republicans manage to win that runoff in Georgia, it will be a 50-50 split. The Vice President Kamala Harris would break the tie. But if the incumbent Democrat Raphael Warnock does win in this runoff in December, the Democrats would have a 51-49 advantage, an outright majority, which, believe me, they would enjoy. It would mean the committee assignments don't have to be even. It would mean they could lose at least one Democratic vote in key moments in the Senate. So this is what it could look like going forward. How did we get to this point? The last Senate seat to be called was in Nevada. It was Catherine Cortez Masto over Adam Laxalt. Some of the mail vote that came in over the last several days helped her make up a deficit. She had been trailing by more than 22,000 votes just a few days ago; now leading by several thousand. So the Senate has been decided. That leaves the U.S. House of Representatives. This is something. Not many people would have thought that the Senate would be called for the Democrats before the House would be called for Republicans. But we just can't yet. There are too many outstanding races. Right now, the Republicans control 211 seats. We projected they will win at least 211 seats. The Democrats, 204. You need 218 seats in the House of Representatives to have a majority, 218, which means the Republicans need seven more. The Democrats would need 14 more. There are currently 20 seats that have not been called, 20 races that have yet to be called. In these races right now, the Republicans lead in 10. They only need seven. They lead in 10. The Democrats lead in 10, they need 14. So you can see, it's an uphill battle. The Democrats on this map right now would need to hold every district that is currently blue and then pick up four of the uncalled races that are still in red. Some of them are quite close. Let me just show you. In California, California's 13th congressional district for instance right now, there's just a margin of 84 votes with 46 percent reporting. So the Democrats could potentially, potentially pick up a few of these seats. This seat, district right here, you can see Riverside County, that's just a county there but you can see in this district right now, California's 41st, the Republican leads by 2,100 votes with just 53 remaining. So again, if the Democrats were to hold every blue district, every blue congressional district on this map and pick up four of these red Republican ones, they would maintain control of the House.

According to Turkish media, president Recep Tayyip Erdogan says he wants to open what he calls a peace corridor, similar to the shipment corridor. He helped to open it on the Black Sea, which allowed Ukrainian grain to start moving again. The grain agreement is set to expire next week. Russia still hasn't agreed to extend it, saying it's not satisfied with the way part of it has been implemented. A piece of history has regained its full voice.
