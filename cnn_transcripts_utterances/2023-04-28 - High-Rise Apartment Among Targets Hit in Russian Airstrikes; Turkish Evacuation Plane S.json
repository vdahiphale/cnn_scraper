There are reports of fighting in Khartoum despite a new ceasefire. Former U.S. vice president Mike Pence testifies before a grand jury about his former boss Donald Trump. And how similar can two songs be before it's considered copyright infringement? Ed Sheeran is looking for answers. Russian forces are once again taking aim at civilian targets in Ukraine, including presidential -- residential homes, rather. Right now rescue teams are desperately trying to find survivors from this high-rise apartment tower that was hit by a missile in the city of Uman this morning. Ukraine's Ministry of Internal Affairs says 27 of the building's 46 apartments were destroyed and others were damaged. CNN's Nic Robertson is on the scene of that attack and brings us an update on the number of people who have lost their lives. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

They are still searching the rubble there. The police say they're going to focus on that. Now Dave is going to pan up and take you higher up in the building there up towards the eighth floor. The smoke still coming out of there. And I can tell, you a tragic story about what happened there overnight. We have spoken to a lady. Her friends lived in one of the apartments up there on the eighth floor. The husband is in hospital. The wife managed to escape, but there is a 13-year-old and a 7-year-old daughter still missing. The lady telling us this was an absolute floods of tears. Still missing somewhere up there on the eighth floor. And the police say that's where they're going to go to next. They say they're not going to stop searching here until they've gone through everything and turned over all the debris here. 109 people registered living in this building. And as I'm talking to you here, behind David there is a line of people just waiting here to find out what's happened to their loved ones, what's happened to their friends. A lot of emergency workers here. The Ukrainians sadly are getting all too experienced about clearing up after Russian strikes like this. 21 of the 23 missiles Russia fired into Ukraine last night were intercepted. This is what happens when just one gets through. And this is the fear that we have been hearing from neighbors here, not knowing if this is going to happen again. The lady who lived in the building right here told me she heard the woosh of the missiles. Put her kids in the bathtub, put a blanket over their heads, and just hoped that they would see the daylight come up in the morning. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

That's because across the Red Sea from Port Sudan, that is the main seaport for Sudan. But to get to Port Sudan, people who got there endured about have miles of a journey, more than 800 kilometers across a war zone, the territory that even in the best of times takes 12 hours, but right now it takes up to 30 hours. They've been joining convoys. They've been hiring buses and trying to make that journey over to Port Sudan. And then, hopefully, if you're lucky, get on a Saudi ship and come over here to Port Sudan. So we're across the border here. Many of them have been arriving thanks to the Saudi Navy. The King Faisal Naval Base where they come in here, they have temporary rights to be here for a couple of days. They get access to a hotel until they can then move on to other countries. So far the Saudis tell us that they have evacuated almost 3,000 people. But only about 100 of them where Saudis. Most of them were from other nationalities, 80 in total. And we're not inside the naval base because it's a military installation. And when there is a ship coming we will be able to get closer to that. But in the absence of it we're out here waiting for word when the next ship will be arriving with these people who have been evacuated from Port Sudan. It's been a chaotic scene. That's what it's been described as in Port Sudan because so many people are trying to get out of the country. Not just foreigners but also many Sudanese people. But to be able to get on one of these ships, you have to have either a passport of another country, so you have to be a dual national, U.K., U.S., German, France, Swiss, dual national with Sudan. Or at least a right to live in another country or a visa to another country. So that is why so far all the reports are there's prioritizing for nationals or dual nationals or people who have residency in another country or here in the Gulf. But this has been an important lifeline for people from India, and China, and the Philippines, and Pakistan, and Germany, and France, and all around the world to get out of the conflict in Sudan -- Eleni.",

It's the third 72-hour ceasefire that was negotiated by what iscalled the tripartite mechanism, the U.N., the African Union, and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, and the Quad, the U.K., the U.S., Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. But the two sides have agreed to it in principle. They say we agree to this. It's necessary to allow some people time to reconnect with their families, to get basic supplies, and then shortly after you see these statements where they accuse each other of having first violated it. The Rapid Support Forces will say, no, we respect that. But this is a breach of international law. That's the other side, the Sudanese armed forces, are not respecting it. People in the middle, the 45 million people in Sudan who are caught in this crossfire, and they can't all leave the country. You can't evacuate 45 million people out of a country and leave it empty. And that is why whenever there is a lull in fighting they try to make this journey, this dangerous journey over 30 hours to try to get to Port Sudan or to the Egyptian border, the Ethiopian border or the Chad border, to get away from the heart of the conflict -- Eleni.",

I don't know if David can get a shot for you pass these diggers, but there are still rescue workers, recovery workers behind the diggers looking into the basement area of the apartment building that they are clearing out there right now. But if David tilts up you can see the pancake floors of the building up there, and the police have told us that they're going to be searching through that area next. And a neighbor from here told us that her friend, who lived up on the eighth floor, her friends survived. The husband is in hospital. But their 13-year-old daughter and 7-year-old daughter, they believe that they are still somewhere high up in that building. And the police are saying that they're going to continue with this recovery rescue mission until they've been through and cleared all the rubble and searched everywhere.

And it does seem at least as if more of those who are awaiting, more of those bodies waiting to be discovered are two young girls higher up in the building. Now we're just moving. Police officers here need us to move back a little bit for the rescue workers, recovery workers can continue doing their job, but witnesses describe what happened in the early hours of this morning.

That they managed to pull one woman out of the rubble very quickly. They put her an ambulance but he said unfortunately she died when she got to a hospital. And a lady in another one of the apartment buildings here heard the woosh of the missile, thought it was coming for her apartment, put her kids in the bathtub, she said, put pillows on their heads. She really thought that they weren't going to live to see the morning. Of course they did. She feels lucky. But she said so many children lived in this apartment building.

So there's a whole range of different factors. But first and foremost we need the conflict to end. We need the fighting to stop so that people can go home, people can meet their own needs to the extent possible, and where not humanitarian actors such as the World Food Programme are able to operate.

And I fear, the longer it goes, the worse it is going to have across the region. So again, desperate times, absolutely essential that we see a ceasefire. The other additional challenge is, to what extent will WFP be able to respond, given that we already are on reduced rations in many of the countries that we're operating because we simply do not have the levels of funding required to meet the needs population.
