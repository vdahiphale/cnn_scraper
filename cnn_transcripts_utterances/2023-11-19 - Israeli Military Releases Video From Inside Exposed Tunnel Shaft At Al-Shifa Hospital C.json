I'm Jessica Dean, in for Fredricka Whitfield.And we begin with some breaking news: Israel Defense Forces just wrapping up a press conference a short time ago after releasing what they say is important new video from Al-Shifa Hospital, which has become a flashpoint of the war in Gaza. The video shows what the IDF says is a tunnel shaft on the hospital's grounds. Israel has long said that Hamas uses the hospital to cover up what it says is an extensive terror network underground. It's something Hamas and hospital officials have denied. CNN's Oren Liebermann entered Gaza with the Israeli Defense Forces last night to see the tunnel shaft for himself and what lies beneath there and CNN reported from Gaza under IDF escort at all times, as a condition for journalists to join that embed. Media outlets had to submit the footage filmed in Gaza to the Israeli military for review. CNN did retain editorial control over the final report. Oren, we just want to lay that out for everyone so they understand what they're seeing. Walk us through what you saw there on the ground in Gaza.",

Inside, the video shows a spiral staircase and as the camera orients itself, it moves forward into a tunnel. The tunnel makes a sharp left turn and at the end of another path, with concrete walls and an arched concrete top, a metal door they say they have not yet opened because they fear it is booby trapped. IDF spokesman Admiral Daniel Hagari says some of the Israeli hostages taken on October 7th were also brought to the hospital. He says the body of Noa Marciano was discovered 50 meters from the compound. REAR ADM. DANIEL HAGARI, ISRAEL'S CHIEF MILITARY SPOKESPERSON: We have evidence that they were holding hostages in Rantisi, but also we have evidence that they were bringing them to Shifa Hospital. We're still looking for the places they might have held them. LIEBERMANN (voice over): This is not proof of a Hamas command center or headquarters underneath the hospital, but Israel continues trying to build its case that Hamas uses the sanctuary of the hospital for cover, which Hamas and the hospital officials have denied. The IDF's ability to continue its operation in Gaza and the credibility of Israel are at stake here as the number killed in the fighting surpasses 12,000 according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health. The IDF says one of its missions is to destroy Hamas, but with international criticism mounting, Israel has to show the terror organization is using Gaza civilians and infrastructure as cover to justify an ongoing war. (END VIDEOTAPE) LIEBERMANN (on camera): In a statement, the IDF said the tunnel shaft itself that goes down is about 10 meters, so 33 feet, and then once underground, the length of the tunnel going horizontally they said is 55 meters, so more than 150 to 160 feet or so. They promised there will be more evidence as their efforts to uncover what's underground continues -- Jessica.",

God bless they've reported -- what -- 53 dead, which is a lot, but to really push in there, it is going to take ground forces and infantry. They've tried to do with air power and missiles and the nasty job of clearing those tunnels and getting around the corner and worrying about these explosives and then losses will go up significantly and naturally. And logically, the IDF wants to be as economical as possible, but time is not on their side. They know it. The whole global media court is out there watching them and much of the global street, so they've got to get this done. Now when you're in a hurry. Bad things happen when you're in a hurry, and so this requires patience. But they've got to move at the same time with alacrity. And in the middle of this, where are the hostages?

They have said repeatedly that downgrade in intelligence that they released last week suggests that the terror group has been using Al-Shifa Hospital as a command and control node and as a storage facility for weapons. And deputy National Security adviser, John Finer, he did speak to this as well this morning and he said that based on the intelligence information that the US has, they still believe that the Hamas is using \"Al-Shifa in an unconscionable way as a command and control facility for the planning of terrorist attacks.\" So they have not yet commented on this new imagery and video that we have seen of this tunnel shaft on the grounds of Al-Shifa Hospital. Of course, you know, there have been a number of tunnels that have been discovered all across Gaza, of course that Hamas was using. And the IDF, of course, says that this tunnel that they found, it goes towards the hospital and that it is further evidence that they were using it as that command center. It remains to be seen, of course, just how extensive the operation that Hamas was conducting within that hospital underneath it actually is and the IDF says that it is going to be releasing more information about that.

They were of humble origins.And though there were people of modest means that came to the White House after them, certainly the Clintons and the Obamas were of at least originally of humble means. The Carters were really rural people, and were not the Washington society, and that was something to their detriment in terms of Washington society. But I have to say, and when I was in college, I was -- I did an internship at the Carter Center, and actually on the topic of Middle East Studies with Dr. Ken Stein, who had a big falling out with Jimmy Carter, with former President Carter over Israel and Palestine, many, many years later. But the love and the marriage and the romance between President Jimmy and First Lady, Rosalynn Carter was something that I think charmed Americans, even his detractors. I mean, their love was so remarkable. And several years ago, in 2015, I got to interview President Carter and I asked him what their secret was, how they were able to keep their marriage so strong. And he said, you know, -- he said, a number of things and one of them was, you know, it's really good to -- you have to pick your partner carefully. You have to make sure you pick the right woman or the right man. Second, he said, you have to give each other space to do your own things. Three, he said, basically, don't go to sleep angry, don't go to bed angry. You have to reconcile before you go to bed at night. And then fourth, he said, try to find everything you can think of that you'd like to do together. And for them, that was family. So for anybody out there, I mean, I do think that Rosalynn Carter had, she had a wonderful life. She really did have a wonderful life. I mean, it is a life to be celebrated. It is sad that she has left, but she did have a wonderful life and I think that's one of the things, the great things about the Carters is that they always -- they have always known how blessed they were and they have always celebrated that, and their marriage is something that I think we can all look up to and all take a lesson from. And so anyway, for anybody looking at them and wondering how did they make it, how did their marriage last so long and how is it so strong? Those were the four lessons Jimmy Carter gave me back in 2015 and I've certainly tried to adhere to them ever since he told me him back in 2015.",

I remember covering the Camp David Accords when the President Carter was negotiating a peace deal between Anwar Sadat and Menachem Bagan at Camp David and I remember she was also involved in that, and she always worked with him. She always helped the president and she was directly involved in -- and recently a couple of years ago, when I went down to Plains, Georgia to interview the former president, Jimmy Carter. You know, she was there, we spent some quality time together. And you can see what a special woman she was, especially as they were getting to their 90s and both of them getting sick and suffering from various illnesses. She was always there for him, she was always special for the family and I just feel so sad now that she has passed. It was just the other day that the Carter Center announced she was beginning hospice care, and then all of a sudden, so quickly, she passes away. It just makes me sad to report this and to hear about it.",

She died at her home in Plains, Georgia. The Carter Center in Atlanta announcing on Friday that Mrs. Carter had entered hospice care. She had been diagnosed with dementia back in May. Her husband, former President Jimmy Carter began his home hospice care in February of this year following several hospital stays. And joining me now to talk more about her extraordinary life, presidential historian, Julian Zelizer and Bill Nigut, the co-host for \"Politically Georgia\" for \"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\" newspaper, and WABE radio. Bill, I want to start with you. You have been covering the Carters since 1983. So you have watched them for decades and decades, and it is interesting you started covering them in '83, because they really redefined what a post presidency could look like. They really were so busy and did so much after he got out of the White House. BILL NIGUT, CO-HOST FOR \"POLITICALLY GEORGIA: You know, Jessica, that's a really important point you make. I came to Atlanta to begin as a political reporter in late '83, and it was still the start of -- the Carters at that point were still recovering from the loss of the White House in his re-election campaign. They were still thinking about what they saw is their future. There was never any question in both of their minds that they were going to go on, to try to do something meaningful, probably in public health and international affairs and they began talking about the concept of the Carter Center, and raising money to build the Carter Center that didn't finally open for a few more years. So I got to see them still recovering from the loss, but already beginning to think about how they could build a future.",

And if you talk to people like the grandchildren, about what their life was like from the time he went into home hospice, they would sit together and hold hands. They ate peanut butter ice cream every night together. And in fact, it was Jimmy Carter, who was there to help her as she struggled. And of course, all these months later, Jimmy Carter is still in home hospice, still surviving at 99, and it is so shocking, that just two days after the announcement that she would go into home hospice, that she has passed away.",

My colleague at the AJC, Ernie Suggs tells a really kind of remarkable story about the 1970 gubernatorial campaign when Jimmy Carter did win. He tells the story that Mrs. Carter was campaigning early in the morning, out in front of an Atlanta cotton mill, and an old woman who worked the night shift came out and Mrs. Carter shook her hand, saw how tired this woman was and Mrs. Carter said to her, I hope you'll get go home and get some sleep. And the old woman said, I would love to, but I have a daughter at home who has mental issues. She is emotionally and mentally challenged, and so I don't get very much rest. And Mrs. Carter said that she thought about that woman all day. And so when you think about her fight to improve mental health services, she did a lot once they went to the White House, but she was already thinking about that as early as 1970 and her husband was there at her side to support everything she did in that area.",

And President Carter and I spoke very briefly, and then he walked me over to Mrs. Carter, and said to her in a very gentle way, do you remember Bill? He's been with us for a very, very long time. And it was already clear at that point that she was beginning to struggle with memory issues at the very least. But it was an example to me of the fact that he was so caring about her, that he wanted to make sure that I got a chance to say hello or she got a chance to say hello to me as well.
