      "sentences": "Hi, everyone. You're in the CNN NEWSROOM, and I'm Jessica Dean in New York.We begin this hour with growing fears in Gaza as tens of thousands of Palestinians flee the city of Rafah amid a looming major assault by Israel's military. Today, the IDF ordering the immediate evacuation of more neighborhoods in Rafah after the Israeli security cabinet approved an expansion of its military operations there. Satellite images show many of the densely populated tent camps where more than a million civilians have been taking shelter suddenly cleared out within a matter of days. The IDF estimating about 300,000 people have already left that area. And all of this coming amid a new report from the State Department that says it's, quote, \"reasonable to assess\" that American weapons have been used by Israeli forces in Gaza in ways that are, quote, \"inconsistent with international humanitarian law.\" We have CNN's Priscilla Alvarez with more fallout from that report. But first, let's go to CNN correspondent Scott McLean, who has more on the dire situation in Gaza. Scott, there has been more airstrikes targeting Rafah. What do you know? What's the latest right now?",

      "sentences": "Hey, Jessica. Yes. So this is according to hospitals in Rafah. They say that there were two airstrikes carried out in the city, some 15 people at this point have been confirmed to have died, including women and children. And what is especially noteworthy is that those strikes took place in areas that were not ordered to be evacuated by Israel.Israel did order several parts of northern Gaza and also of Rafah to evacuate today. All in anticipation of a stepped-up ground offensive in Rafah and that renewed bombing campaign in the north. And I say renewed because there have -- there has been restarted bombing there just this afternoon, according to the IDF, and it comes after there were several airstrikes overnight in Northern and Central Gaza. These came without warning, though, in the middle of the night. And frankly when can you look at some of the video of the aftermath, in the hospitals which are chaotic, on the strike locations, which are completely destroyed, it is especially hard to watch because there are so many children in those videos. Some of them very, very small. Infants even. Also among the victims is a journalist, his wife and his 12-year-old son. That marks the 143rd journalist to be killed since this war began. The IDF was asked about those strikes last night. They declined to comment other than to say that they are trying to dismantle Hamas and that they work within international law and they take precautions to safeguard civilians. That's notable, of course though, because it comes just a day after this report was released by the U.S. State Department strongly suggesting that in many cases, the opposite is actually true. Israel has been pushing those that it's asked to evacuate toward one particular area along the coastline called Al-Mawasi. It is a sandy area, it has dunes there, and very little, though, in the way of infrastructures to support the 300,000 people who have pitched tents in those areas. That's double the number that the IDF estimated on Thursday, 150,000. And inside Rafah, there's already plenty of evidence that, you know, the streets are starting to hollow out. People are leaving, they're picking up whatever they have and they're going either by car or by donkey cart or in many cases on foot. And our CNN stringer today, Jessica, was able to speak with one woman as she was leaving today with three young kids in tow and she was very emotional and she said it's horrible. Is the world happy to see this? We can't find a place to stay. We don't know where we're going to go. And she's obviously not even close to the only one -- Jessica.",

      "sentences": "That's right, Jessica. This high-stakes and highly anticipated report came as the president is on his West Coast swing concluding here in Seattle for fundraising. Now, this report was really another moment, another stark moment in the U.S.-Israeli relations. It was put together by the Biden administration and it found that, quote, it's reasonable to assess that U.S. weapons have been used by Israeli forces in Gaza in a way that is, quote, \"inconsistent\" with international humanitarian law.But it stops short of saying that Israel violated the law. Of course, this report stemmed from a February National Security memorandum that was required to make a determination on this matter as well as whether Israel withheld humanitarian aid to Gaza in violation of U.S. law. But there has been some pushback here because while the report came to these conclusions and was highly critical, it doesn't provoke any type of U.S. policy change at this point. And it also doesn't mandate any actions by the Israeli government. So allies to the president have pushed back on this saying that, yes, there are there, it is critical and yet there is no change on the horizon. And of course, all of this, Jessica, comes against the backdrop of the president's interview with CNN earlier this week, where for the first time he said that he's willing to withhold some weapons from Israel if they move forward with a major ground operation in Rafah. Rafah had been that area where more than a million Palestinians are displaced. Of course, he said that the U.S. will continue to provide defensive weapons. That could change, though, with offensive weapons. So still a lot of questions here in terms of what this looks like moving forward. But what is very clear, Jessica, is that there are underlying tensions that remain between the U.S. and Israel as it wages its war against Hamas.",

There has been a lot of activity in recent weeks in these, hostage talks with the CIA director going abroad to engage in some of these talks, the secretary of state and even the president and the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, all engaging on this, but there is still no deal.

Thanks so much for that reporting.And joining us now from Tel Aviv is Danny Danon. He's a member of Israel's Knesset, a former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations. Mr. Ambassador, thank you so much for joining us this afternoon. I just first want to get your reaction to the State Department report on Israel's use of U.S. weapons in Gaza. DANNY DANON, MEMBER OF ISRAEL'S KNESSET: Jessica, we haven't seen the report yet, but I can tell you one thing. The way we conduct the war, we take all precautions in order to make sure we minimize casualties for civilians. And we have proved it. You know, the very fact that, as we speak, we're asking that relation to move to a different area, we just show you that, you know, it takes us too long, seven months to operate in Gaza. But that's only because we do it slowly. We try to minimize civilian casualties. And we'll continue to do that. And I think our friends in the U.S. that are aware of that, they know what's happening here on the ground. And then they should actually look at the fact of what's happening here, regardless of those allegation that we get every once in a while.",

But he wants to see how we handle the humanitarian aspects. And we have plans how to deal with the civilian population, to move them to a different base before we operate in Rafah.And all of a sudden we heard those news about holding that shipment and that at the same time when Iran is doubling their shipments to their proxies in Lebanon and we are being attacked by Hezbollah, by proxy of Iran and by Hamas. So yes, we are disappointed, but we will continue the dialogue with the U.S. We are grateful for the support, but at the end of the day, we will take the decisions by ourselves. We will not forget the hostages, including five American hostages who are being held by Hamas. And we have no desire to go to Rafah. I can tell you as a father of an officer in the military, nobody in Israel is happy to send a family member to fight in Gaza. But we don't see any other option to bring back the hostages and to finish the war. If Hamas will surrender tomorrow morning and will release the hostages, we will definitely not go into Rafah.",

But if you compare to the way that the U.S. fought terrorism, whether it's in Afghanistan or Iraq, sometimes you have to use force to fight off the terrorists, and they are hiding behind civilians. They are committing a war crime by hiding behind civilians. So it's challenging for every democracy in fighting a terror organization to fight when you fight inside a civilian population.We are doing our best to minimize casualties. We will continue to do that. And sometimes when we get the support of the U.S., it allows us to use sophisticated weapons in order to achieve our goals. If we will not have those weapons, we will continue without those weapons. And I think it will be harder for us and the casualties will be larger.

And that was very bad news for us that even 33 hostages that would committee to give us the number of people who are alive.So that's bad news. I think we will have to use more force in order to get to a deal. That's what happened when we started the war. We put a lot of force. We forced them to negotiate and to achieve an agreement.

So whether they're, you know, the sophistication of their doing it, though, is really questionable because on cross-examination, they went in the same areas themselves, it appeared at Donald Trump's request to try to get in and mix it up with Stormy and they did not do well at it.

Well, it's known as a sunspot.Do you remember the eclipse last month and we have these specialized glasses. You can go outside, reuse your solar eclipse glasses, point up towards the sun only when you're wearing these glasses, and you can see the sunspot because it is so large on the sun. It's 17 times the size of the earth. And that sunspot is responsible for ejecting solar plasma, these highly charged particles. That's what it looks like on your screen there. Those are the solar flares that have recently ejected from that sunlight that is visible to the necked eye when you, of course, wear proper protection. And this is sending these charged particles through the atmosphere via the solar wind. And we've had several different opportunities for this to charge up our magnetic field here across planet earth. Think of it as almost like a Roman shield deflecting that plasma towards the poles. And that gives us obviously the unique opportunity to experience the aurora borealis or the auroras strophes in the southern hemisphere. And you know what? We have seen it in places that don't normally experience it, including Florida and including here in my backyard. That's why we're actually here because we are anticipating seeing it once again tonight as another one of these coronal mass ejections heads towards planet earth as we speak. But you had a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity if you witnessed this, let's say, in Florida yesterday or here in Atlanta, Georgia, where I was yesterday. Now, we have maxed out the scales from the Space Prediction Center. We saw a G-5. That is the highest level of electro and storm activity. And guess what? We're moving right into another very active period. So once that sunsets tonight, the potential to see more solar activity is definitely on the cards. Probably not as far south as the gulf coast and Florida like we experienced yesterday. But believe me, we'll be ready for that moment. You could see that greatest chance of viewing here all the way to Nashville and Atlanta. Plenty of clouds for some places. But you know what? It'll be worth it.
