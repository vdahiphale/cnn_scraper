And now he is again -- a lot of Republicans are thinking that he was the primary reason that they lost in these midterms on the whole. I think they see him as a loser and that is not what they want. As much as he caused controversy, they saw him as a winner and someone who could energize the base.

It is one of many uplifting moments we've seen over the past few days. Just yesterday the Ukrainian flag was once again raised at the city square. Hundreds of residents joined in the celebration, waving flags of their own and cheering for the troops who freed the city from the Russians. So far Ukraine says it has liberated more than 60 settlements in the Kherson region, mostly in the area west of the Dnipro River. Now authorities are trying to restore normality to those places.

They have been able to get food in pretty rapidly. But rebuilding that infrastructure will be very important as winter approaches. But for the population there, that is relatively insignificant compared to the joy of being liberated. But on the other side of the river, 60 percent of Kherson province is in Russia's hands; in particular, Nova Kakhovka, upriver from Kherson, one side of the river opposite that bank now controlled by Ukrainians, the other side controlled by the Russians. That will be a very significant target in the future for Ukrainian forces, because it controls the water flowing down the canal from the Dnipro into the Crimean Peninsula. So in that context, the Russians have recently announced that they are evacuating civilians from around that area 15 kilometers away from the river, perhaps signaling that they are anticipating at least heavier fighting there.

On Sunday we expect to see one of the biggest rappers in the industry come out in support of Raphael Warnock. That is what we expect to see throughout the next couple of days. But the question is for Herschel Walker. Who will he ask to come and rally for him? Will it be former president Donald Trump, the person who gave him the nod for this position? Or will it be someone like Georgia governor Brian Kemp, who has been feuding with president Trump over the past few years but was able to win his re-election bid with a wide margin and is very popular still here in the state of Georgia? Those are questions that both sides of the aisle have to figure out as they continue to pour in more and more money.

Of course they are familiar with each other; they have been meeting face-to-face for more than 10 years now. And there are a whole host of issues where Beijing and Washington disagree. The biggest flashpoint is that self-governing island of Taiwan. Beijing claims it as its own territory, even though the Communist Party has never ruled Taiwan ever. And it accuses Washington of interfering in its own internal affairs every time a top U.S. government official travels to Taiwan. President Biden has said several times that the U.S. would defend Taiwan if China ever moved militarily against it. That is a big friction point. And there are other areas as well. China has said that it wants to establish a new world order in conjunction with Russia. So it is hard to see where these two leaders can see eye to eye.

But one big sign of the holiday season has arrived here in New York City. This year's Rockefeller Center Christmas tree arrived on Saturday. The Norway spruce stands at about 82 feet tall and weighs in at 14 tons. The massive tree will be decorated before the famous lighting ceremony happening on November 30th. After the holidays it will be taken down and donated to Habitat for Humanity, where the wood will be used to build houses. Even before most Americans have finalized their Thanksgiving plans, the Viennese Dream Christmas market is open in Vienna, Austria. And there doesn't seem to be a mask in sight. The market was closed during the 2020 season due to the pandemic. Last year, the market still had some COVID-19 restrictions but now vendors say the place is hopping. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator):  I can tell you we are open today for the first day and I've never seen such a strong customer frequency on the first day. It's fantastic. Everything is on the move. Everything is on its feet. The tourists from all over the world are here; the Austrians as well. It's great. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You know, the bells sounded through wars. And we just try and imagine what these bells have actually seen, 160 years in London. Even though everybody carries a wristwatch or looks at the computer, they love listening to Big Ben. So we started again striking it this week. And all we've gotten is praise, people going, oh, that's brilliant to hear Big Ben back again. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
