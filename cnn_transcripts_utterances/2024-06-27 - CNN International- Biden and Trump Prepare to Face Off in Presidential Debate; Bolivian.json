It is Thursday, June the 27th 9 a.m. here in London, 4 a.m. In Atlanta, where Joe Biden and Donald Trump will square off in the first 2024 presidential debate. The candidates will take the stage at CNN's World Headquarters this evening.Unlike previous debates, there will be no live audience and the candidates microphones will be turned off when their speaking time expires. The economy immigration abortion and protecting democracy are amongst the key issues for voters. And we can expect plenty of focus on the candidates mental sharpness as well. The latest CNN Poll of Polls shows no clear leader in the presidential race and both candidates have struggled with negative approval ratings. Mr. Biden's campaign says his debate focus will be on his economic record protecting democracy and abortion rights. CNN's MJ Lee has a look at one specific line of attack expected from Trump.

      "sentences": "There is one separate category of incoming from Donald Trump that President Biden, we are told, is preparing for. And that is potential personal insults and attacks aimed not just at the president, but members of his family as well. A Biden adviser tells me that in debate prep sessions at Camp David, the president and his team have been preparing for the president to respond to those kinds of potential attacks thrown his way by the former president.And while this adviser wouldn't elaborate, of course, still fresh for President Biden is the news from earlier this month that his son Hunter was convicted on three felony gun charges. This was a legal saga that was extremely painful for the entire Biden family. And, of course, what's incredible is that the president has already experienced his son Hunter being attacked by the former president on the debate stage. And that was back in 2020 when President Trump said that Hunter Biden had been dishonorably discharged from the military for cocaine use. To be clear, he had been administratively discharged, which is different. He also mocked Hunter Biden for not getting a job, he said, until his father had become vice president. And the moment where President Biden defended Hunter Biden in in response ended up being a moment that aid said afterwards really resonated with American voters. There's a moment where the president at the time was able to really connect with different American families who have had experience with family members dealing with addiction issues. So all of this just goes to show the level to which the Biden team has really been trying to prepare the president for anything and everything that the former president might throw his way on Thursday night.

That's 2 a.m. here in London.Now, an attempt to overthrow Bolivia's democratically elected government has been stopped. And the former army chief behind the failed coup d'etat was arrested in La Paz after a dramatic confrontation with a Bolivian president inside a government palace. President Luis Arce reportedly told Juan Jose Zuniga, I am your captain and I will not allow this insubordination. Zuniga was later shown handcuffed on national TV before being forced into a police vehicle. This all comes a day after he was relieved of his duties. Earlier, armored vehicles were seen ramming the doors of the palace as armed troops surrounded government buildings. Well, the soldiers withdrew after the newly appointed army chief ordered them back to their units. President Arce had called on the public to mobilize in defense of democracy. The attorney general's office is now vowing to impose the maximum punishment on the perpetrators of the attempted coup. CNN's Stefano Pozzebon has a closer look now at how it all unfolded. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STEFANO POZZEBON, CNN CONTRIBUTOR (voice-over): In the end, the attempted coup was defused in a matter of hours. But only after army units took control of the city center of La Paz and military vehicles quite literally rammed the doors of the presidential palace. But inside, they met a firm response from the sitting president. Luis Arce telling rebel general Juan Jose Zuniga to stand down. It fills us with bravery and courage to keep on resisting any coup attempt because Bolivia deserves its democracy, which has been won in the streets and with blood, brothers and sisters. Zuniga, who had been the head of the Bolivian army since 2022, was detained shortly after and is now under criminal investigation. It appears Zuniga decided to move against the state after his dismissal on Tuesday. He was fired for threatening former president Evo Morales from running for re-election. We are the armed wing of the people, the armed wing of the fatherland. A warning sign of how Latin American militaries may have become more comfortable taking bolder actions. GUSTAVO FLORES-MACIAS, PROFESSOR OF GOVERNMENT AND PUBLIC POLICY, CORNELL UNIVERSITY: The armed forces have gained more and more involvement. They have more of a say in public affairs. And frankly, this has emboldened the military in thinking that maybe, you know, civilians absolutely need them. And it generates this sense among the population that civilians may be unable to solve policy problems, that they really need the militaries to step in.",
