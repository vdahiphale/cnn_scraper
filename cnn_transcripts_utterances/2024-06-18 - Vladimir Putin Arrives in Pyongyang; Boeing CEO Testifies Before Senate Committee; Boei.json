The Russian president greeted on the tarmac by Kim Jong Un as he landed in North Korea. Boeing backlash. The playmaker's CEO apologizes to the families of victims of two 737 MAX crashes while being grilled over safety issues by U.S. lawmakers. Cartel crackdown. Law enforcement in China, Mexico, and the United States unite against drug money laundering networks in America. And a Babbel battle. The global language learning system mixing artificial and human intelligence aka personal tutors in a bid to become the top translation app. That conversation and plenty more coming up. But first, Russia's President Vladimir Putin has arrived in North Korea for talks with leader Kim Jong Un. It's his first visit there since the year 2000 when he met with Kim Jong Un's father, the late Kim Jong Il. North Korea maximizing the pomp and ceremony for the occasion, Russian flags bunting, even photos of President Putin himself lining the streets. It's an important moment for the two leaders, both increasingly at odds with the west. Russia, of course, it's become yet more isolated over the war in Ukraine and needs basic ammunition supplies. On North Korea requires both economic and advanced technological support after years of international sanctions. Will Ripley joins us now from Taipei on this. A very personal welcome, perhaps, as you would expect. Will, good morning. Do we have any sense now of what North Korea has planned for this showcase?",

They were popping up ahead of this hearing. What do you make of what happened? RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR-AT-LARGE:  It was not a stellar performance by any stretch. The way in which he had to admit he hadn't seen documents sent by Boeing to the committee that he had to admit were gibberish, the fact that he didn't know how many whistleblowers or that he'd met the whistleblowers, it was a poor, sort of performance. But I think what really stood out for me was when he stood up and did that apology to the relatives. He was the CEO brought in after those crashes to improve the safety culture. He had two years to do it and spectacularly failed with the Alaska door blowout. So, that begs the question, which he was asked again -- I mean, one senator, Senator Hawley, not surprisingly, said, why don't you resign, basically, and go. Well, he has essentially resigned. He's going at the end of the year. He is, Julia, the scapegoat. They're heaping everything on it. He's happy to take it on his back because he's got a very good compensation package.",

Israel's militarysays it now has approved plans for a potential offensive in Lebanon. For months, the Israel Defense Forces have traded fire with Hezbollah, a militant group based in Lebanon. However, this doesn't necessarily mean war is imminent. The U.S. has been trying to avoid a wider war through diplomacy, spending a special envoy to Lebanon and Israel this week. But Israel has been preparing for that possibility that diplomatic efforts could fail. Let's get more now from Oren Lieberman, who's in Tel Aviv for us tonight. Oren, good to have you with us. I think that's the point we should emphasize here, there has to be some form of preparation if those diplomatic efforts to de-escalate what we've seen since October the 7th fails.",

The northern command putting out astatement from the IDF saying it has validated its operational plans for an offensive in the north. It doesn't mean a war is about to start tomorrow. Or rather, if you look at the hostilities now as already a conflict, that wider war is about to start tomorrow. But it is the IDF of saying, look, we're monitoring the northern border. We know Hezbollah has fired some 5,000 rockets and missiles and drones across the border since right after October 7th. And it would be foolhardy to think that somehow this will just end and that diplomacy will work. Certainly, that possibility is there. And the U.S. envoy here, Amos Hochstein, has held meetings here over the last couple of days to try to make diplomacy work. But in this region, that's never a given. And the IDF is just putting out a statement saying, it's ready if it gets to that point. And crucially, if that order comes. There are still voices here, many of them in senior leadership positions saying, look, we are ready for diplomacy to work, looking for an off ramp. And it has repeatedly been said by the U.S. that neither Israel nor Lebanon nor Hezbollah are looking for a war. And yet, one miscalculation could easily lead to that one. One attack from either side that kills too many people or causes too great of a catastrophe can easily lead to a wider war. This is the IDF saying, look, if that moment comes and the order is given, the plans are in place to carry out an offensive. The question, of course, as we've seen over the last couple of days up north is where is this headed? It's not the volume of fire today, yesterday that we're seeing a couple of days ago, there aren't the fires raging in Northern Israel that we've seen, and yet, the world, and certainly the U.S. remain concerned. And that's because if you compare Hamas to Hezbollah, Hezbollah is a far more powerful organization with a far larger arsenal. And if that were to come into play versus Israel's military, a war could be catastrophic in Southern Lebanon and Northern Israel.",

For a long time, U.S. officials have pleaded with their Chinese counterparts to crack down on both the production of things like fentanyl precursors or chemicals used to make fentanyl, but also on the money laundering rings that are allegedly being used by the Mexican cartels to clean their cash. They have to find a way to get it out of the U.S. Get it out of Mexico, and get it back into sort of legitimate looking accounts. And that's where some of these money laundering networks come in that are long established. It's been about a decade now that -- according to U.S. officials and private experts that Chinese money laundering rings in, in the U.S. and in Latin America have been working with the cartels to launder the money. And what we're seeing today is the, you know, sort of the tip of the spear. There's an ongoing series of investigations. We've gotten a glimpse behind the scenes of some of the tactics that law enforcement are trying to use to disrupt these networks. But it's such a lucrative trade, Julia, that -- and it really depends on how willing prosecutors are able -- you know, are to put some of the defendants behind bars for many years. Because otherwise, if they do a year or two in jail for lesser charges, they might be willing to go through that and then be able to be released in a couple years. So, it's really a long game of trying to get governments to cooperate more. And to your point, it's a rare occurrence when we have Mexico, China, and the U.S. making a sort of joint announcement saying, we were able to apprehend two people in this network.",

Sean Lyngaas there. Now, in the past few hours, the U.S. president has announced an executive action allowing hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants to apply for U.S. citizenship. It coincides with the 12th anniversary of the DACA immigration policy for those known as Dreamers. This new program applies to the spouses and children of U.S. Citizens, with the White House saying that more than half a million families will benefit. President Joe Biden laid out some of the terms of the new plan. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  This action still requires undocumented spouses to file all required legal paperwork to remain in the United States, requires them to pass a criminal background check. And it doesn't apply to anyone trying to come here today. It only applies -- this action is a better way. It doesn't tear families apart, while requiring every undocumented spouse to fulfill their obligations under the law. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, despite the ruling, Trump can still file a petition to have the court hear the case. Justin Timberlake has been charged with one count of driving while intoxicated and has now been released from police custody. Timberlake's mugged shot, it can be seen here. He was also cited for running a stop sign and failure to keep in his lane, according to his attorney. Timberlake was arrested overnight in Sag Harbor in the State of New York. His next court date is on July 26th. And it's a very special Pride Month in Thailand. The nation set to become the first in Southeast Asia to legalize same sex marriage. The Kingdom Senate overwhelmingly approved marriage equality Tuesday. Thailand's king is expected to sign off on the measure the last step before it becomes law. It's only the third place in Asia to allow same sex marriage following Taiwan and Nepal. As activists hope this step will encourage other nations to enact marriage equality. Anna Coren has more.

Ten years ago, we had to bottle our feelings. And now, I can freely say that I am gay. COREN (voice-over):  On Tuesday, the Thai Senate voted to legalize same sex marriage, a first for Southeast Asia. That success has been hard won. POKPONK JITJAIYAI, PROFESSIONAL WEDDING SINGER (through translator):  This should have happened in Thailand a long time ago. After our success, I hope that we'll be like a domino and start that effect to nearby countries. COREN (voice-over):  Pokponk was once forced to abandon a career as a martial arts coach after he says a student outed him as gay. JITJAIYAI (through translator):  My life was shattered. My male students were afraid of me. My female students mocked me, saying I was not a real man.

But while A.I. is now firmly established as a go-to resource for travelers and students alike, the need for real people remains. In fact, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Statistics. Employment for interpreters and translators is projected to grow by 4 percent from 2022 to 2032, and that's around the average growth for all occupations. Now, while the foreign language learning at Babbel has been integrating A.I. for over a decade, it recognizes the need for real people in teaching too. Today, it's launching a service to offer live private classes with human tutors. Julie Hansen is the U.S. CEO of Babbel, and she joins us now. Julie, fantastic to have you on. I'm sure this is demand-based because you've been doing live teaching with groups now for a number of years. Why now go private? JULIE HANSEN, U.S. CEO, BABBEL:  Exactly right. Thanks for having me, by the way. It's just been the number one request from our group classes from the beginning. People want to have that personal connection. And it has a lot to do with, like, your own maybe pace of learning, but also the fear of speaking in front of others, that goes away when you have a personal tutor. So, that's the biggest thing. And, you know, it's not just that it holds us back, it actually makes it -- we don't learn as well when we're afraid to speak. So, the private tutor can really accelerate learning.",
