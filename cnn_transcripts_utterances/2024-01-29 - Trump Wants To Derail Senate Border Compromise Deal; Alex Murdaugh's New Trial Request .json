You'll all recall when President Biden was sworn in on January 20th, 2021, the new administration started ending many of the Trump administration's immigration policies, arguing that they were harsh and inhumane. For instance, the Remain in Mexico policy, which forced would-be asylum seekers to stay south of the border. Migrant arrivals and requests for asylum surged. Last May, along party lines, House Republicans passed H.R. 2, that's a bill that would bring back Trump-era policies. President Biden threatened to veto the bill and it's gone nowhere in the democratic- controlled Senate. Last October, Republicans demanded that any additional aid for Ukraine and or Israel be would also need to include legislation to deal with the border crisis. Republican Senator James Lankford of Oklahoma, along with Independent Senator Kyrsten Sinema and Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, the three of them started negotiating for a possible compromise. In mid- December, apparently hoping to win passage of the aid for Ukraine, the White House signaled that they would accept some of the Republicans' immigration demands, including limits on asylum and an expansion of detention and deportation efforts. This meant for all intents and purposes, that the Lankford, Sinema, Murphy compromise would be the most conservative immigration compromise that the Senate had taken up in decades. But then, in a January 17th post on Truth Social, former president Donald Trump wrote, \"I do not think we should do a border deal at all \"'unless we get everything.\" More posts followed along those lines. You will recall that Donald Trump was not able to pass any immigration reform when he was president. It did become clear that Trump wanted to use this issue against Biden in November and that was why he wanted to stand in the way of any progress on it. On Friday, House Speaker Mike Johnson, who frequently communicates with Team Trump, sent a letter to his colleagues saying that the emerging border deal in the Senate would be, quote, \"dead on arrival\" in the House. And believe it or not, right now in Oklahoma, the Oklahoma Republican Party is condemning Lankford for having the temerity to try to solve a major problem in this country. That brings us to today. CNN's Melanie Zanona on Capitol Hill. Melanie, is there any hope for the Senate negotiations now? When will senators even reveal the details of this deal?",

      "sentences": "Well, negotiators are still hoping to reveal bill text sometime this week. But Jake, the deal is already facing massive headwinds inside the GOP, particularly in the House. You mentioned Speaker Johnson has made clear that the deal, as he understands it, is likely dead-on arrival in the House, and today he put out yet another statement, taking aim at one of the reported provisions in this deal, saying on social media, \"Any border shutdown authority that allows even one illegal crossing is a non-starter. Thousands each day is outrageous. The number must be zero.\"Now, that is a reference to a provision we have learned is in the Senate deal that would automatically shut down the southern border if average daily migrant crossings reach over 5,000 in a one-week span. We've also learned that negotiators have agreed to a provision that would speed up the process for those seeking asylum to six months and also expedite work permits. So those are some pretty significant concessions here from Democrats. In fact, this would likely be the most conservative immigration deal being discussed on Capitol Hill in decades. And President Biden has indicated that he would sign that package into law if it comes to his desk. And yet, despite all of that, it is very unclear whether it will reach Biden's desk. And a huge reason for that, Jake, is Donald Trump, the Republican frontrunner for the presidential nomination. He has been urging Republicans both privately and publicly to reject this compromise in a large part because he wants to campaign on this issue and he does not want to have Biden and Democrats a victory. And many Republicans here on Capitol Hill, eager to follow his marching orders. And that is what you're seeing right now on Capitol Hill, which is leaving border security and aid for Israel and Ukraine hanging in the balance, Jake.",

In their impeachment articles, which they unveiled yesterday, they said he has not maintained operational control of the border, that he has not enforced laws on the books, and that he's lost the trust of the American public, all of which Democrats and constitutional experts say is a policy dispute and does not rise to a high crime or misdemeanor.But the other element at play here, the reason they are pursuing these impeachment articles now is politics. Speaker Mike Johnson has been under pressure from his right flank. The base has been urging and itching for revenge really after Donald Trump was impeached twice when House Democrats had control of the House. And so now you're seeing moderate Republicans lining up behind this. Speaker Johnson promising to move quickly to put this on the floor, even while he promises to reject the Senate compromise deal, which could help stem that flow of migrants at the border, that same flow of migrants, which now Republicans in the House are saying they want to impeach Mayorkas over, Jake.",

As for the tunnel they say they found here where the cemetery once stood, the military never provided any evidence. (END VIDEOTAPE) DIAMOND (on camera): And, Jake, we pressed the Israeli military multiple times for that evidence, but instead, they released a press release today that actually poked more holes in their story. The story that General Goldfuss told us when we're in that underground command center. He said that we're just below the cemetery, but the press release a map that the Israeli military released today actually places that command center well outside the bounds of that cemetery.

The trenches in which Ukrainian soldiers hunker down are cold and wet as Russians bomb and strike them with artillery. CNN's Fred Pleitgen and crew even came under fire themselves trying to get to this area. A warning, some of the images we're about to show you in this report are disturbing.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (voice-over): All out warfare in unforgiving terrain. Forest battles in eastern Ukraine mean facing a near constant Russian onslaught. Vladimir Putin's army trying to break through Ukrainian defenses. Dmytro is one of those holding them up. The situation is very active and very tense, he says, because the enemy has much more equipment and manpower. Basically, every day they try to storm the positions. A dead Russian soldier and a destroyed tank show just how close the Russians have come. It's a fight for survival and against the elements. The trench cold, wet, and soggy, the only heat coming from candles the soldiers cower around, gathering strength to face overwhelming Russian firepower. They shoot direct fire. Planes are flying. Basically, they have it all, he says. But probably the worst are tanks. When they fire, you don't even hear it. You hear an airplane when it comes over with a tank, you're in God's hands. Artillery fire, another threat here, as we found out when we came under fire trying to make it to the area.",

It's no secret we're starved of artillery shells. He says we try to work as efficiently and accurately as possible to hit the enemy's firepower, trying to fight back any way they can on one of the toughest battlefields of this war. (END VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (on camera): And, Jake, the Ukrainians say by and large on that front line, they say that they're holding on. In fact, troops there told us that they destroyed more than 40 tanks and armored vehicles in the span of just a couple of days. And yet the Russians keep coming. And one of the big issues right now for the Ukrainians is increased use of heavy Russian aerial bombs that they say can wreak havoc on those trenches that you saw there.",
