We are just about t minus six hours to show time. Everyone is scanning weather reports to figure out if they will get a view. Roughly 32 million Americans live in the path of totality. That is where NASA says the moon will appear to completely cover the sun for about four minutes, or as one scientist just told us, where the moon will eat the sun. That is science. Ninety-nine percent of Americans will view at least a partial eclipse, which is still pretty cool, but not totally cool. Again, science. The next time this will happen is 2044, 20 years from now.

This is the heart of the Texas hill country, and according to the mayor of this town, about 100,000 people from all over the world are expected to be here in this town for this.Now, let me give you that TikTok of what we're expecting, because the total -- this eclipse is going to cross from Mexico into the United States at about 1:27 p.m. in Eagle Pass, Texas, or near Eagle Pass, Texas. I just can't get away from covering the border here, and the good thing is that the federal agency that's going to be monitoring and following this eclipse as it crosses the border from Mexico is going to be NASA. So there's going to be no stopping this eclipse. It's going to continue on from Texas all the way to Maine. Now, about the economic impact here. According to one on source, that could be about $6 billion across the United States. But the Texas slice of that astronomical pie is about $1.4 billion. And businesses are getting very creative, especially here in Kerrville. We're not just talking about all sorts of glasses for the eclipse but also pins that show that it's an eclipse. And guys, I'm not wearing this on this time, but you can see that it's an eclipse pen that's on here. Theres also, of course, crystal balls that are being sold in this town, just a little bit of everything, t-shirts like the one that I'm wearing. But the business that gets the most points for creativity is the brewery that's just across the river from the park where I am. They're actually going to be given free beer during the four minutes of totality here. And what could go wrong when you give free beer in the dark? Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, to answer your earlier question as to whether the eclipse will make a sound if it's cloudy, listen to this. There are a lot of birds that live in this forest, so they're going to have experts here studying what happens during an eclipse. Right now, it's still dark, it's early in the morning. They're trying to get on with their daily routine. You can hear the nodes are making. They're going to have experts not only listening, seeing what happened, but telling the people what's happening. We're hoping for not cloudy days and a big show on this sky. BERMAN:  Extraordinary stuff. Gustavo Valdes, Rosa Flores, our thanks to both of you. Everyone, obviously, get your eclipse viewing glasses. This rare opportunity will not come around again for two decades. You can join CNN for special live coverage of the eclipse across the country today at 1:00 p.m. eastern, or you and stream it on Max. And Kate, I do have to tell you, you heard the birds there going -- you know what's coming. The birds there are going crazy.

I am going to quickly read some of that for you. She said: \"We are deeply disappointed in President Trump's position. Unborn children and their mothers deserve national protections and national advocacy from the brutality of the abortion industry.\" The statement goes on to say, \"Saying the issue is 'back to the states' cedes the national abortion debate to the Democrats.\" And so definitely not what I think a lot of his leading anti-abortion allies had wanted him to do, not going as far as they thought he should.

The United States is on high alert, actively preparing for a significant attack that could come anytime from Iran, possibly targeting US or Israeli assets in the Middle East after last week's Israeli airstrike in Syria that killed top Iranian commanders. US officials believe an attack by Iran though is inevitable. CNN's Alex Marquardt is following all of this and he is joining us now. And Alex, we've talked about this a lot.

Now US officials believe that Iran could respond imminently within the next few days, they say, against American and/or Israeli targets. Now, the US has been trying to distance itself from that Israeli strike, saying publicly that this was Israel that carried it out, that they had no prior knowledge, that they had no involvement in this. But at the same time, warning that Iran should not retaliate against US interests.

There are really two pressing issues right now, Kate, in terms of thepotential escalation. An Iranian response against US or Israeli targets, and what Israel may do when it comes to Lebanon. Now, remember for the past six months, there has also been this low level war going on between Hezbollah in Southern Lebanon and Israel. Tens of thousands of Israelis have been displaced. The US has been working furiously to prevent a second front from opening up, but now Israel is saying that they are ready to move from defense to attack when it comes to Hezbollah. They are preparing ways to get more troops and equipment faster to that border. Now I've reported recently that US intelligence believes that Israel could open up a second front by attacking Southern Lebanon by early summer. US diplomats trying to prevent that from happening to create a buffer in Southern Lebanon to push Hezbollah away from that border, but Israel may feel that that is not enough and launch a broader campaign into Southern Lebanon -- Kate.",

Now, these plans would benefit people who fall under these categories. Let me read some of those to you. Borrowers who already qualify for student loan forgiveness under existing programs, but have not yet applied. Those who have entered repayment, at least 20 years ago, those who enrolled in \"low financial value programs\" and those experiencing financial hardship. Now, these plans still need to go through a public comment period. So it may take some time before these all take effect, but the White House says that some of these borrowers could see relief as early as this fall. Of course, this is all part of the president's pitch to lower costs for Americans. And today, he is going to take pick that pitch to battleground Wisconsin, where he will be talking about all the efforts his administration has made that have helped the American pocketbook and especially front and center, the programs that he is rolling out to provide some relief to borrowers.",
