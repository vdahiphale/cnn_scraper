About three hours from now, a US government jet, will touch down at Joint Base Andrews capping the largest prisoner exchange with Russia since the Cold War and one of the most intricate of its kind ever.Sixteen Russian detainees released, including three Americans. \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter Evan Gershkovich, former Marine Paul Whelan, Russian American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva, also, dissident and US permanent resident, Vladimir Kara-Murza. They were flown from Russia to Ankara, Turkey, where the exchange took place. Like the deal itself, that exchange involved several different planes from the US, Germany, Poland, Slovenia, Norway, and Russia. Here is Gershkovich in a photo the White House put out with Kurmasheva and Whelan speaking with President Biden. And here they are on the plane that is now just a short way out from Andrews. Speaking about what went into freeing them, the normally buttoned down National Security Adviser, Jake Sullivan, well, he got choked up. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The dark flip side of the deal, the price of the deal, however, was the release of a collection of Russian criminals and alleged criminals, including the man in the cap there, Vadim Krasikov, former FSB Colonel and hitman, convicted of an execution style murder. Here, greeted by Vladimir Putin back in Moscow with a warm embrace.Former President Trumps saw little good in the deal quoting now from his post on social media, \"I got back many hostages and gave the opposing country nothing and never any cash.\" First, Jake Sullivan today, said the US included no money in the deal and did not loosen any economic sanctions. Additionally, CNN factchecker, Daniel Dale has uncovered four exchanges in which the former president himself approved the release of prisoners from US detention in exchange for foreign adversaries releasing Americans. Those adversaries, they include Iran, the Taliban, and the Houthi rebels in Yemen. As for Evan Gershkovich, he personally extended Putin one final gesture before his release. According to \"The Wall Street Journal,\" at the end of the application for clemency, he had to submit. He added a handwritten request for Putin for an interview. Always a working journalist. Joining us now with more on what went into this remarkable deal, we're joined by CNN's Alex Marquardt. Alex, what a complicated web of diplomacy that brought this over the finish line, all the countries involved. How exactly did this deal come together?",

But then, when he was killed that kind of put all kinds of questions in the air.So, we are told that up until the last minute, Biden was working the phones. He was trying to get the Germans across the finish line and including on that final day, that when he -- two weeks ago when he announced that he was dropping out of the race. He actually made a separate call so the Slovenian prime minister to make sure that they were onboard because they had two Russian spies in their custody.

President Biden, Vice President Harris, and family members, they're going to head to Andrews to greet Evan Gershkovich, Paul Whelan, and Alsu Kurmasheva, three and their families will then board a flight to San Antonio, that for the Brooke Army Medical Center to undergo a standard medical evaluation, get whatever care they might need.

I think that initial period on the airplane with fellow Americans, with government officials on your way to freedom is really the first moment where you can let your shoulders loosen up a little bit and realize, okay, this part of my ordeal is finally over. And for the families I've been in touch with, a couple of them today, and throughout the last few years, in the case of Paul Whelan, this has to be a moment of immense joy and relief but also an understanding, there is a really long road ahead.",

Three of them are coming from the United States. There are then four more of what we call illegals. These are essentially spies living undercover. They were in Norway, Slovenia, and Poland.One of them was the couple in Slovenia and then you have these three in the United States for a variety of crimes, laundering, hacking, cybercrimes. I want to highlight one of those men, 40-year-old a Roman Seleznev, he is a convicted hacker and credit card fraudster. He was serving a 27-year sentence in the United States. The Russians had previously asked for Seleznev and the US had agreed to that, but the deal fell apart when the Germans declined to give up Krasikov. So, he was sentenced in November to 14 years in prison. He played a role a $50 million cyber-fraud ring. And then of course, Krasikov, the big name, we saw him getting hugged by Putin as he got off the plane. He was sentenced to life in prison in 2019 in Germany. He carried out what's being called an execution-style killing in a Berlin park. He killed a former Chechen fighter and it was such a galling crime that's really why there is so much resistance by the Germans to give him up.",

You might call it, brinksmanship; hostage diplomacy might be too generous in that they deliberately take Americans were trumped up or non-existent crimes to become trade capital, to get really bad guys out of detention abroad. The risk here, of course, and the criticism is when you do an exchange like this, are you laying the groundwork for the next hostage to be taken? EVELYN FARKAS, FORMER DEPARTMENT ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR RUSSIA/UKRAINE/EURASIA: I don't really think so, Jim. I mean, you never know for sure, but at the end of the day, you have to make a calculation. These 16 innocent lives were worth giving up these bloody, bloody murderers and spies, or bloody murderer and spies and hackers, real criminals, and of course, the optics are terrible. Morally, it does feel 'yucky' for lack of a better word. But at the end of the day, if you think about what you get in exchange, I think the president had no choice really, in a way, it was brilliant that they came up with this really big deal. I do remember when I was in Munich in February, there was talk about a big deal. Bill Browder, who is someone that I've worked with, my organization and the McCain Institute has worked with, to try to get Vladimir Kara-Murza freed because you may know he was pall bearer in Senator McCain's Funeral, and was someone that John McCain, a war hero himself called a hero. And so, we were listening closely to people like Roger Carstens, the ambassador who is in charge of these deals, these hostage deals. So, there was some talk about this. At the end of the day though, Vladimir Putin is not going to change who he is because there's a deal or there's not a deal. He still wants to put pressure on us. He still will take unwitting Americans who go to his country. So, I do agree with the administration people who are saying, don't go. The people who are still being held I think a masseuse or a hairdresser, a school teacher, who probably should have known better because you don't bring cannabis to Russia. But regular Americans need to know, for you journalists, I don't know what the calculation is because you do want to cover those countries.",

That hey, if you get caught when you're doing something that we send you to do, essentially to kill somebody overseas, if you caught, don't worry about it. We will eventually get you out. So in that sense, he got in that sense what he wanted but it's a difficult balancing act. I can tell you this though, I was asking myself, why now? And I think that Putin assessed that there was no way that he could do this if a Trump administration came in because there is no connection, like the Biden connection to the Germans and that I think came into play when he just made a decision this way.",

And just listening to his comments today, he said this would not have been possible without friendship and diplomacy, particularly Germany, as you've been reporting all day long, this simply would not have happened without that strong bond between he and the German chancellor. And what's so striking about this also, if you go back and look at his Oval Office address just one week ago, he said, we are working hard on freeing imprisoned Americans. At that point, he already knew that he had the final leader to leader phone call with the leader of Slovenia one hour before he decided not to run. So this was, of course, all in his mind.

Donald Trump, this could be a moment to rise above to say it's a good thing and he's going to bring other detained Americans home. He knows as well as anyone, this is incredibly hard. We worked to try to get Austin Tice out of Syria and did not prevail. Joe Biden still wants to do that. And by the way, we've got American hostages in Israel.
