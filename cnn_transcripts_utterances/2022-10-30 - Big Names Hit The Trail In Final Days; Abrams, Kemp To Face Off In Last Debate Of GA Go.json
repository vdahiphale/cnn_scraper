Just nine days to go until the midterm elections and the political heavyweights for both parties are hitting the trail, as the campaign hits the homestretch. President Joe Biden, former presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump all fanning out across the country. This weekend, Obama perhaps the Democrats' best messenger, rallied voters in key battleground states, trying to boost turnout. We have team coverage. CNN's Eva McKend is covering tonight's final Governor's debate in Georgia. Let's begin with Kevin Liptak who is traveling with the president in Delaware. So Kevin, what is Biden's primary message this week?",

He did join the 19 million Americans who have cast early ballots yesterday.And we will start to see him campaigning more next week when he travels to Florida on Tuesday. And this is a trip that the White House has tried to put on the schedule for a long time. They kept having to cancel it for various reasons, and the president is going down to try and boost the Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Charlie Crist. You know, this is an interesting stop, just because of the national dynamics of that race. You have the Republican Governor Ron DeSantis potentially eyeing a national office. That is also where President Trump lives now in Florida. So it will be interesting to see how President Biden uses that in his campaign speech. Later in the week, the president will go to New Mexico. He's expected back in Pennsylvania and then he will spend election night eve in Maryland. So not necessarily the most high profile races. Of course, President Biden has not necessarily been the most sought after surrogate in this campaign, but they will offer him an opportunity to get out his message as Democrats grow increasingly anxious about November. Listen to how President Biden described his message yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Things much different this time around with Abrams challenging an incumbent Republican governor.You know, tonight different than a few weeks ago. The libertarian candidate will not be on the stage. He was very disruptive the last time, so tonight we're truly getting a head-to-head match between Abrams and Kemp. I mean I'm curious to see if Abrams sharpens her attack against Kemp. She has been behind him in most of the polls that we have seen. Does she sharpen her argument on abortion? The abortion restrictions in the state unpopular with most Georgians. Take a listen to how both Abrams and Kemp have been making their closing arguments on the campaign trail.

The problem for Democrats is that before we got to the homestretch, a lot of their candidates have taken hits. Their races have tightened up. President Biden's approval ratings are underwater.

He wants to see how he plays in states that aren't traditional red states. That includes somewhere like New York. Governor Hochul has a pretty comfortable five, six, seven-point lead. I don't think she's too worried about Zeldin. On the other hand, the Zeldin campaign has not given up. They think they have a shot, and they want to bring in what they think is one of their big guns, which right now for Republicans is governor DeSantis, who has a huge lead in his Florida governor's race.",

And a couple of hours ago, we had a rare conversation with a first responder.Now, we had to talk to them by phone. We can't reveal anything about their identity because they're so afraid of being exposed here. But they described what it was like when they arrived at this -- you know, this is the alleyway just right next to the alley where the majority of the people died. And I'm just here to kind of show you how wide this space is. You would say maybe seven feet or so across. And so just imagine these first responders arriving. They say basically they were getting calls and I'll read you the quote in a minute. But people had fallen down and they fell forward. And as they fell forward, other people were falling on top of them. And you ended up in a situation where you had layers of people and basically what the first responder described being able to see is nothing but their faces. Ok. So just imagine kind of coming up to a narrow space like this and seeing row after row of human faces. Now let me read you this quote from this first responder, saying quote, \"At 10:23 p.m., we received more than five reports that people fell and they could either get hurt or die. When we arrived now on the site they were only able to see 7, 8, no 10 rows of faces. We couldn't even see their legs. We first pulled those at the bottom row out. We thought they were most urgent. When we were pulling them out, they were becoming delirious and when we laid them on the ground, most of them were unconscious.\" So can you imagine just for the first responders how traumatic it would be to see, you know, this essentially this pile of people, and as they're trying to rescue them, to help them, their condition is worsening. Many of people were laid down on the sidewalks back here. This is just beyond that tape there is where the majority of people were laid down, and basically, in long lines of bodies on the street, and they're just dying right and left as their friends, you know, and other, you know, onlookers were desperately trying to give them CPR. Paramedics were trying to give them CPR. But in the end, because their injuries were so severe in this crushing event, it was almost impossible to save them. And the death toll has continued to climb at almost every update. Now, at least 154 dead from so many different countries. You mentioned the Americans, Fred. We also have victims from France, from Australia, from China, from Iran, from Thailand, from Sri Lanka. The list just goes on -- Australia, Austria. It's really overwhelming the scale and scope of this, what truly is an international tragedy even though the majority of the victims from right here in South Korea.

They're among the group who brought these two cases against UNC Chapel Hill and Harvard.So, tomorrow morning, the Supreme Court will once again re-examine affirmative action here. You know, it's really quite likely that this solidly conservative court could end up banning the practice of colleges and universities considering race as a factor in admissions despite the fact that the Supreme Court first approved it back in 1978. You know, this is a case that has been going through the courts for almost a decade now. Asian American students in particular sued Harvard saying they were being disadvantaged in favor of Blacks and minorities. These groups have actually lost at the lower courts. The lower courts saying that affirmative action is okay because the Supreme Court said it was okay. But it is quite possible that the Supreme Court could once again overturn precedent and come this spring or summer, the Supreme Court could in fact ban affirmative action. That's what this case will be about when they hear arguments tomorrow morning. What's interesting is that in the past several years, nine states in this country have banned affirmative action at public universities. And, you know, a \"Washington Post\" poll, a recent \"Washington Post\" poll, actually found that 63 percent of Americans who were surveyed did support banning affirmative action. So, this is a high-interest case. We're already seeing people outside the Supreme Court rallying about this. Students who say they were disadvantaged because of affirmative action, they're rallying right now to get rid of it. So, the arguments will be heard tomorrow morning, Fred. And then at some point in the spring or summer, we will likely know what the Supreme Court decides here. It is quite possible that this conservative court could upend about 45 years of precedent here if they do ultimately ban affirmative action. But we'll see how the arguments play out tomorrow morning when it's all heard here at the Supreme Court -- Fred.",

Fox will be trying to get behind whoever the likely nominee is and whoever the nominee is, assuming that's where the kind of Republican base is, because that's the business model here, Fox plays to the Republican base. And you know, its programming reflects that. So -- so that's certainly, you know, on the horizon in 2024. But, of course, the other thing to always keep in mind is Rupert Murdoch is not a young man, and at some point, he is going to die.

So we'll see his journey how he's been in this impossible position. You might say, well, why is Prince Harry in difficult position? Why is he suffering? He's so wealthy. But royalty is a gilded cage and it's a gilded cage which he's suffocating and he's a gilded cage where there is no privacy, and it's a gilded cage in which clearly I think that Harry is making an important points here about the role of the second in line, the idea that they're always supposed to be in line to assist the monarch, to assist their sibling.
