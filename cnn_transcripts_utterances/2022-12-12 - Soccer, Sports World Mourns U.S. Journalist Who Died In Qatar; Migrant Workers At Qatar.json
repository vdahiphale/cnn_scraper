And ever since news of his death broke everyone has been talking about the impact he had. What kind of reporter he was. Everyone remembers the LeBron James story that he had. But what I was struck by that you wrote was less about how he was as a reporter and more how he was as a colleague. You said, \"From the late spring day in 1996 that he walked into the Sports Illustrated headquarters, he relentlessly championed inclusion in his colleagues, especially younger ones and those further removed from the levers of corporate governance.\" CHRIS STONE, DEPUTY MANAGING EDITOR AND VICE PRESIDENT, L.A. TIMES STUDIOS, FORMER EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, SPORTS ILLUSTRATED (via Webex by Cisco):  Yes. I mean, Grant and his wife, Dr. Celine Gounder, used to throw these dinner parties for Sports Illustrated once a month. And the idea behind these dinners was to bring people together who normally wouldn't come together and probably didn't know each other, even as much time as they might have spent in the workplace. And he was really all about connection and I think that's how he viewed soccer in a big way. People have used the word he lifted soccer, he popularized it, he pioneered its coverage. But I think above everything, what Grant did both in his coverage of soccer and in the way he related to colleagues is he believed in sharing. He shared soccer much in the same way that Anthony Bourdain shared food and used it as a vehicle to bring people together. That's what Grant saw, among other things, as being the purpose of soccer.",

So, Title 42 is a Trump-era policy, which was enacted early on in the pandemic to send migrants crossing the southern border back either to Mexico or to their home countries without allowing them to apply for asylum as our laws indicate.And part of the reasoning behind that, the Trump administration said, was to stop the spread of COVID-19 in the detention centers -- in immigration detention centers, even though the CDC had said at the time that migrants weren't a huge cause of spread of COVID-19. So it was seen as a political move by critics just to use immigration again as this divisive issue and expeditiously expel immigrants from the country. Now, when Biden came in, he said that he was going to end the policy right away. And what we have seen is that the Biden administration has sent mixed messages about it. They have come to rely on it more and more, especially as we got closer to the midterm elections when immigration became, again a very polarizing hot topic and they wanted to change the conversation. Because what DHS officials are projecting is that once Title 42 is lifted, anywhere between 9,000 and 14,000 migrants would try to cross the border, with a worst-case scenario of about 18,000 a day.
