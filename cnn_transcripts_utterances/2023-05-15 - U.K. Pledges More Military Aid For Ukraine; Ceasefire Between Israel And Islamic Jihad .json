Tonight, Turkey's president will go head-to-headwith his opposition rival, as the presidential elections go to a runoff vote. We'll have the latest from Istanbul. Then, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy meets British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak as the U.K. pledges more military aid for Ukraine. Plus, CNN is in Gaza city just days after a ceasefire between Israel and Palestinian militants. We'll look at the damage left behind after five days of fighting. But first tonight, we start in Turkey this hour where voters will have to wait almost two more weeks to choose their next leader. Officials have set a presidential runoff for May 28th, saying no candidates crossed the 50 percent threshold needed to win Sunday's vote. The two candidates headed to the final round are incumbent Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Kemal Kilicdaroglu. Mr. Erdogan's chief rival is an economist backed by an alliance of several opposition parties. He is among those who said the president is responsible for struggling economy. Mr. Erdogan's critics also blame them for lackluster earthquake response that cost lives. But he did better in the polls than many expected, and his party is set to remain the largest in parliament ahead of final results. Let's get more on all of this, CNN's Jomana Karadsheh joins me now live from Istanbul. And Jomana, it's not a win yet for Erdogan, anything of course is possible mathematically. But he's in a strong position ahead of this runoff. So what is your sense on the ground, is he likely to hold on -- to cling on to power here?",

      "sentences": "Well, I mean, you know, Isa, you have to look at the numbers. Yes, President Erdogan did not getthat 50-plus 1 percent that was needed to get the presidency, but he did do better than was expected in all the polling that was taking place before these elections. They did have Kemal Kilicdaroglu; the leader of the opposition in the lead, and now you see that President Erdogan has pretty much come out with that slight lead with more than 49 percent of the vote. And you've got both sides sounding very confident going into this second round, but a lot of the supporters of the opposition are very concerned that the opposition might not have that same determination amongst its electorate. That same kind of enthusiasm they went into that first round, believing that, that win from the first round was possible. Now, you also have that third candidate who was running an ultra nationalist Sinan Ogan. And he could potentially emerge from this as a tie-breaker, with those 5 percent votes. Of course, he's been eliminated because only the top two will be headed towards that runoff. And that 5 percent vote that he managed to garner in this election, what happens to that? It is a combination of disenchanted nationalists who couldn't vote for President Erdogan's alliance. And then you've also got the protest voters who did not agree with the opposition's choice of Kemal Kilicdaroglu to lead the opposition into these elections. What happens to that? He spoke earlier to our colleague, Becky Anderson, take a listen to what Sinan Ogan told her. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SINAN OGAN, TURKISH ATA ALLIANCE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE (through translator): What we're thinking is all the political parties should exclude terror organizations. We don't have to give our support to either of the parties. There's no such rule. When we first started this race, we thought we need to either win the government or we are going to be the kingmaker, and we are at that status. Political parties like HDP(ph) or HUDA(ph), we want those candidates not to rely on parties that have no distance between terrorist groups, and we succeeded in that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "That is going to be the question. That's going to be the big challenge because there was real disappointment amongst the voters for theopposition, amongst those supporters. They really were expecting something very different. They believe that Kemal Kilicdaroglu and his alliance has underperformed. People really had their hope in this united front, this opposition coming together in a way they have never done before. You had the six diverse parties backed by the Kurds as well, all coming together as this one coalition. They were hoping to unseat President Erdogan, their promise was really speaking to the disgruntlement of much of the population here, promising them change, promising that real democracy under a parliamentary system will come back again under this opposition, if they do win. And there was this feeling that they could achieve this. They were promising that they could potentially do this from the first round. Then, you had the polls that were coming out and putting Kemal Kilicdaroglu in the lead. So right now, you have the serious disappointment, but you're also hearing from the opposition saying that they are ready for the second round. Kemal Kilicdaroglu saying today, he's not going anywhere. He is here and here to stay, and he will fight until the last moment. But we will have to see because I mean, Isa, yesterday, we saw these incredible scenes where you had so many people turning out. Turkey does have a history of high turnout at elections. Yesterday was a record turnout, nearly 90 percent of eligible voters were out voting. We saw the elderly being brought into these polling centers on stretchers and in wheelchairs. We spoke to first-time voters who were saying that this was the most decisive election in the history of their country. And they felt that they had an obligation to take part in it. And a lot of people that we spoke to were saying that they wanted change. But clearly, if you look at the results, you see a very divided Turkey. It is really a reflection of the state of polarization in this country, two very different men, two very different visions for the future of the country. And Turks are very much divided on what Turkey they want to emerge out of this election, Isa.",

But it wouldn't surprise anybody, really, possibly not even the Russians. That this leader of a mercenary organization would offer in return for -- in return for a softer life for his employees, his Wagner right mercenaries on the frontline in places like Bakhmut, that he would give away Russian positions, Russian locations. Now, of course, that is high treason of the most egregious kind. It was been dismissed immediately by Russia. I think that this is really -- should be seen in the context of the sort of maelstrom of misinformation that often surrounds Prigozhin and the Wagner Group. It is tactically important, it has been in the fight over Bakhmut, where they've lost really large numbers of people, absorbed a lot of Ukrainian energy. But this is not an organization that is in any way replacing the Russian Armed Forces. It's going to be interesting to see how this latest iteration of a sort of bloody soap opera plays out. And I think really, that is the way it's being seen here in Ukraine. That said of course, the Ukrainians would love to be able to turn somebody of the prominence of Prigozhin or indeed any other leading Russian military official or officer, to their side, albeit, even if it's for a backhander or a bit of a light touch on the frontline.",

So, it's not like, you know, Ukraine thinking and coming up with more and more ideas, it's the -- the question is that when we can form the capability, which would be able to successfully resist Russian offensive.

They've never really completely blocked off this area, but that gives you a sense of the potential capacity for this surge. What you see behind me is the bus station. This is normally where migrants would catch a bus to continue on their journey in the United States. And this is the entrance of that bus station. Now, here is what we're hearing from nonprofits on the ground. There are two prominent nonprofits in this area of south Texas, and they both say that they've seen a significant drop, a 50 percent or more. That reflects exactly what the federal government is saying. That they're seeing on their end as well. And the big question is why? I've been in contact with community leaders and officials on the Mexican side of the border, who have contact with the migrants who could seemingly be the ones crossing over into the United States. And what they tell me is that, the tough talk by the Biden administration, the images of migrants being shackled and deported back to their home countries is resonating. It is sending the message to a lot of the migrants on the northern side of Mexico, that if they cross illegally into the United States, that there will be legal consequences, including a five-year bar of re-entry into the country. And so a lot of these migrants are deciding on their own not to cross the border illegally. On top of all of that, there is an official in Tijuana, Mexico, across the border from San Diego, California, who says that on Wednesday, the Mexican National Guard also made presence along the border wall, and that has also diminished the number of smuggling groups that are working in that area. That is also dropping the number of migrants who are crossing into the United States. And Isa, with all of that said, I've got to say that nonprofits here, the individuals that work with this migrant group, are still preparing for the worst. Again, because the Biden administration is still saying that the situation is fluid. They're not sure if there will be an uptick later on or not, and so nonprofits are getting ready just in case.

He used all the powers of an incumbent mobilize state resources, and despite that 51 percent of the country did not vote for him. And despite the devastating earthquake, which hit the country recently, and the faltering economy, double digit inflation, he still managed to use the identity card.

Palestinian Islamic Jihad began its own rocket launches the next day. Over those five days, 33 Palestinians were killed in Gaza and two people were killed in Israel.

But nobody here is laboring under the illusion that this calm is going to last for very long. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WEDEMAN (voice-over): Broken cinder blocks and twisted metal, all that's left of an apartment building once home to more than 40 people. Saturday afternoon, a call came from someone identifying himself as Rami from the Israeli military, \"Leave the building now. We're going to bomb it,\" he told Hassan Nebhan. \"Don't bomb the whole building,\" Hassan pleaded, \"Just hit the apartment of the guilty person. There are disabled people here.\" Once the building was empty, it was bombed. No one was killed or injured. \"Between you and me, I think I was joking,\" Hassan told me. \"I didn't expect the house with disabled people would be destroyed. Impossible.\" Reached for comment, the Israeli military didn't go into specifics, merely claiming they struck command and control centers used by Islamic Jihad for the planning of terrorist activities against Israel. Building residents insisted they didn't know who the target was. Whoever it might have been, this is the result. Dozens of people left without a roof over their heads. \"We need a home,\" says Felistine. \"The rest we can get, but 45 people now need a home.\" Her neighbor, Belel Napan, is in shock. \"We don't have a bed to sleep on. We don't have clothing to wear,\" he says. \"We've lost everything.\" With only scattered ceasefire violations, calm has returned for now. Gaza's markets are open again. For the more than two million residents cooped up in this narrow strip of land, there is no expectation of lasting peace. 56-year-old Musela Mabutcher has lived through all Gaza's woes. The conflict, he says, will continue until Judgment Day. Armed struggle isn't the priority for most here. They're weary of it all. \"Look, not just me, all Palestinians are tired,\" says Sayed, the government worker. \"Me, you, all of us. People worry about their children, about their homes.\" Faded as they are trying to find their way through this never-ending vortex of sporadic violence. (END VIDEOTAPE) WEDEMAN (on camera): This was the third major outbreak of hostilities between Israel and Islamic militants in Gaza in the last three years. In fact, since Israel pulled out of Gaza in 2005, it's the 50th official Israeli operation in Gaza and the feeling is the 16th isn't long away. Isa.",
