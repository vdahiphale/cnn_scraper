Now, we spoke to the mayor of that town, who told us that he lives about two, two and a half kilometers away, and he thought the blast happened right next door. He said that this building was home to people who had been displaced from other parts of Lebanon families basically, including women and children. He said he had no knowledge of any fighters being in the building or any weapons being stored now. Now, it's the Lebanese Red Cross Society that is saying that the death toll is at least 19, nine injured, but they continue to dig in the rubble because it's believed there's still people alive, perhaps, underneath. Now, it's significant because this is a village that's about 100 kilometers north of Beirut in an area that normally wouldn't be targeted by the Israelis. It's not clear at this point what the potential target was, but it certainly represents a change and it certainly underscores that Israel will hit anywhere in the country. They have hit further north in Lebanon, but a majority Christian area, this is absolutely the first time this has happened. At the same time, the Israelis are issuing more evacuation orders this morning for more than 20 villages in the south. And among the list of so-called villages is the city of Nabatieh, which has a population in normal times of more than 100,000. At this point, about a quarter of Lebanon is under these Israeli evacuation orders, which come out new ones every single day.

Let's bring in CNN military analyst and retired U.S. Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton, joining us live now from Washington, D.C.Cedric, I just want to start by talking about this Hezbollah drone attack that managed to get to an army base in Israel, killing a handful of Israelis. I mean, just the fact that it wasn't intercepted, it wasn't detected, it caught the Israel completely off guard. There were no air raid sirens that went off. What did the Israelis learn from this? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: I think they'll be learning several different things here. First of all, they're going to want to know exactly how that drone penetrated those Israeli air defenses. And one of the things that they will be looking at, I think is, what was the actual flight path of the drone? And one possibility is that that drone actually was at a very low altitude. And because of being at a low altitude, it could conceivably evade radar detection. That is one of the techniques that is used by fighter pilots when they get into an area that has a lot of air defenses that they need to attack. They will go very low before they attack those air defenses and it could very well be a similar flight profile that Hezbollah used for this drone. They'll also take a look at where it launched from. They'll take a look at exactly who was operating it, if they can find that out. And it's going to be one of those areas, saying, where there are going to sometimes be more questions than there are answers, or the answers will get new questions. So it's going to be, I think, a dynamic effort on the part of the Israelis to actually find out what happened here.",

And so if this is the start of a new strategy by Hezbollahor even Iran, this is something that Israel really has to concentrate on at this moment. But we know, Cedric, that's not why the THAAD batteries are being sent over. The THAAD batteries are being sent over to intercept ballistic missiles, larger-scale missiles. I'm wondering your reaction to the news of these THAAD batteries being moved to Israel, obviously sending a deterrent message to Iran. But what does that tell you, perhaps, about what Israel may do in its strike that we're expecting against Iran?",

I think one of the things that we can see is that, you know, as you mentioned, the deployment of theTHAAD is very much a signal of support for the U.S. And what you can probably expect from this is, number one, that the Israelis will strike something in Iran. What that is will depend on, not only what is operationally possible for the Israelis, but also what kind of a message they want to send and how far they want to get up that ladder of escalation that we've talked about before. If they want to send a message and then be done with it, that may result in one type of movement. If they do something else, that could result in a much more expanded conflict in the Middle East. And it's definitely in the U.S.'s interest not to expand the conflict. The Iranians, of course, are looking at this and they're saying, this may potentially limit our ability respond to any Israeli attack, and they will then calibrate what they do based on the deployment of the THAAD and see what missiles they can potentially lob against Israel that might get through those air defenses, but it's going to be far less likely for them to do so, given the fact that the THAAD will soon be in Israel and be deployed there.",

That leads to the question I was going to ask you about, just how coordinated the two sides are at this point in terms of what thatresponse would look like from Israel, given that the THAAD defense system has now been or is in the process of being deployed to Israel. There had been some reporting that Israel was not communicating as openly with the White House as the U.S. administration had wanted. And there had been a canceled visit at the last moment by the Defense Minister Gallant. It wasn't his decision. It was Prime Minister Netanyahu's. But the two have since spoken. I mean, are you now more open to the possibility that these two sides are on the same page, or the U.S. is more aware of what Israel may be planning to do?",

And, Bianna, we can't forget that General Kurilla, the commander of Central Command, U.S. CentralCommand, was in Israel recently, obviously discussing what the possible Israeli response options might be. And that then tells me that at least at the tactical and what we call the operational level, the two sides are definitely talking military to military. When it comes to the more strategic level, I think it's also become pretty clear that both sides see that there's a certain congruence of interests between the United States and Israel, and that congruence of interests means that they are willing to work with each other in spite of political differences or personality issues. And that very fact means that there is going to be some degree of coordination between the two nations. And how that plays out, of course, remains to be seen. There's always a chance that the coordination may fall apart at the last second. But in this particular case, they're at least working in, I would say, a synchronized fashion at this particular moment in time.",

These kinds of attacks are not designed to win any friends outside of the Middle East for Israel. In fact, they do the exact opposite. The other thing that, of course, this could do is this could implicate Israel in the political situation within Lebanon, which is an incredibly complex situation, with or without Hezbollah. And it seems that whether or not this was deliberate, they're sending -- the Israelis are sending a message to the Christian elements in the Lebanese population that they want things to be done in a certain way. What that way is, I'm not sure. But the key thing here is that everyone in Lebanon seems to be at risk. And that, I think, is a very dangerous game for Israel to be playing right now, because it would really be in their interest for them to, at the very least, keep the Lebanese population neutral in what's going on right now.

A new \"New York Times\" poll over the weekend compared 2016 results where Latino voters supported at 68 percent to what the estimates are right now in the most recent October poll, and that is 56 percent support among Latinos. And one of the questions asked of voters this weekend is that the escalating attacks on immigrants has not driven away Latino voters from Trump to Harris.

She has also really closed the gap and is almost even on issues like the economy and immigration.

What is he afraid of?

This area does receive a couple of inches of rain annually, but in a couple of days' time, during the month of September of this year actually received about a year's worth of rain in that short period of time. So much so that satellites high above us in space actually captured the lakes that formed as a result of this heavy rainfall. So going back to August 14th of 2024, you can see no lake. Let's go forward by roughly a month, and after that rainy spell, and you can see this turquoise coloring of blue, that's actually the lakes forming and ponding within the dry or typically and arid Saharan desert. This, by the way, is the largest non-polar desert in the world. So it's amazing to see that contrast from the before and after satellite images. Here's another aerial photograph of the water piling up within the valleys of the Saharan desert. This is again over southeastern Morocco. And if we take a closer look at the rainfall totals here during the month of September, that shade of blue and the white gray there, that is actually areas that received 100 to 200 millimeters of rain. Roughly in some locations, about a years' worth of train just in the short period of time. And what made this particularly unique, is that it wasn't part of the seasonal shift known as the intertropical convergence zone. This was actually formed because of an extra tropical cyclone. So it brought rainfall, an extreme amount of rainfall in terms of what they are used to, to an area of northwestern Africa that doesn't normally experience these types of events. One thing's for sure, going forward in time, there are some light showers in this forecast, but that's not an extratropical cyclone, that's just precipitation moving from the Atlantic inland and that could impact some of those areas that saw the ponding within the dry desert regions of southeastern Morocco, but this has just created some incredible photography coming out of the area.
