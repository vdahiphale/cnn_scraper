If you said the sun, put your hands up. Aurora Borealis is an atmospheric phenomenon caused by particles emitted in solar storms creating enchanting waves of colored light. All right, we want you to take a look at something that looks a lot like the Northern Lights, but it`s actually something unique. Meet Steve, a rare spectacle that hovers over the horizon in the Northern hemisphere. It`s a bit different from the more famous auroras we`re familiar with, those shine, blue, green, and red when charged particles from the sun interact with our atmosphere. But all Steve is caused by an atmospheric river of particles heating up and it shows up at lower latitudes as streaks of purple with distinct green bands. All right. So why do they call it Steve? Well, members of the Alberta, Aurora chasers in Canada borrowed the name from DreamWorks 2006 animated movie \"Over the Hedge\" when the characters encountered a surprise, they named it Steve to make the discovery less scary. All right, we often talk about on this show. How, if you want to make something happen in this world, you have to see it up here in your mind`s eye before you can see it out there in the world. Well, today`s story getting a 10 out of 10 is about a woman named Brooke Hart Jones, who took a dream and made it a reality. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
