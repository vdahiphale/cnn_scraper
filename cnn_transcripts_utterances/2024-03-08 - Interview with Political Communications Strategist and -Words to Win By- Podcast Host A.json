I'm Bianna Golodryga in London sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Well, the stakes were high for President Biden as he stepped up to the podium for this year's State of the Union. After a week in which the election race was all but confirmed as a Biden-Trump rematch, pundits and likely many voters were listening and watching closely. They were met with a fiery address, as Biden weaved between issues including the economy, the border, the Middle East, and even his own age. He challenged Former President Trump without ever mentioning his name directly. But he started with something which usually takes a backseat at these speeches, foreign policy, making the case that democracy is once again on the ballot. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Anat Shenker-Osorio is apolitical communication strategist who joins me now from California. And I thank you so much for joining us. So, let's start there. It's a bit unusual for the president to start a State of the Union address focusing on foreign policy. Yet, that is exactly what President Biden did, obviously, a lot of frustration among his administration and among the Democratic Party. And let's be honest, even among the majority of Republicans that do want to see that extra supplemental of foreign aid funding pass, of some $60 billion waiting to be sent to Ukraine, which needs that funding yesterday, desperately going through ammunition and needing additional resources and weapons. What did you make of the president starting there? And do you think it was an effective decision? ANAT SHENKER-OSORIO, POLITICAL COMMUNICATIONS STRATEGIST: Yes. I mean, absolutely extraordinary Biden in fighting for him and weaving together what I would note really well at the top of the speech that foreign policy (INAUDIBLE) with the very real truth that he was giving that speech in the very face of an at-home, home-baked authoritarian faction that is hellbent on taking our freedoms and has questioned the very basis of Democratic governance in that very chamber by helping plan, pay for, and wanting to pardon the deadly January 6th attack. So, those two threads together. Essentially, the same thread, authoritarianism, a faction of people who are going to rule for the wealthiest few, both abroad and at home. And he made that point clearly. He made that point well, and he made that point forcefully as he had to do.",

This is tough legislation. It's something that he'd really fought for, and yet, it is nowhere near passing as well because it is being held up by the speaker of the house. You poll a lot of people on this issue, and immigration has taken a real leap forward in terms of a concern for not only Republicans, which it traditionally has, but Democrats as well. Do you think that President Biden put himself well-positioned, at least enough, in terms of saying the ball is in the Republicans' court, not mine right now? SHENKER-OSORIO: I think the part of the speech where he came to immigration, and I thing by any objective view, he kind of began to get a little bit more convoluted and come out more -- less clearly, less strong than he did at the outset and at end. I think that really shows what an Achilles heel that is. And, unfortunately, if your electoral prospects, and I would argue more importantly, if the prospects of the continuation of experimental -- experiment with self-governance, with having representatives who actually act in our interests honor our freedom to vote, honor freedom to decide for ourselves, basic things like weather and when we have kids. If the future prospects of this country hinge upon the American people, understand that this election is a confrontation between two different futures, one in which we will continue to be able to elect our leaders, cast our votes, have them counted, and then another in, which this authoritarian faction will keep chipping away at every one of our freedoms. If you need people to understand that, you cannot say on one day, hey, these folks in Biden's parlance are semi-fascist, and I promise to work with these semi-fascists. That is an electoral story that doesn't make sense. When you try this gambit of exposing them for their hypocrisy by unwittingly crediting them as good policymakers, you're undermining your overarching story, which I would argue is accurate, that these are deadly, dangerous people who do not have Americans' best interests at heart. There is a way to seize the upper hand on the immigration debate, and it comes from leading with our own values. And, yes, calling out Republicans, but not by crediting their policy ideas, but rather by exposing how they are employing the oldest trick in the authoritarian book, which is to shame and blame a scapegoat, to tell people, look over there, your problems, it's because of those people, however that group is named and shamed. And they are doing that in order to get you to look the other way while they take away everything, Social Security, health care, living wages, the right to join together in union. That's the way to call out Republicans. It's not by crediting them as genius lawmakers by saying, hey, I'm going to make this bill happen because they wrote it.",

I mean, wasn't he doing effectively that, calling out those Republicans who winpresented with sensible, some of the toughest legislation that's getting support from both sides of the aisle still can't be passed? Isn't calling him out by saying you're more focused on getting one man back into office or playing politics as opposed to focusing specifically on what would benefit the American public? SHENKER-OSORIO: He was doing a permutation of it. The essential difference -- and I'm arguing not just on the basis of my own logic, but rather on actual testing. And when we look through randomized control trials at what moved voters and what doesn't move voters, he was doing that by first crediting Republicans with having a good idea here, because what else does it mean to say, I'm going to pass this bipartisan piece of legislation that Republicans hammered out? This is the toughest border bill ever. He's echoing their language. And, unfortunately, in echoing their languages, as you probably noted, he even went so far as to use the word illegal as a noun, thereby giving credence to their broader story line, which is of course, is one of fear- mongering, race-baiting, as they've done all along. And so, yes, there is a way of calling their bluff, but the way of doing it is not saying, hey, here's their piece of legislation and I'm ready to pass it. Because what that does is it reaffirms his predecessors, to use his language, storyline that he's the strong man and he is the one that's going to come fix the border and is he the that needs to be bowed down to. When Biden says, you know, I'll do it with you. I will come to you or you come to me, and we will do together, how does a voter both understand these people are hellbent on taking your freedoms and, hey, I promise to work with these on this policy issue?

I don't think he ever named Donald Trump, but he referenced him a number of times, over a dozen, and talked about their differences, but also their similarities. Interestingly enough, both addressing that both of them are older men -- are old men, but said their views on the future of the country, their views on the future of the global order are vastly different. Do you think he was effective in speaking out and calling out the elephant in the room, that's his age, but also saying, you know, my predecessor also isn't a spring chicken? SHENKER-OSORIO: Yes. I think that his line, which is he's used a couple of times now around it's not about how old you are, it's about how old your ideas are is spot on. Everything that we're seeing in testing is that casting the election more broadly, not as a contest between these two individuals, which let's face it, people aren't that hooked into, we've had this exact same matchup before, voters are bored of it, just to speak in the most prosaic terms. So, rather than making it a contest between two individuals, making it a contest between two potential futures. And as Biden rightly said, between an America that moves forward together, intent on the full freedoms, the promise of liberty, opportunity, equality for all, and a MAGA Republican desire to drag us into, I would argue, the Mesozoic era, where a handful of wealthy white men alone decide who gets to do what and how. And when that contrast is presented. When we see voters flip from thinking about this as a contest between two rival teams, and they're not really into either team, let's just be honest, so I'd rather just turn off the game, to a contest between what will my future be, where will my children live, what will be their surroundings, and how will they experience life in America, that is when the switch really flips, and I think Biden did that really well at the end there.",

And he came into the picture because we've had the British secretary of state for the colonies, Joseph Chamberlain, offering as the push from Herzl for return to Palestine was on the table. Instead, he said, for now, let's at least offer parts of East Africa, known as the Uganda Scheme, it was actually Kenya. Is this -- was a sort of a temporary solution as a homeland in place of Palestine.

He was probably the most famous Jewish figure in the English-speaking world at thebeginning of the 20th century and would be horrified at how completely he's been forgotten in 2024. His legacy really is the phrase melting pot. You know, we hear of America being spoken as the melting pot, and same with England, or maybe New York specifically. And my book is called \"Melting Point,\" and people often, as soon as I tell them the title, about four seconds later, they say, oh, your book, \"The Melting Pot.\" So, it's this phrase that's really ingrained in our vocabulary, but it was made famous by Zangwill in a play written in 1908 called \"The Melting Pot,\" premiered in Washington. Theodore Roosevelt, who was president at the time, led the standing ovation. And it sort of triggered this national discourse about America as the great melting pot, and is it a good thing or a bad thing that immigrants come from Europe and from Russia and from elsewhere, and they arrive in America and they amalgamate, whether it happens in their generation or the next generation or the generation after. So, Zangwill saw America as the melting pot, and he actually felt ambivalent about this. He didn't know whether it was a good thing or a bad thing. At one point he said, America is the euthanasia of the Jews, which is obviously strong language, but he also led -- you know, he was the leader of the movement to send the Jews to Texas. I mean, really, they were being saved from Russia. So, it's both. Is it a good thing? Is it a bad thing? I think my whole book is sort of about things being, you know, two things at once.",

And in fact, I want to read a quote in your book from Zangwill, where he wrote, the only solution of the Jewish question is to take the Jews out of Russia, and plant them in a soil of their own.

New York was the greatest Jewish centerthe world had ever known at that time, probably at 1900, 1905, specifically the Lower East Side of New York. If you walk through the Lower East Side of New York in 1905, it would be like walking through a little piece of Russia, a Jewish ghetto, as the newspapers called it at the time. Though you wouldn't really hear much English being spoken. It would be Yiddish and Russian. There would be signs in strange languages and, you know, strange foods being cooked.

My parents didn't want to go where all of the other Russians were going, and that was New York at the time. But take us back -- that's our first picture in America. That is Galveston as well. So, I just thought that was an interesting story, that parents had never heard of Galveston. How did we end up in Galveston?

My grandmother, you know, everything that she grew up with, all the Russian, all the, perhaps Yiddish as well, I'm not sure, but all -- you know, all the stories and poems and she celebrated Passover. I have none of that. None of that got passed down to me. Slowly, through the generations, it went.

I think that President Obama was wonderful at setting this tone in which racism did not disappear, but it wasn't overt. I think what's happened with this administration is that they've set a tone in which casual racism has become OK in a way. And because you have the leader of a country who himself sort of engages in casual racism, I think that's the same for Mr. Jimmy (ph) as well. And so, the political leadership can set the tone.

So, we and others have found that when people watch a movie, say, or they listen to astory, we can see the same circuitry that's involved in memory that is currently being involved in just understanding what people are saying in the moment. And the reason is that even to understand what's happening in your news show, which is exceptionally clear, people are going back and engaging in this kind of memory retrieval in the moment just to follow what's going on. And the reason they're doing that is because they really want to know not where you are now, but where you're going. And so, that's just a very mundane example of the kinds of functions that memory has in everyday life. But, you know, think about you wake up in a hotel room, for instance. Your first question is, where am I? Without memory, you have no idea. You're floating in time and space, right? And as much as this is something that just kind of comes automatically to us, if you have a memory disorder, that's it. You are just there, right?

My brain is now shifting my mental context, and so I've created a little event boundary that's a moment that says, OK, brain, let's just pack this event into memory. But I'm packaging these little impoverished events. And every time I switch over, my brain takes a little bit of time in using some of my medical resources just to get caught up again. So, now, imagine what's happening is you're getting a fragment of information in memory every time a switch. And those fragments are never really there in the first place because I just getting caught up. And so, it's no surprise that afterwards you have almost this sense of amnesia, like what happened.

Let's see what happened. And so, I went into the report and the cases that I found and the things that were being discussed in the media were not the kinds of things that would concern me because I think when people say elderly man, poor memory, it's buttons on stereotypes that we have, especially in the U.S. about older adults. And I think the first thing that comes to mind for many people is Alzheimer's disease. And what I wanted to make clear in this editorial is, number one, there's a lot of variability in aging. If you follow up people who are older adults, what you find is some people, their memory drops up precipitously, but other people, it goes pretty well and they preserve a lot of those abilities. Now, the second thing is that often as we get older, there are these retrieval failures that we just talked about where the memory is there, but we just can't get details or we're struggling to pull up information or sometimes we make a mistake and it takes us a while to correct it. And the examples that I saw in the special counsel's report were all of these kinds of phenomena where it's not that Biden didn't remember his last year of the presidency or he had no memories of his son's death, but it was that he couldn't pull out the year that these things happened when we needed it. And I would be hard pressed to find somebody at his age who doesn't have that problem from time to time. So, I looked at this and I said, well, when other people are looking at Biden, what are they seeing? And it's like they see somebody maybe with gray hair, maybe they're judging him on his appearance or Trump too. I want to be clear that this is not something that's a partisan issue. I mean, one in six Americans are over the age of 65. And I think when people look at someone who's older, especially in this country, and they see someone who maybe is not moving as well as a young adult, they're not speaking as remotely as a young adult, they make assumptions about memory that are just untrue.",

You have to use these resources that you use to keep your memory accurate, these mental resources. And yes, it does get worse when you're under stress. It gets worse when you're not sleeping well. It gets worse when you get older. And these are all features of modern life. So, what I would say is that there is research out there to mitigate the effects of misinformation. And definitely the media, especially social media companies, I think have a responsibility to -- and I hope the Supreme Court keeps this in mind, that we really have a responsibility to label things that are obvious misinformation.

So, even if you watch true news, you'll see two people watch a debate and they'll walk away with different memories of how that debate went based on their beliefs, the partisan beliefs they had to begin with.

So, what that suggests is that somehow there's some process by which you and I talk about it and there's some pruning of the memories. And so, Suparna Rajaram at SUNY Stony Brook has studied this, for instance. And one of the things that people have found is that people who are the dominant narrators, meaning people who tend to be more powerful, tend to be more loud and obnoxious can take up a lot of the discussion. And so, what people remember that would normally be idiosyncratic, like I talked about before, tends to kind of hone in on the shared amount of information that overlaps with this dominant speaker. And so, the only way around this is to listen to the people who might otherwise be ignored. And this often happens to be people who are older or elderly or people who are children or from marginalized groups. And that's actually key to how collective memory can be improved.
