Just to underscore those words, Wolf, some of them directed to you personally, it suggests that this evidence may very well show that Trump had first-hand knowledge that you just do not declassify material with a wave of a hand, that there is a very rigorous process.",

Agencies have to be notified. There's is not just some waving the wand, a thought in your head. So, these records, I'm told, will give evidence that he knew the right way to do it.

If this is true, he had absolute notice that what he was doing would have maybe been violative of the Presidential Records Act. And, again, assuming he did not realize it then, he certainly knows it now. And the idea that there's been an overarching fight to try to retain that which belongs to the government under that very act is really ludicrous to me and quite absurd. But the notion here, of course, of why this is so important, think about why we need to have a process to declassify documents. If the waving of the hand was sufficient, that would not alert anyone on the chain of command, anyone who had access to material, anyone who could be compromised by its dissemination that in fact was not declassified or that the underlying substance of the information was no longer of a sensitive nature. The waving of the wand, the snapping of the finger is not enough. But in a legal sense, if you have notice of what you are doing and you cannot feign ignorance, you cannot demonstrate there was an absence of intent, which really is the key to any legal proceeding.",

And so if they can show that these records were never properly declassified, then all of those statutes are in play.And second of all, it goes squarely to the issue of intent. It appears that these documents where Archives telling Donald Trump, if you want to declassify, here's how you have to do it.

Clearly, they are committed to their jobs here, preserving presidential records.As for spinning this politically, I think you saw it in the town hall last week and we see it on his social media all the time, he leans into anything surrounding this classified documents investigation. He leans into his home being rated, as he calls it, by the FBI and that, as we saw last August, after the seizure took place all the way through now, is an attempt to fortify his base around him and we have seen it work.

In the latest court records, we have a look at some Air Force records from his unit where he was reprimanded. And this is stunning because his access to this information was not curtailed here, and at least according to prosecutors, he kept accessing that information and disseminating it.So, let me walk you through this. This first one is from late last year, 15th September of last year, where his superiors say he was taking notes on classified intelligence information and was seen putting those notes into his pocket. Just one month later, October 25th of last year, following a cease-and-desist order from the previous month, he was seen doing a deep dive on intelligence information. In fact, at this point, he was then offered other jobs to see if you wanted to cross train into a different Air Force position, which still would have given him, according to these Air Force records, access to intelligence. He turned that down to stay in his position even after this reprimand. And then earlier this year, on January 30th, 2023, he was observed on a JWICS machine, a machine that has sensitive information, access to classified intelligence, viewing content that he was not supposed to be looking at. His superior told other superiors and yet, at least according to these records, there was no reprimand, there was no admonishment, and according to prosecutors, he had access to that information that he kept on putting out there. We know from our previous reporting from last month that two commanders of the unit were suspended as this investigation continues and the mission itself lost its mission, that intelligence mission assigned to other units as this investigation unfolds into what went wrong here. And, Wolf, we just got another look into the failures behind what Jack Texeira is being investigated for here, as his defense attorney says he should still be allowed out ahead of his detention hearing.",

And the House did pass this along party lines with seven Democrats who voted present, most of them being on the House Ethics Committee. And George Santos himself voting in favor of referring that resolution. So, essentially, this is a delay tactic, but take a listen to how Kevin McCarthy explained his decision-making. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): I would like the Ethics Committee to move rapidly on this.

Chris Sanchez, a member of Harry and Meghan's security detail, said the couple switched cars more than once during the chase. They were first seen in a black car then a yellow cab. The couple left the U.K. for a life in North America in 2020 partly over press intrusion, examples of which Harry recounted in his memoire, Spare. And even after leaving the U.K., his fight with the British tabloids in court continues. Harry, in March, appeared at London's high court for a legal case against the Daily Mail, and last week on the first day of a phone-hacking trial, receiving an apology from the Mirror group newspapers. A spokesperson for the couple urged that images obtained from Tuesday's car chase should not be disseminated and reiterated that being a public figure should never come at the cost of anyone's safety. The New York Police Department said that, although photographers made the couple's journey challenging, there were no reported collisions, injuries or arrests. (END VIDEOTAPE) FOSTER (on camera): A lot of people, Wolf, making the point that high- speed car chases going through New York, more people will notice it, very unlikely to have happened. But just to clarify, the people that I have been speaking to around the Sussex is saying it was not a high- speed chase, there were trying to stick to the speed limit because they did not want to cause anymore risk to people around them. Their concern was the paparazzi going into pavements, crossing red lights and potentially causing a fatality amongst pedestrians around the car. So, there has been some confusion around that. They're not making the point that they were traveling at a high speed, basically. But we need to get some more information really about exactly what happened. There were also, I should point out, different legs of this journey, because they swapped cars a couple of times and some legs of the journey were more hectic and scary for the couple than others.",

And he said it was an hour-and-a-half of chaos on the road. You had at least ten vehicles, a car with blacked out windows, that at one point, mounted the sidewalk, scooters and mopeds, and e-bikes with people communicating in rapid comms, using radios and cell phones. And that whenever they slowed down or stopped at a light, they were surrounded. He said they weren't even taking that many pictures or videos. Their main object seemed to be to attempt follow them to the private residence where they were staying, and they had avoided hotels for the specific purpose of not being stalked once the location leaked out, and that this was relentless. They finally went to a police station, tried to gamut with a taxi cab and then regrouped and finally were able to get them to that location undetected.

Kim Jong Un has just inspected what North Korea claims is its first military reconnaissance satellite and approve it for deployment. Experts think the launch could take place any day now and have provided CNN with pictures thought to be preparation at the likely launch site.
