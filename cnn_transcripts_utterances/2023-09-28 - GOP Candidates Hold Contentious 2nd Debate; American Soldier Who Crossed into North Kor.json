For me what I saw was, you know, these debates, it's not just about who gets to be the nominee. It's about the country. It's about what happens to the party along the way.

What has become kind of the base line, key points for the party. Do you think Van's right? This is -- this is it now? You can listen to the Romneys. You can listen to the McConnells. You can listen to other people who come from kind of the old guard of Republicanism, but this is it. JOSH BARRO, WRITER, \"VERY SERIOUS\" NEWS: I mean, the main way that these candidates are trying to differentiate themselves from Donald Trump is by trying to get to his right: getting to his right on entitlements; getting to his right on abortion. And I think -- you know, I think Van's right. That the -- the argument that John there, that's a general election argument. And it's a perfectly good general election argument that will help Democrats, but it won't -- it won't help you in a Republican primary, where people, where the typical voter thinks that everything Donald Trump did through that process at the 2020 election was fine and justified. There is a subtler argument that you could make, about, you know, even if -- even if you're OK with all the stuff Donald Trump did, why this is bad for the Republican Party and conservatives. That he can't run for a second term. That he's going to be spending all of his time and money during the general election on defending himself in these -- in these legal matters that he has, regardless of their merits, rather than trying to win elections for Republicans. And you saw Ron DeSantis get at that a little bit, talking about, you know, we need a president who can serve two terms. The problem is, I don't think that that many voters think about this in those terms. You know, like, they don't think about it like if they were a party operative trying to implement the party agenda. And that's what -- that's what's so difficult for these candidates in this race. That yes, you know, you have to attack Donald Trump to be relevant. But if you attack Donald Trump from the left, which is effectively what you're doing is you say, you know, it's so terrible he tried to steal the election, then that's not going to get you anywhere in the primary.

Here, on his way out, it involved the Swedes. It involved the Chinese. It was Sweden that acted as a sort of interlocutor between the U.S. and North Korea. It was a Swedish convoy that brought Private Travis King to the Friendship bridge on the border between North Korea and China. At that point, he was picked up by the U.S. defense attache to China, and he became once again in U.S. military custody. He caught a flight from there to South Korea to Osan Air Base there. And then a military fight back to the -- back to the United States. We were actually able to track those flights on flight-tracking websites as he made his way back to the U.S. for the first time in some two months. He'd been able to speak with his family, Poppy.
