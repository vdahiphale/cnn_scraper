They want to boost some of those exports. So another good reason that Madam Lagarde may get that opportunity. I want to talk about the opportunities though that the Fed does not have, right, when we talked about that CPI number versus PPI number, I want to bring up a graph here. If you look at both of them, and even though the wholesale prices today came in a little bit lower than expected, the point is they are both ever so slightly trending up and that is what is worrying the Fed.

And if they don't send them money, that's what they're going to do. So Instagram has been facing increasing pressure to crack down on this issue, to do more to address this threat. And a key part of these Instagram features that they're rolling out here is that they'll create a bit of friction. They'll prompt young people to think more about who they're messaging and what they might be sending. So, for example, that notification that you showed that will ask teens to reconsider if the app notices that it's about to send -- that they're about to send an explicit image. The app also says that they're working to identify the accounts that may be engaging in this type of scam and to make them harder to interact with. So, for example, by making it so that those accounts that they suspect might be engaging in these scams can't outbound message other users. And then some of these things, it's interesting that they're only just getting to this. You know, this thing about blurring nudity in DMs, Instagram already doesn't allow nudity on the public parts of its platform.
