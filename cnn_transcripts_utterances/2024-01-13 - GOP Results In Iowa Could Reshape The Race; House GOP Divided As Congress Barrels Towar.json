It's time to get together with some smart people to break down the week's big stories.Today we're asking, with all the polls showing Donald Trump with a huge lead going into Monday's Iowa caucuses, what happens if he doesn't live up to those expectations? Then Speaker Mike Johnson under pressure for trying to make a deal with Democrats. How long will he last? And the Stanley cup craze that has nothing to do with hockey. Our panel gives its yay or nay on the newest merch mania. The gang is all here and ready to go so sit back, relax, and let's talk about it. Up first, after months of campaigning, the Iowa GOP caucuses are finally here. Monday night in frigid conditions, Iowans will gather at locations across the state from church basements to school cafeterias to discuss the Republican candidates and vote. And the results could dramatically reshape or solidify the landscape of the presidential race.

You know, over time the GOP has become a party that embraces a lot of Americans who, by the way, for good reasons in some cases just generally don't trust institutions.
