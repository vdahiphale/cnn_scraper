Police say he was armed and on a mission to kill, out hunting for his next victim when they arrested him over the weekend in northern California.Investigators had been searching for a man seen on surveillance video. Wesley Brownlee is their suspect. He will be arraigned in court tomorrow. Now, police believe he killed six men and injured a woman in a string of late-night shootings. CNN's Camila Bernal is in Stockton, California, for us. Tell us how police found this guy, Camila, and what we know about him.",

We're waiting to hear more on that.But authorities did express how they believe they got their guy essentially. They say this arrest was made to two things. The first was the public's help, the tips from the community. The second thing being what the police chief call good old-fashioned police work. They say, after they reviewed the hundreds of tips that came in, they were able to zero in on one possible suspect. They started studying this guy. They were following him and they were trying to figure out if he had any patterns. Indeed, they found the patterns. He was out in the early morning, late at night, going around dark places or to parks. He would driver around, stop, look and continue driving. That's why the chief of police specifically said he was out on a mission to kill. He was hunting. Those are the words used by the chief of police. When they arrested him, he was wearing all black, wearing a mask around his neck, and he did have a gun. So now local authorities thanking the public for they did here. Here is the mayor of Stockton, Kevin Lincoln, and what he said about the next step. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR KEVIN J. LINCOLN (R-STOCKTON): We made it very clear to the public that the senseless acts of violence would not be tolerated. Even though there's no words we could say that could bring back the lost loved ones, the least we could do is do our part of help bring justice. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

These shootings began in April 2021, with the latest being just at the end of last month.We know that at least six of them were men. Those that were killed were all men. Most of them Hispanic. All of them were killed when they were out late at night, when they were alone. There's one survivor. It's a 46-year-old black woman. And she has talked to police. She said she was out at her campsite, and she heard something, so she went outside and looked around and that's when she was shot. It's unclear what she remembers.

We widen things out there, you can see the low levels of what's left in the water in parts of the central and lower Mississippi valleys. All of the dots indicating where we have record low levels. We want to zoom into parts of Memphis into areas of New Madrid. These areas are at about five feet below where we should be for the Mississippi River basin. Unbelievable. Three new records just in that vicinity. We showed you that levels. Now I want to show you the island. Some of these people were walking to the island. Like Ana, said typically you need a boat. Now that water level completely down. Most of the state of Arkansas still under some sort of drought. And 70 percent and 99 percent of Oklahoma under a severe drought. We need rain. It's just not happening. And our rain chances for the upcoming week, very little. Even up into the Ohio Valley, not seeing much. You have to get into the Great Lakes to get a better chance. That below level rainfall is expected, not just this week, but all the way through the month of October. Folks, we need rain, and it's just not happening. And on the contrary, let's head up to Alaska where water levels are actually rising due to the melting ice caps. Climate change? Possibly. That's actually affecting the king crab and snow crab population. I mean, we had billions from 2018 to 2022. We've dropped from eight billion to one billion. It would be typically like two degrees Celsius water. Lately, the water temperature has been rising, which is part of reason we noticed the decline in the crabs -- Ana?",

Ye posting on Parler, \"In a world where conservative opinions are considered to be controversial, we have to make sure we have the right to freely express ourselves.\" So where could all of this lead?

It was a platform that was taken off of Google store and the Alphabet store after January 6th. It claims it has better moderation procedures on this platform. But no one goes there for a dialogue on conservative ideas. They go there to find equally minded hate, essentially. And that's what -- that's what Kanye, that's why he's buying it. It's no joke. He knows exactly what he's saying. His hate rants just need to find a platform.",

Money equals power when it comes to social media and being able to control a message.I take it there's a message at the top, these people with money buying or creating new social media avenues.

The market has decided they don't want some of this misbehavior, incitement on their platforms.When Twitter takes Donald Trump off, there's no First Amendment allegation. But they want words around because of the salaciousness that they like to claim that they're racism or they're anti-Semitism, as we've seen. What can we do? There are two things that are going to curb this. One is there's just going to be a group of people who want to converse in the most hate-filled arena. That, in some ways, we sort of move on and moderate for violence but not focus on it, right? The second is the market is going to be attacked. So I was looking at the market value of Parler. We don't know quite what it is. They've only been able to raise less than $100 million. That seems like a lot to people. It is not a lot if you're talking about a global social media platform. So there's going to be market controls. And the third is, of course, lawsuits. These social media platforms are looking at vulnerability they have for allowing the organization by letting people get together and hate as much they want but organizing of violence. And we're probably one lawsuit away from being already filed against the social media platform. So, they're going to be more cautious about what they allow on them. And I should say, for the record, Google and Apple Store should look at what apps they're allowing on the platform. I mean, they have free agency. They're not the government.",

When you look at adults 20 to 69 who could benefit, 16 percent have ever used them.
