We've also learned that he used to be a regular patron at the dance hall and met his ex-wife there, and that he then went to another dance hall in a nearby city, but bystanders disarmed him and he escaped in his van. The Sheriff says the gunman used -- the gun that he used was an automatic -- a semiautomatic pistol which is now illegal to purchase in California. More details about that will be coming out in the days ahead.
