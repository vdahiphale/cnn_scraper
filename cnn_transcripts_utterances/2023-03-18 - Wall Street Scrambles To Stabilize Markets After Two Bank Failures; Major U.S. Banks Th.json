You know, the wheels of international justice often take years after the alleged atrocities have happened to actually get into gear.Now, this is still happening according to our sources here on the ground. Children taken away from their parents in some cases, and most seriously out of state-run orphanages across the front lines, into Russian territory, and often given up to adoption to Russian parents, according to these allegations. The prosecutor, the ICC said that these children are being used as a tool of war. And you had President Zelenskyy after this announcement of an arrest warrant speaking about the scale of these alleged crimes. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translation): This is a historic decision that will lead to historic responsibility. More than 16,000 cases of forced deportation of Ukrainian children by the occupier have already been recorded. But the real, full number of deportees may be much higher.

So, this could be the first step in a much longer process. David McKenzie from Kyiv, thank you so much.We want to turn now to the United States. And new developments this week in Fulton County, Georgia, where a special grand jury recently wrapped its work looking at former President Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 election defeat in the Peach State. The Atlanta Journal Constitution is reporting that investigators now have audio of a phone call that Trump made to the former Georgia House Speaker, a recording where Trump pushes for a special session of the legislature to undo President Biden's victory in that state. A source has confirmed to CNN that such a recording exists. So, let's dig deeper now with the Atlanta Journal Constitution's Managing Editor Leroy Chapman; and former Federal Prosecutor Michael Zeldin. Gentlemen, appreciate you sharing part of your Saturday with us. Michael, first to you. There are now three, three recorded calls we know of where Trump tried to pressure officials in Georgia. How does that bolster a potential case? [07:10:20] MICHAEL ZELDIN, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: Well, it's further evidence Boris, of the effort of the President to undermine the integrity of the vote in Georgia. To prove criminal behavior here, however, you need to have established that the President knew he lost, he objectively knew he lost. And despite that knowledge, went forward with a plan to prevent the certification of the vote, merely calling members of the state legislature in a good faith effort to have them investigate his belief of fraud will not rise to the level of criminal behavior. So, it's this matter of what was his intention, and what can they prove about what prior knowledge he had, and why this call was an effort to do something that was criminal, as opposed to just inappropriate.",

But we understand that with some of our interviews with members of the grand jury, that their, their work is complete, they're confident in it, and they talked a little bit about what they heard.

But what Speaker Ralston knew is that he did not have the power to call a special session just for that.

What Leroy described is interesting, because what Ralston said was, I will do everything that's appropriate. And then Trump says, OK, thank you very much. A phone call, I guess, standing up in and of itself, to me wouldn't prove criminal behavior would be -- it would prove inappropriate behavior, but not necessarily, necessarily criminal behavior.So, what the DEA has to do is decide whether or not these phone calls in combination with all the other evidence that she's amassed equals criminal behavior versus just inappropriate behavior. And that's not a simple thing, because you have to prove this to jury, of home county jury beyond a reasonable doubt and it has to be sustained on appeal. So, I think she's taking her time appropriately to determine whether or not she can make a case that will stick and you know, that's not -- she shouldn't have used the word imminent in our initial press conference because imminent for lawyers and imminent reporters as we know, Boris, is very different.",

So, you've got a significant amount here of winter storm warnings in winter weather advisories across the Midwest as well as portions of the Northeast, where we've got some lake effect enhancement, it's kind of following up from that cold front that sliding through. And that's going to produce some snow showers across much of this area. Most of the areas we're talking about, about four to six inches total.

The cold there also up into the Midwest at 12. Temperatures -- were at 12 degrees right now in Minneapolis, minus one in Bismarck.
