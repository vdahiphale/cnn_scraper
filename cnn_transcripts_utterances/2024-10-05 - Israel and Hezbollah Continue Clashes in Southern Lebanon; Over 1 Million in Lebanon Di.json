In southern Lebanon, it's conducting a limited military operation while continuing its war on Hamas in Gaza. Israel appears likely to respond in the coming days to Iran's largest ever missile attack earlier this week. The IDF has described its operations in Lebanon as limited, localized and targeted, although it has forced tens of thousands from their homes on evacuation orders. A new report from a conflict monitoring group says, Israel's bombardment of Lebanon over the past three weeks is the world's most intense aerial campaign, with the exception of what has happened in Gaza in the last two decades, Well, Lebanon says more than 1 million people, about one-fifth of its population, are now displaced. More than 1,400 people have been killed in Israel's offensive and close to 7,500 wounded. One-quarter of Lebanon is now under Israeli evacuation orders. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTOINETTE KARAM, RELIEF WORKER (through translator):  The Lebanese people don't deserve this and they should not be living through this. As you can see, there are children who are sleeping in the streets. There are children who don't have shelter or pillows. There are people who still didn't find a school to shelter and winter is approaching. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

NABIH BULOS, MIDDLE EAST BUREAU CHIEF, \"LOS ANGELES TIMES\":  Well, so in terms of the latest, we actually just heard now of another strike on the southern suburbs where Hezbollah holds sway. And this was actually, you know, actually, I think it was about 30 minutes ago, roughly speaking. And we've also -- we've also had reports that the Israeli army now intends to target ambulances that are operating in the south of the country. So we are talking about a continuation of what has been happening, of course, over the last few days but also an intensification because we're seeing the war expanding across other parts of Lebanon. And in fact, also overnight, we heard of a strike on Tripoli in the north of the country. Indeed on a refugee camp actually in the north of the country, where a Hamas leader was killed. Again, it's all about the expansion right now. We are seeing this war spill over into other parts of Lebanon.",

The fact of the matter is that Israel says it wants to create some kind of a buffer zone or at least that's the implication, which is to say that it wants to push Hezbollah, I guess, behind a certain line on Lebanese territory. Of course the problem is that Hezbollah, at least used to; I don't know anymore at this point. But it does possess some kind of long- range missile capability. And so the idea is pushing it back 10 kilometers or 20 kilometers behind a certain line. It seems to be a non-starter in terms of actually being able to secure Israel's defense. At the same time, I mean the implication of the various evacuation orders we've seen from the Israeli military seemed to indicate a longer-term occupation that would actually extend even to parts of the Owhali River or, I should say, north of the U.N.-mandated buffer line from 2006. In fact, in some cases, you're talking about a third of the country possibly under occupation. And that will be repeat of what we saw in the '80s.

There is actually a lot of movement into various parts of the country while people are trying to find any kind of shelter. Because, for example, places inside there, where Ben Wedeman was, I mean, that's almost now completely full. Right. You go to other places in the north like Tripoli, also relatively full.

And yes, they are indeed digging in and you can expect a very, very strong or a very, very entrenched and powerful fight to go on between the two sides. Now of course, given enough time, I have no doubt that Israel can actually advance and take ground. The question is, how long can it hold it? Because once it does, Hezbollah will not disappear. And let's say that, even if Israel does manage to push them out in a material fashion and in a more permanent fashion, I mean, they'll always have this situation where Hezbollah will want to go back and take that land.
