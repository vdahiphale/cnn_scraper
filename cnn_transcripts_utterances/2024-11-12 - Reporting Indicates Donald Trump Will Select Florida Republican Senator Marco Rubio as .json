      "sentences": "Florida Senator Marco Rubio for Secretary of State, and North Dakota Governor Kristi Noem is expected to Trump's pick for Secretary of Homeland Security.And Trump is clearly focused, as you can see, on filling out key national security positions first. Florida Congressman Mike Waltz is expected to be his National Security Adviser. Longtime aide Stephen Miller, who was central to Trump's immigration policies last time, is expected to be his deputy chief of staff for policy this time. And former New York Congressman Lee Zeldin is Trump's pick to head up the EPA. Everything from Trump's climate policy to what his actually plan is to pull off his mass deportation plan to what he'll do about future support for Ukraine and Israel, all of these huge issues now likely left to those names to figure out. Joining us right now for some more insight on what really is happening inside this fast-moving transition is Meredith McGraw, national political correspondent for \"Politico.\" It's good to see you, Meredith. What are you hearing about what it is like behind closed doors in these meetings to decide who Trump is going to pick for these big roles? MEREDITH MCGRAW, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"POLITICO\":  Well, for weeks before Donald Trump was elected, his transition team had been compiling resumes and names for Donald Trump to go over should he win. And now that he's back at Mar-a-Lago plotting out his next administration, he's going over some of these choices. There's a room at Mar-a-Lago behind the scenes where some TVs are set up, where an aide is able to plug in a laptop and show him bits and pieces of their resume and bio, and even some video clips of their hits on television. And he's taking advice and input from a parade of people who have come through Mar-a-Lago, including people like Elon Musk or RFK Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard who are honorary co-chairs of the transition but are having some input on things, too. But really, this comes down to Donald Trump and the people he wants to have surrounding him. Susie Wiles is also an important player in all of this. She was speaking to a network of donors in Las Vegas yesterday with some of the other Trump advisers from the campaign, but during this time, she's also been influential as the chief of staff and will have a say over who is going to be on the White House staff among other roles.",

Now this is all happening behind closed doors. That doesn't mean that we're not getting some glimpses of what's going on, whether it's reporting we're getting behind the scenes from sources, or its just Mar-a-Lago members and people who happen to be around taking videos and photos of people like Howard Lutnick, the co-chair for Donald Trump's transition, having lunch with him at his golf club, or Elon Musk getting photographed zipping around with Donald Trump at his club down in Florida, too.So we haven't seen any sort of embarrassing scenes like when photographers descended on Mitt Romney having dinner at John George in New York City as he was discussing the role of secretary of state with Donald Trump and Reince Priebus back in 2016. But we are getting some glimpses of who's down there. And of course, as people fly down to take meetings or to talk with folks, reporters who are in Palm Beach are reporting who they're seeing on the scene. So we are still getting little glimpses, even though if it's not all playing out in the lobby of Trump Tower for the public to see, like it did back in 2016.",

He's having dinner with him and Melania. He's taking his son around the course with Trump. He's spending hours with Donald Trump at this really critical period. And they've become really close over the course of the campaign. But I think this relationship is going to be a really interesting one to watch when you think about all of the business ventures that are tied up in government contracts that Elon Musk has control over, whether its SpaceX and NASA or different government contracts and projects.And I am really closely watching how this relationship is going to play out. But he does have a lot of influence here. And people around Trump have said that it has been really exciting to see Elon Musk actually stick around after investing so much in the campaign, that he's now wanting to shape things to come. But there could be some tension points moving forward.",

Lots of things to get to here and lots of picks coming out from Trump world. First of all, let's talk about Marco Rubio. He may be his secretary of state. Marc, to you first. What do you expect from Rubio? MARC LOTTER, FORMER STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN:  Well, I think Senator Rubio has obviously shown that he is very strong on foreign policy. He's also a huge supporter of our military. And so I think you're going to get somebody in that position who is very much in line with President Trump's worldview, our need to have difficult conversations not only with our adversaries, but sometimes our allies. And so contrary to what we saw in, say, early 2017, and I was in the White House at that time, I think you're going to have a secretary of state in Marco Rubio, if that is the president-elect's choice, who is going to be fully aligned with his vision and make sure that's communicated on the world stage.",

But I think the fear is kind of exactly what Marc just said, that this is going to be Trump choosing people that are not just completely aligned with him, but that have shown that they will bend the knee, that they will genuflect at the altar of Donald Trump no matter what happens inside the room.And I hope that at least for somebody like Marco Rubio who was established as a leader within Republican politics way before Donald Trump, with considerable bona fides in Republican policies and Republican beliefs before Donald Trump, and as somebody with a position of secretary of state, is he going to adhere to those? Or is he going to essentially do whatever Donald Trump makes him do or wants him to do? And that's concerning, because we know that Donald Trump possibly might take the United States out of NATO, possibly might take the United States out of so many of the other world alliances that we count on in order to keep world peace. And so, that's going to be my question. And I think everyone's eyes are going to be on Marco Rubio to see if that happens, what is he going to do? I suspect that he's going to do exactly what Donald Trump wants him to do. And I think that that is the concern. So, moving forward, look, and Donald Trump clearly, he won the election, and so he has the right to choose people, whoever he wants around him, but I think that people understand that this is going to be very much an imperial presidency of a president who does not stick to norms, who does not stick to alliances that have worked for western peace, global peace, world peace. And that's going to be what people are going to be very concerned about moving forward.",

And what's going to be interesting is moving forward, he said that they're going to start mass deportation on day one. And that is going to be, first of all, has already injected terror, chaos, fear, division among so many immigrants and communities of color around the country. I've got so many calls and texts from my friends who are terrified about what is going to happen, even people who are here with legal status, because I don't think that at the end of the day, they're going to really make any kind of distinction between the criminal undocumented, which, by the way, the criminal undocumenteds are being deported. That is a policy that is being adhered to.But it also, I think, indicates that there's a lot of talk here, Sara, and it's going to be very improbable that they're going to really be able to do this from a policy standpoint and from a budgetary standpoint. So we'll see what happens, but right now it has only injected fear and terror in America's communities.",

Even though this case was about the hush money payments made to Stormy Daniels and the cover up that took place when Trump was a private citizen, there were some evidence that came into the case of official acts and the Supreme Court decision says that that cannot be used by prosecutors. That includes the testimony of Hope Hicks and Madeleine Westerhout, two White House aides, as well as the tweets that Trump made while he was president in the White House. A lot of them having too with his lawyer, Michael Cohen, who he didn't want to plead guilty and cooperate against him. So, that is the reason why Trump's lawyers are saying that this conviction should be set aside and this indictment should be dismissed. Prosecutors though have said that even if you look at the evidence that Trump's team has highlighted, they say that is a sliver of the mountains of evidence of testimony and documents and that this verdict should hold.
