KAYLA TAUSCHE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  That's right, John. It's been a fast and furious week for Vice President Harris, who is now atop the Democrats' presidential ticket. And she ended that week on a high note with that highly anticipated endorsement from the Democratic Party's power couple. Listen.

According to the campaign, there will be more than 2,300 events over the weekend. Coffee hour, soul food potlucks, and pride trivia nights, office openings and more as she seeks to embrace the campaign infrastructure that President Biden has handed down to her and also tries to expand it and reshape it in her own image. Her campaign says that she is also planning a slew of battleground events as she has throughout the week today, holding events in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia, and more states. That, of course, with surrogates and affiliate groups in those states, as she's rallied various demographics virtually on Zoom throughout the week, John, just continuing this momentum, of course, as the party barrels toward its own convention.

And there is more of this. There's going to be more extreme statements that come out. And since the story has been big, he has skipped Netanyahu's address, went on Charlie Kirk's radio show, sat down with Don Jr. He has yet to do a major mainstream interview and explain what he meant by these comments and tried to do the cleanup.

There are large immigrant populations in those suburbs that feel like they're not adequately represented and given the same sort of kind of help that they wish to have, things like that. So I would expect that the community, law enforcement and intelligence community, is looking at all of those groups that basically have complaints with the French government.

DAN KILDEE (D-MI): Well, things have improved. The horse race numbers are one indication of that, but I think we have to be careful not to look too closely at that because the biggest difference I see on the ground is the level of enthusiasm, not just among Democratic base voters, but among those swing voters who are really kind of unsure where they would go because they wanted a choice other than Donald Trump or President Biden. That may not be fair to President Biden in my view, but that was the fact. The enthusiasm level is so much higher now than it was just a few weeks ago. And that's going to make a big difference.

Even police leadership will say the whole community has to be involved. So, I remember that debate and that was principally focused on not just saying, okay, more and more and more police will solve the crime problem.
