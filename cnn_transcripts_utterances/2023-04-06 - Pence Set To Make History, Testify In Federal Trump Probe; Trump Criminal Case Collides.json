And he's also got a problem in not laying out the specific election law crimes because he's got a problem as a local prosecutor, and these are federal crimes. So the two theories upon which his case rests are both really unproven, really untested, really unsettled.

It allows an investigation of sorts for any sort of ethical impropriety that may rise in the public reporting of that as well. But, John, as you know, a split Congress means he needs to get support from Republicans to get this out of the Senate, where 60 votes would be needed for any such legislation, not to mention the Republican controlled House.
