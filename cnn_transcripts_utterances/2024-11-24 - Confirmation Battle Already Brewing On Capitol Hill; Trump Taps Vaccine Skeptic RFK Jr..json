Jessica Dean has the night off.Confirmation battles are already shaping up on Capitol Hill, as some Senate lawmakers begin to pick apart Trump's more controversial cabinet picks. One of them, Tulsi Gabbard, for director of National Intelligence. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TAMMY DUCKWORTH (D-IL): She is, in terms of the intelligence community, very unqualified. Plus she is potentially compromised and could be and has -- there are questions about whether or not she is now a Russian asset. SEN. JAMES LANKFORD (R-OK): Well, we'll have lots of questions. She met with Bashar Assad. We'll want to know what the purpose was. There's comments that are floating out there, but we want to be able to know the rest of the story. SEN. MARKWAYNE MULLIN (R-OK): This isn't a new administration coming in. And so when people are criticizing his picks the president has done this job before. He knows exactly what he needs.

Some of which you've highlighted, but also the ones who have been speaking out publicly about this. They know that Tulsi Gabbard and her views on surveillance and her skepticism of some of the agencies that she's going to be overseeing is something that could be an issue with senators. They know that RFK Jr., his position and past position, I should say,supporting abortion access could be an issue that could come up with many conservative Republicans. They know that Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump's pick to lead the Pentagon, and one, his credentials and whether he's experienced enough, but also the recent police report detailing a potential sexual assault allegation against him is something that could be an issue. So they are aware of all of this. They are talking I know, Donald Trump's transition team, with members very frequently on a daily basis, getting, taking their temperature, and also working to ready these different candidates for what is to come. And particularly I will add as well that they also are trying to prepare them to meet one-on-one with different senators, to go to different meetings, like we saw Matt Gaetz and Pete Hegseth do last week alongside Vice President-elect J.D. Vance, to really see what they can do to assuage some of those concerns behind closed doors before this plays out openly and in public. Now, we actually did hear Senator Markwayne Mullin, he's a fierce defender of Donald Trump in the deeply red state of Oklahoma, try to argue that Donald Trump knows what he's doing, that he chose these people for a reason. I want you to take a listen to how he put it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

One is that he highlighted something that I hear constantly in my conversations with those working on the transition and close to Donald Trump, that the former president himself, the president-elect believes that he was given a mandate. There's questions of whether people agree with that. But he believes that he, you know, his performance in the election has emboldened him to make these decisions.He also wants to choose people that he believes are going to break with the establishment norms, to break from tradition, and that's why he has chosen these people, he argues, and he's been saying that himself to some of these members. And then the other thing as well, I would just point out, is what we saw happen last week with Matt Gaetz does show that senators do have a backbone. They do have a say in this, even though Republicans, you know, control both the House and the Senate. And obviously many Republican senators want to show their loyalty to Donald Trump before the next four years, they also made it clear that the numbers were not there to get Matt Gaetz confirmed. And so there's a lot of discussions happening behind the scenes about how to exactly move forward on this. But again, these are things that they are really trying to prepare these different picks for, really, before this becomes public and we see some of these confirmation hearings play out on television -- Kayla.",

But we appreciate you being there for us in Florida this evening.You heard Alayna mentioned one of President-elect Trump's controversial picks in Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who is a known vaccine skeptic, and Trump has appointed him to run the Department of Health and Human Services if confirmed. During his failed run for president, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. called for officials to modify vaccine mandates, remove fluoride from public drinking water, eliminate entire departments at the FDA, and replace 600 officials at the National Institutes of Health, among other issues. Joining me now is Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University School of Public Health, former senior official in the Biden administration as well. Doctor Jha, it's good to have you this evening. You've also waded into the debate on some of these pics. You tweeted earlier today, while RFK Jr. is an absolutely terrible choice for HHS secretary, you think the nominees for FDA, CMS, and NIH are, in your words, all pretty reasonable, and that while you have plenty of policy disagreements with them, they are smart and experienced. We will need them to do well. What do you see as the dividing line between Kennedy and those others that you mentioned? DR. ASHISH JHA, DEAN, BROWN UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH: Yes. So, first of all, thank you for having me back. There really is a very big difference. If you look at the picks for CMS, FDA, NIH, as I said, they're not the people I would have chosen. I have significant disagreements with them on policy but there are people with experience. They are smart. They have a track record and generally believe in modern medicine, and modern public health. RFK Jr. is very different. I mean, this is a guy who doesn't believe HIV causes AIDS. He doesn't believe that polio virus causes polio. He's not a vaccine skeptic. He espouses ideas that have been widely debunked over and over again. And he's going to be their boss. So I worry immensely about that. There is a very large difference between RFK Jr. and all the other picks I have seen so far for HHS, key positions inside HHS.",

I think where there's a lot of disagreement is around vaccine mandates, where I think there is a reasonable debate to be had about whether there should have been or should be mandates or not. But again, Robert F. Kennedy is a different kind of a person. I mean, this is a guy who fundamentally doesn't believe in modern medicine. Why Donald Trump, why President-elect Trump chose him, I don't understand the politics of it. Not my area of expertise. What I will say is when you think about the health of the American people, Robert F. Kennedy poses a very unique and substantial danger in a way that the other nominees really do not.",

There's no question about it.The question is, as HHS secretary, is Robert F. Kennedy going to be actually able to effect change? The rhetoric is great. We need people to eat more healthily. How is he going to make decisions about what policies to implement? My view, we should use science and evidence to make those decisions. He doesn't seem to have a strong track record of using evidence and data. A lot of the policies are going to come out of the Agriculture Department, not in his purview.

And I think the language that we're hearing now is additional pressure from Iran on Israel to move towards this ceasefire. If Hezbollah goes on a ceasefire with Israel, that's because Iran says it's OK. So a ceasefire with Hezbollah really sort of indicates a lowering of temperature with Iran and I think this is what we're seeing from Iran at the moment, adding their pressure, their voice into this equation as the discussions go on around a ceasefire.",

Thank you for joining us. A recent article from the \"Wall Street Journal,\" we'll start here. It says that TikTok CEO reached out to Elon Musk seeking counsel on what to expect from the incoming Trump administration. You know, TikTok is potentially going to be banned. There's legislation to that effect. It's in the middle of a lot of litigation. There's the potential that Trump's former Treasury secretary could try to buy it.

And even though Musk is not going to have a formal cabinet position, his soft power is arguably even more influential. So we're going to continue to see stories like this where there are examples of, in this case, the CEO of TikTok trying to get through to Musk and thus to Trump.",

Well, flash forward eight years. The incoming President Trump is joined at the hip by the owner of the old platform, Twitter, now known as X, and every tweet Musk posts is now scrutinized very carefully for clues about what he might do or not do. You know, so I think this solves, this ends the argument about howimportant these social media platforms are. Over the weekend, for example, Musk is joking, I think, about maybe trying to buy MSNBC. It seems he's just trying to troll. Comcast is not making MSNBC up for sale right now. Maybe something will change in a few years.

That has happened before in other countries. That's part of the concern when even if Elon Musk is just joking, that's part of the concern here when it comes to MSNBC. But at the moment, this spinoff that Comcast is doing will take at least a year to complete. There's no immediate sale or any of that I'm told that is planned.

With 60,000 trees gone, they're trying to make ends meet with wreaths and smaller trees for the season.That farmer also unfortunately lost his home. This farm here lost 270,000 seedlings. These are baby trees that would have eventually gotten planted to become those bigger trees that often get cut and sold for Christmastime but when the flood waters came in, it contaminated all of these trees with that pollution and root rot. And these are just not viable anymore. A lot of these were also supposed to go to other farmers in the industry, and that's just a loss for them this season. Christmas trees take seven to 10 years to grow, so it is possible that we really won't understand the impact of Helene on the Christmas tree industry for another decade.
