And it's going to have to be intentional being able to disseminate, deconstruct racism and bias. [13:05:08] And, as I said, it is the institutionalized police culture. It's not just the police culture. It's the justice system. We have bias in every aspect of society. And so you don't see officers doing this to white citizens, because our court system has said that they value white life more than any other life. And so we finally have to speak truth to power on these issues to say, the reason why we keep seeing it happen to black and brown people is because it is the culture in this society that we can marginalize brown and black people, that we can trample on the constitutional rights of black and brown people.

But let me tell you how your question matches the gentleman's question in the front row. Why do we see this continuing to happen? I will give you two reasons. It's a two-way street. The community wants it. But the other side doesn't want it. The unions don't want it. This is like a carnival. You see the strong man trying to hit the target and make -- and ring the bell, and it's a rigged game? Well, we try to ring the bell, but we can't because it's rigged.

I am sad to even think that what you said is true, that they would use African-American officers to go berate African-American citizens because they thought it would get less attention. We know that the citizens have now come forward to my office saying that their constitutional rights were violated by the Scorpion unit and that they actually tried to report them, and nothing happened. So, we cannot give anybody a pass on our constitutional rights, on our dignity, on our humanity. It doesn't matter if it's a black police officer or a white police officer. And that's what hurts so bad, because you want them to see the humanity in us. And you keep thinking to yourself, these officers got to understand that that could have been your brother, your little brother. Tyre could have been your little brother. Would you want anybody to do what you were doing to Tyre to your little brother? And that's how you have to think about it, that what if this was my family member? Hopefully, every police officer in America is going to start thinking when they interact with a citizen, what if this was my brother or my sister or my child? That's what we want. We want compassion and respect. The same way you de-escalate with white citizens, well, de-escalate with black citizens too. We all want to get home to our families.

The video, when you all see it, you all try to think to yourself, what are the correct charges? Because we all don't -- we all got eyesight. We don't need anybody to interpret it for us. You look at that video for yourself. And you say, were the actions intentional? I mean, when you're kicking somebody, and you -- it's not a reaction kick.

So, when you take that quote, and you understand what we have seen and what the charges are, those are maximum charges. Murder requires a little bit more something. And I agree with Ben that the state's attorney looked at these charges and did whatever they could. Whether or not there's any other charges out there, well, maybe the evidence will bear that out.

And you all know the names. We don't even have to explain them to you. That's how bad it is, when we say Michael Brown, when we say Tamir Rice, when we say Alton Sterling, when we say Eric Garner, when we say Stephon Clark, when we say Laquan McDonald, when we say Philando Castile, when we Daunte Wright, when we say Amir Locke, I mean -- Atatiana Jefferson. I mean, is that not a systematic problem with the culture when you have these many unarmed black people dying? We're not talking about people who got guns coming at the police, because we look at the data. Attorney Romanucci, Van Turner, I mean, these are great lawyers. We don't just go willy-nilly. We look at statistics. We look at when the police have to use deadly force with white citizens, it's normally when a citizen has a deadly weapon. That's not true when we look at deadly encounters for black people and police. I mean, how many times do we have to hear another black man was shot in the back while he was running away from the police and the police say, I'm in fear of my life?

This is coming on a day that we are expecting that, sometime after 7:00 p.m. Eastern time tonight, we will be seeing the video of that stop and arrest that led to a beating and that led to the death of 29-year-old Tyre Nichols. Five now former officers are involved and are facing murder and kidnapping charges. Seasoned officials who have seen this video have been absolutely shaken by the brutality of it all, the Memphis police chief telling CNN's Don Lemon this morning that it depicts acts that she said -- quote -- \"defy humanity.\" To break this all down, I'm joined now by former Washington, D.C., police Chief Charles Ramsey, who now advises police departments across the country as a consultant. And also with us is criminal defense attorney Joey Jackson. Chief Ramsey, I want to start with you, because we heard from the family over the course of the last hour a clear determination that they don't want their son's death to be in vain. And what they are asking for now is for accountability from this police department and the disbandment of a unit that seemed to have been involved in this stop. They're called the Scorpion unit. They are saying that these units are responsible for brutality, for a wolf pack mentality. What's your reaction to that?",
