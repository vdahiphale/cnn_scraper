Here, you can see the mangled steel of what used to be the Francis Scott Key Bridge on top of that cargo ship that smashed into a support pillar at about 1:30 this morning. Six people remain unaccounted for. And moments ago, President Biden said the search-and-rescue operation remains the top priority. Two other people were saved. One of them is in critical condition, according to the president. Officials are still trying to piece together what happened. There is one key detail. If you watch the video closely, shortly before the impact, you see the boat. The lights can be seen flickering on and off. Now, Maryland's governor confirms that the crew sent a mayday call about a power issue, alerting authorities, who quickly cut off traffic to the bridge, a move that potentially saved lives. Let's take you now live to the scene with CNN's Gabe Cohen. So, Gabe, update us on this search-and-rescue effort. Where does it stand now?",

You can see that massive container ship and what's left of the Key Bridge just spilled across it, across both the deck and in the water on each side of it, thousands of tons of steel, as those rescuers are in these rescue boats all around it searching for any sign of life. We also have seen rescue vehicles on the riverbank. They're participating in the search as well, Coast Guard helicopters. It is a lot. There are a lot of agencies that are taking part in this, but, look, we are now close to 12 hours into this operation, and things are getting more dire, because this is cold water. We're talking 48 degrees, conditions this morning particularly frigid. And so every second counts. And we have heard officials talk about that, but, as of now, they say they are maintaining hope, and they are just praying that there is going to be that sign of life and they can pull some of these individuals who are missing out of the water. We know they're searching for at least six people believed to be missing in the river right now. And we're waiting on an update hopefully in the coming minutes or hours as to whether or not anything comes up, they're able to find anything. But, as of now, it's been a very difficult morning for these crews, conditions, a lot of choppy waves out there. It has definitely settled down, but not easy, Boris, for the crews that are working in this difficult situation.",

      "sentences": "Right, Boris.We have been able to get to this vantage point a few hundred yards from the vessel itself. Our photojournalist Andrew Crispin (ph) is going to go right past me and give you a closer view to it. You can see just the sheer force. You -- just from this angle, you can see the sheer force with which the Dali, this cargo ship, this container ship, slammed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge. You can see there at the bow of the ship, which is to the right -- this was an outgoing vessel, by the way, going out toward the Chesapeake Bay, which is what you see beyond it. This -- that you can see across the bow is a remnant of the bridge itself. It's lying across the bow. This is -- you can also see another angle of the damage to the vessel and the damage to the bridge itself. If we can pan out just a little bit wider, you can see -- look at that -- the entire middle section of the Francis Scott Key Bridge is gone. There's a Coast Guard helicopter hovering overhead. Rescue vessels have been going back and forth. A few minutes ago, we saw an Army Corps of Engineers vessel that we were told had sonar capability that is also searching the water. We also saw a couple of tugboats coming past here towing an oil boom. So they're looking for remnants of possible spillage there. I heard Gabe mentioning, of course, they're looking for six people unaccounted for. We're also told by officials that they tracked four vehicles that were on the bridge at the time of the collapse, four, at least four, possibly more vehicles, but a few vehicles, we can say, that went into the water. Unclear if there were any people inside the vehicles. At least one of the vehicles was seen with its lights on in the water after it plummeted into -- into the water from this bridge. And, again, just take a look at the devastation there and what is missing. It's a very dramatic shot of what is missing from this bridge there. It's a very important artery for commerce going north and south along the East Coast. Hazmat material is only allowed on this bridge. It's not allowed in the tunnels that go underneath the Baltimore Harbor, where most of the vehicular traffic, the regular vehicular traffic, goes into the tunnels. The hazmat material can go over this bridge. So that gives you an idea of what's been disrupted here. Here's another kind of illustration of what's been disrupted. No major vessel traffic has been allowed in or out of this harbor since this accident happened almost 12 hours ago. That green vessel right there, that's called the Carmen. That is a vessel that brings cars into that port terminal here in Baltimore. It is stranded here. Every other commercial cargo ship is trapped inside this harbor. No other major vessels can get in or out. That is a huge disruption of the economy here. You have got hotels, businesses, restaurants, other businesses here that depend on these goods coming in and out of Baltimore Harbor. That is disrupted for at least days, we're told. I also spoke, Boris, not too long ago to an official with a marine construction company that's going to be involved in the salvaging and the reconstruction of this bridge. He told me that it's going to take several days just to get floating cranes and heavy equipment here, so that it can remove some of the fragments of this bridge when it gets here. Then they have to chop up some of these fragments into smaller pieces. It's going to take days just for them to get on site. And that can't even begin, Boris, until the rescue operation is complete.",

It would include helmets and gloves and boots and so forth just to keep them safe while they're in, on and around the water. And, again, once they enter the water, it's very precarious. It's very dangerous for the personnel that are in and around the water. The divers are having a difficult time because of the currents and because of the wind, because of the light when the incident first occurred, and the fact that, because of the currents, you have a lot of drifting of the boats and drifting of the lines and so forth.

We're going to keep our eye on that, bring it to you as it happens. But in the meantime let's bring in CNN's Tom Foreman. Tom, give us a sense of just how big this was and all the dynamics that were at play. TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, the ship itself is a little bit longer than three football fields, so this is a big, hefty piece of -- it -- without any cargo, it weighs almost 100,000 tons. With the cargo, it gets much heavier than that, so a tremendous amount of power here. We know that it was moving in -- out from here from Point Breezy around this way. It came down doing about nine miles an hour when it made impact down here. So that's an idea of what was going on. You will notice that little swerve right there. There's going to be a lot of looking at that. Why did this happen? Because that's what took it off the course that would have had it going really much more where ships should go, which is right here. This is where it diverged from that. So we will find out what that meant if we move on. But we know also that the bridge itself, substantial bridge here, 1.6 miles in length, quite a big distance, a very, very busy bridge. And we know that the bridge basically seemed to be in good shape, last inspected in 2021, and, at the time, it was rated fair.",
