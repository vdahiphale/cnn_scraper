It's still very much an active and ongoing situation.I want to just go straight to this social media video that CNN has verified and geo located to this aerospace company, because it shows the moment of that attack in that video, if we could pull up that social media video, you can see what is a huge explosion. You can hear the sound of it, a plume of smoke going up, and then you see an individual who is moving through that location, appears to be carrying a weapon. You can also hear gunfire as well in that video. It gives you a sense of just how terrifying this attack was right in the middle of the day, as you can see there in the capital, in the heart of Turkey. Again, this is going to terrify many families across Turkey. It has been relatively safe, relatively peaceful in recent years in terms of these types of attacks. But, Turks have seen many of these in the past, particularly in 2016. There was a spat of terror attacks across the country. So, many are going to be wondering, what is behind this attack? What is the motivation behind this attack? Who is behind this attack? We're awaiting a press conference from the country's Interior Minister very shortly. He may provide some clarity there. We do have a death toll so far, which is 13, or rather, three people, I apologize, three people killed and 14 people wounded in the attack. Turkish officials also saying that two individuals were killed in this attack here. Again, looking at those live images, you can see just the number of sirens that are going off. There are medical workers there, rescue workers there, police, security officers, all trying to secure that scene and help those dead and wounded in this attack.",

And it is significant to know what this aerospace company is, because it is emblematic of the Turkish state, because it is a state-owned aerospace company that does provide contracts, does provide to the Turkish military, including drones, according to some experts that were speaking to us just a short time ago, that this company provides expert drones to Turkey's military that are used by its army. So, it's very much symbolic, if you will, of Turkey's military.So, that begins to give you an indication of why it was a target. But also important to note that there is hundreds of people who work within that complex who all, of course, now are caught up in the aftermath of this terror attack. Of course, at this time, you're going to hear again, potentially, from the interior ministry, but you can expect that Turkish officials are going to be concerned, of course, when they say terror attack, is this ISIS? Is this groups like ISIS, or is this coming from Kurdish separatists? So, a lot of concern right now for the motivation. What is behind this attack? Who is behind the attack? But, the primary concern, of course, is going to be those who need help on the ground. The country's officials say an investigation has already been launched.",

And in fact, recently, the government started exploring the idea of a peace process with PKK, the Kurdish separatist group. And so, an attack on a major Turkish defense contractor, a public company, but also the crown jewel of Turkey's defense industry, is going to be a huge trauma. It's also going to raise a lot of questions and suspicions in Turkey about what the motivations are, what could be behind -- who could be behind it, but who could be behind the actual perpetrators?There will be a tendency to blame foreign powers or build conspiracy theories around this attack that has to do with the rise of Turkey's defense industry and perhaps the peace process that it is entertaining with the Kurds.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. This has been almost out of the blue. Turkey's leading coalition member, ultranationalist Devlet Bahceli, has started talking about a peace process with the PKK, the major separatist groups that has been waging a war on Turkey and -- for the past 40 years, and in fact, he started talking about having Abdullah Ocalan, the imprisoned leader of PKK, reach out to the organization for disarmament. This is something that the government and government media has supported. It's clearly something that didn't just appear in his head. It's something that the government has been working on, trying to resuscitate the peace process that it had with the Kurds, and which ended in 2015. It is a major, major story that impacts Turkey's relations with its NATO partners, Turkey's positioning in Syria and Iraq.So, just as the Turkish public is discussing the idea of a major new peace deal with the Kurds, this attack comes, and I think it's hard for people to make sense of why and whether this is a response from the PKK as effectively a no to an Olive Branch, or if there is someone else behind. Don't forget that Turkish public is being very suspicious of Western intentions as Turkey's relations with its NATO partners is up and down. Turkey's relations with Israel is obviously at an all- time low because of Gaza. And of course, when you look at polling data inside Turkey, the Turkish public pretty much feels that everyone is a -- potentially a threat to Turkey, whether it's Russia or United States, NATO allies, partners, regional power. So, there will be a lot of theories and a lot of confusion until we know who has actually planned this and carried it on.",

He not only talked to The New York Times, where he described that Donald Trump was a fascist, but he also talked to The Atlantic where he argued and kind of recounted a conversation about where Donald Trump had argued he wishes he had generals like Hitler did back in World War II. Here is what Trump campaign Steven Cheung told me when I asked him to respond to this. He said quote -- he said \"Kelly had totally beclowned himself with these debunked stories he has fabricated because he failed to serve his President well while working as Chief of Staff and currently suffers from a debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome.\" So, clearly, they are pushing back very heavily on these comments. But, again, it's not just Democrats and the Harris campaign that are really trying to warn about what Donald Trump would be like as a leader. I think you're hearing a lot of his former advisors and aides and administration officials weigh in in this final 11th hour stretch to kind of argue that Trump does not, is not, and should not be back in the White House come November 5th.

We saw today that the Israeli military issued a pretty sweeping evacuation order for the center of the city of Tyre. They've hit this city before, but this is the first time that they've issued such a sweeping evacuation order and that it has come in the center of what is really a historic city.This evacuation order came right in between two UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and it is, of course, forcing the displacement of more people. The majority of the people in this city had already evacuated, according to local officials, but tens of thousands were still there and were likely impacted by this order. We saw shortly after those evacuation orders were issued, very large plumes of smoke as the Israeli military hit the center of this city. We are also watching the impact on civilians in Lebanon in other ways, including on hospitals. According to local officials, more than two dozen hospitals have been impacted by Israeli strikes over the course of the last few weeks, and five hospitals are now out of service as a result of Israeli military strikes inside of Lebanon. We've also seen overnight strikes in other parts of Lebanon as well, as the Israeli military tries to not only dismantle Hezbollah's military infrastructure in Lebanon, but also as they are clearly trying to drive a wedge between Hezbollah and the rest of Lebanese society.

Now, this afternoon, President Putin has also met with the Iranian President, the new Iranian President, and we saw a lot of sort of politics coming through, Pezeshkian talking explicitly, saying that they need to disrupt the West global domination.So, I think you can see overall that this grouping that started some 15 years ago as sort of a Goldman Sachs founded idea of fast growing economies that were eventually going to dominate is now increasingly political.",

Mike Jeffries has been released on a $10 million bond after being charged with 16 federal counts of sex trafficking and international prostitution.

Now, we've been in touch with his attorney, who said that they'll save their defense for the courtroom and they won't be saying anything in the media.As far as the indictment goes, a lot of disturbing details were unsealed yesterday. As we've said, it's a 16 count indictment with charges stemming from sex trafficking and interstate prostitution. And this was a very sophisticated scheme. And what they did was they went out to search for vulnerable men who wanted to actually be in the fashion industry, an industry that's notorious for being very tough to break into, and they dangled in front of them the possibility of various opportunities to get into that industry, and in return, they expected sexual favors. But, it went way worse than that. Those vulnerable men ended up becoming the center piece of a lot of these sex events that would happen in various major cities across the world. And at those sex events, they were required to either wear costumes or perform sexual acts, and in some cases, even take drugs where it would range anywhere from muscle relaxers all the way to drugs that were supposed to help them perform sexually. Now, prosecutors in New York outlined just exactly how much evidence they had. They detailed some of the mountain of evidence that they had. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BREON PEACE, U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK: We have substantial evidence. We have travel records. We have financial records. We have testimony of victims and other witnesses. So, we think we have a lot of evidence that corroborates the charges in this case. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They say these fresh slivered onions are a likely culprit, but they haven't ruled out the beef patties. Those investigations are continuing. McDonald's says it has pulled those out of the stores in affected states. Here is what they told the Today show this morning about whether it's safe to eat in their stores.
