As wars around the world rage on, from the Middle East to Ukraine, the fear of nuclear escalation has increased. There are more than 12,000 nuclear warheads across the globe, according to a Swedish research institute for peace. And Vladimir Putin has repeatedly threatened the use of Russia`s nuclear weapons since the invasion of Ukraine. Even Japan`s neighbor, North Korea, is rapidly developing its own nuclear arsenal. The Norwegian Nobel Committee praised Nihon Hidankyo`s efforts to, quote, \"achieve a world free of nuclear weapons.\" The group represents some of the last living reminders of the damages nuclear weapons can inflict on people. Next year marks 80 years since the atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. And this year`s winner is a stark reminder to the world about the dangers of escalating conflicts.
