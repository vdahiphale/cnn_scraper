Jean Carroll. They're just looking at damages from a defamatory statement that Trump made in 2019, much more narrow, right, focus for the jury. But now E. Jean Carroll's lawyers, they are wrapping up their case. They are introducing a few additional exhibits, mostly things we have seen before, a deposition that Trump sat for where he famously confused E. Jean Carroll and his ex-wife, Marla Maples, as well as a sort of a press statement -- I won't call it a press conference, because I was there and he did not take questions -- last week, where he attacked the judge, he attacked E.

He's limited to talking about how she was damaged from this, which really isn't something he can say that much about. So I think it's going to go badly.

This is a new and untested method of execution that his attorneys claim could cause excessive pain or even a torturous death.

For two of those hours, they were jabbing him, trying to access a vein. He believed that any minute he was going to die. At one point, they put him in a stress position, where they raised the gurney, so he was vertical with his arm spread, so they could jab the needle into his neck. And they did not succeed in killing him, but he was traumatized. Since that time, we have been arguing that the state doesn't have the competency to carry out these executions. They switched the method. And now they're saying they have the skill to carry out a method that's untested and never been used before. That's the essential argument. Yes, he has also been vomiting persistently for the last several days. It is a symptom of the trauma. If you vomit with a sealed mask on, the experts have testified you will asphyxiate.

They allowed Alabama to proceed in Mr. Smith's case before, and Alabama could not complete the execution constitutionally. They allowed this to happen in Alan Miller's case, and it didn't work. At some point, the court has to stop trusting a state that has repeatedly failed to carry out these executions. And I think the court has something added in this case, which we need to keep in mind, which is that the jury in the case that heard the evidence believed that Mr. Smith should not be subject to the death penalty. They returned a verdict of life, and it's only because Alabama allows its elected judges to override verdicts of life that Mr. Smith is even facing execution.
