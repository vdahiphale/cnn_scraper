And tributes for Hamlin continue to pour in. That's happening under way right now. And it happened before the game -- the Bills, their fans, loudly showing their support as Hamlin continues to recuperate. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He says \"The love has been overwhelming, but I'm thankful for every single person that prayed for me and reached out. We brung (SIC) the world back together behind this.

And then, before the game even started earlier this morning, Damar posted again on social media, sharing a video as well as a message. There's a song playing behind that video, and the name of that song is called \"Count Your Blessings\" it's by a gospel choir. And the message he says is -- you can hear some of that song. \"Take a look and see what God has done.\" And Damar writes, \"It's game day.

President Biden will be landing in El Paso, Texas for his first visit to the southern border since becoming president. And this comes as his administration is under fire from Republicans and some Democrats over the growing migrant crisis along the U.S./Mexican border. El Paso has seen record levels of migrants and asylum seekers in December, hoping a Trump era law blocking border crossings would be lifting -- lifted, rather. And we've got team coverage of the president's visit. Arlette Saenz is at the White House. Rosa Flores is in El Paso. Rosa, let's begin with you. What do we know about the president's visit?",

According to DHS, those numbers have dropped significantly to about 700.

Trying to navigate this issue that really has no immediate solution at hand.Now, the president has been facing pressure from both sides. And he and his team had really been resisting calls for quite some time to have him visit the border. Now ultimately, they have decided to go ahead and do that today. Officially, White House say -- officials say that they're doing it en route to Mexico as he is set to speak about migration issues there with the country's president. But also, aides scheduled this trip as they were aware that not visiting the border increasingly has become a political liability for the president. Now much of this trip has been constructed to try to show that he's paying attention to the issue. White House officials say that he will be visiting one of the busiest ports of entry in El Paso, as well as meeting with people at a migrant services center to talk about those people who have been working with migrants as they have been coming to the United States. But what's unclear is whether this visit will really have any concrete outcomes and results when it comes to border security policy. Now, the president is also facing challenges when it comes to the policy itself. He has argued that comprehensive immigration reform is needed to solve some of these migration issues but then he's also rolled out some policies that have now placed him at odds with members of his own party, and have that run counter to some of his campaign promises. But simply put, this is a very challenging issue that has confronted both Republicans and Democratic presidents, and so far the president has struggled at times to really present a clear solution to the crisis at hand, Fred.",

It seems to be at this point a situation where there were so many people that they were able to outnumber the police that were there. And we are getting reports that people were able to get all the way into the congressional building and that the few public employees that were there were being threatened if they tried to stop those people from getting in there. We're looking at these images coming to us from Brasilia right now. What's going on? Well, the congress is not in session. So there aren't any members of congress that are presently in danger. The president of Brazil, the current president, the new president, Luiz Inacio Lula Da Silva is in Sao Paulo state, so he's not anywhere near this place. But we also understand, Fred, and this is also very concerning, that protesters have also breached the building of Brazil's supreme court, so it's not only the congressional building but also the supreme court. Meanwhile, the former president, the man that these protesters are supporting, is here in the United States, Fred, in Florida. He left the country, as a matter of fact, before his successor took office. And he is in Florida right now.

What opportunities might we have pursued different than what we pursue now. Might we be further along in our generational goals? (END VIDEOTAPE) ROMERO (on camera): And, unfortunately, Rosewood is not a unique event. We saw these acts of racial terror against Black communities specifically when you look at the time period of 1917 to 1923. 1919, that summer is coined \"Red Summer\" because all of the bloodshed that happened during that summer. At least 25 cities in the Deep South and in the north and the Midwest from Florida to Chicago saw angry white mobs attacking Black communities, burning down their homes and businesses, lynching people there as well. And, Fred, that's a big part of the reason why there's a renewed conversation about reparations.

And then the other thing is this hyper-arousal, this edginess. It can look different again but we might be on edge, irritable, lashing out, very tearful.
