In different parts of the city, I can see them rising up in the sky, just filling up this section of Luanda from the buildings around, from the harbor, from the promenade surrounding this section of the city, way more impressive in the distance than was closest to me, but no doubt a lot of celebration. And we heard one of the traditions in Angola is for you to embrace your family at midnight. They wear white to celebrate newness, to celebrate purity, and they embrace family. The kids go to party. Well, the younger people go to party. And that's what about to happen now that it's midnight in Angola. Oh, there it is, the view over the South Atlantic Ocean with the fireworks lighting up the sky. Spectacular with the city lights in the back and the fireworks. And so everybody around here, the crowd is surging closer to the water so they have a good view of it -- at midnight for the fireworks. These posts are going to be all over Instagram, all over TikTok, all over Facebook and X. I'm sure everybody's feed is just going to be flooded with this shot of the fireworks, even if it doesn't look that great on the phone, but everyone does it. Whatever culture, everyone celebrated New Year. When you look on your phone right now on your feed, you'll see lots of fireworks pictures. Some are grainy, some are great. They're really great, but it's still an amazing moment because it's one of the most exciting things that you end an old year and get to start a new year. And if you're lucky, it's somewhere beautiful like this with the fireworks lighting up the water and lighting up the sky and the celebration around, just exceptional. And that is a view from Angola. Let me try and get in a shot on the -- behind me, and I can explain a little bit of where we are with the fireworks over the water here in Angola, and more coming up from different parts of the city.
