It has been almost exactly one week since that attack, and there is a sense here in these early morning hours that Israel is preparing to strike back with the type of force we haven't yet seen.This is video of airstrikes along the Gaza strip that we received just moments ago. The country's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu said today that the near constant airstrikes on Gaza are \"only the beginning.\" We've already seen incursions into Gaza today and more on that in a moment. So what is next based on the artillery and troop massing at the border would be a significant ground invasion. President Biden today was asked what concerned him most about that possible invasion? He had one word, death. We do not know the timing of any such invasion or whether a final decision has been made. We do know that today, Israel dropped leaflets across Northern Gaza. They read in part: \"For your safety, you should not return home until further notice from the IDF.\" As part of a warning, Israel announced giving them more than 1.1 million civilians in the northern part of Gaza, a 24-hour period to evacuate. That window was to end in about four hours from now. Scenes like this were common in Gaza today, civilians trying to get out, trying to escape, several evacuees were seen loading a car with a dead body. When asked why? They responded, we don't know where to bury our dead. This is a map of the region, the area of evacuation is highlighted in red toward the top center of the map. Those leaflets that I mentioned said civilians need to head south of the river, you see marked there, Wadi Gaza, you can also see the Rafah Crossing at the southern end of Gaza bordering into Egypt. That crossing is closed for Gazan civilians. The US has pressed Israel and Egypt to keep the crossing open to aid the evacuation of among others, the 500 to 600 Palestinian-Americans estimated to be in Gaza. However, sources tell CNN, it is not clear if that crossing is fully functional, following multiple Israeli airstrikes in the vicinity earlier this week. A top White House official today, John Kirby called the evacuation \"a tall order.\" Making the effort even more complicated, Hamas has called on Gaza residents to ignore it, to not evacuate. A Hamas spokesman urged Palestinians to \"remain steadfast\" in their words and that \"the only direction we are migrating is back to our rightful land.\" There was a new threat from the north of Israel today as the country traded fire with Iranian-backed Hezbollah based in Lebanon to the north, and in the West Bank, the Health Ministry says that eight Palestinians were shot dead by Israeli forces during protests in support of Gaza. This was the scene in Baghdad, Iraq today where hundreds of thousands are estimated to have protested the Israeli airstrikes. In a symbol of both US diplomacy and military might, both the secretaries of State and Defense were in the region today, Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Arab leaders and pressed the case to minimize civilian casualties. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin meanwhile, declared the United States' unwavering support for Israel. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But that seems to indicate that there are ground level troops close to the border with Gaza. We know that there was that incursion over the past 24 hours. The IDF saying they went in, they were trying to get again Hamas leaders, they're trying to get information about hostages, a limited incursion, a small incursion, but nevertheless, the first time that they've gone back into Gaza, since this past weekend. So, you know, again, it fits the picture of the tempo, just picking up and even so, you know, we had a salvo of rockets coming out of Gaza from here, two hours ago, intercepted by Iron Dome, and from my perspective, that was perhaps the biggest salvo we've had in a couple of days. So Hamas taking -- there was a pause in the missile strikes, they took that 20 minute pause, fired some rockets out. So, they are still there. They're still active -- Anderson.",

And in a way, he gives himself more time to solve it by saying that this is going to take some time. The indications from military analysts here is that incursions would be relatively short, and in part that is because of that difficulty of working in a highly populated civilian environment with a potential for high civilian casualties. The standards that Israel and its allies set for it in not causing additional casualties and the pressure from the international community and from the UN agencies as well working inside Gaza, you know, who are giving a very, very dire assessment of the situation there. The medical system close to collapse, huge numbers of people 400,000 people displaced from their homes already. Some hospitals are running out of the ability to treat people, no new medical supplies coming in. So against that backdrop, it's more likely to be limited incursions that can have limited results, and therefore the whole thing, the process would take longer.",

Are you going to kind of create a tent city in the Sinai Peninsula for potentially more than a million people?So, a lot of details to be ironed out. And meanwhile, it's the people in Northern Gaza specifically, today, who have been suffering most acutely. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WARD (voice over):   They grab whatever they can and set off, many of them on foot with no set destination. After six straight days of relentless bombardment, Palestinians in Northern Gaza woke up to leaflets from Israel's military, ordering them to move to the south of the densely populated enclave. The deadline given to the UN was 24 hours. But there is nowhere for them to go. Efforts to open a humanitarian corridor through Egypt have so far been fruitless, and shelters are completely overwhelmed. The head of the UN's Palestinian refugee agency called the order \"horrendous\" and said the enclave was rapidly becoming a hellhole. The streets of many neighborhoods are already ghost towns, hollowed out by ferocious strikes, those who remain, alone with their grief.   (ABU HASSAN speaking in foreign language.) WARD (voice over):   'My sons, my daughters, my neighbors are all gone,\" resident Abu Hassan (ph) says. \"I only have one message to the Arab and Islamic world, have mercy on us. For God's sakes, there is nothing left.\" In several cities across the world today, there were protests in support of Gaza, but the drumbeat of an invasion is growing ever louder here. And the price that Gaza civilians are paying for Hamas' bloody attacks is already so high. At the Shifa Hospital yesterday, some of the youngest victims lined the hallways on a stretcher, on the floor of the hospital, a young girl pants with fear. \"You're a good girl. Praise God, you're here,\" the man tells her. \"Don't cry, my dear.\" \"Everyone is dead,\" she says. \"There's only a few left.\" In another bed, a young boy lies heavily wounded, reassuring his father: \"Don't be scared. Don't be scared, dad,\" he says. \"I am fine.\" But with no promise of safe refuge, fear is the only sane reaction. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And then, finally, Anderson, right before the attack, the day before on October 6th, there was an Israeli report that was circulated among U.S. officials that indicated that there was some unusual behavior by Hamas. That was passed on from the Israelis to U.S. officials. But none of these three were all that out of the norm, and they certainly didn't speak to the horrors that we saw unfold.

At the top of the list is the notion of how exactly are they going to screen individuals to know whether they are civilians or whether they are combatants, terrorists perhaps as well. And, secondly, Egypt is also concerned about having a massive flow of refugees, a million people, perhaps flowing into their country. So, we do know that that is an ongoing discussion that U.S. officials are having. And it's also important not to lose sight of the fact that Egyptian officials are also key in this discussion beyond just the Israelis. Beyond that we know that Israel has given folks in Northern Gaza 24 hours to evacuate to the south. And for now, that seems to be the focus. As the borders of Gaza remain closed, people are just being told to go further and further south. But, really, there's not much place to go. Anderson?",

General Marks, as we reported earlier, the IDF announced today that it had made local raids over the past. several or the past day, I should say, in the Gaza Strip using infantry armed forces in an effort to, quote, eliminate the threat of terrorists and weapons in the area and locate hostages. Talk to me about what these raids tell you about Israel's plan. I mean, does this sort of probing, gaining intelligence softening up areas before a ground invasion? MAJ. GEN. JAMES SPIDER MARKS (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  It provides an opportunity to expand upon, you know, confirm or deny intelligence. That's one of the, what I would say, downstream benefits of doing this. But this operation was conducted primarily because I can tell you that probably was based on a high level of confidence on the intelligence that they had on where hostages might be. And that becomes very perishable. That's targetable intelligence. And so the Israelis conducted these raids, hoping they might be able to receive, might be able to get their hands on some hostages and bring them back. As a result of that, you certainly are going to expand and increase your intelligence collection. It's not necessarily a direct harbinger for a ground operation, but it can be used that way.",

You want to try to get as deep as you can, as quickly as you can. And then what you have is this labyrinth, this internecine set of these tunnels, which will be incredibly difficult to clear. Israel is very much aware of that. They've done this in the past. The key is what objectives are you going to establish and when do you determine that you've met those objectives.

You can hear the panic in their voices asking what's going on. Are there Israeli soldiers nearby? We aren't going to show you what happened next. Cohen says Hamas gunmen repeatedly toss grenades into the shelter. People inside were blown apart. It's one of the most gruesome videos we've ever seen. This is some of the aftermath. Noam Cohen survived hiding under body parts. That's him terrified but alive. We found the shelter in the town of Alamein (ph) yesterday evening. Someone had put a curtain up over the doorway, but nothing could hide the smell as you enter. My cameraman, Neil Hallsworth, who's experienced a lot of war, began to retch and had to step outside. There's bloody hand prints on the wall. There's blood smeared on the walls. See, probably these are either bullet holes or from the grenades that were thrown in here. Body parts have already been collected from here, but blood soaks clothes and shoes remain. This looks to be a bloody handprint The shelter is no more than 15 feet long, maybe 5.5, 6 feet wide.
