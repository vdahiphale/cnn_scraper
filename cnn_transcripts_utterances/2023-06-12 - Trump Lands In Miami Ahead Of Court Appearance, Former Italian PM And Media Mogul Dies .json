He made his initial fortune as a property developer back in the 1960s. He then diversified into television and created his family's holding company, Fininvest and went on to create Mediaset, Italy's biggest media empire. The company is now part of Media for Europe. Fininvest also, and the football club AC Milan, as you heard in that piece there. Well, Berlusconi never publicly named there, but his daughter Marina is considered to be the most likely to take over. She is his oldest child, and the chair of Fininvest. And Barbie Nadeau joins me now from Rome. And Barbie, I mean, you said there in your piece, you know, he is flamboyant and colorful, but also a very divisive character. How is he being remembered across Italy today?",

But I think you can't dispute, love him or hate him, he was very, very important in post-war Italy. You know, this is the longest serving prime minister after World War Two and that, you know, made its mark, it really did. And if you look at the media landscape in this country, the private media is almost entirely because of Silvio Berlusconi.

So it is going to remain to be seen what happens to that party if it just disappears without him or if someone takes over. There is also a lot of talk that Marina Berlusconi may very well enter into politics. This is something she wouldn't talk about while her father was still alive, but she is the favorite daughter. She will probably as we mentioned, you know, take over his business enterprise. A lot of people are wondering if she is also going to take -- fill his political shoes as well.

The settlement amount is subject to court approval.\" Epstein was a JPMorgan client from 1998 to 2013. Now these suits alleged people at Chase knew about the sex trafficking allegations against Epstein, but still did business with him. In his deposition, Dimon acknowledged that he is now aware that some JPMorgan employees knew Epstein was charged with sex crimes involving cash, but he did not know at the time, and he said he never met Epstein or ever spoke with him. The settlement does not resolve a suit against JPMorgan from the US Virgin Islands, nor does it resolve JPMorgan's suit against a former executive, Jes Staley. JPMorgan sued Staley, a former banker there and a known friend of Epstein, alleging he is to blame for the bank's 15-year relationship with Epstein. Staley has denied all wrongdoing.

At the moment, the Ukrainians have got slightly the upper hand in some incremental gains, but it is very early stages.

They have the manpower, they say, but what they need is the equipment and right at the top of their list, of course, is the F-16 fighter aircraft without which many Ukrainians quietly predict that they are very, very substantially hampered in this counteroffensive.",
