The city issued a statement saying that its police department did indeed become involved in a \"alleged sexual assault involving Pete Hegseth. The city says that it dates back to the early morning hours of October 8th, 2017, and that its police department became involved with an incident that happened at the Hyatt Regency, and that its officers became involved four days after this date, after a complaint was made about October 8th.Now, take a look at this Facebook post. It comes from the California Federation of Republican Women. You see there that Hegseth is standing at a podium. He was a speaker at their conference at around this time, according to these Facebook photos. The city says that while it is not specifically identifying Hegseth as an alleged assailant, it does say that he was involved. There is also an unnamed victim and an injury. An injury described as \"contusions to right thigh.\" The city says it would not be releasing a full police report, and a check of the county court showed that Hegseth has not been charged in any criminal case since 2017, up until today. We did reach out to Hegseth's lawyer who says that yes, an allegation was made, but no charges were filed. And Trump's spokesperson, when asked by CNN to respond to all of this, says that Hegseth has vigorously denied any and all accusations, and \"we look forward to his confirmation.\" Amara, Victor?",

Now, you know, the House Speaker in an extraordinary move trying to intervene and prevent the House Ethics Committee from sharing its investigation with the Senate. I've got to think that is going to see the light of day somehow. But it is a pattern, you know, where this is not seen as disqualifying these kinds of allegations, certainly in the -- in the Trump selection process. And look, in the Republican coalition, there are a lot of voters, you know, particularly male voters who believe that, you know, men are facing unfair allegations. Don't forget when Brett Kavanaugh faced his allegation, what do Donald Trump say? He said, this is a very dangerous time in America for men. That was his response to Christine Blasey Ford.

And if he is confirmed, I think you would see much more pressure in this Trump Administration than you saw in the first to roll back access to mifepristone which is under the jurisdiction of the FDA, which would, of course, be under his authority. But it does, I think, introduce a new wrinkle into the debate where Republican senators might find it easier to oppose him on those grounds than on the question of what he would mean to vaccines. Either way, he doesn't have to repeal in any way or undermine -- he doesn't have to repeal a state vaccine mandate to undermine it. The CDC, which, again, would be under his control, reported last year that the number of parents opting out of vaccines is now at an all-time high, three percent of the public school parent -- student parents. At five percent, herd immunity starts to fail. So, the parents who are complying with the mandates, who support the mandates, who believe they protect their kids, would nonetheless be in a risky situation. And it's not hard to imagine that RFK Jr., whether at HHS or in the White House, through public fearmongering, could drive down that number of compliance into the danger zone.",

In governors' races in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, Senate races in places like Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia, by focusing voters on other issues. And what you saw a clear pattern in 2022 was that a surprisingly large percentage of voters in those swing states who are unhappy with the economy voted for Democrats anyway, because of issues like abortion, democracy, or that they view the Republican, the Trump- alive Republican alternatives as to extreme. That gave Democrats hope. They could do the same thing in '24. There was no question Trump was going to run better in the popular vote. I mean, there's no -- there's no precedent for a president's party not suffering losses when you have as much discontent as we saw in '24. But they thought they could quarantine his swing states again. It didn't work. Voters are dissatisfied with the economy, voted for Trump in much higher numbers when they voted in '22.
