In the doorway, Pargas can be seen talking to the Texas Ranger Christopher Ryan Kindell who, as CNN has previously reported, is currently suspended and under investigation for failing to organize a response that day. But Pargas doesn't appear to tell him about the 911 information he received. CNN has learned from sources familiar with the investigation that a number of law enforcement officials on scene, including high-ranking officers with the Texas Department of Public Safety, say they did not know about the 911 call. A few minutes later, at 12:20 p.m., Pargas can be seen walking away from the school -- away from the hallway where dozens of officers from several law enforcement agencies remain -- debating, at times, confused and seemingly uncertain about what to do. They wouldn't breach the classroom for another 30 minutes. CNN analysis of a new never-before-made public angle of the hallway security camera shows that Pargas never steps foot back inside this hallway. In interviews with investigators obtained by CNN, Pargas says he didn't believe he was in charge and his officers from the Uvalde city police were there only to assist the school police until the Texas Department of Public Safety took over. The Texas Department of Public Safety, which placed seven of its officers who were at the scene under further investigation, labeled Uvalde school police chief Pete Arrendondo as the on-scene commander. Arrendondo, who was fired in August, maintains he wasn't in charge either. CNN reached Pargas by phone. He said, quote, \"He would love to defend himself but he's been told not to speak to the media.\" Adding, quote, \"It's not that we're afraid because there's nothing to be afraid of. We did what we could but the thing is that we've been told that we can't.\" In interviews with Texas Rangers, he was asked why officers didn't force their way into the classroom sooner as active shooter training clearly indicates.",

They conducted their investigation. And so, after that, the city put him on paid leave, which is where he remains. He's still being paid though he's not serving the Uvalde Police Department.Look, there are people, Don, inside the city, inside the police department that feel he needs to go and that it's just a matter of time. There is a process underway. The locals are still doing their investigation. So we'll see what his status is. Also, interestingly enough, Don, he is an elected official. He was just reelected as a county commissioner. Yesterday, before we aired this story, I had some time to talk with the families about this before we went ahead and published this story just to give them a heads up, of course. And everything that we do, we always include the families. And when I started telling them about this story -- certainly, they were just quiet. And they are just continuing to be upset because the only way that they're learning information is through us -- by us calling them, by us airing these stories. By us digging and getting this information. Because still, we are almost at the 6-month mark. Next week, Thanksgiving Day, will mark the 6-month period since this happened and the families have still not gotten a full briefing from law enforcement officials on exactly everything that happened here. And guys, every time we dig in we find more and more and more. There are so many layers of this that we're not looking at those moments of the breach and what happened.

JUANA SUMMERS, HOST, NPR \"ALL THINGS CONSIDERED\":  That's absolutely right. It is still partially a memoir. She peels back the layers much like she does in her acclaimed book \"Becoming,\" which came out back in 2018. But she told me that she intentionally wanted this book to be more practical. To offer people a guidebook -- a roadmap of sorts to chart a path out during difficult times. She told me that she wrote this book largely in isolation during the pandemic with only a close group of people by her side who were giving input. And it gave her a lot of time to look inward and think about what type of tools she could offer to the type of people across the country and around the world who constantly are writing her and asking her for advice on how to solve some of the biggest problems that they're experiencing in their lives.",
