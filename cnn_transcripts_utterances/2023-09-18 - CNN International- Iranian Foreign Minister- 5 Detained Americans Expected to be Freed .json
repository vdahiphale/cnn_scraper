Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesperson says five Americans who had been imprisoned in Iran are expected to be released today as part of a wider U.S. Iran deal. He spoke at a news conference which was shown on state affiliated Press TV a short while ago. The U.S. government has designated all five Americans as being wrongfully detained. Joining me now, CNN International diplomatic editor Nic Robertson. It's a very complex deal, isn't it, Nic?",

      "sentences": "It is a very complex deal and it seems to be open to a variety of interpretations that certainly reflects what we've heard from the Iranian president over the past week. The broad details have been out there in the public domain as they've been debated. But what we're hearing from the Iranian Foreign Minister today is, he says, we would hopefully today see access to our money.And what he's referring to there is $6 billion of frozen Iranian accounts that are being currently under the control of South Korea. And that money would arrive in an account. Now the Foreign Minister says in a regional state. But we understand that account, that new account that Iran would have access to would be in Qatar. But the implications are here that this expected arrangement that would allow for these five Americans being held and one of them has been held in jail since October 2015, so almost eight years, that would expect to allow them to be free and this money frozen assets, if you will, would be put in an account that Iran would not have free and complete access to. There would be controls over that account. The account would be for Iran to use for humanitarian goods, medicines, food, for the population, that sort of thing. And this is what brought the contention from Iran's president last week, speaking about it, saying that Iran essentially in essence would have all access to that account. The Iranians are saying that they expect five Iranian prisoners to be released from U.S. jail as well. So, the headline from the from the foreign minister, the Iranians, now expecting that money to end up in the account, apparently in Qatar, that they would therefore have controlled access to. Just setting out some of the sort of language around what the process has been happening over the past week. And the United States wrote a waiver -- the White House wrote a waiver allowing access to these accounts a week ago today. Let's listen to John Kirby, National security spokesman in the United States, who laid out some of the framework. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

There's not going to be sanctions relief. There's no U.S. taxpayer dollars that are going to be applied to getting these Americans home. And this $6 billion without getting into the details of the negotiations, I think there's a little confusion about what this account is all about.This is part of an of a system of accounts that was set up in the previous administration that allowed some countries to import Iranian goods, non sanctionable goods, and that the Iranians could pull on those accounts, those payments, through the through a special system only used for humanitarian purposes. And that's what we're talking about here. It's a pre-existing account that was set up in the previous administration, which they allowed other countries to set up that has not been made accessible to the Iranians. They'd be able to have some access to it, but only for humanitarian purposes. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So it is a contentious issue.But I think if we look more broadly beyond the release of prisoners from Iran that Iran has detained on accusations -- some of these five have essentially been detained on accusations, been convicted on accusations alleged of espionage, of working with foreign governments. The idea that Iran gets a financial reward for better international good behavior goes beyond that. I mean, we could look at the recent situation, the rapprochement between Iran and Saudi Arabia that was brokered by China that's led to the Houthis in Yemen, who were being supplied with weapons and cruise missiles from Iran, abating their war with Saudi Arabia. So part of that deal sees better economic ties between Saudi Arabia and Iran in the future. Development, you know, business connections between the two countries. So I think you get the sense here more broadly that what Iran wants as a price to do what the international community has been asking it to do, whether it's sort of stop terrorist activities around the world or release people that they've wrongfully detained, it always seems to have a financial inducement -- Max.",

After that, he'll head to Washington to meet with U.S. President Joe Biden at the White House and with Congressional leaders on Capitol Hill. Mr. Zelenskyy is pushing for more support from allies, including long range missiles and artillery.Zelenskyy is also eager to show his U.S. allies that Ukraine's counteroffensive is making gains on the battlefield. On Sunday, Ukraine liberated a key village south of the city of Bakhmut. CNN investigative producer Katie Polglase joins us now. And this is really around the fact that there are U.S. politicians who think the progress isn't good enough and what they're spending on the war isn't going far enough. KATIE POLGLASE, CNN INVESTIGATIVE PRODUCER: You're absolutely right, Max. And that is one of the key things that President Zelenskyy is worried about. That while the Biden administration may be supportive of this funding for Ukraine, there may be those on the other side of the House that are not. And that is why he is also meeting with Senators at Capitol Hill to really explain why U.S. funding is so key. And we've been seeing a lot of announcements really recently about Ukraine recapturing areas as part of this counteroffensive. And part of that messaging is showing that they are making progress. And where the U.S. money is going. This money that they are putting in, this military equipment, this training, all of this is worth it, is what Zelenskyy wants to demonstrate. And we saw just this morning, there's been reports they've recaptured another village, Klishchiivka in the eastern area of the frontline. Then yesterday, last week even there was the recapturing of Andriivka, before that Robotyne. These areas aren't big.",

They are making progress and that what they really need is more weaponry, more ammunition, more support from the United States. And this is why we've been seeing all this referencing of long range weapons, long range missiles.Is that because particularly this kind of weaponry can get behind enemy lines. Target key areas of infrastructure strategy. Areas where Russia is supporting their war, not just on the frontline but repairing ships like they targeted last week in the Crimea. These areas are key for Russia's war effort. And what's Zelenskyy wants to show is that if they give them more weaponry, if they support them more, this counteroffensive may go faster. It may speed it up, and there may be a breakthrough. Which is what all of them want and what they desperately need, particularly as we now head into the winter months when the fighting will get even more challenging with the cold weather.",

They say that one team told us that they were able to recover more than 60 bodies since they got here. But right now, they are not able to do this anymore. This one team says they spotted the bodies of about 300 people. But the conditions are so challenging out there for them, they say that they don't have the right equipment to reach these really hard to reach areas. Coves where these bodies have ended up. Shallow waters where their boats can go and they just don't have the equipment and the expertise, the manpower to deal with a situation like this. And what they're telling us is while they did spot these bodies over the past couple of days, right now, those bodies have disintegrated into remains that they just cannot reach they cannot retrieve because of the health hazard. And this is absolutely devastating for the so many families, survivors here in Derna who he was speaking to who told us all they want is to find the bodies of their loved ones or their remains to give them a proper burial. This one international team we were speaking with earlier said that they have dealt with accidents in the past with migrant boats, capsizing. They have dealt with search and recovery operations where they've managed to pull dozens of bodies in the past. But never had they had to deal with a situation with something on this scale before where they're looking for hundreds and thousands of bodies. Jomana Karadsheh, CNN, Derna, Libya. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
