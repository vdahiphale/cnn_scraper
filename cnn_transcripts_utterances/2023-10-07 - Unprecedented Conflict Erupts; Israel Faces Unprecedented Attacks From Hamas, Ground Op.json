This follows just an unprecedented, historic attack on Israel, which authorities say has killed at least 300 people, wounded more than 1,500 others. Rockets rain down on Israeli cities as far away as Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, well north of Gaza. But this is the most alarming part.Hamas militants stage massive cross-border raids on Israeli communities in the south, as well as attacks from the sea and the air. Israel says some of its soldiers and a significant number of civilians have been captured by Hamas, taken back into Gaza as hostages. We do have to warn you that so many of these scenes are truly graphic. Video obtained by CNN shows what appear to be civilians killed, gunned down inside and just outside of their cars, this on a road near the border with Gaza. Another video obtained by Reuters shows a disabled tank with Hamas militants climbing aboard appear to be dragging out Israeli soldiers. Israeli forces are now retaliating with relentless airstrikes on Gaza, one of them, they're taking down an entire building. The Palestinian Health Ministry says at least 232 people have been killed in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is vowing to find Hamas militants wherever they are hiding, he says. He's warning the people of Gaza to leave Hamas strongholds there as Israel prepares bigger military strikes. He also says Hamas is responsible for the well-being of captives and that Israel will settle the score with anyone who harms those captives. (END VIDEO TAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: What happened today has never been seen in Israel, and we will make sure that does not happen again. The entire government is behind this decision. The IDF will immediately use all its strength to destroy Hamas's capabilities. We will destroy them, and we will take mighty vengeance for this black day that they have forced on the state of Israel and its citizens. (END VIDEO CLIP) CNN's Hadas Golds is live now in Jerusalem. And Hadas, I know we're getting information in bits and pieces as we proceed here.

We know tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of reservists have already been called up for duty. And part of the reason for that is not just because of the offensive on Gaza, it's because they are planning to have the military help protect and try to root out these militants and all these communities in southern Israel. In the last, and previously when there's been a conflict with Gaza and they've called up soldiers to fight, you know, it's not to have soldiers be stationed within Israeli towns. That's what's different about this.What's also interesting is in the last hour or so, the Israeli military, they have sent out a message in Arabic to citizens, to civilians in Gaza, telling them to leave certain areas to find safety in city centers. That's an indication of what may be to come from the Israeli military. No indication of a ground offensive just yet, but there's no question that they are preparing for that possibility, especially when you think about the number of Israelis that are likely to be in Gaza.",

Quite literally, you cannot fire out enough defensive rounds to intercept all of those missiles. And again, I think that's what we saw this evening.The 150-missile salvo that was fired towards Tel Aviv earlier this evening, some of those missiles got through, quite literally, Iron Dome, overwhelmed. And I think that's what we've seen again this evening, the numbers of salvos that came back-to-back to back seemed to create the impression that they were, you know, one salvo reduced Iron Dome's ammunition, another salvo on top, another salvo on top, try and get around the defense system that way.",

Well, these attacks, as we were saying, by land, sea, and air, they completely caught Israel off guard, leaving the nation now in shock, raising serious questions about exactly how this happened. Intelligence failures? Not just intelligence failures, but military failures, defense failures. I'm joined now by CNN global affairs analyst, Kimberly Dozier. One of my guests last hour, Avi Meyer, he called this Israel's 9-11.You also heard comparisons to Pearl Harbor, and the element of both, well, beyond just the carnage, right, you know, for civilians, mostly civilians here, is the surprise aspect of this, but also the fact that they didn't see it coming, right? With all the resources that Israel has pointed at Gaza, intelligence, military, and otherwise, they missed this. How is that possible?",

How were these militants communicating that they were able to plan such a complex, multilayered operation that attacked on, to use military language, on three vectors, air, land, and sea, and to have stocked up so much hardware to carry it out? That's one of the reasons we're likely to see at least raids, if not a full-blown ground incursion into Gaza, because the Israelis will want to capture and question some of these fighters to figure out how they missed this.It's possible that what Hamas did was they went old school, the same way Osama bin Laden for years avoided capture, was by going with written messages, human message mules carrying things from place to place to avoid Israel's saturation through drones in the air, its saturation of monitoring of the communications networks. So, all of that will be looked at later. But right now, I think those hostages inside Gaza are going to be the priority, figuring out how to get them out.",

There's a bit of rivalry between the intelligence services on both sides. So, there are certain areas where, yes, the U.S. would be watching the edges and the fringes, but they wouldn't be saturating it the way the Israelis are. So, there will be concern on the U.S. side, as there is concern right now inside Israel. What else might they have missed? But I have to say, when you look at newspapers, news sites from the Arab world, they're looking at this very differently.They remember many of the news headlines that we in the West haven't been paying so much attention to. Our focus has been on the war in Ukraine. There have been a number of Israeli security actions in the West Bank. And more recently, some incursions into the territory of the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which is in the old city of Jerusalem. And it shares space with a very holy site to Jews. Ultra-nationalist Israelis have physically raided that area. And two Middle East officials that I've been in contact with today brought that up. So, yes, they think what's happening to the Israelis is horrible. But the second thing I get from people is, but they had something like this coming. Now, that's an awful thing to say out loud. But that is the sentiment that I am picking up from the Arab world. SCIUTTO: Listen, not uncommon. I've heard similar things in the past. What we should be clear about here, though, is you have Hamas terrorists coming across the border and taking women and children and the elderly as hostages and others killing in their homes and on streets. This is a terror attack. This is a terrorist attack of immense proportions by a group that, of course, has not hesitated to do so, only been capable of doing so on a smaller scale to date. But the brazenness of this is just off the charts.",

There is concern within Israel, among those I've spoken to, friends who've had to dash for bomb shelters with their grandchildren and former officials, current officials, that this could only be the first step.Hezbollah in Lebanon, which has more than 100,000 missiles and rockets that can reach much of Israel, has warned if there is an Israeli ground incursion into Gaza, that they might also attack.  So what Israelis are worried about is facing attacks from all sides if, as they see it, allies of Iran decide to join Hamas, take up the call of Hamas militants and attack from all sides.",

That is no surprise to anyone.But for others, there is a little bit of surprise, I would imagine, from Prime Minister Netanyahu. And I say this specifically about Saudi Arabia. You'll remember just a couple of weeks ago, Jim, Prime Minister Netanyahu was literally standing in front of the U.N. Security Council saying, I am about to make peace with Saudi Arabia. This is going to be a major breakthrough in the region. I am on the path to peace. And now we're looking at the statement from Riyadh today, yes, calling for both sides to de-escalate, but then going on again to blame Israel in its treatment of the Palestinians. So, for critics of Prime Minister Netanyahu, they're going to point to not just his talks with Saudi Arabia, but really his relations with the region at large.

And I just I hope our fellow Americans can recognize how lucky we are to have countries bordering us, Canada and Mexico, that do not -- not only don't pose a threat to us but are our friends and allies. Israel and Israelis live like this all the time, Jim, as you well know. And what I'm seeing right now, I said, and I'll tell you what really saddens me. This is Iran and Hamas's reaction, their response to peace. So for anybody watching right now, if you really want to understand what's going on, they are objecting to the notion of the Abraham Accords. They're objecting to the notion of Saudi Arabia normalizing with Israel. This is their effort to create a massive disruption, a regional war, perhaps. They want Israel to respond with full force, which saddens me that I think will exactly happen. And it's going to be some dark days. But I don't think Israel has a choice, Jim.",

They are deeply aligned. They are committed equally to the destruction of Israel. They like to use proxies so that we find it sometimes difficult to find their fingerprints, if you will. We will find them. I suspect that, indeed, this is Iran-influenced, if not initiated, and just once again demonstrates how complicated, how difficult this is going to be. But I do want people, again, to pay attention to the fact that they are trying to prevent the very peace that for 50 years, 50 years, so many have lost their lives in pursuit of.And that we, many of us, Democrats and Republicans, in both the House, the Senate, the Biden administration, along with the Saudis and Israelis, so close to a historic regional peace that would, by the way, be a domino effect, perhaps through the Muslim world. That's exactly what they wanted to disrupt. We cannot let them do that, Jim. And there are going to be some tough days ahead, but I ask that we all be resolute in pushing for peace. And, by the way, also for Palestinians. I'm horrified by what is almost certain to ensue. Women, children, the innocents will be collateral damage in something that, of course, Israel has to protect its citizens, just as the United States of America would have to if missiles were raining on us from Canada or from Mexico. That is the sad truth. We have got to end this as quickly as we can and pursue peace, and that is my mission.",

The parties were close, it seemed, to a historic agreement between a normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia's statement tonight does not inspire a lot of confidence, given the way they reacted to this, with really not an explicit condemnation at all. Do you see this as, if not derailing, destroying that peace effort?",

The State Department says he spoke with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. This is a flurry of phone calls going on right now in and around the Middle East. Oren Liebermann joins me now from the Pentagon. We heard President Biden a short time ago as he was commenting on this promise all support to Israel. The U.S., of course, gives many billions of dollars in military support to Israel every year. So, what additional support might be in line in response to these attacks?",

      "sentences": "Jim, we can look at that from a few different perspectives. One is on the diplomatic front, where the U.S. will no doubt protect Israel at the United Nations from condemnation that is almost certainly coming as Israel ramps up its retaliation. Then there's also behind the scenes diplomatic efforts.As you point out, Secretary of State Antony Blinken is engaged with not only Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, but other leaders in the region. But it's difficult to see how any of those make any progress, given Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's promise of a prolonged campaign. And that is where the military steps in. The U.S. Defense Department has stockpiles of weapons that it keeps in Israel, reserves essentially that Israel can tap into. Now, that can be approved very quickly. It doesn't rely on Congress having to approve any sort of transfer. Biden himself can do that. And that would be in the short term here, as we see how this plays out. And that might involve something like precision guided munitions, which Israel uses for airstrikes. If there's a ground incursion, perhaps artillery ammunition as well as tank ammunition. So that would be one of the big steps. The longer question is, if this continues for weeks, if not longer than that, does it require congressional approval at that point? If so, how do you make Congress work so you can get through aid to Israel? Because they've clearly said this is a priority. Make it happen.",
