This afternoon, Biden looked at and sounded every bit what he did not look like last night, coherent, energized, different in almost every measurable way. And, yes, he did have a teleprompter, but if Americans were watching, they watched the Joe Biden that they saw at the State of the Union. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: I don't walk as easy as I used to. I don't speak as smoothly as I used to. I don't debate as well as I used to. But I know what I do know.

This is Democrats really reckoning with a decision and a deadline, basically a month before the convention to double down on Biden or to go with someone else. And they won't get to do that in private.The cover of TIME Magazine simply says, panic, with an image of a meandering Biden walking off the page, The New York Times Editorial Board tonight publishing this editorial, to serve his country, President Biden should leave the race. And now, the Biden White House was quick to say that they have been here before, quote, the last time Joe Biden lost The New York Times Editorial Board's endorsement, it turned out pretty well for him. But this is new, and this is different. A public push and pull between Democrats over the president's fitness pulling him out the door are the bros who worked with both Obama and Biden.

Congressman you know, if Democrats say that Donald Trump is a threat to democracy, why take a chance on a candidate who the American public has said time and time again they do not think is fit to run for president and be president another four years? REP. GREGORY MEEKS (D-NY): Because you look at the work that Joe Biden has done. You look at bills that we've passed. I've sat next to him. History is going to record Joe Biden as making NATO stronger than ever. You know, you just said, I'm on the foreign affairs committee. I look at -- he's got South Korea and Japan, two nations that never talked, people that he's bringing them together, just on the foreign services and the foreign affairs alone. You know, when he first got elected, individuals said, oh, aren't we glad that we are back Biden was there? And they said, yes, but for how long, because they know how bad Donald Trump is?

So, there could be states with different deadlines. There might have to be some litigation.The other thing is, remember, when people are voting, they're not voting for the president. They're voting for electors. In some states, the electors are pledged to have to vote for the candidate who is named. In other states, they would they were not so pledged. So, things get complicated.

It almost, you know, makes you wonder, I mean, is it really that you think she's so weak or is there a fear of what she is?BRYAN LANZA, FORMER DEPUTY COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, TRUMP 2016 CAMPAIGN: No. Listen, I think always highlighting her has been a good thing for the Republican Party, because they always felt that, you know, Biden sort of created this bizarre pick. It's got to be a woman. It's got to be a black woman. Sort of, he created his own barriers of what a vice president is and he stuck with her. And people felt that she was picked not because she was capable for the job but because she fit a certain demographic that Joe Biden needed at that particular moment.

In a 6-3 decision, the high court ruled that the Justice Department overstepped by charging some of them with obstruction. Now, there are more than 240 pending January 6th cases that have an obstruction charge.In addition to others, more than 50 people have been convicted and sentenced with only that obstruction charge. And of those people, 27 are currently behind bars. It's also worth noting that even though Trump was charged with obstruction related to his January 6th case, this decision will unlikely have an impact on that case. Joining me now is Pam Hemphill. She was part of the January 6th mob and she spent time in jail for what she did on that day. But we should note that she was not charged with obstruction. Pam, I wonder what is your reaction to the Supreme Court ruling? PAM HEMPHILL, SERVED 2 MONTHS IN PRISON FOR INVOLVEMENT IN JAN 6 RIOT: Well, I'm extremely disappointed, you know, with the riot that happened in Boise, Idaho, with them and Bundy. I went to the Capitol Police and I said, why weren't they arrested that day? And he said, because it's all political. And that's how I'm interpreting this right now, which is sad because the statute clearly says obstructs, influences, impends any official proceedings or attempts to do so. So, we know they attempted to do that. It's obvious. It's really a sad day.",
