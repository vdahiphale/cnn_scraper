As M.J. was reporting, if President Biden makes the decision to step aside, that decision is his alone. There is thoughts of a plan underway for what he would do. And the current thinking, according to our reporting is that he would throw his support behind Vice President Kamala Harris, who notably has been at his side all day long. They shared a lunch together today. He invited her to join that meeting of Democratic governors happening later this hour.So, one adviser tells me, quote, he's with her. Now, there have been many questions about what would happen, would there be an open convention fight? That is something that Democratic Party officials are trying to avoid, and, of course, she is the sitting vice president. So, the thinking goes, according to this contingency planning, is that President Biden would throw his support behind her, ask delegates to do the same, and then party leaders and former presidents and others would also do the same, supporting Vice President Harris. One senior adviser, Pamela, told me this, this is so telling. Who would stand up against our historic vice president to be our nominee for president? So, framing the stakes there, it would be difficult to potentially stop her from becoming the Democratic nominee. Again, this is all contingent on President Biden making a decision. And as we've heard from him, he has not yet done that. But aides say it would be malpractice to not discuss what would come next in their fight against Donald Trump. That, of course, is the point here. It is more than -- bigger than Joe Biden, Democratic advisers say, and they want to get on with it. Of course, we should point out it's the Biden- Harris campaign. So, she would also inherit the campaign war chest and infrastructure as well. Pamela?",

Governor, thanks for joining us just before this meeting is about to kick off, I want to get first your reaction to this new reporting that plans are underway for President Biden to immediately throw his support behind Harris and get his delegates to do the same if he were to make that decision to step aside. GOV. JOSH GREEN (D-HAWAII): Well, first of all thank you for having me and I will tell you this. This is the president's decision. He has earned our nomination through the process. So, whatever decision he makes is going to be his decision with his family and closest advisers, period. That's important to say. We believe that a Democrat should win the White House. That is absolutely. What the other Democratic governors feel. Of course, we're the president's strongest supporters. And I know everyone has gone through a bit of shock from the debate. It was a bad day, as the president shared. But I have to tell you, one of the larger questions has not been asked. And, you know, I'm a physician. I know that's one of the reasons you're having me on this conversation. It's one of the things we're talking to the president about, are you up to this? You have to compare the clinical concerns that we have. We have a president who was forgetful and had a terrible debate. That is correct. We also have serious concerns about the former president, President Trump's temperament. His narcissistic personality disorder is a problem, and it has been a problem for some time. So, the country has to assess what is safe for it, and I think that is also part of the dialogue. I appreciate you guys covering the (INAUDIBLE) but I think this is a question.",

But the Democrats that I talked to, super delegates, Democratic National Committee members, say there are two scenarios. It's all up to him. He has to decide for himself if he's going to step aside.But if he does it quickly, maybe there could be a kind of mini primary with five or six or seven, probably a lot of them would be governors, running. He would release his delegates, or he decides to just turn it over to Harris. And that's plan B. But so far, he seems to really be trying to stick as the nominee. But there's things that I'm watching for. Number one, do more elected Democratic officials come out and say he should step aside? We've only had a very few so far. And then what do the polls show?

I hear people saying, well, you know, he's going to have to make a decision, which is not a confidence-inspiring thing for Democrats to say about the Democratic president United States. Now, as it relates to Harris, my view is there's no possible way they can jump over Kamala Harris. I mean, they picked her. They wanted to pick the first black female vice president, and they made a strident argument at the time that she was highly qualified. So, to skip over her now and try to hand it off to some of these other politicians, these governors or whoever, there's no possible way the Democratic Party is going to do that.

And Donald Trump and his forces continue to attack the basic pillars of our democratic institutions all across the country. So, right now, President Biden is obviously hearing from a lot of people. He's about to meet with the governors. He's heard from members of Congress, as you've said, on all sides of the issue. And he obviously has a very heavy decision to make, but he won the delegates. And so he's in a situation where he gets to make that decision. But I do think that we don't have a lot of time for him to make that decision and we, you know, wish him Godspeed in his deliberations.

If Vice President Kamala Harris won the nomination, she would presumably be able to use Biden's campaign war chest because her name is on all the filings. But any other candidate may have to raise their own money.(END VIDEOTAPE) TODD (on camera): Now, what happens if President Biden, for some reason, leaves the race after the Democratic Convention? Experts say, in that unlikely event, the Democratic National Committee would convene and select the Democratic nominee for president on its own, after consulting with Democratic leadership in Congress and Democratic governors.

He was talking about setting up internment camps and using the Justice Department to prosecute his enemies, and purging the civil service and deploying federal force into blue states and cities over the objections of their mayors and governors.And at that moment, as we face that kind of crossroads about what the structure of American government and democracy will look like, the Democratic Party is melting down behind a nominee, who I think there is a broad consensus in the party that Biden cannot recover from what voters saw last week, that it is virtually impossible for him to unring the bell. But there remains enormous reluctance to express those doubts publicly or to pressure him in any way despite the stakes, which were only raised by that Supreme Court decision this week that functionally, you know, gave Trump a blank check and said it will be virtually impossible to hold him criminally liable if he is reelected almost no matter what he does, including the extreme scenarios Sotomayor talked about, such as assassinating a political rival.",

I want to ask you about what the White House is saying. It told our MJ Lee, the president Biden hasn't had any medical exam since February. Does it raise a red flag to you that he didn't get re-evaluated after the debate performance that really shocked so many of us seeing that for the first time? Does that raise a red flag that perhaps they had seen that before because they're not re-evaluating him? DR. JONATHAN REINER, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST: Sadly, it's not surprising to me that the president didn't have a formal evaluation since February. He has a comprehensive exam once a year but the presence physician sees him almost every day or basically every day. So he has a continuous evaluation. But what really surprising to me after really watching the precedent struggle mightily last week, that he didn't generate another evaluation of the president which suggests possibly that this is not new and that they've seen -- they've seen this before.",

And I'm wondering the White House is saying they're trying to explain this or write this off as he had a cold and he was jet-lagged. The jetlagged thing is new today from the White House.

So I really know what jet-lagged is like. That didn't look like -- like that with the president. It looked like something -- something else. Look, were not vetting are these candidates for the next four months? We're vetting these candidates for the next four years. And with great respect and with great sadness, it was hard to watch that debate and understand that the president could be -- shoulder -- he really shoulder the heavy burden of the presidency and deal with the issues of the United States for four years. And if that was just a one-off event, then great. If it represents a chronic problem, then we need to hear about that regardless, I think we need to get more data from both from the White House and from the Trump campaign about the health of their candidates.",
