Thank you so much, Carlos Suarez, for your reporting.John or Kate. KATE BOLDUAN, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  Scientists in Texas are on the brink of a breakthrough when it comes to artificial intelligence. They're training A.I. to essentially read your mind. Here's how it apparently works, because clearly, I understand it so well. The person's brain is scanned while listening to audio clips, then the A.I. bit of this will translate that scan into something of a transcript of what the person was thinking. Donie O'Sullivan met with the scientist behind this breakthrough. He is here now. So, it sounds like mind-reading, but I'm sure these scientists -- DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.",

Special Counsel Jack Smith who's looking into the Mar-a-Lago documents as well as situations surrounding the January 6th insurrection has made moves that appear to show the documents investigation could almost be over. With us now, CNN Legal Analyst and Former Federal Prosecutor Jennifer Rodgers, great to see you, counselor. I'm going to ask you to do something this challenging here.
