To start with, to folks who aren't necessarily familiar with the region, the location of where this attack happened, where this U.S. outpost is in Jordan, an ally of the U.S., can you explain the significance of it? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Sure, Phil, good morning to you. And in fact, one of the key things to look at is where exactly this occurred. And so this occurred right here in this area where -- in the greater Middle East where you see Israel on the West, Syria North, Jordan where it occurred, Iraq to the East, and Saudi Arabia to the South. So let's go into this a little bit closer. This is the tri point that Oren talked about, where Iraq, Jordan, and Syria come together in one -- one particular area. This base right here, Al Tanf, is a major U.S. facility that has been around since about 2016. And it was -- has been used to help with the -- what used to be called the Syrian Democratic Army. This was the force that was fighting against Assad, the president of Syria. It has also been used to fight against ISIS. The base right here, Tower 22. That is the base that serves as one of the logistical supply areas for the Al Tanf base and for other facilities in the region that the U.S. uses to help in the fight against ISIS and also to help train Jordanian, Iraqi and Syrian democratic forces.",

The key thing that you have here is that you want to make sure that you have some kind of an air defense system, which obviously failed in this particular case. But they had to use a drone to go after this, because they couldn't get into it from the ground.

The effect has been different because of the three personnel killed and the 34 injured personnel that we know of so far.But our forces have been attacked over 150 times since the start of the Gaza-Hamas war. The problem that we have in this particular area is the fact that the greater Middle East is really part of a plan by the Iranians to try to move all the U.S. forces out of here. And the reason they're attacking our forces is because they don't want us in this particular region. The fact they don't want us, of course, complicates things from a force protection standpoint for us. And in fact, one of the key things to note is all of these groups right here are possible perpetrators in this particular case. Kataib Hezbollah is one of the key ones, and that's been implicated in many of the other things that have happened in this area. In fact, we killed their leader back in 2020, so they would have reason to go after U.S. forces.",

But it's still not enough for some Republicans. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FOX (voice-over): A showdown on Capitol Hill as a bipartisan group of senators looks to pass an emerging border security plan during a presidential election year. SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): We do have a bipartisan deal. We're finishing the text right now. And the question is whether Republicans are going to listen to Donald Trump, who wants to preserve chaos at the border, because he thinks that it's a winning political issue for him. FOX (voice-over): One key factor to the proposed plan would be to allow the commander in chief to shut down the border between ports of entry when unlawful daily crossings average 4,000 over a one-week span.

Because they were getting ready to pass a very bad bill. And I'll tell you what, a bad bill is -- I'd rather have no bill than a bad bill. FOX (voice-over): Other components of the proposed plan include reforming the asylum system to resolve cases faster and expedite work permits. REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): This is a compromise. It's a negotiation, and that's what we're here to do. FOX (voice-over): The lead Senate Republican negotiator, Sen. James Lankford, is optimistic the plan can pass. Other Republicans are more skeptical. SEN. JAMES LANKFORD (R-OK): Do not have a vote count yet, because everybody's got to be able to read it, to be able to go through, but I do feel very positive about it. SEN. RICK SCOTT (R-FL): James is -- he's smart. He's hard-working. He knows the issue. He's on a suicide mission. The Democrats do not want to secure the border. FOX (voice-over): Over in the House, two articles of impeachment were released against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. First, charging him with willful and systemic refusal to comply with the law. And second, breach of public trust, accusing him of making false statements. The Department of Homeland Security calling the upcoming impeachment vote a farce. REP. MICHAEL MCCAUL (R-TX): Eight million encounters, 300 on the terror watch list, 200 million people dead now thanks to fentanyl poisoning that this one man is responsible for. I think that is a dereliction of duty. And, you know, we look to the founding fathers here. They didn't have a lot of federal criminal statutes. Breach of the public trust is sufficient to impeach. (END VIDEOTAPE) FOX (on camera): And just to give you a sense of how difficult it will be for some Republicans to support this plan, you saw over the weekend the Oklahoma Republican Party condemning and censoring James Lankford's actions as he's negotiated the border deal.
