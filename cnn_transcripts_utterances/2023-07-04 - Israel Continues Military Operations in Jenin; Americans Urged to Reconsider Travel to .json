U.S. markets closed for Independence Day but do not display we continue to go forth there's plenty to survey. On Wall Street stocks still looking spry as we head into July, the major averages ending Monday's shortened session in the green thanks for rallies in Tesla, and other EV names a Yankee Doodle Dandy year so far for U.S. investors too the best first half protect impact since 1983. The NASDAQ now up 32 percent since January and Nvidia provide the real fireworks this year up some 190 percent, thanks to all the AI the artificial intelligence euphoria and another stock cruising ahead Carnival up more than 130 percent. Investors of all shape and size stars and stripes gearing up for the Q2 earnings parade in just a few weeks' time. And other challenges to flag include perhaps another Fed rate hike later this month. Plus jobs data this Friday is the labor market still as hot as a holiday barbecue grill. Well, later in the show we'll be grilling Eric Hoffman the Founder and CEO of Shareholders Food, a pioneer in 3D printed foods. Did you learn can you see a plate of printed fish or meat in your future Fourth of July or any other holiday for that matter feast? Maybe lots to chew over to in Europe and Asia today a mixed bag as you can see the Australian Central Bank taking a page from the Fed Chair Jerome Powell's playbook and announcing a hawkish rate hike pause. No holiday pause though the U.S. China trade tensions. The Wall Street Journal says the U.S. is set to restrict Chinese access to U.S. cloud services. A possible blow to Amazon and Microsoft all this as China restricts exports of metals used in chip and electric car production, an interesting time indeed for Treasury Secretary Yellen's to trip to Beijing. That's expected to begin on Thursday. As you can see lots to get to as always on the show but we do begin with the latest from Israel, and at least eight people have been injured after a car struck pedestrians at the shopping center in Tel Aviv. Police say the driver then left the vehicle and began attacking people before an armed civilian killed him. It comes as an Israeli military operation in the City of Jenin continues for a second straight day. Israel's largest defensive in the West Bank in more than 20 years and joining us now Elliott Gotkine. Elliott, good to have you with us I believe in the last few moments Hamas have claimed responsibility for that attack in Tel Aviv what more can you tell us?",

And the car as you were saying the carwas driven according to the IDF was driven by someone from a town net near Hebron in the West Bank that he drive into this bus stop and you can see the kind of mangled ruins of this car. And then also looking over some of the people that was a bike lane where there were people biking and scooting past and then got out of the car and then began trying -- began stabbing people. So some quite graphic security camera footage that we've seen, which shows almost the entirety of the attack, playing out and then chased after people as they were kind of running away from the attacker. So that's what happened there. There are eight injuries as you say they're all in hospital. And I don't think it's necessarily a surprise that there was an attack of this nature in the wake of this ongoing operation by Israel into Jenin Julia.",

One spectacular one, of course, that actually hit the domes on top of a building inside the walls of the Kremlin. They were suburbs of Moscow that were also hit. And when you add to that the events that were really dramatic last month, the attempted military uprising in Russia, led by the Wagner Leader Yevgeny Prigozhin. Then again, it just shows you that you know Russia looks increasingly unstable. And that will be noticed, of course, by ordinary citizens in the country that up until this period had really been pretty much insulated from the events that we're folding next door, the conflict of special military operation as the Russians call it inside Ukraine.",

I mean,all of these nations, China, India, Russia, they all certainly want to show their strength particularly toward the west to show that they have some political muscle. Yet there is this line where you know, they can't push things too much, because there is some dependence or some need to have somewhat cordial for lack of better words, discussions with the West when you mentioned China and Xi Jinping. I mean, right now, China, as we both know, as students of China, China is facing a very precarious economic situation. So it is leaning on the West, it is getting ready for a visit by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Yet it's also not directly condemning Russia. It's trying to figure out, for lack of better words, the sweet spot, President Xi or Chinese Leader Xi did address the organization during its opening meeting today. Let me just share with you some of the phrasing that was used, because I think that also proves an important point. Xi said today, the world is full of chaos and changes unseen in a century are accelerating. Human society is facing unprecedented challenges, unity or division, peace or conflict, cooperation, or confrontation, a series of rhetorical questions, to basically bring up this broader point of the need for win-win cooperation, if you will. Despite all of these statements, though, there is no question that China is going to be very resolute in its approach to all of this, Russia, and China and Russia are two of the organs -- two the nations along with Former Soviet Republics that formed this SCO Alliance this Shanghai Cooperative Organization. So expect them to stay to script. But to go back to this phrase, Julia, as you brought up before balancing act, it's just a political necessity in this current global landscape.",

Now, it's important to note that the extradition treaty that the U.S. used to have with Hong Kong has actually been gotten rid of by the United States because of the laws that have been enacted in Hong Kong recently, when it has to do with national security. So it's not as if the United States is legally required to send any of these activists back to Hong Kong or Beijing. But it's very significant that the United States feels in this statement, that this is a crackdown on human rights globally. They don't think that Hong Kong should be doing this should be seeking millions of dollars for these activists who are, you know, using freedom of speech around the globe to speak up against Beijing's crackdown in Hong Kong? We'll watch and see where this one goes. But the State Department you know, putting out this statement demonstrates just how closely they are tracking what Hong Kong is doing right now.",

In Paris, we see alarming scientists at alarming about the climate change it cannot be solved without nature being able to help us. If we lose natural ecosystems, our forests, soils, or oceans, we are still bust even if we reach zero, full de-carbonization by 2050. So it's essential as regards fighting climate change. Secondly, when we talk about our food security, none, no farmers can or won't work on soils that are not fertile. On grounds that are not pollinated by pollinators. So these essential nature functions, we take it for granted. And I think sometimes we forget that we need to take care of nature. Because even if you look at the numbers, not environmental numbers, but numbers that comes from the businesses, World Economic Forum. 50 percent of the world's GDP depends on nature, especially food sector, of course, construction, and etcetera.

So they can implement it, despite you know, the debates that we have had commission put the additional compromise non paper, which I think worked well, but we should not forget one more important detail. European Union was, together with the Member State driving force at the cop 15 in Montreal, where we have reached a global agreement, global biodiversity framework. And in that framework, nature restoration is also featured. And I think, you know, when it comes to a leadership, first of all, you have to deliver that leadership at home. And then, of course, work with other partners to ensure that those global agreements are delivered.

Hey, imitation is the highest form of flattery, isn't it? And isn't the first social media copycat we've seen whether it was Instagram reels, which felt a lot like TikTok, or even Twitter itself earlier this year announcing it would launch encrypted messaging and phone calls, which sounds a little like WhatsApp. But spreads I think will be an interesting one for two reasons. You mentioned the user base. Already this is working off Instagram. It has 2 billion monthly active users on Instagram. So that makes this a very different sort of copycat in that sense. Secondly, it's all about timing. And right now given that Twitter is at a huge transitional period, and not everyone to put it mildly thinks, it's going all that well.

That certainly seems to be the strategy from Twitter fans. Today, even this from Jack Dorsey who posted with a bit of a typo, I'd say all your threads belong to us. And it lists some of the data parameters that threads will be able to access and share and link to users potentially. But frankly, that is something that already exists with Instagram.
