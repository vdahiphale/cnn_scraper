The man who founded the now-bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX is in a courtroom in the Bahamas saying that he's no longer going to be fighting extradition to the United States to face charges that include criminal fraud. Kara Scannell is watching all this for us joining me now. So, Kara, what is happening in this courtroom?Jean Casarez, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, so this extradition hearing is underway and that sources tell us that that's why he's there today he wants to waive extradition so he can come to the U.S. and face these charges. Remember last week, eight counts, including wire fraud and conspiracies. So, our colleague, Patrick Oppmann is in court, and what he's telling us is that they're in a recess and the judge called a recess because there's some clash between the Bahamian prosecutors and the local council for Bankman-Fried. That local counsel saying he doesn't understand why he's in court. He hasn't had a chance to talk to his client because since Bankman-Fried was arrested last Monday night, appeared in court on Tuesday, he has been held in a Bahamian prison. So, it appears there's some miscommunication about what is going on and what Bankman-Fried's desires are, so they're in a recess so he -- the attorney can talk to the client and figure out what's happening, then this will resume. So, now assuming everything goes according to plan from what our sources tell us.",

The January 6 House committee is meeting in about 90 minutes for its final public gathering, the focus to consider criminal referrals against former President Donald Trump. The culmination really if you will of 18 months of work to investigate the riot on the U.S. Capitol. Following today's meeting, the committee will issue its full report on its investigation of the insurrection and that'll be released on Wednesday.Joining me now is former Republican congressman and Trump's former acting White House Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney. It's great to have you here, Congressman. What do you think, the -- we will see what happens in 90 minutes and what -- and what we learn and what they present, but what do you think the lasting impact will be of the January 6 committee and its investigation?",

I saw that previous segment you did with a panel and there were suggestions, maybe the FBI gets involved.My guess is that the executive branch is going to look at this and say, look, legislative branch, this is your problem. You have to deal with this internally that the courts are not going to sort of get involved in this cross-branch fight. I think that's the right way to handle it. Do I think that the Democrats will likely ignore subpoenas from the upcoming Republican control of various committees? Yes, I do. And I think that would have taken place in any -- in any Congress. Members of Congress don't want to be -- don't -- they don't -- it's not -- there's that something different in that nature that says, look, we shouldn't be putting our own people under subpoena come and talk. That's not -- that's not the way the body works. So, I don't think there's going to be any much that comes up that after this hearing today.",

There is also another -- there's a leadership fight I do want to ask you about playing out among your former colleagues in the House.So, you have Kevin McCarthy, he still doesn't have the votes yet to become a speaker. He also is one of the members that we're talking about here that refused to subpoena. But aside from that, what do you think about this challenge to McCarthy coming from Freedom Caucus members?

I -- ultimately, I think McCarthy probably wins because I think this is a personal challenge. I don't know why these five guys don't like McCarthy but this is not like when we challenged John Boehner almost a decade ago. Back then, we had objections to the policies and the practices that John Boehner was using and putting in place as the speaker of the House. We thought conservatives were being mistreated. Conservatives are getting treated great under Kevin McCarthy. Jim Jordan, again, is going to be the chairman of the powerful judiciary committee. That was beyond our wildest dreams when Boehner was speaker. So, I'm not really sure what the objection is since it feels personal, it feels like a vendetta, I just don't think those types of objections have as much strength and as much legs as the ones that are based on principle. They -- ultimately, these -- the rebellion falls apart if McCarthy becomes the speaker.",

So, if it has to vote on a short-term funding bill, if it has to vote on something for the National Defense Authorization Act, it has to vote on anything, it can't vote without a speaker. So, there's that practical impediment of this fight getting in the way.But then there's also the political impact. You've got -- Republican voters across the country got to look at themselves and say, look, we gave these folks control of the House and they can't even elect a speaker. That's dysfunction at the highest level. So, yes, I think there is the potential here to have a negative political impact on the party if they can't get their ducks in a row in time for the election on January 3.",

There's wind shear that could be an issue. It could have been thunderstorms here, in this case, lots of big up and down drives.I know a lot of people are afraid of turbulence.
