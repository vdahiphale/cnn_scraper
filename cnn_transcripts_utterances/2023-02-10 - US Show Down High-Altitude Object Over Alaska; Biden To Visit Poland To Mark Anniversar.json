According to the White House now, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby says the Defense Department was tracking the objects over the last 24 hours. It comes less than a week after the US shot down a Chinese spy balloon that transmitted across the continental United States. Here is a little of what Mr. Kirby had to say about this latest incident. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ADM. JOHN KIRBY (RET), COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS AT THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: Yes, the President absolutely was involved in this decision. He ordered it at the recommendation of Pentagon leaders. He wanted it taken down, and they did that. They did it using fighter aircraft assigned to US Northern Command. The Pentagon will have more to say about the details of this later on this afternoon. It's only just within the last hour. We're calling this an object, because that's the best description we have right now. We do not know who owns it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Right. And what Kirby said is that the remnants of this objects that were shot down landed in frozen watersoff of Alaska, and that the US is working to gather those remnants and gain some more insight of what the purpose was of this object. It was first detected in American airspace on Thursday evening and what Kirby said was that it was much smaller than the Chinese balloon that transited the United States last week. He described it as about the size of a car, last week's balloon was described as the size of three buses. So this was a much smaller object, and the reason that President Biden decided very quickly to order it shot down is because it was flying at 40,000 feet and President Biden determined that it could be potentially a threat to civilian aircraft, and so he did order that shut down much quicker than last week when this object was -- or when the balloon was transiting the United States over the course of several days. Now, as you said, Kirby did not say who this object was from, whether it was a balloon or some other type of object and what its potential purpose was, and that will be something that investigators are looking at very closely. Now, what we do know is that the Federal Aviation Administration in the United States did close off the airspace around this object as this operation was underway, that occurred in Northeastern Alaska very near to the Canadian border. Before they shot it down, pilots were able to determine that it was an unmanned device, that there was no people inside of it before they shot it down. But of course, this is going to raise questions of where did this come from? Was it another Chinese object? Or did it come from another country? Kirby couldn't even necessarily say whether it was a state actor that flew this object over the United States or if it was some of their private function. And so there will be a lot to learn over the next few hours as the pieces of it are gathered from that frozen area of Alaska -- Eleni.",

But President Biden ordered the shooting down of this object, which clearly shows that they were concerned in terms of the threat, as you say, to airspace. They also said that they will not be contacting their Chinese counterparts, there is no need to because they don't know who is responsible for this object. So I think there were a lot of questions purely because of course it comes really, you know, not even a week after the Chinese balloon was shot down.",

You have satellites, drones, and balloons and all sorts of sensors and the rest of it. So they're very worried of what's going on. Now, whether it's a Russian drone, and I don't know that it's a drone, of course, or a Chinese, they probably don't know, they probably would have said by now, but the Pentagon is in a state of high alert, worrying about a conflict -- a wider conflict.",

They also would like to know if President Xi is involved with this, or is the Chinese military acting in a rogue commander.

Now, this all coming though, and this is why I think it's slightly more significant than the pretty regular, almost weekly, certainly every 10 days or so mass attacks by a mixture of Iranian-made Shahed drones and these cruise missiles that the Ukrainians have shot down, 61 out of 71.

He reiterated his pledge today to rebuild within a year, and he promised to pay for temporary shelter for those who have lost their homes. More than 5700 buildings collapsed in Turkey leaving hundreds of thousands homeless. These satellite images are from before and after the earthquake. And they show the extent of the damage.

Protesters stormed the Brazilian Capitol last month, an invasion reminiscent of the January 6 insurrection in the U.S. President Lula da Silva sat down exclusively with CNN's Christiane Amanpour and he spoke about the state of democracy in Brazil around the world. As you can see, President Joe Biden waiting for President Lula da Silva to arrive. He should be arriving any moment now. I've got Christiane Amanpour standing by. Christiane, you've spoken with President Lula da Silva in extensive conversation. Both countries need to get back on the same page. Through the conversations that you have, do believe that the messaging that President da Silva we're going in with -- in the meeting with President Joe Biden that they can find common ground?",

But yes, Presidentda Silva has got a slightly different view, maybe a very big -- a big difference of views regarding the war. Basically, what he's saying is that Brazil does not believe in intervention, and that he wants to help launch the process for peace immediately. He did say, as he said before, that Putin made a mistake by -- and did not do the right thing, in other words, by invading Ukraine, but we have to try to get towards peace. So, he is hoping to continue what he has an open line and open dialogue with Putin, and also with other members of the alliance known as the BRICS, that obviously Brazil beloved belongs to. That's Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. All of these countries have a different view as to what's happening in Ukraine. They all condemned the invasion. But they have a different view as to, you know, Ukraine's position. And so, he wants to see if he can open some peace talks. But I asked John Kirby, who is the national security spokesman, and he said, very sadly, at this precise moment, there is no avenue for any peace talks with Putin. And the only way that could happen is if they give weaponry to Ukraine to try to bolster, you know, try to bolster their position on the battlefield. This is the part of that conversation between Lula and I. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Of course, it has that right because the invasion wasn't a mistake on the part of Russia. And Russia couldn't have done that. And after all it would spot the U.N. Security Council. And so, this was not discussed at the U.N. Security Council. So, what I want to say is the following. What have been mistaken has already done. The mistake was already done. Now we have to find people to fix the mistake, to fix the error that was made. I know that we Brazil doesn't have that international political clout to promote that in this prefers rationale of conflicts in the world. But I can say to you that I will dedicate a lot of my time to find a way, a road for someone to start talking about peace.
