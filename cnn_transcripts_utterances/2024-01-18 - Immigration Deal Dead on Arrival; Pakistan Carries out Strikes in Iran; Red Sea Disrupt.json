But Iran carried out its own deadly missile strikes starting Monday on northern Iraq, on Syria, and then Tuesday night on Pakistan. And it stunned the ruling establishment there. They said that at least two people were killed in what the Iranians said were missile strikes on a militant group that they accused of hiding out in Pakistan and carrying out attacks on Iran in the past.So, the Pakistanis, they withdrew their ambassador from Tehran. They called this a violation of Pakistani airspace. They declared Iran's ambassador to Pakistan unwelcome. And just a few hours ago, the Pakistani military claimed responsibility for what it described as precision strikes into Iran against a different militant group that it accuses of carrying out attacks on Pakistan in the past. The Iranian authorities say that killed at least nine people, including a number of children and women. They're demanding an answer. Again, not what you could have predicted at the beginning of the week. Both of these neighbors are Islamic republics. Neither of them have relations with Israel. And suddenly this flare-up of tensions. A big question is, how will Iran respond to this? Does it really want to get into a dust-up with its much larger nuclear armed neighbor to the east? Poppy.

Thank you, guys, for being here. Matt, let me just start with you on this. What's so interesting about when Jamie Dimon talks about politics is he tells you what he really, really thinks. But the point he made there is, a lot of that Trump did proved, in his opinion, to be correct, even if you don't like some of the styles, some of the things that are said, et cetera, and beyond that.
