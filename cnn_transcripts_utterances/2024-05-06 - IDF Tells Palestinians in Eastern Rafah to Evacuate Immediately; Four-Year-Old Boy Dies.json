The Israeli military is preparing, it appears, for a possible and long-anticipated ground offensive in the southern Gaza city. In the last hour, we've seen smoke rising over part of the area, unclear right now why and what it is from. However, the IDF has been dropping leaflets to alert civilians warning Palestinians to evacuate immediately, with a map showing them where to go to find safety.Also happening right now, the hostage and ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas this morning are stalled once again, all of this interconnected. This is just after there was a brief moment of optimism, of progress at the end of last week. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is in Jerusalem, Arlette Saenz is at the White House. Jeremy, what are you learning about what Israel is planning and what they're saying right now?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Kate, there's no question that the White House is watching these latest moves from Israel relating to Rafah incredibly closely. It comes as the Biden administration and President Biden himself had also warned that any Israeli operation in to Rafah must also take into account the more than 1 million civilians who are currently in that area.U.S. officials have been speaking over the recent weeks with Israeli officials about what plans they might have in place to ensure the protection and safety and evacuation of those civilians. On Friday, we reported that the Israelis had recently briefed the U.S. on their thinking relating to evacuating civilians out of Rafah, but sources stress that what was presented did not represent a final plan or provide full insight into what a military operation would look like. So, certainly, the White House has expressed concern about what could happen in Rafah, and they'll certainly be seeking more answers from the Israelis about their intentions and their plans there. Now, over the weekend, we also learned that the U.S. paused a shipment of U.S.-made ammunition to Israel. A source familiar with the matter told CNN that this does not have to do with any potential invasion into Rafah, and it won't affect shipments going forward. But there are real questions about why they paused this shipment. A bit earlier today, Senator Chris Coons, a key member of the Foreign Relations Committee, suggested that it could be due to some logistical issues. Now, this is all playing out against the backdrop of those ceasefire and hostage negotiations, which Jeremy was just speaking about. CIA Director Bill Burns had been in Cairo for these talks. He traveled on to Doha and remains there today. He had met with the Qatari prime minister and was set to travel to Israel, but will remain in Doha. And it comes as the administration had really been striking an optimistic tone, expressing some hope about the prospects of this potential deal. But at this time, it appears that things have stalled for a bit with both the Israelis and Hamas leaders blaming each other for what they view as extreme views. Now, President Biden today will have lunch here at the White House with King Abdullah of Jordan, someone who has expressed some concerns about the situation in Gaza. So, we will see what the president might have to say as he meets with the Jordanian king. But certainly, they will be watching the situation that's developing in Rafah very closely as they've expressed concern about the path forward.",

      "sentences": "Yes, dramatic is the word, John. I feel like it might have been the most dramatic testimony that we have yet seen in this trial. But Hope Hicks really kind of helping both sides as we've sort of seen with some of these witnesses.She really took us inside the campaign before Trump's election in 2016, kind of showing jurors sort of the crisis mode that they entered once that Access Hollywood tape came out, also when The Wall Street Journal article came out about Karen McDougal and a little bit of mention in there about Stormy Daniels, there was an email that was shown to jurors where she told her camp, deny, deny, deny. Also, she didn't tell jurors or acknowledge for the prosecution that she knew of any hush money payment that was paid to either of those women. But she did say that Cohen wouldn't make a payment out of the kindness of his own heart. He would have had to have done it at the direction of someone else, obviously hinting towards Donald Trump. And then she got emotional, John. She actually started crying on the stand a little bit and had to take a little bit of a break before really right as cross-examination was starting up. And so court took a little bit of break. She came back on. She acknowledged really at the top of this that she was very nervous about testifying. She was there under subpoena. And when the defense was asking their question, she really painted the former president as a family man, someone who valued Mrs. Trump's opinion, someone who didn't want to cause any embarrassment for his family, really helping the defense show that it's possible maybe these payments were paid not to interfere with the election, but rather because he was concerned about his family's perception of him. And she also talked about Michael Cohen. Of course, we know this as a key witness in this trial. She kind of dug at him a little bit more as we have seen in this defense tactic, talking about how he was this person who sort of inserted himself into the campaign, how he would frustrate the members of the campaign, saying this, that Cohen liked to call himself a fixer or Mr. Fix It, and it was only because he first broke it that he was then able to fix it. So, interesting kind of quote there. So, she's off the stand. We don't know again who is going to be coming up next, but certainly it's going to be an eventful week, four days of court this week. And we know, of course, Stormy Daniels, Michael Cohen, a lot of people's names on that list who could possibly take the stand this week. It starts up again, John, at 9:30.",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, there are multiple videos circulating online showing the protest at the University of Mississippi in Oxford, but there's one video in particular that has gone viral and it's at the center of the controversy.Before I show you the video, we need to warn our viewers that it may be offensive to some people. As you can see, the video shows a group of mostly young white men in the counter-protest yelling at a black woman. At least one counter- protester is seen on video and appears to be making gestures at the woman. We now know who the woman in the video is. Her name is Jalen Smith. She's 24 years old. She confirmed to CNN that she's the woman seen in the video. Smith said that during the protest, pro-Palestinian demonstrators were kept in an enclosure, which police said was for their safety. She also said that she briefly stepped out of the enclosure to go live on social media and that's when the confrontation took place. CNN has made efforts but has not identified any of the counter- protesters seen in the video. We've also learned that the University of Mississippi has opened an investigation into student conduct but didn't say who or what they were specifically investigating. In a letter, Chancellor Glenn Boyce says university officials are aware that some statements made were offensive, hurtful and unacceptable, including actions that conveyed hostility and racist overtones. Smith tells CNN she said some insults back to the counter-protesters but adds the following quote. People calling me fat or Lizzo didn't hurt my feelings because I know what I am. I am so confident in my blackness. I am so confident in my size and the way that I wear my hair and who I am. They do not bother me. If anything, I felt pity for them for how stupidly they acted. The controversy, Kate, took another turn when U.S. Representative Mike Collins, a Republican representing parts of Georgia, shared the viral video on next, the following day, saying Ole Miss taking care of business. CNN has reached out to Collins' office but there hasn't been an answer so far. And then on Saturday, Congressman Collins' tweet prompted the NAACP to send a letter to congressional leadership asking for an investigation into Collins' conduct. And part of the letter says the following. These actions conducted by a member of the House of Representatives, regardless of intent, legitimize and propagate racism and undermine the principles of equality and justice that our government is sworn to uphold. Some of our viewers may remember that the University of Mississippi has a long history of racial incidents, including the deadly riots that broke out there in 1962 when James Meredith became the first black student to enroll at the school.
