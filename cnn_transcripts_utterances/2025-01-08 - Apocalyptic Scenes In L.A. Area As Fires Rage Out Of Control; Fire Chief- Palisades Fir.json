      "sentences": "Welcome to Inside Politics. I'm Dana Bash in Washington, where we are following breaking news on what officials describe as apocalyptic conditions. You're looking at live pictures out of Los Angeles County, where life threatening fires are tearing through the most populous county in the United States.At this hour, four separate wildfires are spreading so rapidly that firefighters can't even begin to start to control them. One fire alone has already engulfed 5000 acres rather, its zero percent contained. Just want to emphasize that, 5000 acres, zero percent contained. None of this fire, all of the fires are out of control. It's really just the opposite. Tens of thousands of people are under evacuation orders. The area includes Kamala Harris' home in Brentwood, and she's here in Washington, D.C., but President Biden is actually in Los Angeles right now. The dangerous conditions upended some of his plans in the area. This afternoon, he will be briefed at a Santa Monica firehouse. As countless homes and businesses are now reduced to smoldering shells of what they were. That includes more than a thousand buildings in the Pacific Palisades alone, so many people attempted to save their belongings before realizing, nothing could be done. (VIDEOCLIP PLAYING)",

I don't even know the number of times that we have seen you out unfortunately in California covering wildfires.

Well, we see that often with fires being 5000 acres, but they're not in densely packed areas like where we are right now. That's what makes this so dramatic and so scary for even those of us who come out here.And I have to tell you, this morning, driving out here was one of the scariest passages I've ever made to a wildfire. And I've done a drive to wildfires several times, but it was like going through -- like you heard the word apocalyptic. It's exactly like that. That's exactly what we saw and it's not something to play with. That's where they want people to stay away. That's why schools are closed because they don't want people negotiating and that's part of the issue here, Dana.",

I mean, that's such a key point, just where you are in the Pacific Palisades, it is densely populated with house after house after house, which doesn't seem like a lot of them are still standing, it's just absolutely hard to wrap your mind around. Thank you so much, Stephanie. I appreciate that.I want to go to Courtney Kay Kirsh, who evacuated from where Stephanie is right now, Pacific Palisades. Courtney, I know you left with your family. First of all, how are you? Is your family safe? COURTNEY KAY KIRSH, EVACUATED PACIFIC PALISADES WITH FAMILY (voiceover): My family is safe. We're just very devastated. It's very surreal. And yesterday morning, at 10:31 when I had a beautiful walk. I just never thought that I'd turn a corner, see a fire and walked to my kids' school. And by the time I got there at 11 am, the smoke was just already billowing and was very scary. And picked them up from school, walked home. I really didn't even think to pack anything significant. I thought we would be home today, which now, in retrospect, seems not so smart, but I just never thought it would go this way honestly. It was very, very surreal. We have such a special community in the Palisades. It's very sad.",

And I grew up in the Palisades. And it's just -- it's always been a very special little enclave in Los Angeles.

We can hear in your voice, it is obviously very hard to breathe there.It goes without saying that we hope that you and your crew stay safe as you are literally standing amid the fire there in Altadena. Thank you so much for giving us that important report. Thank you, Julia. And President Biden is in Los Angeles. As we mentioned, he is going to receive a briefing there soon.

      "sentences": "Well, Dana, we have seen President Biden go into disaster zone so often to try to offer some comfort. But what's so unique in this situation is that President Biden is in Los Angeles County as these wildfires began unfolding.We expect him at some point today. The White House said he will be visiting a fire station in Santa Monica, where he will receive a briefing from California fire officials about these wildfires that have spread across the county. President Biden has been in Los Angeles since Monday night and began receiving briefings on these fires after they began just yesterday. Now he is there for a mix of reasons. In part, he revealed in a USA Today interview that his granddaughter Naomi Biden was scheduled to have a C-section today to have a baby in the California area. But President Biden was also out west to travel to the Coachella Valley to designate two national monuments yesterday. That trip was actually scrapped due to those high winds. And a source familiar with the matter said that the president stayed at his hotel in Los Angeles after that to try to minimize any impacts on the road that his motorcade might result in. So much of the attention of the administration right now is trying to ensure that the Los Angeles County has the resources they need to try to fight these fires. The federal government has deployed a number of resources, including U.S. Forest Service large air tankers. There's also about 10 federal firefighting helicopters that are there, working with state and local firefighters to try to combat these flames. All really trying to get a handle of this situation. Now, reporters who are traveling with the president actually said they could see fire haze from the hotel where he was staying in Culver City. I will also note that Vice President Kamala Harris has a home in Brentwood. We are told that her neighborhood did face an evacuation order yesterday. The vice president has been here in Washington, D.C. But of course, both Vice President Harris, President Biden are watching this fire with great concern as there will be a long recovery after this as these fires are still unfolding across the county.",
