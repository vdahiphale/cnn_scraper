Navalny's team posted this picture of his body covered in flowers, lying inside the casket. The prominent Kremlin critic died exactly two weeks ago at an Arctic penal colony.

Now, at that time, Nemtsov was investigating Russia's covert involvement in stoking the war in Donbas in eastern Ukraine at a time when the Russian government didn't actually acknowledge that it was actually involved in this conflict, and that was only afterwards that -- now, we look two years on from the full scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. And the situation has changed very dramatically, especially when it comes to registering political protest.I was in Moscow in the days running up to and following the full-scale invasion, and we saw thousands of people who are arrested across Russia, who had come out to protest against the war. And the Russian government introduced draconian new laws, essentially restricting free speech and making it illegal to criticize the military. So, as you had noted before, I mean, it's an act of tremendous courage to turn out in Russia in great numbers to commemorate someone whose name the Kremlin really wouldn't acknowledge. Navalny was sort of the he who could not be named. And state media did its best to keep him out of the headlines and out of public awareness in general. So, it's remarkable to see people coming out and risking arrest, and turning on in large numbers in Moscow at a time when the atmosphere and when the room for public debate has been so stifled, Fredricka.",

Russians go to essentially re-anoint Vladimir Putin, who is widely expected to win a fifth term in office that would keep him in office until 2030, and also at a time when he is projecting this message of confidence, wants the world to believe that he is beginning to prevail in Ukraine.

This is all for internal audiences, for the most part, but that's just the basic, we don't care.But, it's also something that sends him, again, one of those very subtle messages to Russian society, saying, OK, we're going to tolerate a little bit of this. It's like a pressure cooker. We're going to let you blow off some steam, if you will. If it goes too far, if you're not, we will come in and we will press hard if we have to.

This video was provided by his team, and in just the last few minutes, his coffin was lowered into the ground. Vigils are expected to take place across Europe later on today. In other global developments, the international community is demandinganswers after the deadly catastrophe in Gaza on Thursday. The Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza says at least 112 people were killed and 760 injured when Israeli forces opened fire as desperately hungry civilians gathered around aid trucks in Gaza City. CNN is unable to independently confirm these numbers or exactly what transpired, given that there have been conflicting reports. The IDF says Israeli tanks fired warning shots to disperse the crowd after seeing people were being trampled. Speaking at the UN Security Council, the Palestinian UN Ambassador said what happened was \"an outrageous massacre\". Paula Hancocks is following the story from Abu Dhabi. So, what is the latest? Still conflicting reports about whether IDF says there was a threat, whereas those who came out in large numbers said they haven't seen food in a long time and they were simply hungry, and approached these aid trucks.

Who is not there, Dasha Navalnaya, Alexei Navalny's daughter, Zahar Navalny, his son, Yulia Navalnaya, as you said, his wife, who wrote this very moving and heartfelt message on X just moments ago, thanking her husband for 26 years of love of support, saying that she doesn't know if she will be able to continue doing it alone, but she is going to do her best to try to make him proud, to try to continue his legacy.And this is a big part, I think, of what Navalny's enormous appeal was. He is, or was, I should say, thoroughly modern. Their love story is relatable. They seem real. They crack jokes. They share heartwarming anecdotes and intimacies that is so different from the pomp and formality and isolation that you see with President Putin. Now, Yulia Navalnaya, I am assuming, is making the judgment that if she did get on a plane as her husband did and she did fly to Moscow, that she would likely be arrested and possibly meet a similar fate to her husband. And given that she is the mother of two children, I would imagine she has made the decision not to take that risk. But, I do think this is a crucial moment for Yulia Navalnaya and for the entire Navalny team going forward. They've said that she is going to take the mantle. But, what does she do with it? What is the future of Russia's opposition? What does that look like? We've already seen the Kremlin leap into action, smearing her, accusing her of being a sort of dilettante of the West, using the fact that she has been living in exile these last few years against her. And so, it will take a lot of dexterity and thought for her to try to work out how to continue to reach and touch and move the Russian people who are still inside of Russia, when she clearly cannot be there at the moment, and when the situation on the ground is so clearly at the moment very, very difficult for anyone who wants to see Russia look different.",

Despite government efforts, turnout is expected to be at record lows, as the government has disqualified opponents and cracked down on any dissent. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei cast his ballot in Tehran a short while ago. The 84-year-old called on Iranians to vote as an act of resistance against enemies.CNN's Frederik Pleitgen is in Tehran and joining us now. So, voter turnout is a key issue. It's expected to be one of the lowest however in 45 years. Why is that?",

I do think that there appears to be a sense of disillusionment, at least among younger people here in this country, at least among some of the younger people that we've been speaking to. There were some folks who were sort of in their early 20s, who were telling us that they believe that the leaders of this country and certainly the political leaders of this country need to do more for them. And they're not feeling heard at this point in time.But, one of the things that we're finding, which I think is a really interesting thing, is that there are a lot of very young people willing to come to us and speak openly about some of the political grievances that they've had. That's certainly something that to the extent that we're seeing it right now. We haven't seen that to that extent in the past. So, that's something where I think a lot of people appear to be somewhat disillusioned with the political process and certainly say they want more from their elected leaders. It's going to be very interesting to see whether or not the leadership of the country is hearing that, is willing to act on that for the future. So, certainly, right now, we're going to have to wait and see what the participation in this election is going to be. But, especially the youth vote is something that I think we're going to take a very close look at and see how many young people have actually gone to the polls when all of this is said and done, Fredricka. WHITFIELD: All right. Frederik Pleitgen, thank you so much. All right. Still to come, Vladimir Putin's most prominent critic is laid to rest. Thousands put their lives on the line to pay their final respects to Russia's late opposition leader Alexei Navalny. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",

They realize what a potent force Navalny was, and perhaps will continue to be depending on what goes on with the movement, what his wife chooses to do. It's really, really interesting, and I think Clarissa Ward talked about it just a minute ago, when you talk to people on the streets and how they react to Navalny. He was -- if you listen to him in Russian, it's really amazing. His speech is just so relaxed. He connects with young people. And it's such a contrast when you hear Putin talking in very formalistic Soviet style.I remember speaking to young Russians when I was in Russia years ago, and asking them, what about that, and specifically about the corruption, which is what Navalny, of course, really hit on hard, the corruption in the Putin government. And a lot of young Russians would say, well, do you have any evidence of that, or is it just you're an American so you think badly? That's what Navalny was able to bring to the Russian population. He was able to show them the massive corruption. And that's why he was such a threat and that's why they're going to be watching very, very carefully what happens on the streets over the next couple of days and weeks.",

One would inspire people about what to do, while the other is telling people what to do. And so, it seems the support for Navalny, I mean, we're just seeing probably a fraction of the support, right, those who are well enough, bold enough to be in the streets to be seen, to be chanting his name, to say we are here. We are many. I mean, they are probably a very small representation, right, of the kind of support that Navalny was able to attract.",

And I think one of the problems within Russia because I think a lot of viewers might be asking, well, if we have this outpouring of emotion, if we have people taking these risks to be participants in honoring Navalny, why aren't we seeing some sort of stronger reaction? Why aren't people taking to the streets in the hundreds of thousands and calling for Putin's resignation? And I think the problem is, is that Russians understand that when they're over their kitchen table, when they're talking amongst family members or perhaps very close friends, they can speak their minds. But, when they undertake an act of public defiance, they run a very significant risk.You talk about just a little -- small fraction of the people coming out and doing this and much more going on behind the scenes. The same is true for the security services. We see a strong police presence, but it's nothing compared to what's going on behind the scenes, as the security service try to identify who is coming up. Do we need to imprison those people as well? It's a very, very delicate situation right now across the country and Russia.",

As Clarissa mentioned earlier, she is not likely to go into Russia, nor will her children, because they see that the same thing might potentially happen to them.
