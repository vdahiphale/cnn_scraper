Zoe Lofgren, a former member of January 6th committee, has told CNN, when they released a lot of this footage throughout the past year during the January 6th committee hearings, they came to an agreement on what footage they could use. One thing they had said, U.S. Capitol Police did not want them using was video of lawmakers evacuating the capitol that day. Lofgren told us that she worries having that footage in the hands of the wrong people, could provide a blueprint for bad actors on how to successfully attack the capitol again.",

But the thing that didn't surprise me is, look, here's a secret that's -- it's kind of an open secret that people know about Kevin McCarthy. He loves to have famous people on speed dial. In every meeting you're in with him, he'll mention some famous person's name that he's talked to. I think, through doing this, he now probably has Tucker Carlson's friendship. He probably has him on speed dial and text with him. I think that's all this was, to win over Tucker Carlson so he could have him on his side. The danger of this is significant.

Because he just wanted to get it done. It wasn't up for debate. I think there's going to be a lot of consternation. That doesn't mean they're going to come out and oppose him. Again, the problem with so-called moderates in the GOP -- I've lived this, I was one of these people -- it's that we like to work together as a team. We may talk tough.

Guys, anytime Walmart reports, people pay attention because of its sheer size, right, and what it tells us about the consumer. But also Home Depot reporting. So on Walmart, Walmart, look, had a pretty strong quarter but started to say that it's starting to see some cracks in the consumer. Starting to see more visits from middle- and higher-income consumers. But also starting to see the impact that inflation is having on consumers. One of the executives said on the earnings call today that there's a great deal of uncertainty, looking out over the balance of this year. While the supply chain issues have largely abated, prices are still high. There's that inflation. And there's considerable pressure on the consumer. Attempting to predict with precision these swings and macro conditions and their effect on consumer behavior is challenging. I.e., outlook is getting a bit more cloudy because of the impact of higher rates, because of the impact of inflation. Home Depot, I should say, also had a decent quarter. It wasn't terrible, but also worry about outlook. So you put it together, two major retailers are starting to sound the alarm about the health of the consumer. Which is, by the way, two- thirds of the U.S. economy, it is the backbone of the U.S. economy, which is the reason why markets are reacting the way they are.",

So take a look at existing home sales, the sale of existing homes, really just plummeting compared to a year ago.Existing homes up 37 percent compared to a year ago, also down slightly from the month prior, less than 1 percent. Why is this happening is, of course, higher interest rates, which of course, are very sensitive to what the Fed does. Also, we have lower inventory. So that's part of the problem. And then mortgage, you see how mortgage rates are now about 6 percent. If you're buying a home right now, chances are it's going to start with a 6 handle. A year ago, probably would have started with a 3 handle. In fact, 85 percent to 90 percent of people who have a home mortgage are locked in under 5 percent. Part of the reason why -- if you're locked in under 5 percent, you have a compelling reason to want to sell in this market. So you're seeing the impact there on the housing market.",

Good news for workers.But, guys, if you're the Fed hearing this, yet another employer saying they have to hike wages -- and I should say Home Depot is saying this is about retention, about keeping workers -- it's a sign of how tight the labor market is. Remember when we got the January jobs report, unemployment dipped to a fresh 50-year low, 3.4 percent. That's what you're seeing. Companies are trying to hold on to workers and so they're trying to incentivize workers with higher wages. The issue for the Fed is, if Home Depot or a company likes it, that passes the higher wage off to us consumers in terms of inflation and it becomes this vicious cycle.

We are going to see very high impacts. The areas shaded in red is where we are going to see major impacts and some spots could see extreme impacts from the storm. Here's the forecast radar. You can see all the snow through the Rockies, through the Midwest. This is Thursday, 1:00 a.m. So we are getting a round now. We will get a brief break for the Midwest and then another round Wednesday into Thursday where we could top possibly see two to two and a half feet of snow across portions of the Midwest. Snow will be measured in feet across the Cascades and Sierra as well. One more look. You can see that pulling through the east. We are going to see very cold temperatures behind it. And we could see anywhere from 12 to 18 inches of snow. And that's the areas shaded in pink. Higher amounts for some isolated locations. But for the most part, we will see a foot and maybe two feet of snow across the Midwest. Also a severe weather risk to this, damaging winds and possible tornadoes across portions of the mid-south. Your forecast accumulation as far as rain goes will be about one to two inches. But we could see higher amounts through the Midwest. There's a major flood threat there.
