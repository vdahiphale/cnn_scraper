Simpson, were someone who had been the Heisman Trophy winner, the greatest college football player when he played at the University of Southern California, and then became an NFL all-star when he played for my Buffalo Bills, and one of the greatest halfbacks in the NFL. And then all of a sudden, he's accused of this double murder, and then we all watched it unfold on television. And so many of us, we couldn't believe what we were seeing at the time. But just reflect a little bit on how someone who was so high, all of a sudden, was thrown way down.",

I want to bring in CNN Sports Correspondent Carolyn Manno to join us here.Carolyn, how is the NFL right now responding to the news? Because all of us of course, remember when OJ Simpson was a star halfback for my Buffalo Bills, he was an all-NFL, went down into the NFL Hall of Fame. When he was in college, he was the Heisman Trophy winner at the University of Southern California. How's the NFL today responding to the news that O.J. Simpson has died?",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, a statement just came through from the Pro Football Hall of Fame and also the Heisman Trophy trust offering their condolences and detailing some of what you mentioned. I mean, part of the reason why his acquittal captivated the country in the 90s is because he was a sports hero and an icon. This is from the Pro Football Hall of Fame. O.J. Simpson was the first player to reach a rushing mark many thought could not be attained in a 14-game season when he topped 2000 yards. And then the Heisman Trophy Trust issuing a statement on Twitter that said that they're mourning his passing as well that they extend their sympathy to his family.But this is a man whose story, Wolf, could be viewed as an American tragedy because of his fall from grace that you've been outlining. I mean, this is a man whose father was a custodian and a cook. His mother was a nurse's aide. And he rose through the ranks in the sports landscape winning the Heisman Trophy. He became a superstar. and you know, when he was drafted to the Bills, it took him a couple of seasons to get going but then he became a pro bowler. He became a Hall of Famer. He was able to successfully transition into a career after being such an incredible halfback, where he became a sports commentator, an actor, an icon, and a legend. And when you listen to people who really know him or covered the trial detail who he was, they described him as such an affable person, a likable person. And that's part of the reason why too a lot of people were so shocked to go through this trial and to hear the details of his ultimate acquittal and what happened afterwards because he was a larger-than-life figure.",

For example, when he would get the ball, we would all just get so excited, just thinking about what he was about to do, and he almost always did exactly that. Take that ball and run for either a first down or in a touchdown. It was just an incredible experience we all had watching him play football for my Buffalo Bills. It was really an amazing moment.What goes through your mind as you think about today, as opposed to all of us growing up watching the trial, watching the car chase, watching what happened to him after he was acquitted of this double murder charge, and then go on and eventually be convicted of trying to steal some paraphernalia -- some memorabilia from some folks in Las Vegas -- O.J. Simpson memorabilia?",

      "sentences": "Yes. Wolf, you can't understate how -- already, there was a powder keg in Los Angeles at the time, if you want to go back to Rodney King, which I know we've discussed a bit here. But you have to take that camcorder video that was sent to a local station, KTLA, that blew up, and seeing this man being beat by those officers -- beaten by those officers was one part of it. Then came the acquittal of the officers. And all four of them were acquitted of assault. Three out of the four were acquitted of excessive force.That led to the powder keg exploding and the LA riots. You saw people really upset. Feeling like they weren't being hurt. They weren't being felt. Then you fast forward because that was '92, then you fast forward to 94 when these heinous murders happened. And O.J. Simpson who was seen as somebody who could transcend race. He was super famous and popular and well-liked. Immediately, the tones changed. And you can see that building up here in Los Angeles throughout the country as well. I remember I was just a news assistant at the time of my first job out of college, and the reporter helped me on the phone to tell her what the verdict was going to be. This was before cell phones. And so, everyone was waiting to hear what was going to happen. But that palpable energy and looking at how it divided people along race lines, and for once, here was a black man who was now seen as a black man again, and he was found not guilty. He was acquitted of these murders. There were a lot of people who saw that as justice, not necessarily for O.J. Simpson, but that the system actually worked for a black man for once. And all of this coming from a very tension-filled decade of the 90s. And this coming at the end of it. You can't actually look at O.J.'s case without looking at Rodney King and without looking at the race riots that followed after it.",

And I've talked to police officers here over the years, who point to what happened in the 90s as a reason to the way they had to change how they were policing. Now, some may argue that they haven't changed enough, but you can definitely see that there was an inflection point.And the way that things were done before had to change because of the upheaval, the unrest, the unhappiness, and also just moving a court trial to a place that is much more white over something like this. Things like this had to change. And that's not the police department, obviously. But still, you can't underestimate the ripple effect of this massive, massive cultural moment that was caused because of O.J. Simpson's trial.",

Simpson was guilty of killing Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman. I think more and more people do believe that. I think there are still some people who question it based on the way it played out.But what you also have is a whole new series of Angelenos who weren't alive when this happened. They don't remember it the way we do, how the whole world stopped for the, you know, slow-speed chase, how the whole world stopped to find out what the verdict was going to be. I mean, if you look at CNN Los Angeles, there's basically the entire office moved downtown, and just everyone reported to work downtown, I'm told during that time. It took over everything. And so, when you go to Brentwood, the part of the neighborhood where he lived, it's not like you can go and visit these places anymore. Things have been erased from the collective memory as far as a place to go to. But when you talk to people here, it is one of those things where everyone remembers where they were, what they were doing when this happened because it did basically paralyzed the city.",
