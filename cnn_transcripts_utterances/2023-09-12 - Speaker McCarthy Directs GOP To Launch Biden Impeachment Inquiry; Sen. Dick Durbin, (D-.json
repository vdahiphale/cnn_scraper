Conservative hardliners are fine with it, even someone like Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who had indicated she wanted a vote to open up an impeachment inquiry, but instead now signaling support for Kevin McCarthy going this route. Even though there are a number of Republicans, including some in some key swing diseases, who simply are not there and would not have voted to open up the impeachment inquiry, which is why McCarthy essentially said prior to that he would move forward without any such vote. And when I asked Speaker McCarthy about this earlier today, he blamed it on Nancy Pelosi's decision to not go forward with an impeachment inquiry during the second impeachment. Nevertheless, never mind what he said just less than two weeks ago.But that is only one issue facing Kevin McCarthy. One more immediate issue how to avoid a government shutdown by the end of the month. He is facing pressure from a range of conservative hardliners demanding a number of spending cuts, including on the short term stopgap bill that is needed to keep the government open past September 30. And when I asked several of them about this, some of them warned they would try to push for McCarthy's ouster if he does not meet their demands. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DAN BISHOP (R-NC): I certainly agree that the speaker has violated agreements that were made in January repeatedly. I'm prepared to support a change in leadership through the mechanism, the motion to vacate the chair if necessary. REP. BOB GOOD (R-VA): I think Speaker McCarthy has a path to choose. Does he pass Republican legislation that advances our policies and cuts spending with Republican majority, Republican votes, or does he pass legislation with Democrat votes that allows -- that lets down the American people? REP. CHIP ROY (R-TX): We blew the hell out of that on Memorial Day weekend with that ridiculous deal. We've been very clear about that since Memorial Day. So now the job is to get it done here in September. That's the deal. Get it done or we'll see what happens. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That will be enough for him to force a vote seeking McCarthy's ouster.So that threat is real. He said that he would do that every single day if he had to. He can certainly do it under the rules, Jake. The question is, does he have the votes? It would require all Democrats and about five Republicans to vote to kick McCarthy out from the speakership. Gaetz thinks he has the votes. McCarthy's always thinks he doesn't. And if McCarthy's kicked out from that vote, Jake, that would be an unprecedented situation and would lead to another speakership election on the floor of the House.",

DICK DURBIN (D-IL), MAJORITY WHIP: It took 15 ballots for Mr. McCarthy to become the speaker of the House, it could take 15 minutes for him to be removed by his own supposedly loyal Republicans. Here's the bottom line. The majority in the Republicans in the House of Representatives are out of control. That's it. Bottom line. And we look what's going on in the Senate, we are trying to pass critical bipartisan appropriation bills for the first time in five years. I just left the floor where Senator Murray, Democrats, Senator Collins, a Republican, have a design to put 12 bills before us for a vote. We're doing our job. We're prepared to pass a continuing resolution and a supplemental appropriation if necessary. And look what's happened in the House. Incidentally, the Senate Republicans have said publicly, many of them already, that there is no evidence to back an impeachment, and I believe they're right.

And that, we understand, has been a clear message from Xi to Putin.But again, talking to various officials, whether they be American or indeed the British Defense Secretary, China, you know, does not view North Korea as a rational, stable entity, does not view the North Korean leadership as rational. So the idea that his best friend for life, Vladimir Putin, is running over to Kim Jong Un is not going to be very encouraging to China.

Officials say neighborhoods were literally swept away. Days later, rotting bodies still lay in the streets of Derna, the hardest hit city. Hospitals are out of service and the morgues are at full capacity. More than 200,000 are now homeless.Libya's army says they are not prepared for such a scale of devastation. While Libya faces catastrophic flooding, another humanitarian emergency is unfolding in countries close by. Today, the United Nations World Food Programme issued a stark warning as it faces massive government funding cuts. Estimating for every 1 percent cut in food assistance, 400,000 people will be pushed to the brink of starvation, especially in hotspots in Africa, the Middle East and Haiti. This year, in Afghanistan alone, the World Food Programme was forced to drop 10 million people from its roles. And U.N. World Food Programme Executive Director Cindy McCain joins us now. It's so good to see you again. CINDY MCCAIN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, U.N. WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME: Thank you. I'm glad to see you too. Thanks for covering this.",
