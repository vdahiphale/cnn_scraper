      "sentences": "Oh, it is a staggering sum, Poppy. I mean, 50 million -- $50 million is a huge amount of money. And like you mentioned, this is money coming from his political action committee, essentially donor money that is being used to underwrite his legal fees.Now, Save America is the main political action committee. Funding his legal bills and his legal expenses. And remember, that is the group that actually had a flood of donations come in immediately after the 2020 election when Donald Trump was railing against and making false claims of widespread election fraud. And so a lot of that money they had in the bank already before he even launched his campaign. But $50 million is a lot of money. And I think what I'll be looking for when these FEC filings drop later today is exactly how much are they able to pay for this on their own, versus how much is Donald Trump having to pay for this. We know that he's already had to pay roughly $5 million in the first E. Jean Carroll trial that he faced. This is not $5 million. This is a lot of money. And so I do expect we'll see, just with the math and the numbers that we have already -- of course, we expect to see more of that later today in these filings. It does seem like Donald Trump is going to have to foot some of the bill for this. And of course, that is something that he is loathe to do. Donald Trump hates paying his lawyers. He's -- has a history of really stiffing lawyers. And so I think that is something that we'll be watching for. And just another thing, just to give you a comparison of the amount of money that his legal expenses are costing, Nikki Haley spent roughly the same amount of money or raised the same amount of money, around $50 million over the past year. And so this is just money that's going toward Donald Trump's legal fees. So again, a huge sum of money. And that number is only going to grow. He has four criminal indictments. If any of those cases go to trial, that number is only going to grow exponentially. And so that's something that the Trump campaign is going to have to deal with as they look to how can they fund this moving forward.",

What it does mean, though, is that the special prosecutor, Nathan Wade, he avoids a potentially embarrassing day testifying in court. And that was expected to happen today at a previously scheduled divorce proceeding. Wade was expected to field questions about his alleged romance withhis now boss, Fani Willis, the Fulton County district attorney. But he avoids doing that. This temporary agreement, though, that's what it is. It's just temporary. It does not mean that Wade will have to -- does not mean that Wade is fully in the clear or, for that matter, Fani Willis is fully in the clear having to testify at a future divorce proceeding. But he just won't have to do that for now. So the attorney for his estranged wife, Joycelyn Wade, tells us that this temporary agreement has to do with alimony and attorneys' fees. But they still have to divide assets and property. And this is what they're telling us here in a statement: \"While this negates the immediate need for a hearing, it does not settle the case. We are focused on the hard work of moving the case towards resolution, whether that is through settlement or trial.\" Neither Nathan Wade nor Fani Willis have directly responded to these allegations that they were involved in an alleged romance, but Fani Willis is on the clock.
